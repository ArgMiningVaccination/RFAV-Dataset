Well, like many topics in the world of Medicare, the real answer to this question can be complex and multi-faceted. Alternative and natural medicine, collectively referred to as Naturopathy, has been utilized for millennia, but exactly how effective it is still a matter of scholarly debate. For this reason, not many forms of naturopathy are covered by Medicare, with a few exceptions. Well, many people may view naturopathy as hokey and inauthentic, but the truth is, this form of treatment emphasizes education, preventive care, and personal responsibility when it comes to staying healthy. Common methods of naturopathy have been proven effective beyond a shadow of a doubt, including stress management, proper diet, and exercise. Still, most specific forms of holistic treatment are not covered by Original Medicare, with the exception of some forms of osteopathic medicine and acupuncture. Courtesy of our friends at MedicareInsurance.com, let's learn a little more about [naturopathy and holistic medicine for seniors.](https://www.medicareinsurance.com/does-medicare-cover-naturopaths-alternative-medicine-or-holistic-medicine/) [Click To Tweet ](http://ctt.ec/vDa7u) Did you know that Medicare covers some alternative treatment methods and therapies? Let's learn a little more about naturopathy and holistic medicine for seniors. Why Some Seniors May Opt for Natural Treatment Staying healthy is a goal every senior should adopt as they age, and some may choose to explore alternative treatment methods and therapies. Some seniors seek alternative treatments from naturopaths or other treatment providers when traditional medicine doesn't meet their needs or has adverse side effects for them. Naturopathic doctors and healthcare professionals use health assessments, lab tests, and imaging to help diagnose health issues just like a traditional doctor. But they may also incorporate therapies like herbal medicine, homeopathy, and acupuncture. For this reason, this type of healthcare can be a rewarding avenue. 4 Types of Alternative Medicine for Older Adults The term \"holistic medicine\" is actually an umbrella term that can refer to many different varieties of non-traditional medical treatment. Perhaps the best way to explore the various forms of naturopathic medicine is to break them down into easier-to-identify pieces. Let's take a look. 1. Osteopathic Medicine Osteopathic medicine is a form of medical treatment that emphasizes the importance of a well-maintained musculoskeletal system. The idea of osteopathic medicine is that your musculoskeletal system affects your entire body, so if there are issues with your musculoskeletal system, there will be issues with your health as well. Examples of osteopathic medicine may include: - Chiropractic care - Physical Therapy - Yoga 2. Integrative Medicine Integrative medicine is a practice in which doctors use what is known as CAM treatment methods. This means that, in addition to conventional medicines, doctors may use complementary and alternative methods of treatment to treat specific people for specific conditions. Examples of integrative medicine may include: - Biofeedback - Hypnosis - Creative Outletting (such as art or gardening) 3. Ayurvedic Medicine Ayurvedic medicine uses an ancient system of Indian medicine known as Ayurveda to treat health issues. \"Ayurveda\" is a Sanskrit term for \"knowledge of life.\" Ayurveda focuses on correcting health issues by balancing \"doshas,\" or life energies, through alternative treatments. Examples of ayurvedic medicine may include: - Meditation - Unique Dieting - Herbal Remedies 4. Ancient Eastern Medicine Ancient Eastern medicine follows an ancient form of Chinese medicine. According to this practice, everyone has a lifeforce known as \"qi\" (pronounced, \"chi\"). If your qi is balanced, you are considered to be in good health. If your qi is imbalanced or blocked, you're more likely to be ill. Examples of ancient eastern medicine may include: [Acupuncture](https://urbannaturale.com/acupuncture-4-reasons-you-should-try-acupuncture/) - Tai Chi - Herbal Remedies Before choosing any holistic remedies, consult your physician first. They can help you find a holistic approach that works as a great complement to your current wellness routine without causing unintended harm. Want to Learn More About Your Coverage Options? Unfortunately, current Medicare standards prohibit Original Medicare from covering most forms of holistic treatment. This is because, by Medicare federal standards, the education and training these doctors go through are not necessarily comparable to a doctor of medicine (MD). Still, there do exist a few ways where you may be able to receive coverage for forms of healthcare services and treatments that are specifically tailored to your needs and lifestyle. [Medicare Advantage plans](https://www.medicareinsurance.com/medicare-part-c-insurance-medicare-advantage-information/), also known as Medicare Part C, may offer seniors some benefits that help promote a more holistic lifestyle. Medicare Advantage plans are similar to traditional insurance plans, offering the same benefits as Original Medicare but often with added benefits. Plans require coinsurance, deductibles, and copays. But they also may include unique benefits like the SilverSneakers program and healthy food options along with pain management therapies and behavioral therapy. Plans may also cover other types of holistic or alternative medicine support depending upon the plan.
