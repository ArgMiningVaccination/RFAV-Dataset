So feel free take advantage of the spa treatments and organic cafe while I take care of your physical health. Going to the doctor no longer needs to be stressful experience.

If you are suffering from pain, chronic illness or recovering from cancer treatments or other major surgery and desire a holistic approach to care, then this treatment may be of benefit to you. I am Dr. Mously Le Blanc, a highly sought after and awarded physician specializing in complex pain management and lifestyle medicine to optimize quality of life for my clients. I incorporate conventional western medicine, energy medicine and psychological techniques to allow you to release long-standing issues, patterns and negative perceptions that may be holding you back from experiencing a peaceful, balanced, and healthy life. This 360 degree approach is what I term \"Mind, Body, Heart and Soul\" healing. By applying this powerful method, clients find that their results are more pronounced, are longer lasting and they are able to bounce back quicker from set backs. My method teaches clients how to \"unleash the healing within\" to allow the body to heal itself. All treatments are done in a supportive and compassionate manner. Holistic is a form of healing that considers the whole person (mind, body, soul, and emotions) in the quest for optimal health. According to the holistic medicine philosophy, one can achieve wellness by gaining proper balance in life. Holistic medicine practitioners believe that the whole person is made up of interdependent parts and if one part is not working properly, all the other parts will be affected. In this way, if people have imbalances (physical, emotional, or spiritual) in their lives, it can negatively affect their overall health. The field of Energy Medicine is based on the premise that all physical beings (bodies), intellectual processes(thoughts, emotions, beliefs and attitudes), psychological processes(emotions) and spiritual experiences are expressions of energy. Energy is the connecting element between the mind, heart, body and soul. Therefore, all bodies are believed to be infused with an energy or life force. This life force is known by a variety of terms corresponding to different traditions. In traditional Chinese medicine it is called qi (pronounced CHEE), in the Judeo-Christian tradition it is called spirit, yogis termed it kundalini, in breathwork practice it is known as prana and in Ayurvedic medicine it is represented in the doshas. It is believed that health is determined by the overall flow and balance of a person's vital life force energy. Imbalances or blockages in the natural flow of the energy fields in the body cause illness. Signs of energy disturbances are discoverable well before illness develops and therefore Energy Medicine can be thought of as preventative and therapeutic. Therapies such as acupuncture and acupressure are all believed to act by correcting imbalances in the flow of subtle energy along the meridians, or energy channels. In therapies such as healing touch, Reiki and even prayer, a healer is believed to emit or transmit the vital energy to a recipient as a way to direct and restore health. In short, yes. There are many well established uses of measurable energy fields in the diagnosis and treatment of a multitude of diseases. Some of these include: magnetic resonance imaging(MRI), laser eye correction surgery, cardiac pacemakers, cardiac defibrillators, electrocardiography (EKG), electroencephalogram (EEG), radiation therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation(TENS unit) and UV light therapy.
