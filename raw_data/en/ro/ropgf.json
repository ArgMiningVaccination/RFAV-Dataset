The information provided typically includes the following: - Newcastle Disease Vaccine (B1 Type, LaSota Strain) Indications - Warnings and cautions for Newcastle Disease Vaccine (B1 Type, LaSota Strain) - Direction and dosage information for Newcastle Disease Vaccine (B1 Type, LaSota Strain) Newcastle Disease Vaccine (B1 Type, LaSota Strain)This treatment applies to the following species: Newcastle Disease Vaccine B1 Type, LaSota Strain, Live Virus Newcastle Disease Vaccine (B1 Type, LaSota Strain) Indications This vaccine contains the B1 type, LaSota strain of Newcastle disease virus. It is recommended for the initial vaccination of healthy chickens at one day of age using the eyedrop method, or for the vaccination of healthy chickens 14 days of age or older using the drinking water or coarse aerosol spray as an aid in the prevention of Newcastle disease. It is essential that the chickens be maintained under good environmental conditions and that exposure to disease viruses be reduced as much as possible. CAUTION: NEWCASTLE DISEASE CAN CAUSE INFLAMMATION OF THE EYELIDS OF HUMANS. EYE PROTECTION MUST BE WORN WHEN REHYDRATING AND ADMINISTERING THIS VACCINE. AVOID CONTAMINATING HANDS AND CLOTHING WITH THE VACCINE. HAND WASHING IS RECOMMENDED AFTER EXPOSURE TO THE PRODUCT. Store at 35-46\u00b0F (2-8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Do not vaccinate within 21 days of slaughter. Use entire contents when first opened. Burn this container and all unused contents. Contains Streptomycin Sulfate and Penicillin as bacteriostatic agents and Amphotericin B as a fungistatic agent. Intraocular Vaccination The vaccine used for intraocular vaccination is accompanied by diluent and is recommended for the vaccination of healthy chickens one day of age or older using the 1,000 dose or 2,000 dose vial. 1. Reconstitute each 1,000 doses of vaccine with 30 mL of diluent. a. Remove aluminum seal and rubber stopper from vaccine vial and diluent vial. Avoid contamination of stoppers and contents. b. Add diluent to half-fill the vaccine vial. Replace stopper in vial and shake it so that all contents are dissolved. c. Pour the reconstituted vaccine into the diluent container. Replace stopper in diluent container and shake. d. Remove stopper and fit drop-dispenser tip into diluent container. 2. Holding the diluent container with the dropper tip down, gently press the sides, dropping one drop of vaccine on the bird's eye. Be sure the vaccine spreads over the eye before releasing the bird. Drinking Water Vaccination Using Pouring Application Drinking water vaccination is recommended for healthy chickens 14 days of age or older. 1. Remove all medications, sanitizers and disinfectants from the drinking water 72 hours (three days) prior to vaccination. 2. Provide sufficient waterers so that all the chickens can drink at one time. Shut off water supply and allow chickens to consume all the water in the lines. 3. Raise water lines above the chickens' heads. Clean and rinse the waterers thoroughly. 4. Withhold all water from the chickens for a minimum of two hours in warm weather to four hours in cool weather prior to vaccination to stimulate thirst. Withdrawal time should be reduced if half-house brooding is in process. 5. Do not open or mix vaccine until ready to vaccinate. 6. Drinking water for vaccine delivery should contain one ounce (29 gram) of non-fat dry milk per gallon (3.8 liters) of non-chlorinated water, or should contain milk product based stabilizer prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. 7. Reconstitute the vaccine in 3 gallons (11 liters) of milk-water during cool weather or 4 gallons (15 liters) of milk-water during warm weather for each 1,000 doses. 8. Distribute vaccine solution among waterers. Avoid direct sunlight. 9. Lower waterers and allow the chickens to drink freely. Add the remaining vaccine solution to the water lines as the chickens drink. 10. Do not provide additional drinking water until all the vaccine is consumed. Drinking Water Vaccination Using Proportioner Application Drinking water vaccination is recommended for healthy chickens 14 days of age or older. Several types of medicator/proportioners are commercially available. Set proportioner to deliver one ounce (30 mL) of vaccine concentrate per one gallon (3.8 liters) of water. 1. Remove all medications, sanitizers and disinfectants from the drinking water 72 hours (three days) prior to vaccination. 2. Clean all containers, hoses and waterers prior to vaccination. 3. Withhold all water from the chickens for a minimum of two hours in warm weather to four hours in cool weather prior to vaccination to stimulate thirst. Withdrawal time should be reduced if half-house brooding is in process. 4. Do not open or mix vaccine until ready to vaccinate. 5. Calculate to supply vaccine solution at a rate of 3 gallons (11 liters) per 1,000 chickens in cool weather and 4 gallons (15 liters) per 1,000 chickens in warm weather. The age of the chickens should be considered when calculating water supply. Always use non-chlorinated water when vaccinating chickens. Example 1,000 chickens in cool weather x 3 gallons (11 liters) = 3 gallons (11 liters). 1,000 chickens in warm weather x 4 gallons (15 liters) = 4 gallons (15 liters). 6. Prepare vaccine stock solution as follows: a. Determine the quantity of vaccine concentrate required by multiplying one ounce (30 mL) x gallons of water needed for vaccine/drinking water. Example For 1,000 chickens: 3 gallons x 1 ounce (30 mL) = 3 ounces (90 mL). b. Add 3 ounces (85 gm) of non-fat dry milk per 16 ounces (480 mL) of cool water, or use a commercial milk product based stabilizer according to the manufacturer's instructions. For 1,000 chickens add 0.5 ounces (16 gm) non-fat dry milk to the 3 ounces (90 mL) of water. c. Reconstitute the dried vaccine with the milk solution. Rinse the vaccine vial to remove all the vaccine. 7. Insert proportioner hose into the vaccine stock solution and start water flow. Continue until all solution has been consumed before changing water supply to direct flow. 8. Do not medicate or use disinfectants for 24 hours after vaccination. Coarse Aerosol Spray Application Coarse aerosol spray application is recommended for vaccination of healthy chickens 14 days of age or older. Use a sprayer delivering a coarse aerosol spray pattern to dispense rehydrated vaccine quickly and evenly throughout a house of chickens. Do not use vaccinating equipment for any other purpose. 1. Prior to spraying, reduce air flow by raising curtains or stopping fans. Air movement should be limited for 20 minutes following vaccination. 2. Do not open or mix vaccine until ready to vaccinate. 3. Fill vaccine container with cool, distilled water. 4. Pour reconstituted vaccine into a clean container and add 5 ounces (150 mL) of cool water for each 1,000 chickens to be vaccinated. 5. Place the vaccine solution into spray canister and walk through the house spraying at the rate of 1,000 chickens per minute. Aim spray directly above the heads of the chickens. 6. Avoid direct contact with the vaccine solution. Wear goggles and mask while spraying. Precautions Do not vaccinate diseased chickens. Vaccinate all chickens on the premises at one time. Administer a minimum of one dose per chicken. Avoid stress conditions during and following vaccination. Do not place chickens in contaminated facilities. Exposure to disease must be minimized as much as possible. For veterinary use only.
