Complementary therapies are just that - complementary. By integrating the best of all available modalities, we create a truly holistic game plan. Together we explore, learn, sift through the reams of available information [to discern what is legitimate from what is hype and seek from all available sources and modalities that which is most beneficial in each individual situation. Your healing is in your hands. I am your facilitator and partner. Your wellness is only limited by what you can imagine and dream.] Consultative Integrative Medicine in which I collaborate closely with your current primary care physician and employ all aspects of Integrative Medicine as a complement to the conventional care you are already receiving. This is on a fee-for-service basis. Consultative services may include complementary or alternative modalities, mind body practices, body work, energy medicine, natural products, preventive practices or lifestyle modification. In all cases we conduct an in-depth review of the key areas affecting the health of the whole individual: Nutrition, Movement/Activity, Sleep, Resilience/Stress Management, Spirituality, Relationships, Social/Community/Occupation, and Environment. We use these core aspects of wellbeing to formulate a unique and fluid plan that reflects your priorities and areas of concern. A plan that includes every aspect of health that we as health partners [ deem necessary to achieve or enhance and balance health. This may take a wide variety of forms and include innovative options such as walking and talking visits in which we take our consult outside to move and enjoy nature, visits in locales geared toward your specific health goals, such as a trip to the grocery store, health food store or the gym. Maybe we'll spend our time online learning how to read supplement labels or research a health issue of particular interest. We gear these experiences toward your priorities, rather than an algorithm or conventional agenda.] Energy Medicine and other traditional or indigenous healing arts: [in which I provide multimodal energy therapy as part of consultative or primary care, upon request or as part of body work already in place, such as Osteopathic Manipulative Therapy (OMT). This may include therapeutic touch, such as Reiki, distance healing work, shamanic healing, ceremony or ritual for personal and spiritual transformation, medical Qigong, psychosocial/spiritual coaching as an adjunct to physical healing and alleviation of symptoms or for stress management and resiliency.] Education in which I provide teaching experiences in the form of lectures, retreats, discussion groups, educational/coaching consults and community collaborations that are tailored to the needs of the individual or group. [These experiences are by request; however, my belief is that teaching you to care for yourself is the highest priority of the healthcare relationship. It is a core tenet of my practice. \"I have always believed that the primary function of doctors should be to teach people how not to get sick in the first place. The word \"doctor\" comes from the Latin word for \"teacher\". Teaching prevention should be primary; treatment of existing disease, secondary.\" -Dr Andrew Weil] Corporate Care in which I provide comprehensive corporate wellness programs, health and wellness-related educational experiences for businesses and collaborations on request.
