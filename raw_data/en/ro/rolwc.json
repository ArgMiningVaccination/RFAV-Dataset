Dom Bellini1 1MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology Francis Crick Avenue, Cambridge Biomedical Campus Cambr idge same (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology Abstract In X-ray macromolecular crystallography, c ryoprotection of crystals mounted on harvesting loop s is achieved when the water in the sample solvent transition s to vitreous ice before crystalline ice form s. This is achieved by rapid cooling in liquid nitrogen or propane . Protocols for protein crystal cryoprotection are based on either increasing environmental pressure or reducing the water fraction in the solvent . This study presents a new protocol for cryoprotecting crystals. It is based on vapour diffusion dehydration of the crystal drop to reduce the water fraction in the solvent by adding a highly concentrated salt solution, 13 M potassium formate (KF13), directly to the reservoir . Cryoprotection by the KF13 protocol is non -invasive to the crystal, high throughput, not labour intensive, can benefit diffraction resolution and ligand binding , and is very useful in cases with high redundancy such as drug discovery projects which utili ze very large compound or fragment libraries. Moreover, an application of KF13 to discover new crystal hits from clear drops of equilibrated crystallization screening plates is also shown. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license perpetuity.

Introduction In macromolecular X -ray crystallography, it is imp ortant to perform data collections at cryogenic temperatures (usually around 100 K) where crystal radiation damage is significantly slower, especially at high intensity synchrotron radiation sources (Kmetko et al. , 2006, Owen et al. , 2006) . Cryoprotection of loop-harvested crystals is intended to achiev e water transition to vitreous ice before crystalline ice formation , upon flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. Crystalline ice formation should be avoided . First , it compromise s diffraction quality by destabilizing the crystal lattice due to its volume expansion compared to liquid water (Haas & Rossmann, 1970, Juers & Matthews, 2001, 2004, Kriminski et al. , 2002, Low et al. , 1966) . These effects cause crystal disorder and/or non - isomorphism. Second, it causes large variation s in background counts of diffraction images due to X -ray diffraction by cubic and hexagonal ice at specific Bragg angles (the so -called \"ice rings\") (Burkhardt et al. , 2012, Fuentes , 2015, Parkhurst , 2017, Thorn et al. , 2017) There main s trategies to cryoprotect macromolecular crystals , which aim to either 1) increase the environmental pre ssure (Burkhardt et al. , 2012, Kim et al. , 2005, Thomanek et al. , 1973) or 2) reduce the solvent fraction to below the glass -transition phase of water (Pflugrath, 2015) . The latter, r eduction of solvent fraction , can be achieved by either a) soaking crystals in cryosolutions enriched with cryoprotective agents such as sugars, salts, polyethylene glycols, glycerol, and various others (Bujacz et al. , 2010, Gulick et al. , 2002, Holyoak et al. , 2003, Hope, 1988, Marshall et al. , 2012, Pemberton et al. , 2012, Rubinson et al. , 2000, Ve ra & Stura, 2014) or b) dehydration. While in some cases an adequate cryoprotective agent is already present in the crystallization buffer , very often an additional step needs to be performed where the crystal is tran sferred to a cryoprotected solution; t his process can be laborious and damaging to crystals due to handling and osmotic stress , respectively . Crystal handling is avoided in procedures that make use of acoustic nanodroplet ejectors (e.g., the Echo acoustic liquid handler from Labcyte inc.) for precise placement of cryoprotective agents directly within the crystallization drop but away from the crystals and towards the drop edges to allow gradual gentle diffusion; however, the set -up of such a pipeline is neither straightforward nor inexpensive, including also the requirement for crystal plate imaging facilities (Collins et al. , 2017) . In addition , a low throughput but efficient protocol has been reported for crystal cryoprotection by using vapour diffusio n of volatile alcohols (Farley & Juers, 2014) . Dehydration studies of macromolecular crystal s instead have usually been aimed at imp roving data resolution rather than cryoprotection (Abergel, 2004, Esnouf et al. , 1998, Heras , 2003, Kiefersauer et al. , 2000) . However, two of these studies have also reported that some crystals, dehydrated either using a humidity control device (Sanchez -Weatherby et al. , 2009) or replacing the reservoir in the crystallization plate with NaCl solutions .

In this study, a new cryoprotection protocol is described in which a solution of 13 M potassium formate (KF13) is added in a single step directly to the plate reservoir . This dehydrate s the crystal drop overnight by vapour diffusion , thereby cryoprotecting the crystal. This method successfully cryoprotected six different crystal systems, which were grown in conditions containing different salts and polyethylene glycols. The amount of KF13 added to achieve cryoprotection , without over -dehydrating the crystal at the expense of diffraction quality , depends on both the components of the crystallization solution and crystal solvent content . It was shown to vary between 4 -20% of the final volume (reservoir plus KF13). Moreover, this work also show ed that adding KF13 to the reservoir of previously equilibrated crystallization screening plates can promote , through further dehydration by vapour diffusion , the formation of new crystal s from \"idled\" clear drops . This approach provid es a new high throughput protocol to recycle unsuccessful crystallization screening conditions . Clear drops usually accounts for around 50% of all conditions in a crystal lization screening experiment . 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Chemicals and protein crystals. Precipitants, such a s polyethylene glycols and salts, buffers and chemicals to prepare dehydrating solutions such as potassium formate were purchased from Sigma. The commercially available proteins Thaumatococcus daniellii (an african plant) thaumatin, Gallus gallus lysozyme and Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean) concanavalin A were also purchased from Sigma. Crystals of Staphylococcus aureus FtsA filaments, Homo sapiens hetero -pentamer Cenp - OPQUR complex and g lutamate receptor ligand binding domain in complex with agonist (GluLBD) were kindly donated by LMB researchers Danguole Yatskevich and Christina Heroven, respectively. Crystallization s itting drops were prepared on the Mosquito nanoliter liq uid handler (STP Labtech) at 293 K by dispensing equal volumes (200 nL) of protein and reservoir solutions. For the study on cryoprotection by dehydration, crystals of lysozyme, concanavalin A and thaumatin were prepared at variou s precipitant concentratio ns, to study both direct effects of precipitant concentration on cryoprotection , and also to produce crystals of different sizes, since crystal size can also affect cryoprotection. To differentiate between the same protein samples that were crystallized at different precipitant concentrations, the following acronyms were used throughout this manuscript: .

Required volumes of KF13, ranging from 0 -20 \u00b5l, were added directly to the reservoir by either a) removing completely the sealing ta pe and using a multi -channel pipette before quickly re -sealing the whole plate with 3 - inch wide Crystal Clear sealing tape (Ham pton Research), in case of high throughput experiments such as the study of promoting crystal nucleation in already equilibrated clear drops, or b) making a small cross incision in the sealing tape with a blade and using a single -channel pipette, before re -sealing the cut with a small piece of crystal clear tape (Hampton), in the case of low throughput experiments such as the study of cryoprotection by dehydration. For crystals of FtsA, Cenp -OPQUR and GluLBD, due to the limited amounts of samples, experiments were performed only once. In contrast , with the commercially available samples, experiments were performed in duplicates (thau matin) or triplicates (lysozyme and concanavalin A) ; however, the concentration of precipitants used in crystallization was slightly varied amongst replicate plates to produce crystals of different sizes (see previous section and Table 1). 2.3. Diffractio n data collection. Single diffraction images were acquired on beamline I24 (Diamond Light Source) and the home source (FrE+ Rigaku) for crystals respectively . Complete datasets collected for of FtsA on beamline I24 and of lysozyme, concanavalin A on I04 (Diamond Light Source ). All diffraction data were collected at 100 K and autoprocessed with Xia2 DIALS (Winter et al. , 2018) . 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. KF13 is an ideal solution for crystal drop dehydration by vapour diffusion . All crystallization plates used in this study are 96-well MRC plates . These allow a maximum reservoir volume of 100 \u00b5l. Ready -to-use c rystallization screening p lates prepared at the LMB crystallization facility contain 80 \u00b5l of reservoir in each well (significant ly lower volumes are not ideal for storing at 10\u00b0 C due to evaporation issues) allowing add ition of a maximum of 20 \u00b5l of extra solution. To achieve furthe r dehydr ation of equilibrated crystal drops via vapour diffusion by adding some 0 -20 \u00b5l solution to the reservoir , the overall osmotic strength of 80 \u00b5l of reservoir plus x \u00b5l of very concentrated solution (where x equals 0 -20) must be stronger than that o f the original 80 \u00b5l reservoir (since the osmotic strength of an equilibrated crystal drop is approximately the same as that of the reservoir). Therefore , to counteract the diluting effect that adding extra solution has on the original reservoir and preven t rehydrat ion rather than dehydra tion, the osmotic strength of the added solution must be very .

A schematic drawing of this process is showed in Fig. 1. A number of potential candidates to generate very high ly concentrated solutions with high osmotic strength were tested (Table 2). Interestingly, it was not possible to achieve the reported maximum solubility at room temperature of most of th e tested substances . Thus the tests w ere carried out at the maximum achievable solubility without heating solutions to reach higher concentrations (this way the solution is more stable and can be store indefinitely at r oom temperature without the problem of the solute precipitating in case of a reduction in the temperature) (Table 2). Solutions of c aesium acetate and fructose were excluded due to their expens e and being too viscous for pipetting , respectively (Table 2). NaCl, K -acetate, CsCl and -phosphate failed to dehydrate a large number of crystallization drops whose reservoir s contained a significant amount of precipi tant (e.g., more than 1.5 M ammonium sulphate or more than 20% of PEG with molecular weight higher than 1000 da), whereas KNO 2 was excluded because it reacted with solutions containing (NH 4)2SO4, releasing nitrogen gas [2KNO 2 + (NH 4)2SO4 2N2 + K 2SO4 + 4H 2O], as judged by the bubbling reservoir, which caused the sealing tape to open up in some places due to the building up of pressure in the well (Table 2). Solutions of 10 M Li- iodide and 13 M K -formate (KF13) proved to be equally efficient in causing crystal drop dehydration in all crystallization conditions tested ( Table 2). However, KF13 was chosen as the preferred solution because it is ten times less expensive than Li -iodide. Figure 2 shows how adding 20 \u00b5l of KF13 to different 80 \u00b5l of reservoirs containing different precipitants at different concentrations significantly dehydrate d all crystal drops. Table 2.

Cryoprotection by KF13 dehydration. Tests were conducted u sing six different protein samples , namely FtsA, Cenp -OPQUR, GluLBD, lysozyme, concanavalin A and thaumatin (Table 1). Moreover, crystals of different sizes were produced for lysozyme, concanavalin A and thaumatin by varying precipitant concentrations (Tab le 1 and Fig. 1S). .

Crystals were then harvested in nylon loops and flash -frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction images highlighting the transition from ice to glass as judged by the disappearance of ice rings relative to the amounts of KF13 added to the reservoirs are shown in Fig. S2 -S7 for each of the six crystals forms, respectively. Table 3 summarizes th ese results with an approximate value for the minimum amount of KF13 needed to achieve cryoprotection in relation to the type and amount of precipitant, and the solvent content of the crystal s. Despite the solvent content as high as 72%, crystals from drop s containing polyethylene glycols (ranging from 8 -20%) only required 4 -10 \u00b5l of KF13 to achieve cryoprotection, whereas in the case of drops containing salts as precipitants, the amounts of KF13 required was markedly higher, being in t he range of 15 -20 \u00b5l, despite solvent content as low as 32%. As shown in Table 3, the variation in the size of lysozyme and thaumatin crystals (Table 1 and Fig. S1) did not appear to have any effects on cryoprotection . Most important is the fact that this protocol has achieved cryoprotection even in cases where the precipitant is a very poor cryoprotectant such as NaCl (Berejnov et al. , 2006) , suggesting that this KF13 - based approach can be applied to crystals grown in most if not all crystallization conditions currently in use in macromolecular crystallography . In this study the diameter s of the harvesting nylon loops were chosen to approximately match the size of the crystal , and the X -ray beam cross section was smaller than the crystal size (Fig. S1 ).

Diffraction data processing showed in all cases a strong correlation between disappearance of ice rings, lower mosaicity and higher resolution (Fig. 3). Continuing to i ncrease the amount of KF13 pass ing the point of ice ring disappearance eventually caused an increased mosaicity and reduced resolution (except in the case of lysozyme crystals w here cryoprotection was only reached when adding the maximum amount of KF13 (20 \u00b5l) allowed by the well size without the need to remove any of the 80 \u00b5l of reservoir ); this also appeared to be true in the case of single -image -collections of GluLBD and Cenp - OPQUR samples as judged from the deterioration in resolution in the diffractio n images of crystals from drops dehydrated with KF13 volumes above the optimal 4 and 10 \u00b5l, respectively (Fig. S3 and Fig. S4). The overall amounts of KF13 that can be added for achieving optimal cryoprotection without degrading the diffraction resolution can vary significantly depending on the sample, ranging from a narrow 8 -10 \u00b5l interval for FtsA crystals to a wider 5 -15 \u00b5l for concanavalin A crystals (Fig. 3) . As expected, crystal drop dehydration induces a hypertonic stress to the unit cell of the crystals causing it to shrink proportionally to the amount of KF13 added to the reservoir , except in the case of thaumatin where no contraction of the unit cell was observed , perhaps suggesting a very rigid lattice (Fig. S8). All other samples underwent an anisotropic contraction of the unit cell, except concanavalin A crystals, where all three unit cell axes shrunk (Fig. S8). As reported in the Introduction , unit cell shrinkage and consequently reduction in solvent content of crystals by dehydration has be en exploited in a number of cases to improve lattice order and consequently diffraction resolution , especially with crystals of membrane proteins crystallized with detergents . Therefore, cryoprotection by KF13 dehydration may also lead to improved crystal order and better diffraction resolution compared to other cryoprotection techniques that do not exert hyperosmotic pressure on the crystal . Since lattice shrinkage is shown to be proportional to the added volume of KF13 , the overall amount of KF13 required to achieve full cryoprotection (e.g., 6 \u00b5l) could be added gradually (e.g., 2 \u00b5l every 24 hours) thereby minimiz ing hypertonic shock and optimi zing diffraction resolution in certain cases . The KF13 cryoprotection method is ideal for crystallographic dr ug discovery projects for a number of reasons. 1) In standard cryoprotection protocols the crystal is transferred to a cryoprotective agent -containing drop, which ideally should also contain the ligand of interest ; however, it can be very labour intensive to prepare all the different cryoprotectant solutions each containing a unique ligand (or even cocktails of ligands) from a large library for each different ligand -complex crystal . This is unnecessary with the KF13 method since the crystal lization solution remains untouched. 2) Since KF13 cryoprotection is achieved by dehydration, this means that the concentration of .

This latter consideration is also true in the case of ab initio structure determination experiments involving metal atom soaks. 3) While the KF13 method works well in low throughput experiments , at the same time it is also ideal for very large projects su ch as screening of large libraries of compounds or fragments. In these cases, high throughput can be achieved by either adding KF13 manually using multi -channel pipettes or via an automated pipeline using liquid handling robots. The crystal dro p dehydration method of replacing the reservoir with a NaCl solution from Douangamath et al. (2013) was developed with the aim to rapidly screen effects of dehydration on the diffraction resolution of crystals in situ. The KF13 protocol is also perfectly s uited for such a purpose, with the advantage that KF13 is added in a single step without necessitating prior remov al of the reservoir. 3.3. KF13 can aid crys tal hit discovery by dehydrating clear drops in pre-equilibrated screening plate s. Standard prot ocols for i dentification of new crystal hits consist of screening over one to two thousand different crystallization conditions using normally 96-well plates. An important parameter in this process is the choice of protein concentration, which, as a rule o f thumb, is taken as the concentration that produces around 50% of clear drops (intended as no observable protein precipitation) immediately after setting up the plates. This means that in any given crystal hit screening experiment, even after achieving dr op equilibration by vapour diffusion, there is usually a high percentage of drops that are left clear, with neit her crystals nor precipitation. There are a number of reasons why drops remain clear . One is due to the fact that the concentration of protein o r precipitant , or both, is not high enough to reach supersaturation and consequently nucleatio n. The growth of crystals from clear drops after weeks, months or even years after the plates had been set up is likely due either to water evaporation from the r eservoir through a small leak in the sealing tape (or greased cover slip) , and/or proteolysis . KF13 dehydration can be employed to mimic while speed ing up this slow evaporation process, thus allowing to discover new crystal hits in screening plates that ha d already reached vapour diffusion equilibration. To investigate this possibility, 96-well crystallization plates for lysozyme and thaumatin were prepared where some of the drops contained too low a concentration of either protein o r precipitant (or both) to reach supersaturation. After 10 days, when crystal growth had no t been observed for several days, fixed amounts of KF13 (3 \u00b5l) were gradually added every 3 days to the reservoirs using a multi -channel pipette. Table 4 A and B summarizes how increasing amounts of KF13 were required for crystal growth in drops with decreasing amount s of protein or precipitant (or both ). Notably, .

As a negative control, the sealing tape was removed from duplicate plates, which were then left open for the same length of time that was required to add KF13 and reseal the original plate s; no further crystal growth was observed in the control plates beyond that observed within the first 10 days of vapour diffusion equilibration , proving that the new crystal hits were indeed the result of KF13 drop dehydration rather than an effect of water evaporation due to the removing of the sealing tape for about 30 seconds (which is roughly the time required to add KF13 to all the reservoirs in a 96 -well plate using a multi -channel pipette) . Both lysozyme and thaumatin sam ples used in the above experiments were prepared by dissolving lyophilized protein into simple water; instead , protein samples used in crystallization typically contain salts, buffers and perhaps other chemicals (e.g., detergents in the case of membrane pr oteins), whose concentrations will also increase upon drop dehydration , with unpredictable effects on nucleation . This also highlights that the procedure of KF13 dehydration of clear drops is different from that of setting up new crystallization plates usi ng a protein sample of higher concentration compared to the one used in the original plates. Another important aspect that needed to be assessed was whether KF13 dehydration of crystallization screening drops may cause the appearance of a high number of fa lse positives due to crystallization of different salts present in most of the crystallization conditions. To investigate this, t he two popular Index (Qiagen) and JCSG+ (Hampton) sparse -matrix crystallization screens were set up using a protein -less sample containing only 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8 and 300 mM NaCl (200+200 nl sitting drops and 80 \u00b5l of reservoir) ; the eight 96 -well plates (four for each screen ) were left to reach equilibrium by vapour diffusion for one week. Subsequently these plates were unsealed and 5, 10, 15 and 20 \u00b5l of KF13 were quickly added to the reservoirs of each screen, respectively, and resealed. Inspe ction over the next 7 days showed that none of the drops contained any crystals, either from salt or other compounds present in the many d ifferent drop conditions. This proves that KF13 dehydration is unlikely to cause an issue with false positives in hit screening experiments and at the same time it also suggests that proteins appear to play a crucial role in nucleation and subsequent cryst allization of salts, which is in agreement with the fact that salt crystals are commonly obtained from different crystallization conditions depending on a specific protein sample used in the screen . .

Screening of various salt solutions showed that 13 M potassium formate (KF13) possesses the ideal osmotic strength compared to other tested candidates to create a one -step B cryoprotection protocol , since small amounts of KF13 between only 4-20% of the final volume (reservoir plus KF13) sufficed to achieve complete cryoprotection in all si x crystal forms tested . Being able to limit the added KF13 volume within this range is very important because it means that a reservoir volume of up to 80% of the well capacity can be used in crystallization experiments without the need to remove any of th e reservoir to achieve cryoprotection by directly adding KF13 in a single step. Being able to add KF13 without the need of removing any of the reservoir means that the crystallization plate has to remain unsealed for shorter times (minimizing crystal drop evaporation and consequently having more control over the experiment outcome and reproducibility) and the all procedure s are faster to complete. Although a one -step cryoprotection protocol could also be developed using osmotically weaker solutions than KF13 by having smaller volumes of reservoir in the well allowing addition of larger volumes of the dehydrating solution , it is preferable to keep the volume of reservoir to a reasonable level (e.g., around 60-80 ul in 96 -well MRC plate from SWISS -CI), since too little reservoir in the well can dry out too fast during storage (e.g., pre - filled plates stored at 10 \u00b0 in our crystallization facility) or even during crystallization screening experiments at room temperature .

The method described by Douangamath et al. (2013), which is carried out in two steps, by first complete ly removing the crystallization reservoir in the well and then replacing this with a solution containing NaCl , scores similarly to the KF13 protocol (Table 5) . Nevertheless, while this NaCl method may be suitable for small scale projects where the manual procedure can b e carried out by making a small incision in the sealing tape to minimize evaporation while executing the two steps, in high throughput cases instead, where the sealing tape is completely remove d to gain easy access to all 96 wells, crystal drops remain exp osed to evaporation considerably longer than during a single step procedure ; resealing the plate quickly is key to achieve a slow and controlled dehydration. Moreover, completely replacing the reservoirs with a pure solution of NaCl cannot guarantee a gent le and slow dehydration rate as if gradually adding small volumes of KF13, with the latter process more likely to benefit the diffraction quality. Cryoprotection by KF13 is very useful for drug discovery projects that are characterized by high crystal form redundancy ( e.g., the amount of KF13 to be added to the reservoir to achieve optimal cryoprotection onl y needs to be established once) and many different ligands (which do not need to be added to KF13 since this is added to the reservoir rather than the drops) ; also dehydration of drops in KF13 cryoprotection can improve the ligand occupancy and/or diffraction resolution . Moreover, this study showed that crystallization drops in pre - equilibrated plates potentially capable of producing crystals but cont aining too little of either protein or precipitant (or both ), can be pushed into supersaturation, nucleation and crystal growth by exerting f urther vapour diffusion dehydration by adding KF13 to the reservoir. This aspect has application in crystallization screening experiments (both small scale and high throughput) where \"idled\" clear drops in plates that have already reached equilibration can be rapidly tested for being undersaturated by adding KF13 to the reservoir. .
