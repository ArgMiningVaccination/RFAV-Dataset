Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 3 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER INTROIntroduction: A Guide to Y our Benefits This booklet contains the Summary Plan Description (SPD) for the Baylor Scott & White Health and Welfare Benefit Plans. Each section has important details about each plan. HIGHLIGHTS Baylor Scott & White Health Benefit Plans help protect you and your family, day to day and over the long term. Along with your pay, your benefits are an important and valuable part of your total compensation. The Company pays all of the cost for certain benefits and asks you to pay all or part of the cost for others. Your portion of the cost is small compared to what you would pay to purchase this coverage elsewhere. This SPD is your benefits resource. You should be able to find everything you need here. But if you can't find what you need, help is just a phone call away. Call PeoplePlace at 1-844-417- 5223, Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. CT, except on holidays, and a Human Resources Representative will assist you. You can also visit the Baylor Scott & White Health benefits site at BSWHealth.com/Benefits. See the Administrative & General Information section for additional information. ELIGIBILITY Your eligibility to participate in the plans is based on your employment status. Your health and welfare benefits include Medical, Dental, Vision, Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), Life Insurance, Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) Insurance, Disability Income, Accidental Injury, Critical Illness, Employee Assistance Program (EAP), Legal Services, and Business Travel Accident Benefits.Baylor Scott & White Health offers health and welfare benefits to: Full-time employees regularly scheduled to work 30+ hours per week who are not classified in a PRN position Part-time employees regularly scheduled to work 20 - 29 hours per week When you are hired or become benefits-eligible, you are automatically enrolled in Basic Life Insurance, Basic AD&D Insurance, the EAP, and Basic Long-Term Disability. In addition, if you are eligible for Business Travel & Accident benefits, you are automatically enrolled in that coverage when your eligibility begins. On the date you meet the above eligibility requirements (your hire date or another date), you are immediately eligible to enroll in the following options: Medical Health Savings Account pre-tax contribution Dental Vision Healthcare FSA (General Purpose or Limited Purpose) Dependent Care FSA Voluntary Life Spouse/Child(ren) Life Voluntary Dependent AD&D Voluntary Short-Term Disability Voluntary Long-Term Disability Accidental Injury Critical Illness Legal Services Plan Additional Eligibility Rules If both you and your spouse work for Baylor Scott & White Health, you may each enroll in the health and welfare plans as employees or one of you may enroll as an employee and the other as a dependent. No one can be covered for health and welfare benefits both as an employee and as a dependent, or as a dependent of more than one employee. As an active employee, you cannot cover dependents under a health and welfare plan unless you also are covered under the same plan. If you fit one of the following descriptions, you are not eligible to participate in the health and welfare plans: -Temporary worker -Employee classified as a \"call-in employee\", including a PRN employee -Leased employee -Individual classified by the Company as an independent contractor -Employees who are nonresident aliens who receive no earned income from sources within the U.S.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 4 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER INTROYOUR DEPENDENTS' ELIGIBILITY If you are eligible for the health and welfare plans and you enroll, you may also enroll your eligible dependents. In general, your eligible dependents are: Your spouse or common-law spouse (if the common-law marriage is recognized under applicable state law), and Your children. Dependent eligibility varies among the Baylor Scott & White Health benefit offerings from different providers. The term \"spouse\", as used in this document and unless otherwise defined by the applicable insurer, means the person to whom you are legally married, but does not include a domestic partner or person with whom you have entered into a civil union. The chart below shows the definitions and eligibility for dependent children under our Medical, Dental, Vision, Life, Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D), Accidental Injury and Critical Illness insurance offerings. Medical, Dental, VisionLife, AD&D, Accidental Injury and Critical Illness Age Up to 26 Up to 26 Marital Status Does not affect eligibility Does not affect eligibility Family RelationshipNatural Step Legally adopted Placed for adoption Foster Child covered by Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO)* Any child living with employee on a full- time basis, whom the employee claims as a dependent on his/her federal income tax return, and for whom the employee has legal custody (or had legal custody immediately prior to the child attaining age 18)Natural Step Legally adopted Foster Other Conditions N/A N/A Disabled Children Age 26 and OlderUnmarried, physically or mentally incapacitated and unable to earn his/her own living; dependent on employee for at least 50% of financial support; claimed by employee as a dependent on federal income tax return; and disabled and covered under plan before age 26**Primarily dependent on employee for financial support and maintenance; and became disabled before age 26 and at such time was the employee's dependent * A copy of Baylor Scott & White Health's Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) procedures may be obtained without charge by contacting PeoplePlace. ** If you are a new hire, or newly benefits eligible employee you may enroll a dependent over age 26 if the dependent: Is physically or mentally incapacitated, and Meets the criteria shown above, and Has been enrolled for coverage as your dependent continually since the disability You will be required to provide evidence of your dependent's eligibility. If Baylor Scott & White Health Plan is unable to verify an individual's status as a dependent or the eligibility requirements mentioned above are not met by the deadline, coverage will be terminated. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be final and not be subject to the appeal process. Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 5 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER INTROHealth and Welfare Enrollment WHEN YOU ARE FIRST ELIGIBLE When you are hired or become benefits-eligible, you must enroll within 30 days of hire or eligibility. You can enroll online through the HR system found on www.myPeoplePlace.com. If you do not enroll by the deadline, you must wait until the next annual enrollment period to enroll in the plan(s) unless you experience a qualifying event. You must submit your qualifying event within 30 days of the event in order to start, change or stop certain benefit coverages (see page 6). If you are not at work because of an approved leave of absence on the day your coverage would normally become effective, coverage for you and your dependents starts as soon as you have been at work for one full day (excludes medical, dental, and vision). Once you enroll, coverage begins immediately. ANNUAL ENROLLMENT Each year during annual enrollment, you can start, change or waive coverage for the next calendar year by accessing www.myPeoplePlace.com. You may also add dependents or drop dependents you are covering. Your election is effective the January 1 following the annual enrollment period and it remains in effect for the entire year. You cannot make changes to your elections during the year unless you experience a qualifying event (see page 6). You must notify PeoplePlace within 30 days of the qualifying event in order to start, change or stop certain benefit coverages. If you do not file a new election during the annual enrollment period, your current elections, including FSA elections, will remain unchanged. IF YOU DON'T ENROLL If you don't enroll by the deadline date when you are first eligible, you will receive default coverage as follows: Plan Default Coverage Medical None Dental None Vision None FSAs No contributions Life Insurance Basic employee coverage only; no voluntary or spouse/ child(ren) coverage AD&D Insurance Basic employee coverage only; no voluntary or spouse/ child(ren) coverage Disability Basic long-term coverage and voluntary short-term coverage; no voluntary long-term Accidental Injury None Critical Illness None Legal Services None Employee Assistance ProgramCovered Business Travel & AccidentCovered if eligible Don't Miss Your Enrollment Deadline If you do not contact PeoplePlace or make a change on-line to enroll a newly eligible dependent (including a spouse, newborn child or newly adopted child) within 30 days of the day he or she becomes eligible, you must wait until the next annual enrollment period to enroll the new dependent. You must notify PeoplePlace of the new dependent even if you are enrolled in family coverage.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 6 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER INTROQUALIFYING EVENTS The charts on the next few pages give an overview of how some life and work events affect your benefits. Federal law governs what changes you can make to some plans during the year if certain life and work events occur. As the charts indicate, any change you make to your benefit elections during the year must be consistent with the change in status. You must take action within 30 days of the qualifying event or wait until the next annual enrollment (employees who have a gain/loss of Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) have 60 days). During annual enrollment, you can make any changes you wish to your benefit elections. You may submit the qualifying event online through the HR system found on www.myPeoplePlace.com.

These rules are summarized below: If there is an insignificant increase or decrease in the cost of a benefit option, Baylor Scott & White Health may automatically change your premium election to cover the change in cost. If there is a significant increase in the cost of a benefit option, you may, on a prospective basis, revoke your election and elect coverage under another benefit option providing similar coverage, or drop coverage if no other benefit option provides similar coverage. If there is a significant decrease in the cost of a benefit option, you may revoke your election and commence participating in the benefit option with the decrease in cost. If your coverage is significantly curtailed without a loss of coverage (for example, a significant increase in the deductible, co-pay, or out-of-pocket limit), you may revoke your election under the option that is being curtailed, but only if you elect similar coverage under an alternate benefit option. If your coverage is significantly curtailed with a loss of coverage (for example, elimination of a benefit option), you may revoke coverage under the plan being curtailed and make a new election for similar coverage under a new benefit option, or drop coverage if no other similar benefit option is available. If during a period of coverage, a new benefit option is added or an existing benefit option is significantly improved, you may be allowed to elect the new option or improved benefit option prospectively on a pre-tax basis and change your election with respect to the other benefit option providing similar coverage. Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 12 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER INTRO You may change your election if you experience a change in coverage under another employer-sponsored plan so long as the other plan permits a change in election or has a non-calendar plan year. You may change your election to add coverage for yourself or a dependent if you or your dependent loses group health coverage sponsored by a governmental or educational institution, such as SCHIP. PAYING FOR COVERAGE Your cost for coverage depends on the options you choose. Your share of the cost for coverage and your contributions to the FSAs will be deducted from your paycheck beginning with the first available paycheck after you enroll as a new hire or newly eligible employee. For annual enrollment elections you make each fall, coverage costs and contribution deductions generally begin with the first paycheck of the new calendar year. Health and welfare deductions are normally taken from all 26 paychecks during the year. By enrolling in the health and welfare plans, you give the Company permission to take pre-tax paycheck deductions as described below. In the event that premiums are missed from a pay period, we reserve the right to collect from future paychecks. Pre-Tax vs. After-Tax Dollars A few tax-related issues affect some of your benefits. While these issues probably won't affect your benefit decisions, you should be aware of them. When you pay for your benefits with pre-tax dollars, deductions are taken before federal and (in some cases) state income taxes are calculated. So you actually lower your taxable income, which means you pay less in taxes overall. You use pre-tax dollars to pay for coverage in these areas: Medical Dental Vision General Purpose and Limited Purpose FSA contributions Dependent care FSA contributions Voluntary Short-Term Disability HSA Contributions By paying for certain benefits with after-tax dollars, you do not have to pay income tax on the value of the benefit if received. You use after-tax dollars to pay the premium for coverage in these areas: Voluntary Life Insurance Spouse/Child(ren) Life Insurance Voluntary and Family AD&D Voluntary Long-Term Disability Legal Services Plan Accidental Injury Critical Illness Any benefit you receive from the Basic Long-Term Disability plan is considered taxable income. Any benefit you receive from Basic Life Insurance, Voluntary Life Insurance, Spouse/ Child Life Insurance, Basic and Voluntary AD&D Insurance, Voluntary Long-Term Disability, Accidental Injury, Critical Illness, Business Travel & Accident or the Legal Services Plan is not considered taxable income. Effect on Other Benefits Pre-tax deductions reduce your income for tax purposes only. Each plan's coverages and benefits are based on your annualized base pay before pre-tax deductions are taken. Effect on Social Security Pre-tax deductions reduce your taxable income. And, they lower your Social Security taxes. Because you may be paying lower Social Security taxes, you should be aware that any future Social Security benefits you may receive might be slightly reduced. However, your current tax savings will likely more than offset future Social Security benefit reductions. If you need more information, contact your local Social Security Administration office. WHEN HEALTH AND WELFARE COVERAGE ENDS Your benefit coverage ends when any of the following occurs: You elect to drop coverage during annual enrollment or after experiencing a qualifying event You stop paying your share of the cost for the coverage You terminate employment You no longer meet the eligibility requirements Your employer stops participating in a plan A plan is terminated or amended to terminate coverage for a group or class of employees that includes you Your spouse's benefit coverage ends when any of the following occur: Your coverage ends You elect to drop coverage for your spouse during annual enrollment or after experiencing a qualifying event You stop paying for spouse coverage You and your spouse divorce or legally separate A plan is terminated or amended to terminate coverage for dependents Your spouse dies Your other dependents' benefit coverage ends when any of the following occur: Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 13 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER INTRO Your coverage ends You elect to drop coverage for your dependents during annual enrollment or after experiencing a qualifying event You stop paying for dependent coverage Your dependent no longer meets the eligibility requirements for dependent coverage A plan is terminated or amended to terminate coverage for dependents Your dependent dies In addition, your or your spouse's or dependent's coverage may be terminated retroactively if you, your spouse, or your dependent engage in fraudulent behavior or make an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact. Special Rules for PRN Employees If your employment status changes to PRN, you will no longer be eligible to participate in the health and welfare plans and your coverage will cease in the same manner as if you had terminated employment on the date of your employment status change. See the If You Leave the Company section for additional information as to the termination of your health and welfare benefits. If You Leave the Company If you leave the Company, your Medical, Dental, Vision, Life Insurance, AD&D Insurance, Long-Term Disability, Accidental Injury, Critical Illness, and Legal Services coverage ends on the last day (12:00 midnight) of the month in which your employment terminates. Premium payments for continuation of this coverage occur on each paycheck that you receive. Voluntary Short-Term Disability, Business Travel Accident, FSA, and Employee Assistance Plan coverage end on your last day of employment. FSA contributions end with your last paycheck. For the FSAs, you generally have 90 days after the end of the plan year in which you terminate employment to file claims for reimbursement of expenses incurred while you were covered under the FSA. You may convert your Basic Life Insurance coverage to an individual policy. You may be able to elect portability of your additional life insurance and AD&D insurance coverage to an individual policy at the carrier group rate within 62 days of your termination. You must meet specific deadlines if you would like to convert or port any insurance coverage. Contact PeoplePlace to obtain information.

The following paragraphs constitute notice of your COBRA continuation coverage rights and explain COBRA continuation coverage, when it may become available to you and your family, and what you need to do to protect your right to get it. When you become eligible for COBRA, you may also become eligible for other coverage options that may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. The right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law. COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you when you would otherwise lose your group health coverage. It can also become available to other members of your family who are covered under the plan when they would otherwise lose their group health coverage. For additional information about your rights and obligations under the plans and under federal law, you should review this Summary Plan Description or contact PeoplePlace. How COBRA Works COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of plan coverage when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event known as a \"qualifying event.\" Specific qualifying events are listed later in this section. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary.\" You, your spouse and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if your medical, dental or vision coverage or Healthcare FSA participation ends because of the qualifying event. Qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage. If you are an employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your group health coverage or Healthcare FSA participation because either one of the following qualifying events happens: Your hours of employment are reduced Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct If you are the spouse of an employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your group health coverage because any of the following qualifying events happens: Your spouse dies Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B or both) You become divorced or legally separated from your spouseYour dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose group health coverage because any of the following qualifying events happens: The parent-employee dies The parent-employee's hours of employment are reduced The parent-employee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct The parent-employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B or both) The parents become divorced or legally separated The child stops being eligible for coverage as a \"dependent child\" Sometimes, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code can be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is filed with respect to BSWH, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of group health coverage of any retired employee covered, the retired employee will become a qualified beneficiary. The retired employee's spouse, surviving spouse, and dependent children will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their group health coverage. When COBRA Coverage Is Available COBRA continuation coverage is offered to qualified beneficiaries only after the COBRA Administrator has been notified that a qualifying event has occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, death of the employee, commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer or the employee becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B or both), Baylor Scott & White Health must notify the COBRA Administrator of the qualifying event. For other qualifying events (divorce, legal separation of the employee and spouse or a dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a dependent child), the employee must notify Baylor Scott & White Health within 30 days after the qualifying event occurs by submitting the event online through the HR system found on www.myPeoplePlace.com. You may be required to provide additional information to support the qualifying event (e.g. divorce decree, etc.). How COBRA Coverage Is Provided Once the COBRA Administrator receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualified beneficiaries. Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered employees may elect COBRA continuation on behalf of their spouse, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their dependent children. COBRA continuation coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage. When the qualifying event is the death of the employee, the employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B or both), divorce or legal separation, or a Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 16 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER INTROdependent child's loss of eligibility as a dependent child, COBRA continuation coverage lasts for up to a total of 36 months. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the employee's hours of employment, and the employee became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage for qualified beneficiaries other than the employee lasts until 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. For example, if a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare eight (8) months before the date on which his employment terminates, COBRA continuation coverage for his spouse and dependent children can last up to 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement, which is equal to 28 months after the date of the qualifying event (36 months-8 months). Otherwise, when the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the employee's hours of employment, COBRA continuation coverage generally lasts for only up to a total of 18 months. There are two ways in which this 18-month period of COBRA continuation coverage can be extended: Disability extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage . If you or anyone in your family covered under the plan is determined by the Social Security Administration to be disabled and you notify Baylor Scott & White Health in writing in a timely fashion, you and your entire family may be entitled to receive up to an additional 11 months of COBRA continuation coverage for a total maximum of 29 months. The disability would have to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18-month period of continuation coverage. This notice must be in writing and sent to the COBRA Administrator. In all cases, this notice must be sent within 60 days after the Social Security determination of disability is issued. Second qualifying event extension of 18-month period of continuation coverage. If your family experiences another qualifying event while receiving 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, the spouse and dependent children in your family can get up to 18 additional months of COBRA continuation coverage, for a maximum of 36 months, if notice of the second qualifying event is properly given in writing to the COBRA Administrator within 60 days of the second qualifying event. This extension may be available to the spouse and any dependent children receiving continuation coverage if the employee or former employee dies, becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B or both), or gets divorced or legally separated, or if the dependent child stops being eligible under the plan as a dependent child, but only if the event would have caused the spouse or dependent child to lose coverage under the plan had the first qualifying event not occurred. Other Coverage Options Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse's plan) through what is called a \"special enrollment period.\" Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov. Enrollment in Medicare In general, if you do not enroll in Medicare Part A or B when you are first eligible because you are still employed, after the Medicare initial enrollment period, you have an 8-month special enrollment period to sign up for Medicare Part A or B, beginning on the earlier of: The month after your employment ends; or The month after group health plan coverage based on current employment ends. If you do not enroll in Medicare and elect COBRA continuation coverage instead, you may have to pay a Part B late enrollment penalty and you may have a gap in coverage if you decide you want Part B later. If you elect COBRA continuation coverage and later enroll in Medicare Part A or B before the COBRA continuation coverage ends, the plan may terminate your continuation coverage. However, if Medicare Part A or B is effective on or before the date of the COBRA election, COBRA coverage may not be discontinued on account of Medicare entitlement, even if you enroll in the other part of Medicare after the date of the election of COBRA coverage. If you are enrolled in both COBRA continuation coverage and Medicare, Medicare will generally pay first (primary payer) and COBRA continuation coverage will pay second. Certain plans may pay as if secondary to Medicare, even if you are not enrolled in Medicare. For more information visit https://www.medicare.gov/ medicare-and-you. In order to protect your family's rights, you should keep the Plan Administrator informed of any changes in the addresses of family members. You should also keep a copy, for your records, of any notices you send to the Plan Administrator or COBRA Administrator. You can obtain further information about COBRA continuation coverage from Optum Financial Services. Continuation Coverage for a Healthcare FSA If your employment terminates for any reason other than your gross misconduct while you were contributing to a Healthcare FSA, and the amount of reimbursement you may receive for the remainder of the plan year exceeds the amount you would be required to pay to continue participation for the remainder of the plan year, you or a qualified beneficiary may elect COBRA continuation coverage. If you or a qualified beneficiary elect COBRA, you or a qualified beneficiary may continue contributions, on an after-tax basis, until the end of the calendar year in which your employment terminated. You may submit claims until April 30 following the end of the grace period for Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 17 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER INTROeligible healthcare expenses incurred through the applicable grace period. See the Flexible Spending Accounts section for additional information. Electing COBRA Continuation Coverage When a qualifying event occurs, you or your dependent(s) who are qualified beneficiaries must request continued coverage. Baylor Scott & White Health's COBRA Administrator will give you and your dependent(s) all of the details about continued coverage, including the cost, and will provide you or your dependent(s) with an election form. To continue coverage, the completed election form must be sent to the address shown on the form within 60 days after the latest of the date: You or your dependent were provided the election form, or Plan coverage ends. Each of your eligible dependents has an independent election right for COBRA coverage. If you or your dependents elect to continue coverage, either you or they must pay 102% (or in the case of an extension of continuation coverage due to a disability, 150% during the disability extension period) of the cost of the coverage elected (including the portion previously paid by Baylor Scott & White Health). Coverage costs may change from year to year. In considering whether to elect continuation coverage, you should take into account that you have special enrollment rights under federal law. You may have the right to request special enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or in another group health plan for which you are otherwise eligible (such as a plan sponsored by your spouse's employer) within 30 days after your group health coverage ends because of the qualifying event listed above. You will also have the same special enrollment right at the end of continuation coverage if you get continuation coverage for the maximum time available to you. Early Termination of COBRA Continuation Coverage COBRA continuation coverage will stop before the end of the maximum period under any of the following circumstances: The required contributions are not made on a timely basis Recovery from disability, if the individual is eligible for extended continuation coverage due to disability, but not before 18 months of continuation coverage The group health plans provided by Baylor Scott & White Health are terminated After electing COBRA continuation coverage, a qualified beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare (under Part A, Part B or both) or another group plan that does not have a pre-existing conditions clause COBRA continuation coverage may also be terminated for any reason if the group health plans would terminate coverage of a participant who is not receiving continuation coverage (such as fraud). If you have already received 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, you are receiving extended COBRA continuation coverage due to your or a family member's disability, and the qualified beneficiary is determined by the Social Security Administration to no longer be disabled, you are required to notify the COBRA Administrator of that fact within 30 days after the Social Security Administration's determination. If you provide notice to the COBRA Administrator as described in this Summary Plan Description and you are determined to be ineligible for COBRA continuation coverage or for a disability or second qualifying event extension, you will be notified in writing. Continuation during a Leave of Absence If you are on an authorized medical, personal, and/or family leave, your insurance coverage will continue as outlined below. Paid Leave If you are on a paid leave, coverage will continue and premiums will be payroll deducted. Unpaid Leave If you are on an unpaid leave (including military leave), coverage will continue and you will be billed for your benefit premiums. It is your responsibility to make payments as directed or your insurance coverage automatically ends after 60 days of non-payment. The termination effective date would be retroactive to the last date premiums were paid. If You Retire Retiree benefits (including the cost of coverage) can be changed, amended or terminated at any time. Retiree Medical/Dental Plan The Scott and White Retiree Medical Program is available to legacy Scott and White Healthcare employees who meet the eligibility requirements described below. 1. If you met the eligibility requirements for access to pre-65 Retiree Medical coverage (without a subsidy) as of December 31, 2013, you will continue to be eligible when you retire from Baylor Scott & White Health. 2. If you met the eligibility requirements for subsidized access to pre-65 Retiree Medical coverage as of December 31, 2013, you will continue to be eligible when you retire from Baylor Scott & White Health. 3. If you did not meet either requirement as outlined in 1 and 2 as of December 31, 2013, you will not be eligible for pre-65 Retiree Medical coverage in the future. 4. The program is closed to new hires, and to employees who become a part of Baylor Scott & White as the result of a merger or acquisition in the future. Hillcrest employees are not eligible for this plan. If the retiree waives medical or dental coverage at retirement, during annual enrollment, due to a qualifying event or for any other reason, or the coverage is terminated due to non-payment, the retiree cannot enroll or re-enroll in the retiree medical or Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 18 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER INTROdental plan. Coverage for dependents on this plan ends when they no longer meet the eligibility requirements (see page 4) or when the retiree turns 65, whichever is sooner. If the retiree is not eligible for subsidized or unsubsidized medical coverage as noted above, the retiree's spouse and/or children are also not eligible. If the retiree should die, the retiree's spouse and any of the retiree's dependent children covered at the time of the retiree's death lose coverage under the retiree medical plan and the dental plan. However, they will be eligible to elect COBRA coverage. Employees who retire after the age of 65 with at least 5 years of service may be eligible for a discount on Medicare Advantage plans offered through the Baylor Scott & White Health Plan as described in the chart below. Retiree Medicare Subsidy for Central Texas Division Eligible retirees who enroll in a Baylor Scott & White Health Plan SeniorCare Plan will receive a subsidy to help cover the cost of their Medicare Advantage plan coverage. For every month that the eligible retiree is enrolled in a Baylor Scott & White Health Plan SeniorCare Plan, Baylor Scott & White will provide the subsidy directly to Baylor Scott & White Health Plan on the retiree's behalf. To be eligible for the subsidy, retirees must meet each of the following requirements: 1. Be working in the Central Texas Division of Baylor Scott & White and age 65 or older at the time of their termination of employment or transfer to PRN status; and 2. Have completed five years of service within the Central Texas Division. The amount of the monthly subsidy for 2022 is $40.Life Insurance for Retirees Retiree life insurance applies to those who retired on or before December 31, 2015, and whose names are on file with New York Life Group Benefit Solutions. Retiree life insurance is not offered to any employee who retires after December 31, 2015. Retirees pay 100% of the cost of this coverage based on their coverage amount.

You may not assign, sell, transfer or pledge any benefits or claim for benefits under this Plan to any third party, including, but not limited to any provider of services. Any assignment by you will be void. Assignment means the transfer to another person or to an organization of your right to the services provided under the Plan or your right to receive payment from the Plan for those services.

The Plan Administrator reserves the right to pay plan benefits to someone acting on your behalf if you are not competent to receive plan benefits, or to your estate if you die while plan benefits are still owed to you. If the Plan Administrator pays benefits to a third party in good faith, benefits will not be paid again. Court Orders If you become divorced, certain court orders could require you to provide healthcare coverage to your dependent child(ren). A court order of this type is known as a Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO). If the QMCSO satisfies legal requirements and you are eligible to participate, you may enroll yourself and your eligible children covered by the QMCSO in the medical, dental and vision plans and the Healthcare Flexible Spending Account. Enrollment procedures are as follows: If you are currently enrolled in required coverages, you may add the designated child(ren) to your current option selections. This may result in an increase in premiums if your coverage tier changes. Coverage is effective on the date specified in the court order. If you are not currently participating in required coverages, you will be given the opportunity to elect options offered by Baylor Scott & White Health. The coverage levels you elect must be consistent with Baylor Scott & White Health offerings. If you do not respond to the court order within the designated period, Baylor Scott & White Health is required by law to comply by automatically enrolling the designated child(ren) as the QMCSO instructs. If the QMCSO does not otherwise dictate coverage, the designated child(ren) will be enrolled in the following coverages. This may result in an increase in premiums if your coverage tier changes. -Medical: BSWH PPO -Dental: MetLife PPO Standard -Vision: Vision Option If you satisfy the court order by covering the designated child(ren) under a plan outside of Baylor Scott & White Health, you must provide confirmation of that coverage to PeoplePlace within the designated period. If you do not, enrollment will be automatic. As soon as you are aware of any court proceedings that may affect your benefits, contact PeoplePlace. You will need to provide them with a copy of the QMCSO. You may obtain a copy of the plan's QMCSO procedures from PeoplePlace at 1-844-417-5223. CLAIMS AND APPEALS PROCEDURES FOR THE MEDICAL PLAN To receive benefits through the medical plan, you or your healthcare provider must file a claim. This section includes claims instructions, as well as some important rules for receiving benefits. In-network providers are responsible for filing claims for services provided. If you get services from out-of-network providers, they may choose not to file the claim with your insurance. You have 12 months after the date on which the medical service is provided to submit a claim for benefits. However, as discussed below, the claims procedure and your right to a review of a denied claim will differ depending on the nature of the claim. Your claim should include the following items, if applicable: Complete claim form required by your Claim Administrator Employee name, member number, address and patient name Date, type and five-digit procedure code for the medical service received or requestedBaylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 23 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER ADMIN Diagnosis code for the illness or injury Itemized charge and proof of payment (e.g. credit card receipt or voided check) Name and address of the doctor or hospital, along with the federal Tax Identification number If appropriate, other insurance explanation of benefits (EOB) If the claim is for a benefit requiring advance approval before medical treatment is received, indicate whether the claim is an urgent/emergent request as described on page 36 All claims must be submitted to the appropriate Claim Administrator.

Claims Relating to Eligibility and Enrollment If your claim is for a determination as to your eligibility or the eligibility of your dependents to participate in the plan or your enrollment under the plan and is not accompanied by a claim for plan benefits, you must obtain a claim initiation form from PeoplePlace, then submit your claim, in a timely manner, in writing to the designated recipient. Your claim will be determined by the Plan Administrator. The decision of the Plan Administrator will be final and will not be subject to the appeals process. All determinations as to eligibility for participation in the plan made in connection with a claim for benefits under the plan will be made in accordance with the applicable claims procedure described below. To substantiate claims relating to eligibility or enrollment, you are encouraged to provide supporting documents such as a copy of personal enrollment confirmation or documentation regarding your employment status. Review of Benefit Determination The Claim Administrator has procedures for applying for benefits and for requesting a review of a benefit determination. If you have followed the Claim Administrator's procedures for benefit review and believe the result is incorrect, you may file a written appeal as outlined in this section. Your \"authorized representative\" is a person you authorize, in writing, to act on your behalf or a person given authority by court order to submit claims on your behalf. In the case of a claim involving urgent care, a healthcare professional with knowledge of your condition may always act as your authorized representative. Any appeal actions described in this section that may be done by you may also be done by your authorized representative on your behalf. If Your Claim or Request Is Denied Disagreements about benefit eligibility or payment amounts can occasionally arise. In most cases, they are resolved quickly by the appropriate Claim Administrator. If you can't resolve the disagreement, formal appeal procedures are in place for your use. Unless otherwise noted, you must file a written appeal with the appropriate Claim Administrator within 180 days of receiving the notice that your claim has been denied.Notice of Initial Determination If your claim or request is wholly or partially denied, you will be furnished with notice of the decision. The notice will include any of the following information, depending on whether the denial is for a pre-authorization or for a claim: Information sufficient to identify the claim involved, including the date of service, healthcare provider, claim amount (if applicable), and a statement describing the availability, upon request, of the diagnosis code and its corresponding meaning, and the treatment code and its corresponding meaning; The specific reason for the denial, including the denial code and its corresponding meaning, as well as a description of the plan's standard, if any, that was used in denying the claim; A reference to the pertinent plan provisions upon which the denial is based; A description of any additional material or information you might be required to provide and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; A description of the plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of your right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review, and a description of available external review processes including information regarding how to initiate an appeal; If the denial is based on an internal rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criterion, a copy of the criterion or a statement that a copy will be provided free of charge upon request; If the denial is based on lack of medical necessity or an exclusion of experimental treatment, an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment that was applied to your medical circumstances, or a statement that an explanation will be provided free of charge upon request; In the case of an urgent care claim, a description of the expedited review process applicable to such claims; and Contact information for the Office of Health Insurance Consumer Assistance or Ombudsman to assist participants with the internal claims and appeals and external review process.

Appeals must be submitted within 180 calendar days from the date that you receive the original decision. After that, the original decision will be final. You may supply additional information that you would like the Claim Administrator to consider. In addition, you may request copies of documents relevant to your claim (free of charge) by contacting the Claim Administrator at the number on your member identification card. You will be provided, free of charge, with any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or generated by the Claims Administrator in connection with the claim and you will be given a reasonable opportunity to respond before a decision is made on your appeal. If new information is factored into your appeal decision, you will be provided with the rationale and given a reasonable time period to respond. This time period will be in advance of when the notice of final benefit determination is sent. If new or additional evidence is received so late that it would be impossible to provide a reasonable opportunity to respond, the time period for providing notice of the appeal decision will be suspended to allow a reasonable opportunity to respond. Review of your appeal will not provide deference to the earlier decision and will be performed by a person different from the person who decided the initial request, and who is not the prior decision-maker's subordinate. If your request was denied based on a medical judgment, the Claim Administrator will consult with a health professional with appropriate training and experience, who was not the health professional consulted during the earlier decision or a subordinate of that person. The Claim Administrator will provide the name of any such expert consulted upon request. All appeals will be adjudicated in a manner designed to ensure the independence and impartiality of the persons involved in making the decision. Accordingly, decisions regarding hiring, compensation, termination, promotion or other similar matters with respect to any individual, including a claim or appeal decision maker, will not be made based on the likelihood that the individual will support the denial of benefits.

Alternatively, if your claim involves medical judgment, you may request an external review, which will be reviewed by an External Review Organization. Appeal for External Review of Healthcare Claims External review is available when the denial involves (1) medical judgment, such as medical necessity and experimental treatment determinations, alternatives for earning a reward under a wellness program, application of nonquantitative limits on mental health and substance use disorder benefits, (2) compliance with surprise medical and air ambulance billing and cost-sharing protections, and (3) a rescission of coverage. In these situations, you may request an external review if you or your provider disagrees with the Claim Administrator's decision. An external review is a review by an independent physician, selected by an External Review Organization, who has expertise in the problem or question involved. To request an external review, the following requirements must be met: You have received notice of the denial of a claim by the Claim Administrator; Your claim involved medical judgment (including medical necessity or a determination that the treatment was experimental or investigational), compliance with surprise billing and cost-sharing protections, or a rescission of coverage; You have exhausted the applicable internal appeal processes. The appeal denial letter you receive from the Claim Administrator will describe the process to follow if you wish to pursue an external review, including a copy of the Request for External Review Form. You must submit the Request for External Review Form to the Claim Administrator within four (4) months of the date you received the appeal denial letter. You also must include a copy of the appeal denial letter and all other pertinent information that supports your request. The Claim Administrator will determine within five (5) business days after receiving your request whether the requirements for external review have been met. Within one (1) business day after completing this review, the Claim Administrator will notify you in writing if your request is or is not eligible for external review, or if it is incomplete. If your request is incomplete, the written notice will describe the information necessary for completion and allow you to complete your request within the remainder of the four-month filing period or the 48-hour period after receiving the notice, whichever is later. The Claim Administrator will contact the External Review Organization that will conduct the review of your claim. The External Review Organization will select an independent physician with appropriate expertise to perform the review. The External Review Organization will notify you in writing of your request's eligibility and acceptance for external review and will provide an opportunity for you to submit in writing within 10 business days following the date of receipt any additional information for the External Review Organization to consider when conducting the external review. In making a decision, the external reviewer may consider any appropriate credible information that you send along with the Request for External Review Form or within 10 business days of notification, and will follow the Claim Administrator's contractual documents and plan criteria governing the benefits. You will be notified of the decision of the External Review Organization usually within 45 calendar days of the Claim Administrator's receipt of your request form and all necessary information. A quicker review is possible if your physician certifies (by telephone or on a separate Request for External Review Form) that a delay in receiving the service would endanger your health or would jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function and you have filed a request for an expedited external appeal. After referral to an External Review Organization, the External Review Organization will render a decision on an expedited review as expeditiously as necessary but in no event more than 72 hours after receiving the request for review. If the decision is not in writing, the External Review Organization will provide written confirmation of the decision within 48 hours after the date of notification of the decision. The Claim Administrator, Baylor Scott & White Health and the plan will abide by the decision of the External Review Organization, except where the Claim Administrator can show conflict of interest, bias or fraud. You are responsible for the cost of compiling and sending the information that you wish to be reviewed by the External Review Organization to the Claim Administrator. The Claim Administrator is responsible for the cost of sending this information to the External Review Organization and for the cost of the external review. For more information about the Claim Administrator's External Review process, call the toll-free customer service telephone number shown on your ID card. Consistency of Treatment The Benefits Committee will take action from time to time as necessary to ensure all claims for benefits under the plans are determined in accordance with the applicable plan documents. Also, the Benefits Committee will ensure the provisions of the applicable plan documents are applied consistently to similarly situated plan participants and their dependents. Changes to Appeal Procedures Any of these appeal procedures may be changed by governmental law or by the Plan Administrator.

Consistency of Treatment The Benefits Committee will take action from time to time as necessary to ensure all claims for benefits under the plans are determined in accordance with the applicable plan documents.

Changes to Appeal Procedures Any of these appeal procedures may be changed by governmental law or by the Plan Administrator. You will be notified of any significant change in a timely manner. If you have further questions or problems, contact PeoplePlace or the claims administrator for the plan. Before submitting an appeal, it is your responsibility to contact the appropriate vendor directly to verify the deadline for filing an appeal and the information you need to submit. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS You or your dependents may be covered by other group healthcare plans. If the other plan (or plans) is also sponsored by an employer, benefits from that plan and Baylor Scott & White Health's healthcare plan are coordinated to avoid double payment. A common set of guidelines is used to determine which plan pays first. These guidelines apply to the medical, dental and vision plans. Under coordination of benefits (COB) rules, one plan is considered primary, and the other plan is considered secondary. When a claim is made, the plan considered primary pays benefits first, without regard to the other plan. The secondary plan may pay additional benefits, depending on its COB provisions. When the Baylor Scott & White Health Plan is secondary, your reimbursement is adjusted so the total benefits paid by both plans will not exceed 100% of the eligible charges. In general, the plan covering the patient as an employee will be the primary plan, which means it will pay first. For a dependent child, if both parents have group healthcare plans, the parent whose birth date comes first during the calendar year (excluding the year of birth) will have the primary plan. For instance, if the father was born on May 15 and the mother was born on July 20 (regardless of the parents' birth years), the father's plan is primary. There are additional guidelines concerning dependents. In a divorce or separation, the plan of the parent with custody of a dependent child usually pays benefits for the child first. If the person with custody remarries, the stepparent's plan pays second, and the plan of the parent without custody pays third. If a court decree places financial responsibility for the child's healthcare coverage on one parent, that parent's plan always Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 29 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER ADMINpays first. If the court does not assign financial responsibility for the child's healthcare coverage and the parents have joint custody, the birthday rule will apply. If none of these situations applies, the plan covering the person for the longest time pays first. If the other plan has no guidelines for coordinating benefits, that plan will pay benefits before Baylor Scott & White Health's healthcare plan. Subrogation and Right of Recovery The following subrogation and right of recovery provisions apply to all health and welfare plans other than the medical plan. Please see the medical plan section of this SPD for the subrogation and right of recovery provisions that apply to the medical plan. As used throughout this provision, the term Responsible Party means any party actually, possibly or potentially responsible for making any payment to a Covered Person due to a Covered Person's injury, illness or condition. The term Responsible Party includes the liability insurer of such party, or any insurance coverage. For purposes of this provision, the term Insurance Coverage refers to any coverage providing medical expense coverage or liability coverage including, but not limited to, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist coverage, personal umbrella coverage, medical payments coverage, workers' compensation coverage, no-fault automobile insurance coverage or any first- party insurance coverage. For purposes of this provision, a Covered Person includes anyone on whose behalf the plan pays or provides any benefit including, but not limited to, the minor child or dependent of any plan participant or person entitled to receive any benefits from the plan. Subrogation Immediately upon paying or providing any benefit under this plan, the plan shall be subrogated to (stand in the place of) all rights of recovery a Covered Person has against any Responsible Party with respect to any payment made by the Responsible Party to a Covered Person due to a Covered Person's injury, illness or condition to the full extent of benefits provided or to be provided by the plan. Reimbursement In addition, if a Covered Person receives any payment from any Responsible Party or Insurance Coverage as a result of an injury, illness or condition, the plan has the right to recover from, and be reimbursed by, the Covered Person for all amounts this plan has paid and will pay as a result of that injury, illness or condition from such payment, up to and including the full amount the Covered Person receives from any Responsible Party. Constructive Trust By accepting benefits (whether the payment of such benefits is made to the Covered Person or made on behalf of the Covered Person to any provider) from the plan, the Covered Person agrees that if he or she receives any payment from any Responsible Party as a result of an injury, illness or condition, he or she will serve as a constructive trustee over the funds that constitute such payment. Failure to hold such funds in trust will be deemed a breach of the Covered Person's fiduciary duty to the plan. Lien Rights Further, the plan will automatically have a lien to the extent of benefits paid by the plan for the treatment of the illness, injury or condition for which the Responsible Party is liable. The lien shall be imposed upon any recovery whether by settlement, judgment or otherwise, including from any insurance coverage related to treatment for any illness, injury or condition for which the plan paid benefits. The lien may be enforced against any party who possesses funds or proceeds representing the amount of benefits paid by the plan including, but not limited to, the Covered Person; the Covered Person's representative or agent; Responsible Party; Responsible Party's insurer, representative or agent; and/or any other source possessing funds representing the amount of benefits paid by the plan. First-Priority Claim By accepting benefits (whether the payment of such benefits is made to the Covered Person or made on behalf of the Covered Person to any provider) from the plan, the Covered Person acknowledges that this plan's recovery rights are a first-priority claim against all Responsible Parties and are to be paid to the plan before any other claim for the Covered Person's damages. This plan shall be entitled to full reimbursement on a first-dollar basis from any Responsible Party's payments, even if such payment to the plan will result in a recovery to the Covered Person that is insufficient to make the Covered Person whole or to compensate the Covered Person in part or in whole for the damages sustained. The plan is not required to participate in or pay court costs or attorney fees to any attorney hired by the Covered Person to pursue the Covered Person's damage claim. Applicability to All Settlements and Judgments The terms of this entire subrogation and right of recovery provision shall apply, and the plan is entitled to full recovery regardless of whether any liability for payment is admitted by any Responsible Party and regardless of whether the settlement or judgment received by the Covered Person identifies the medical benefits the plan provided or purports to allocate any portion of such settlement or judgment to payment of expenses other than medical expenses. The plan is entitled to recover from any and all settlements or judgments, even those designated as pain and suffering, non-economic damages and/or general damages only. Cooperation The Covered Person shall fully cooperate with the plan's efforts to recover its benefits paid. It is the duty of the Covered Person to notify the plan within 30 days of the date when any notice is Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 30 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER ADMINgiven to any party, including an insurance company or attorney, of the Covered Person's intention to pursue or investigate a claim to recover damages or obtain compensation due to injury, illness or condition sustained by the Covered Person. The Covered Person and his or her agents shall provide all information requested by the plan, the claims administrator or its representative including, but not limited to, completing and submitting any applications or other forms or statements as the plan may reasonably request. Failure to provide this information may result in the termination of health benefits for the Covered Person or the institution of court proceedings against the Covered Person. The Covered Person shall do nothing to prejudice the plan's subrogation or recovery interest or to prejudice the plan's ability to enforce the terms of this plan provision. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from making any settlement or recovery that attempts to reduce or exclude the full cost of all benefits provided by the plan. The Covered Person acknowledges that the plan has the right to conduct an investigation regarding the injury, illness or condition to identify any Responsible Party. The plan reserves the right to notify the Responsible Party and his or her agents of its lien. Agents include, but are not limited to, insurance companies and attorneys. Interpretation In the event that any claim is made that any part of this subrogation and right of recovery provision is ambiguous or questions arise concerning the meaning or intent of any of its terms, the claims administrator for the plan shall have the sole authority and discretion to resolve all disputes regarding the interpretation of this provision. Jurisdiction By accepting benefits (whether the payment of such benefits is made to the Covered Person or made on behalf of the Covered Person to any provider) from the plan, the Covered Person agrees that any court proceeding with respect to this provision may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction as the plan may elect. By accepting such benefits, the Covered Person hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving whatever rights may correspond to him or her by reason of his or her present or future domicile. OTHER IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION Discounts and Refunds Under some of the medical, dental and vision plan coverage options, some providers may agree to charge participants negotiated rates that are lower than their regular rates. In these cases, the amount you pay will be based on the reduced rate the provider has agreed to charge plan participants. In addition, some of the contracts between the plans and providers, insurers or other organizations provide for other kinds of discounts, refunds and incentive rebates that belong solely to the plans. These discounts, refunds and rebates are designed to reduce the cost of benefits to the applicable plan as a whole, but do not reduce your cost of coverage, deductibles or copays. The plans have no obligation to pass on any of these discounts, refunds or rebates to participants. Mistake of Fact Any misstatement or other mistake of fact in this information will be corrected when discovered. No Right of Employment Nothing contained in this information or in the provisions of the plans creates or should be inferred to create an employment contract. Omission or Misrepresentation of Information If you do not provide the claims administrator required information regarding your claim, your benefits may be delayed or denied until you do so. When you file a claim for benefits, you certify the statements you make on the claim are complete and accurate to the best of your knowledge. If you misrepresent information or send in a fraudulent claim, you will be responsible for repaying any benefits based on that claim. Also, you may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Liability for Payment Neither Baylor Scott & White Health nor any company participating in the plans has any obligation to make a benefit payment to you or your dependents under a plan that is fully insured. The insurer is solely responsible to make such benefit payments, and Baylor Scott & White Health has no liability to you or your dependents if the insurer fails to make any payments required under any insured plan. The following plans are fully insured: Dental benefits Vision benefits Life Insurance benefits AD&D benefits Business Travel & Accident benefits Long-Term Disability benefits Accidental Injury Critical Illness Legal Services benefits Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 31 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER ADMINOverpayment of Benefits The amount of your plan benefits will be adjusted for any of the following reasons: You have misstated any information in your application for plan coverage (including any information on the Statement of Good Health Form) or in your application for benefits You do not report required information while receiving Baylor Scott & White Health-provided benefits Any error is made in calculating your benefits If a benefit is overpaid or benefits are duplicated, you are expected to repay the plan(s) within 60 days of the overpayment. If you do not, the Plan Administrator may request that you enter into a written payroll withholding agreement providing for repayment of the amount due. No interest will be charged on the amount of any overpayment or duplication of benefits, and unless required by law, no interest will be paid on any underpayment of benefits or on any benefit payments that have been delayed for any reason. Plan Amendment or Termination Although Baylor Scott & White Holdings expects to continue the benefits described in this document, Baylor Scott & White Holdings has the right to amend or end the plans, in whole or in part, at any time and without prior notice to participants. Also, benefits may be discontinued at any time for any groups of employees or inactive participants, including retirees. Your cost for coverage is also subject to change at any time. Certain amendments to the plans may be made by designated executive officers of Baylor Scott & White Health without approval by the Board of Trustees of Baylor Scott & White Holdings. The right to amend or terminate includes the right to reduce or eliminate coverage for any treatment, procedure or service. This right is applicable regardless of whether any participant is receiving such treatment, procedure or service for any injury, illness or disease, including those occurring before the effective date of the amendment. You will be notified in writing if you are affected by any change to the plan. Plan Funding Plan funding arrangements are listed in the Plan Details chart on page 19-20. Plans described as \"self-insured\" pay benefits from separate trust funds set up for the exclusive benefit of participants. Plan Year The Plan Year for all plans described, unless stated otherwise, is Jan. 1 through Dec. 31. Severability of Plan Provisions Each plan provision is independent and does not affect the validity of any other plan provisions. If any provision is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining plan provisions remain fully effective. HIPAA Privacy A federal law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), requires health plans to protect the confidentiality of your private health information. More detailed information is given in the notices of HIPAA privacy rights from Baylor Scott & White Health Plan, MetLife and EyeMed, as applicable. You may request a copy of the privacy notices by contacting PeoplePlace at 1-844-417-5223. YOUR BENEFIT RIGHTS ERISA The following plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended. Health benefits -Medical benefits -Dental benefits -Vision benefits -Healthcare Flexible Spending Account -Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Welfare benefits -Life Insurance benefits -Accidental Injury -Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) benefits -Critical Illness -Long-Term and Short-Term Disability benefits -Business Travel & Accident benefits -Legal Services Other employee programs (including the Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account) may be explained in this summary but are not governed by the rules discussed in this section. As a participant in the plans, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA. ERISA provides that plan participants shall be entitled to: Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office, all documents governing the plans, including insurance contracts, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the plans with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration. Obtain, upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents governing the operation of the plans, including insurance contracts, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and the updated Summary Plan Description. The Plan Administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies. Receive a summary of each plan's annual financial report. Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 32 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER ADMINThe Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each participant with a copy of this summary annual report. Continue healthcare coverage for yourself, spouse or dependents if there is a loss of coverage under a healthcare plan as result of a qualifying event as provided under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). You or your dependents may have to pay for such coverage. See Continuation of Coverage through COBRA and the applicable plan documents on the rules governing your COBRA continuation rights. In addition to creating rights for participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the plans. The people who operate the plans, called \"fiduciaries\" of the plans, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, may end your employment or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA. If your claim for a benefit is denied or ignored in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you may take to enforce the previously discussed rights. For instance, if you request a copy of plan documents or the latest annual report from the plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the court may require the plan administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator. If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, and you disagree with that denial, you must file an appeal of that denial in accordance with the Claims Procedures described in this summary plan description. If your appeal is denied in accordance with the Claims Procedures herein, and you have exhausted the administrative remedies provided to you under the plan, you may file suit in a state or federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the plan's decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in federal court. If plan fiduciaries misuse a plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay these court costs and fees.

The plan provides coverage for a wide range of medical expenses, including prescription drugs and preventive care. PLAN HIGHLIGHTS You can select from three medical plan options, which differ in the amount you pay for coverage, the way you access care and the amount you pay when you need medical care. The plan covers well-child care and immunizations for your children, mammograms, adult annual physicals and other preventive services at no out-of-pocket cost to you when you use in-network providers. All medical plans include prescription drug coverage at Baylor Scott & White (BSW) pharmacies and through BSW pharmacy mail-order. All medical plans also include prescription drug coverage through Baylor Scott & White Health Plan, which has a network of retail pharmacies. Pre-existing condition restrictions do not apply. YOUR MEDICAL CHOICES Your medical choices include a Select Exclusive Quality Alliance (SEQA) / Exclusive Quality Alliance (EQA), Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and one Consumer Drive Health Plan (CDHP) with a Health Savings Account (HSA). These plans will be referenced in this document as follows: SEQA/EQA PPO HSA The SEQA/EQA plan is a single-network and exclusively includes providers in the Baylor Scott & White Quality Alliance (BSWQA) network. The PPO and HSA plans offer an extended network and you'll have lower office visit copays, coinsurance and out- of-pocket costs using the Tier 1 BSWQA network. YOUR COVERAGE TIERS Your coverage tiers include: Employee (referred to in this document as EE) Employee + Spouse (referred to in this document as ES) Employee + Children (referred to in this document as EC) Employee + Family (referred to in this document as EF) See Benefits at a Glance on pages 37, 39, 42 and 44 for specific details about plan benefits.TIER 1 BSWQA FACILITIES When you need hospital care, you'll pay less if you use a Tier 1 BSWQA facility. Tier 1 includes all BSWQA facilities, as well as the network of physicians, hospitals and other care providers in the BSWQA network. For a full list of Tier 1 BSWQA facilities, visit BSWHealthPlan. com/BSWH and use the Find a Provider search tool based on the plan in which you are enrolled. OUT-OF-AREA COVERAGE (OOA) Employees and dependents enrolled in the PPO and HSA plans who live 40 or more miles from the nearest Tier 1 acute care hospital may visit Tier 2 providers and receive a higher benefit (80% vs. 50%, after Tier 2 deductible) for inpatient and outpatient services. You can determine your proximity to Tier 1 acute care network hospitals by using the Baylor Scott & White Health Plan Find a Provider search tool located on the member portal. If you or one of your dependents lives 40 or more miles from a Tier 1 acute care hospital, notify the Customer Advocacy Center at 1-844-843-3229. To ensure your claims process correctly, please notify them prior to accessing services. Or, if you or your dependent had the OOA coverage activated but no longer live 40 or more miles from a Tier 1 acute care hospital, contact Customer Advocacy Center to deactivate this coverage. This coverage is not available to SEQA/EQA members. OUT-OF-NETWORK PROVIDERS AT TIER 1 AND TIER 2 FACILITIES When an out-of-network provider furnishes items and services (other than emergency services) to a participant with respect to a 'visit' at a Tier 1 or Tier 2 facility, coverage will be provided as follows: (1) The same cost-sharing requirements (e.g., deductible, coinsurance, copay) apply as if the items and services were provided by Tier 1 or Tier 2 providers. (2) The cost-sharing amount is calculated using the recognized amount. (3) All cost-sharing paid by participants for such items and services will count toward any Tier 1 or Tier 2 deductible or out- of-pocket maximum as if furnished by Tier 1 or Tier 2 providers, and the Tier 1 and Tier 2 deductible and out-of-pocket maximums will apply to such items and services. PLEASE NOTE: Facility-based physicians (Radiologists, Anesthesiologists, Pathologists, Emergency Providers, Neonatologists and Hospitalists) will process and be paid at the Tier 1 benefit level when receiving care in a Tier 1 or Tier 2 facility. Claims for Tier 1 or Tier 2 facility-based physicians can Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 34 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER MEDICALbe reprocessed at the Tier 2 benefit level if requested by the member. Additionally, in the event a claim is processed at the Tier 2 benefit level, the member can request it be reprocessed at the Tier 1 benefit level. However, if the out-of-network provider meets certain notice and consent requirements, then this paragraph will not apply. For this purpose, \"visit\" means, with respect to items and services furnished to an individual at a health care facility, in addition to those items and services furnished by a provider at the facility, equipment and devices, telemedicine services, imaging services, laboratory services, and preoperative and postoperative services, regardless of whether the provider furnishing such items or services is at the facility. IMPORTANT: Claims from out-of-network providers could be filed to your insurance before the facility claim is received; in that case, the system may not know the service was at an in- network facility and claims could process at the out-of-network benefit level. If this situation applies to you, prior to paying any charges, contact Baylor Scott & White Health Plan at the number listed on the back of your medical card for assistance. CONTINUITY OF CARE If you are a continuing care patient with a Tier 1 or Tier 2 provider or facility at the time such provider or facility becomes out-of- network, you will have the right to elect continued transitional care from such provider or facility. This means you can receive the same benefits, under the same terms and conditions, with respect to the course of treatment you are receiving as a continuing care patient for up to 90 days. A continuing care patient is a participant who meets at least one of the following criteria: (1) is undergoing a course of treatment for a serious and complex condition from the provider or facility; (2) is undergoing a course of institutional or inpatient care from the provider or facility; (3) is scheduled to undergo nonelective surgery from the provider, including receipt of postoperative care from such provider or facility with respect to such a surgery; (4) is pregnant and undergoing a course of treatment for the pregnancy from the provider or facility; or (5) is or was determined to be terminally ill and is receiving treatment for such illness from such provider or facility. PRE-AUTHORIZATION/ PRE-NOTIFICATION Certain services, such as inpatient stays, certain tests and imaging, procedures and outpatient surgery require pre- authorization. Pre-authorization is a process that helps you and your physician determine whether the services being recommended are covered expenses under the plan. It also allows Baylor Scott & White Health Plan (\"BSWHP\") to help your provider coordinate your transition from an inpatient setting to an outpatient setting (called discharge planning) and to register you for specialized programs or case management when appropriate. You do not need to get pre-authorization for services provided by an in-network provider. These providers are responsible for obtaining necessary pre-authorization for you. However, it is always recommended to check with your provider's office to confirm they have secured the necessary approval prior to receiving care. Failure to get pre-authorization for services will result in denial of services and payment. Please contact Customer Service to verify benefits, eligibility and pre- authorization requirements. When you go to an out-of-network provider, it is your responsibility to ensure your provider obtains prior authorization for any services or supplies on the pre-authorization list. Failure to get pre-authorization for services will result in denial of services and payment. The Pre-Authorization Process Prior to being hospitalized or receiving certain medical services or supplies, certain pre-authorization procedures must be followed. You or a member of your family, a hospital staff member or the attending physician must notify BSWHP to pre-approve any of the out-of-network admissions or medical services and expenses on the pre-authorization list, prior to receiving any of the services or supplies, within the time frames specified below. To obtain pre-authorization, call BSWHP at the telephone number listed on your ID card. This call must be made in the circumstances shown in the table below. BSWHP will provide a written notification to you and your physician of the pre-authorization decision. If your pre-authorized expenses are approved, the approval is good for the dates of service on the Coverage Determination letter as long as you remain enrolled in the plan. When you have an inpatient admission to a facility, BSWHP will notify you, your physician and the facility about your pre- authorized length of stay. If your physician recommends that your stay be extended, additional days will need to be authorized. Your physician or the facility will need to call BSWHP at the number on your ID card by the last day authorized. BSWHP will review and process the request for an extended stay. You and your physician will receive a notification of an approval or denial. If pre-authorization determines that the stay or services and supplies are not covered expenses, the notification will explain why and how BSWHP's decision can be appealed, including where to send your appeal. You or your provider may request a review of the pre-authorization decision according to the Appeals Process in the Administrative & General Information section.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 35 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER MEDICALPre-Authorization and Concurrent Reviews Pre-authorization/Pre-service request A Pre-authorization/Pre-service request is a request for coverage of medical care, drugs or services that BSWHP must approve in advance, in whole or in part consistent with the benefit plan language. The appropriate Utilization Management (UM) Clinician will notify you of his or her determination with respect to a pre-authorization/pre-service request, whether adverse or not, no later than 15 calendar days after the receipt of the request. This 15-day period may be extended for an additional 15 days if the UM Clinician determines the extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of the plan and notifies you of the extension before the end of the initial 15-day period. If the UM Clinician has not received all the necessary information to make a determination, he or she will notify your Provider via notification that will outline the information needed. Your Provider will be given a reasonable period of time, but not less than 45 calendar days, in which to supply the missing information. If a pre-authorization/pre-service request is denied by the UM Clinician, you have 180 days from the notice of official denial to file an appeal of the denial. Urgent/emergent request Urgent/emergent request is a request for medical care, drugs or services where application of the time frame for making routine or non-life threatening care determinations could seriously jeopardize the life, health or safety of yourself or others, due to your medical or psychological state, or in the opinion of a provider with knowledge of your medical or behavioral condition, would subject you to adverse health consequences without the care or treatment that is the subject of the request. The UM Clinician will notify you with respect to an urgent/ emergent request, whether adverse or not, no later than 72 hours after the receipt of the request. If the UM Clinician has not received all the necessary information to make a determination, he or she will notify your Provider within 24 hours of receiving the request via notification that will outline the information needed. Your Provider will be given a reasonable period of time, but not less than 48 hours, in which to supply the missing information. If an urgent/emergent request is denied by the UM Clinician, you have 180 days from the notice of official denial to file an appeal of the denial. Concurrent request Concurrent request is a request for coverage of inpatient medical care or services made while you are in the process of receiving the requested medical care or services, even if the organization did not previously approve the earlier care. The UM Clinician will notify you of his or her decision within 72 hours of receiving your request, provided the request was received at least 72 hours before the course of treatment was scheduled to terminate. Type of Admission or Service Time Period for Pre-authorization/Notification Non-Emergency Admission You, your physician or the facility must call and request pre-authorization at least 15 days before the date you are scheduled to be admitted. Emergency Outpatient Medical ServicesYou or your physician must call as soon as reasonably possible. Emergency Admission You, your physician or the facility must call within 24-48 hours or as soon as reasonably possible after you have been admitted. Urgent Admission You, your physician or the facility must call before you are scheduled to be admitted. An urgent admission is a hospital admission by a physician due to the onset of or change in an illness, the diagnosis of an illness or an injury. Outpatient Non-Emergency Medical Services Requiring Pre-AuthorizationYou or your physician must call at least 15 days before the outpatient care is provided or the treatment or procedure is scheduled.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 36 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER MEDICALServices That Require Pre-Authorization The list of services that require pre-authorization may change from time to time. You can find out if your service requires pre-authorization by calling 1-844-843-3229 or by visiting BSWHealthPlan.com/BSWH. The Prior Authorization list can be found under Tools and Resources. How Failure to Pre-Authorize Affects Your Benefits If your in-network provider fails to obtain a required pre- authorization prior to incurring any expenses that require pre-authorization, there will be no coverage for the service and the provider cannot bill you for the unpaid balance of the bills unless you sign a financial responsibility waiver at the time of service. You are responsible for obtaining the necessary pre- authorization from BSWHP prior to receiving services from an out-of-network provider. Your provider may request authorization of your treatment for you; however, you should verify with BSWHP prior to the procedure that the provider has obtained pre-authorization. If pre-authorization is not obtained by you or your provider, your expenses will not be covered. Any additional out-of-pocket expenses incurred because your pre-authorization requirement was not met will not count toward your deductible, coinsurance or out-of-pocket maximum. HOW THE SEQA PLAN WORKS The Select Exclusive Quality Alliance (SEQA) plan is available to employees making $27.00 or less per hour. This plan has a low deductible and exclusively includes providers in the Tier 1 BSWQA Network, except in cases of urgent/emergency care or rare situations when an in-network provider is not available and authorization is provided.

No out-of-network coverage is available, except in cases of urgent/emergency care or rare situations when an in-network provider is not available and authorization is provided. Out-of-Pocket Maximum The out-of-pocket maximum is the most that you will pay for eligible healthcare expenses, including your copays, and coinsurance, in a plan year. Once you reach the out-of-pocket maximum, the plan pays 100% for covered services throughout the remainder of the plan year. This plan has embedded out of pocket maximums which means no one person in your family has to pay more than the individual maximum, even if together you haven't met the family out- of-pocket maximum. The individual out-of-pocket maximum equates to the employee out-of-pocket maximum. IMPORTANT!

HOW THE HSA PLAN WORKS With the Health Savings Account (HSA) plan, you may set up an HSA that can help you pay medical expenses. You pay expenses (either out of pocket or from your HSA) until you reach your deductible. After the deductible amount is paid, you and the plan share the costs until you reach your annual out-of-pocket maximum. Then, the plan pays 100% of any further Tier 1 and Tier 2 covered expenses for the plan year. To qualify for an HSA, you must meet the following requirements: You must be covered under BSWH's high deductible health plan (HDHP) on the first day of the month. You have no other health coverage except what is permitted by the IRS, as described in the \"Other Health Coverage\" section of IRS Publication 969. You are not enrolled in Medicare. If you have previously enrolled in Medicare or enroll in Medicare during the plan year, it is your responsibility to promptly notify BSWH of your enrollment. Upon enrollment in Medicare, you will no longer be eligible to contribute to your HSA beginning with the month in which you enroll in Medicare. For more information on how your contributions will be affected by your enrollment in Medicare, see the section titled \"Annual Contributions\" below. You are not enrolled in TRICARE. You haven't received Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits within the past three months, except for preventive care. If you have a disability rating from the VA, this exclusion doesn't apply. You cannot be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return. You do not have a healthcare flexible spending account (FSA), with the exception of a limited purpose FSA that can be used solely for eligible dental and vision expenses until you meet your deductible. For complete details, you can review Publication 969 on the IRS website at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf . If you have other healthcare coverage in addition to BSWH's, you should enroll in the SEQA/EQA or PPO plan because this restriction does not apply to those plans. With the HSA, you may contribute your own money tax-free. The HSA belongs to you \u2014 you decide whether to use the money to pay current expenses or keep it in the account for future needs. When you enroll in the HSA plan, you may visit any doctor at any time without a referral. However, when you use a provider in Tier 2, you will pay discounted fees. And if you use a Tier 1 provider, you'll pay even less. In addition, if you use a Tier 1 or Tier 2 provider, you will not pay for charges in excess of the discounted price and, in most cases, the provider will file claims for you. Preventive care from a Tier 1 or Tier 2 provider is always covered at 100% \u2014 with no deductible or coinsurance. To see what's covered, see pages 59-70 . If you use a provider that is not in Tier 1 or Tier 2, you may have to pay the full price at the time of service and file a claim for reimbursement. In addition, you are responsible for any charges above the recognized charges. Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 40 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER MEDICALTo locate a Tier 1 or Tier 2 provider, visit BSWHealthPlan. com/BSWH and use the Find a Provider search tool. Health Savings Account (HSA) After you enroll in the HSA plan, you may open an HSA. You will receive an information packet and a Healthcare Payment Card from Optum Bank explaining how to take advantage of your HSA. All HSAs opened through Optum Bank will need to have a physical mailing address (not a P.O. Box) in the HR system. You can make pre-tax contributions to your HSA. Your HSA belongs to you, similar to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). You decide whether to spend the money or save it for the future. It is your responsibility to keep receipts to prove that withdrawals are spent on eligible expenses. Each year that your HSA is open, you must file a Form 8889 with your federal income tax return showing contributions and withdrawals from your account. You can also choose to open an HSA with another bank or other financial institution. However, BSWH will only deposit pre-tax payroll deductions to HSAs opened through Optum Bank. This section explains the basic rules about the HSA. Please note, however, that once opened, the HSA itself is not part of the BSWH Plan. HSAs are not maintained or sponsored by BSWH and are not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Annual HSA Contributions You may contribute your own money to your HSA, up to IRS limits. For 2022, your contributions may not exceed $3,650 for Employee coverage or $7,300 for Family coverage. This limit applies even if you enroll after Jan. 1. If you are age 55 or older, you can make an additional HSA catch-up contribution of up to $1,000 per calendar year. If you have previously enrolled in Medicare, you will not be eligible to contribute to your HSA. If you enroll in Medicare during the plan year, the above HSA contribution limits are pro-rated based on the number of months in the plan year prior to your Medicare enrollment. If you stop participating in the HSA plan or become covered by a low-deductible health plan during the year, your eligibility to contribute to your HSA ceases and the maximum amount of contributions you may make will be reduced. Please note: These amounts are indexed annually for inflation. If you make a contribution for the entire tax year \u2014 when you only have part-year coverage \u2014 then you must remain in an HDHP and subsequently be eligible for the HSA through the next full calendar year, or must include the amount of this contribution (above and beyond what you could have contributed based on a pro rata portion of the annual limit) in gross income and be subject to an additional 10% tax. You can elect to contribute through pre-tax payroll deductions and/or electronic fund transfer (EFT) from a personal account. If you contribute through EFT, those contributions may be deductible on your federal income tax return. You can change your payroll deductions at any time.Using Your HSA You decide when to use the money in your HSA. You will receive a Healthcare payment card that may be used at healthcare merchants (such as a doctor's office, pharmacy, etc.) where MasterCard is accepted. The Healthcare payment card can be used at an ATM for cash withdrawals or internationally, but there is a fee associated with this type of transaction. You must have adequate funds in your HSA to pay for any expenses or your card transaction will be denied. You can also request a withdrawal/reimbursement from your account. Your HSA can be used only for eligible expenses for you and your federal tax dependents, whether or not they are covered by a BSWH medical plan. Note that this does NOT include adult child(ren) up to age 26 who are covered by BSWH medical plan but are not claimed as dependents on your federal tax return. Your HSA can be used for eligible expenses of a domestic partner only if he or she is claimed as a dependent on your federal tax return. If you use HSA funds to pay eligible healthcare expenses, the money is not taxable when withdrawn. If used for ineligible expenses, the money is taxable as income and is subject to a 20% tax penalty if withdrawn before age 65. Eligible healthcare expenses include your deductible, your coinsurance amounts, prescription drugs, dental and vision expenses, etc. Amounts paid from your HSA after December 31, 2019 may also include certain over-the-counter medications and menstrual care products. Out-of-network amounts that exceed the recognized charge are also eligible healthcare expenses that may be paid from your HSA. Note that although your HSA can be used for dental, vision and amounts exceeding the recognized charge, these amounts do not count toward your medical deductible. So, your HSA's impact on your deductible depends on how you decide to spend your HSA money. To be eligible, expenses must be incurred on or after your HSA is opened. However, expenses do not have to be paid or reimbursed from your HSA in the year incurred. Expenses continue to be eligible after you no longer participate in the HSA plan. These rules provide a great deal of flexibility for using your HSA. For example, if you have a medical expense of $500 in 2022, you can initially pay it out of pocket and save the receipt. If you decide in 2022 or a later year that you prefer to pay this expense with HSA money, you can file for reimbursement at that time, as long as you have the receipt to submit.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 41 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER MEDICALCoverage LevelHSA Tier 1 Tier $7,000 (EF)* $3,500 $7,000 $14,000 * Aggregate family deductible, which means the plan will provide after-deductible coverage once the total family deductible is met. Note: A separate deductible applies for services provided under each Tier. Medical expenses will only apply and accumulate to the applicable network tier. All in-network pharmacy claims cross accumulate and are subject to the Tier 1 deductible only. HSA Fees Baylor Scott & White Health will pay the account maintenance fee while you are employed. If you terminate employment with BSWH, but continue to maintain your HSA with Optum Bank the monthly account maintenance fee of $2.75 per month will be automatically deducted from your account. Once you maintain an average balance of $3,000 in your HSA account, the $2.75 monthly maintenance fee will be waived. Investing Your HSA Your HSA is an interest-bearing account insured by the FDIC, paying a tiered variable rate. Go to www.optumbank.com for current rates. As long as your HSA has a minimum balance of $2,000, you can direct its investment among a range of investment choices with nationally-recognized fund families. The investment funds each have minimum investment levels. Optum Bank offers online investment, trade and balance reporting. Transactional and management fees apply. Deductible Your deductible is the amount that must be paid before the plan begins to pay coinsurance. You pay your deductible out of pocket, which can include funds from your HSA. The amount of the deductible varies based on the coverage level you select, as shown below. Amounts that don't count toward the deductible: Expenses paid by the plan Expenses for preventive care Any out-of-network expenses that exceed the recognized charge Coinsurance If you have additional eligible medical expenses after your deductible is paid, then coinsurance begins. Coinsurance means you pay a percentage and the plan pays a percentage of the costs. The plan generally pays a coinsurance amount of 90% of the cost for services through Tier 1 providers, 50% of the cost for services through Tier 2 providers and 20% of the cost for services through Tier 3 providers. Tier 3 amounts above the recognized charges are your responsibility. Your coinsurance amount is 10% of the cost for services at Tier 1 providers and 50% of the cost for services through Tier 2 providers, up to a limit called the out-of-pocket maximum. The out-of-pocket maximum is the most you pay in coinsurance expenses for covered services in a plan year. Your coinsurance for Tier 3 providers is 80% of the recognized charge for services, with no out-of-pocket maximum. If you choose the HSA plan for you and your family, the Tier 1 deductible of $3,500 must be reached by the covered expenses of any combination of family members before coinsurance begins for any family member. Example - Tier 1: Betty enrolls herself and her daughter in the HSA plan and contributes $500 to her HSA. During the first six months of the year, all of the $500 in the HSA is spent on expenses for Betty. In July, she has an X-ray at a Tier 1 facility that costs $700, and pays out of pocket. In August, her daughter has expenses of $2,300, which she also pays out of pocket. She has now met her Tier 1 $3,500 deductible, and the plan will pay coinsurance for any additional expenses for Betty and her daughter for the remainder of the plan year, until the Tier 1 out- of-pocket maximum is reached. Prescriptions You pay coinsurance for prescriptions after you meet your deductible. See the Prescription Drugs section for more information. Recognized Charges If you obtain covered services from a Tier 3 provider, the amount paid by the plan is based on the recognized charge. The recognized charge for a specific service or supply is determined by BSWHP in its sole discretion. The plan pays only the recognized charge, not the full amount. Any portion of an expense that exceeds the recognized charge is your responsibility to pay and will not count toward your deductible amount. You may pay the excess over the recognized charge from your HSA. See the Glossary for the definition of a recognized charge. Out-of-Pocket Maximum The out-of-pocket maximum is the most you will pay for eligible Tier 1 or Tier 2 healthcare expenses, including your deductible and coinsurance, in a plan year. Once you reach the out-of- pocket maximum, the plan pays 100% for Tier 1 or Tier 2 covered services for the remainder of the plan year. * These are embedded out-of-pocket maximums, which means no one person in your family has to pay more than the individual maximum, even if together you haven't met the family out-of-pocket maximum.

When you use a provider in Tier 1 or Tier 2, you pay a simple copay for most services, like in-network office visits and prescription drugs. Inpatient and outpatient services, including labs and x-rays are subject to a deductible. Once you meet your deductible, you and BSWH share the cost of any additional covered expenses until you reach your annual out-of-pocket maximum. After that, the plan pays 100% of Tier 1 or Tier 2 covered expenses for the year. Some preventive care, like routine physicals, routine child and well-baby care, immunizations and preventive tests, is covered at 100%. In addition, network providers have agreed to charge a negotiated fee for their services and will file your claims for you. Plus, when you use a provider in Tier 2, you will pay discounted fees for services. And, if you use a Tier 1 provider you'll pay even less. If you use a provider that is not in Tier 1 or Tier 2, you might have to pay the full price at the time of service and file a claim for reimbursement. In addition, you are responsible for any charges above the recognized charge. To locate a Tier 1 or Tier 2 provider, visit BSWHealthPlan.com/BSWH and use the Find a Provider search tool. Deductible You and/or your covered family member must satisfy a deductible each calendar year before the plan begins paying benefits. The family deductible is satisfied by the combined out-of-pocket expenses of two or more family members. Preventive services such as adult routine exams, mammograms, pap smears and well-child care are not subject to the deductible. The amount of the deductible varies based on the coverage level you select and whether you use Tier 1 or Tier 2 providers, as shown below. Coverage LevelPPO Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 You pay copays for doctor visits, walk-in clinics, urgent care, emergency services and prescription drugs. If you need hospital care, you pay 100% of the costs until you meet your deductible.

The individual deductible equates to the employee deductible. Note: A separate deductible applies for services provided under each Tier. Medical expenses will only apply and accumulate to the applicable network tier. Out-of-Pocket Maximum The out-of-pocket maximum is the most that you will pay for eligible Tier 1 or Tier 2 health expenses, including your copay, deductible and coinsurance, in a plan year.

To be eligible for coverage, the prescription must be for a medically necessary treatment of an injury, illness or other medical condition covered by the medical plan options. What You Pay You'll pay different amounts for prescription drugs, based on your medical plan option and the tier of medication you choose: preferred generic, preferred brand, non-preferred brand, non-preferred generic, and specialty drugs. All drugs have been reviewed and approved by a group of doctors and pharmacists to be included on BSWH's formulary (approved drug list). Go to BSWHealthPlan.com/BSWH for a complete list of formulary drugs. Preferred Generic: These drugs have the lowest copayment as they offer the greatest value compared to other drugs that treat similar conditions. Generics have the same active ingredients as a brand-name drug but usually cost less and the quality and effectiveness are the same. Generics have been FDA-approved under strict standards. Preferred Brand: Brand name drugs are produced under the original manufacturer's brand name and are often more costly than preferred generic medications. Preferred brands have been proven to be safe, effective, and offer greater value than other brand name products that treat similar conditions.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 48 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER MEDICAL Non-Preferred Brand and Generic: These are brand-name and generic drugs that are generally more costly than drugs in the preferred tiers. There are often alternative medications available in the preferred tiers that treat similar conditions but are less costly. Specialty: These are high cost medications that are used to treat complex conditions, and which usually require close monitoring. Specialty drugs may be self-administered in the home by injection (under the skin or into a muscle), by inhalation, by mouth, or on the skin. These drugs may also require special handling, special manufacturing processes, and may have limited prescribing or limited pharmacy availability.

Variable Specialty Copay Program: If copay card (manufacturer assistance) is used to offset the amount you would be charged under the plan, you will only receive accumulator (deductible or out of pocket) credit for the amount you pay for certain drugs. You will still receive the benefit of the copay card financially, however, you will not receive the deductible or out of pocket credit for amounts you have not paid out of your own pocket. Baylor Scott & White Pharmacies If you fill your maintenance eligible prescription through any BSW pharmacy, both mail order and retail, you can receive a three-month supply at the cost of a two-month supply. Mail-order is handled through the Baylor Scott & White Frisco Pharmacy. You will also get a 20% discount on over-the-counter drugs if you show your BSWH employee badge at a BSW pharmacy. 90-day Supplies of Maintenance Eligible Medications for Out of State Employees If you or your covered dependent reside out of state and would like access to a 90 day supply of a maintenance eligible medications, you may contact the BSWHP pharmacy help desk number on the front of your ID card and request a 90 day supply of your maintenance eligible medication at a contracted retail pharmacy near you. Two times (2x) copay of the contracted retail pharmacy 30 day supply copay will apply. Example: 30 day supply for preferred generic is $12; $12 X 2 = $24 copay. All other standard contracted retail pharmacy benefits apply including but not limited to Rx deductible. HSA is subject to the applicable deductible and coinsurance. Step Therapy With almost every health condition, there are several different prescription drugs from which to choose. In many cases, the medications work similarly, but some cost less. That's where step therapy comes in. Before approving certain brand name medications, your plan may ask you to try a lower-cost alternative first. If it isn't effective, you can step up to the next lowest-cost medication until you find a drug that works best. Remember, you'll pay less if you choose a generic drug instead of a brand name option. Quantity Management For safety and cost reasons, certain drugs have limits on the amount you receive at one time. This is often based on the manufacturer's recommended dosages. Split-Fill Oral Oncology Program Prescriptions for drugs included in the Oral Oncology Program are limited to a maximum 15-day supply for the first two months of therapy, at 50% of the specialty copayment. Since these medications sometimes have side effects and may be difficult to tolerate this allows you and your doctor to try the medication for a shorter time while avoiding wasted medication and unnecessary expenses. After the first four fills, members continuing on therapy may fill their prescription for up to a 30-day supply. Pre-Authorization Some drugs need approval before the plan will cover them for both safety and cost reasons. If you receive a prescription for a drug that requires pre-authorization, you, a representative, or your doctor may submit a request for coverage. If approved, you'll pay the applicable copayment or coinsurance. If not approved and you still want to take the medication, you'll pay the full cost. Compounds Compounds costing greater than $100 require pre-authorization. For coverage, compound must contain at least one formulary ingredient. Bulk chemicals and non-FDA approved products such as topical pain patches are excluded from coverage.

Specialty Drug Coverage Under Medical The medical coverage for specialty medications is the same as the pharmacy coverage for the PPO and HSA plans. PPO: You pay 20% ($200 max) for Tier 1 and Tier 2 participating providers, and 80% after deductible for Tier 3 non-participating providers. HSA: You pay 10% after deductible for Tier 1 and Tier 2 participating providers, and 80% after deductible for Tier 3 non-participating providers. Medically Necessary Coverage is provided only for services and supplies that are medically necessary.

A preventive service done that results in a therapeutic service done at the same encounter and as an integral part of the preventive service (e.g. polyp removal during preventive colonoscopy), the therapeutic service would still be considered a preventive service. Examples include, but are not limited to: A woman had an abnormal finding on a preventive screening mammography and the follow-up study was found to be normal, and the patient was returned to normal mammography screening protocol, then future mammography would be considered preventive. If a polyp is encountered during preventive screening colonoscopy, the colonoscopy, removal of the polyp, and associated fees done at the same encounter are covered under the Preventive Care Services benefit. When a service is done for diagnostic purposes it will be adjudicated as a non-preventive medical benefit. Diagnostic services are done on a person who had: Abnormalities found on previous preventive or diagnostic studies that require further diagnostic studies; or Abnormalities found on previous preventive or diagnostic studies that would recommend a repeat of the same studies within shortened time intervals from the recommended preventive screening time intervals; or A symptom that required further evaluation. Examples include, but are not limited to: A patient had a polyp found and removed at a prior preventive screening colonoscopy. All future colonoscopies are considered diagnostic because the time intervals between future colonoscopies would be shortened. A patient had an elevated cholesterol on prior preventive screening. Once the diagnosis has been made, further testing is considered diagnostic rather than preventive. This is true whether or not the patient is receiving pharmacotherapy.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 59 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER MEDICALMedical Plan Preventive List Service Description Sex Age Frequency Grade Wellness visits (General)Preventive medicine comprehensive evaluation and management services include: An age-and gender-appropriate history Physical examination Counseling/anticipatory guidance Risk factor reduction interventions The ordering of appropriate immunization(s) and laboratory/screening procedures Codes G0402,G0438, G0439, G0513, and G0514 are the Medicare initial preventive PE and wellness visit (one time) with no copays.

The plan shall have the Right of Recovery with respect to any recovery, right of recovery, claim, cause of action or other rights that any or all interested parties may have against a third party. The term \"third party\" means any entity or person, including but not limited to, an insurance company (e.g. the participant's own insurance company, in the case of uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage or no-fault automobile insurance). The term \"interested party\" means any person or entity who has or may have a right of recovery, claim, cause or action or other right arising out or related to the illness or injury (or any loss related thereto) sustained by the participant; such term shall include but shall in no way be limited to, the participant's estate (or personal representative of the estate), heirs, guardian or other representative. Extent of Right of Recovery 1. The right to recover from any interested party all amounts the interested party may recover or receive from any third party with respect to the illness or injury for which benefits are payable under the terms of the plan; 2. The right to reduce the amount of covered plan benefits payable with respect to the illness or injury, by any amount or amounts recovered by an interested party from a third party with respect to or as a result of the same illness or injury; and 3. The right of subrogation to stand in the shoes of an interested party and assert any right of recovery, claim or cause of action of the interested party and assert any right of recovery, claim, or cause of action that the interested party may have against a third party arising from or related to the illness or injury for which benefits are payable under the terms of the plan; the plan's right of subrogation includes the right to control absolutely the prosecution of the subrogated right of recovery, claim or cause of action, including, but not limited to, the selection of counsel. Priority The plan's Right of Recovery shall be determined as follows: 1. The plan shall have a first priority lien on any full or partial recovery by an interested party from a third party. The plan's Right of Recovery shall apply regardless of whether or not the interested party is made whole from the recovery against such third party. Any recovery amount that the plan is entitled to shall not be reduced or prorated by or on account of the interested party's attorney's fees and costs. 2. Any full or partial recovery by an interested party against a third party shall be deemed to be recovery for plan benefits with respect to the illness or injury for which the third party is or may be liable, regardless of whether or not the judgment, award, formal or informal settlement, contract or any other payment of any kind itemizes or identifies an amount awarded for plan benefits or is specifically limited to certain kinds of damages or payments; an interested party may not avoid or circumvent the plan's Right of Recovery because of the way in which the recovery from a third party is characterized. By way of example, the plan shall have a Right of Recovery even if an interested party's recovery from a third party is described as a recovery for pain and suffering, loss of consortium, emotional distress, punitive damages for vexatious refusal to pay, attorneys' fees, or medical expenses. 3. The Plan Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, may agree to treat a lesser percentage of an interested party's recovery from a third party as attributable to plan benefits. The amount so determined shall be binding on the plan and the interested party as the amount of plan benefits to which the plan has the Right of Recovery. Limits on Plan Obligations If the plan has a Right of Recovery, the plan shall not be obligated to pay any plan benefits with respect to the participant's illness or injury until all of the following conditions are fulfilled to the complete satisfaction of the Plan Administrator in its sole and absolute discretion. 1. If the Plan Administrator desires to assert the plan's right of subrogation, all interested parties (or someone legally qualified and authorized to act for an interested party) must sign all documents required by the Plan Administrator to assert such right. 2. If the Plan Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, decides not to assert the plan's right of subrogation, all interested parties (or someone legally qualified and authorized to act for an interest party) shall agree in writing to the following conditions: a. The interested party shall agree to include plan benefits in any claim or cause of action the interested party makes against a third party for the illness or injury (or any loss related thereto); b. The interested party shall agree that the plan has an absolute Right of Recovery and a first priority lien upon any recovery made by the interested party related to the illness or injury for which plan benefits have or will be paid; and c. The interested party shall agree not to settle a claim against a third party without prior written consent of the Plan Administrator. 3. All interested parties (or someone legally qualified or authorized to act for an interested party) shall agree in writing to cooperate fully with the plan in asserting and protecting its Right of Recovery, supply the Plan Administrator with any and all information necessary to assert and protect such Right of Recovery, and execute and deliver any and all instruments and papers in their original form.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 78 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER MEDICALSuspension of Plan Payment The Plan Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, may suspend payment of plan benefits if any interested party has not executed or is not in compliance with the terms of any required written agreement. Payment of benefits pursuant to the plan before any required written agreement is obtained, or while an interested party is not in compliance with the terms of such a written agreement, shall not constitute a waiver by the plan of its Right of Recovery. Violation of any required written agreement shall be a violation of the terms of the plan document. Waiver The Plan Administrator, in its sole and absolute discretion, may agree to waive the plan's Right of Recovery. The plan's waiver of its Right of Recovery with respect to one claim shall not constitute a waiver of its Right of Recovery with respect to another claim; and the plan's waiver of its Right of Recovery with respect to one interested party shall not constitute a waiver of its Right of Recovery with respect to another interested party. Notification of Potential Right of Recovery An interested party shall notify the Plan Administrator, in writing, whenever an illness or injury arises that provides or may provide the plan a Right of Recovery. The plan shall be entitled to recover its attorney's fees and costs from an interested party if the plan takes legal action against the interested party to enforce its reimbursement rights.

Homebound \u2014 We follow the Medicare definition/criteria to determine coverage eligibility. Medicare considers you homebound if you meet both of the following criteria. 1. You need the help of another person or medical equipment such as crutches, a walker or a wheelchair to leave your home. OR Your doctor believes that your health or illness could get worse if you leave your home. AND 2. It is difficult for you to leave your home and you typically cannot do so. Your doctor will decide whether you qualify as homebound when they write up your plan of care for the home health benefit. Whether or not you do depends on your doctor's evaluation and knowledge of your condition over an extended period of time, not on a daily or weekly basis. Leaving home for medical treatment, religious services or to attend a licensed or accredited adult day care center does not put your homebound status at risk. Leaving home for short periods of time or for special non-medical events, such as a family reunion, funeral or graduation, will also not keep you from being considered homebound. Taking an occasional trip to the barber or beauty parlor is also allowed. Mental Disorder \u2014 An illness commonly understood to be a mental disorder, whether or not it has a physiological basis, and for which treatment is generally provided by or under the direction of a behavioral health provider such as a psychiatric physician, psychologist or psychiatric social worker.

Recognized Charge \u2014 Only that part of a charge which is less than or equal to the recognized charge is a covered benefit. In some circumstances, BSWHP may have an agreement with a provider (either directly, or indirectly through a third party) that sets the rate that BSWHP will pay for a service or supply. In these instances, in spite of the methodology described above, the recognized charge is the rate established in such an agreement. BSWHP may also reduce the recognized charge by applying BSWHP Reimbursement Policies. BSWHP Reimbursement Policies address the appropriate billing of services, taking into account factors that are relevant to the cost of the service. Substance Abuse \u2014 A physical or psychological dependency, or both, on a controlled substance or alcohol agent [as defined on Axis I in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association, which is current as of the date services are rendered to you or your covered dependents].

PLAN HIGHLIGHTS You have a choice of two dental plans: -Standard PPO or Plus PPO \u2014 Preferred Provider Organizations, administered by MetLife Both plans cover preventive care at 100% along with basic care and major care. The Plus PPO covers dental implants and orthodontia for eligible children and adults. The plans differ in the amount you pay for coverage, how you go about getting care and what you pay when you need care. You can see any dentist you choose, but you'll save money if you use a MetLife network dentist. HOW THE METLIFE STANDARD AND PLUS PPOS WORK The MetLife Standard PPO and the MetLife Plus PPO work the same way. You can go to any dentist you choose, but you will save money by going to one in the MetLife Preferred Dental Program (PDP). You have to meet the same deductible for both PPO plans before the plan shares the cost of dental care with you. However, with the MetLife Standard PPO, you may pay a higher coinsurance and the annual maximum is lower. The MetLife Standard PPO does not cover orthodontia; the MetLife Plus PPO covers orthodontia for eligible children and adults. The Plus plan also covers dental implants. Here's how the MetLife PPOs pay dental benefits: The coinsurance percentage under each plan applies whether you go to a network or non-network dentist. If you use in-network providers, you pay discounted rates for services. If you go to an out-of-network dentist, benefits are paid based on reasonable and customary charges for services. If your dentist charges more than what MetLife deems reasonable and customary for the service in your geographic area, you must pay the difference between the reasonable and customary charge and what the dentist charges, in addition to your share of the coinsurance. Under the PPO Dental Plans, you pay coinsurance (a percentage of the cost) for each treatment. Certain treatments are subject to an annual deductible, which varies based on your level of coverage (employee only or employee plus one or more dependents).The PPO Summary of Benefits is listed on pages 82-83. It shows your coinsurance amount for each service and excluded services. The following sections apply to both the Standard and Plus PPOs, except where otherwise noted. Find a Network Dentist To find a provider for either PPO, go online to www.MetLife.com, click on \"Find a Dentist,\" select your plan and enter your ZIP code. Individual and Family Annual Deductibles An individual annual deductible of $50 applies to restorative and major care. The plans pay for services for each individual once that person has met the $50 deductible. In addition, the plans will pay for services for all family members once the family's total expenses reach $150. Preventive care such as check-ups, cleanings and X-rays, and orthodontia are not subject to the annual deductible. Emergency Dental Care If you need emergency dental care, you are covered 24 hours a day, seven days a week, anywhere in the world. When a participating PPO dentist provides emergency services, your copay/coinsurance amount is based on a negotiated fee schedule. If a dentist outside the PPO network provides emergency care, the services will be subject to reasonable and customary charges as determined by MetLife. Covered emergency services may vary, based on state law. PPO Dental Plan Coverage Rules Replacement Rule: The replacement of, addition to or modification of existing dentures, crowns, casts or processed restorations, removable bridges or fixed bridgework is covered only if one of the following terms is met: The replacement or addition of teeth is required to replace one or more teeth extracted after the existing denture or bridgework was installed. Dental plan coverage must have been in force for the covered person when the extraction took place. The existing denture, crown, cast or processed restoration, removable bridge or bridgework cannot be made serviceable and was installed at least ten years under the PPO Dental Plans before its replacement and are not abutments to a partial denture, removable bridge or fixed bridge installed during the prior ten years under the PPO Dental Plans.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 82 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER DENT AL The existing denture is immediate and temporary to replace one or more natural teeth extracted while the person is covered and cannot be made permanent; replacement by a permanent denture is required. The replacement must take place within 12 months from the date of initial installation of the immediate temporary denture. Tooth Missing But Not Replaced Rule: Coverage for the first installation of removable dentures, removable bridges and fixed bridgework is subject to the requirements that such dentures, removable bridges and fixed bridgework are (a) needed to replace one or more natural teeth that were removed while this coverage was in force for the covered person; and (b) are not abutments to a partial denture, removable bridge or fixed bridge installed during the prior ten years under the PPO Dental Plans. Alternate Treatment Rule: If more than one service can be used to treat a covered person's dental condition, MetLife, as the Dental Claims Administrator, may decide to authorize coverage only for a less costly covered service provided that all of the following terms are met: The service must be listed on the Summary of Benefits, The service selected must be deemed by the dental profession to be an appropriate method of treatment, and The service selected must meet broadly accepted national standards of dental practice.If treatment is being given by a participating dental provider and the covered person asks for a more costly covered service than one for which coverage is approved, the specific copayment for such service will consist of: The copayment for the approved less costly service, and The difference in cost between the approved less costly service and the more costly covered service. No Guarantee of Results: All participant care and related decisions are the sole responsibility of participating providers. The insurance provider does not provide healthcare services and, therefore, cannot guarantee any results or outcomes. Right to Review: Participants on their own behalf or on behalf of a covered family member may request an independent medical review when the participant believes that healthcare services have been improperly denied, modified or delayed by a participating dentist.

Pre-treatment Estimate of Benefits If you expect charges for planned dental work to be $300 or more, you or your dentist can submit a written treatment plan outlining the results of the examination (including X-rays), the suggested treatment and estimated costs. This plan can be submitted on a standard claim form. The submission of a plan is at the discretion of you and your dentist. After the Dental Claims Administrator, reviews the plan and considers alternate procedures, you will receive a pre- treatment estimate of benefits stating how much the plan will pay. However, this pre-treatment estimate of benefits is not a guarantee of payment. The amount of benefits paid by the plan depends on how much of your deductible has been paid and your maximum benefit limits. Under the Alternate Benefit provision, benefits may be based on the cost of a service other than the service you choose. You are still required to submit proof once the dental service is completed for the plan to pay benefits.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 87 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER DENT ALFILING CLAIMS Claim forms are always required. In some cases, your dentist (if he or she participates in the PPO network) may file your claim form with the Dental Claims Administrator for you. If your dentist does not file the claim form for you, it is always your responsibility. When a claimant files a claim for Dental Insurance benefits described in this SPD, both the notice of claim and the required proof should be sent to us within 90 days of the date of a loss. To file a claim for dental benefits, each dental bill should include all of the following: Employee name Employee Social Security number Patient name Date of service Type of service received Appropriate ADA procedure codes Itemized charges Name and tax identification number of dentist performing the service If appropriate, other insurance Explanation of Benefit (EOB) statement Submit all claims to the address listed on your membership card. Plan benefits are paid directly to you unless you assigned payments to your dentist. After you submit a claim to the Dental Claims Administrator, the carrier will review your claim and notify you of its decision to approve or deny your claim. This notification will be provided to you within 15 business days from the date the carrier receives your completed claim, except for situations when the carrier requires an extension of up to 15 additional calendar days because of matters beyond its control. If the carrier needs an extension, you will be notified prior to the expiration of the initial 15-business-day period with the reason why the extension is needed and when the carrier will make its determination. If an extension is needed because you did not provide sufficient information or because you filed an incomplete claim, the time from the date of the notice requesting further information and an extension until the carrier receives the requested information does not count toward the time period for the claim decision. You will have 45 calendar days from the date you receive the notice to provide the requested information. If Your Claim Is Denied Disagreements about benefit eligibility of payment amounts can occasionally arise. In most cases, differences can be resolved quickly with a phone call. The Dental Plan is responsible for the actual coverage and the dental care provided or arranged. All appeals regarding coverage must be made directly to the Dental Claims Administrator.

Diabetic Eye Care Benefit Members who have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes are eligible to receive supplemental coverage for additional services from their vision Provider. With this benefit, you can obtain a vision evaluation every six months to monitor for signs of diabetic complications. Subject to provider determination and benefit frequency limitations, you may also receive the following diagnostic testing: retinal imaging, extended ophthalmoscopy, gonioscopy and laser scanning. If you have questions, please contact EyeMed's Customer Care Center. Availability of diagnostic equipment and services varies by location.

Contact Lenses Exam/Fitting Fee Most providers charge a fee for the fitting of contact lenses. This fee is separate from the comprehensive eye examination and varies depending on the provider's fee structure policies. It also varies due to circumstances or complexities involving the physiological condition of the eyes, the lens prescription and the type of lenses used. The Contact Lens Fit and Follow-Up visits are available once a comprehensive eye exam has been completed. See the schedule of benefits for a full description of the benefit. Refractive Surgery The plan offers a 15% off retail and 5% off the promotional price for LASIK when you use a contracted, in-network provider for these procedures.

PLAN HIGHLIGHTS Baylor Scott & White Health offers three flexible spending accounts: a Healthcare FSA, a Limited Purpose Healthcare FSA and a Dependent Care FSA. The type of Healthcare FSA available to you depends on which medical plan you elect. You can use the money in your Healthcare FSA or Limited Purpose Healthcare FSA to pay for eligible healthcare expenses for you, your dependents and your adult children to age 26, even if they are not covered under a healthcare plan. Eligible expenses include expenses not covered by the plan and copays. You can use the money in your Dependent Care FSA to pay for eligible child care expenses so you and your spouse (if married) can work. Your contributions to the FSAs are deducted from your paycheck before federal and Social Security taxes are deducted, so your taxable income is less. You should estimate your expenses very carefully. Any unused money remaining in either account after the end of the grace period (typically, March 15th of the following year) is forfeited. For information on additional benefit programs or details, see the Administrative & General Information section or individual benefit sections. HOW THE ACCOUNTS WORK Each of the accounts works basically the same way. You decide how much to contribute and contributions are deducted from your paycheck on a pre-tax basis each pay period. Then you use the money in your account to reimburse yourself for eligible expenses. YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS Contributions are deducted in equal amounts from 26 paychecks each year. Because contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, the average participating employee saves 15 to 28 cents on every $1 contributed. When you are hired or become eligible to receive benefits, the FSA contributions you elect are deducted from your paycheck beginning with the first available paycheck after your enrollment is effective. These contributions are made before federal income and Social Security taxes are withheld.Once you choose to participate in an FSA, your contributions will be in effect for the rest of the calendar year unless you have a qualifying event. In this case, you may enroll or change the amount of your contribution. For more information on qualifying events, see the A Guide to Your Benefits section. Go to www.optumbank.com to track your reimbursements and check your balances. UNUSED CONTRIBUTIONS Your expenses must be incurred during the plan year (January 1 through December 31). If you have an unused balance in your FSA at year-end, you may submit additional covered expenses incurred during the 2 1/2-month grace period from January 1 through March 15 of the following year. Any expense you incur during this grace period will be applied to use up your remaining account balance from the prior year. Any amount remaining in your FSA for the prior year after payment of allowable expenses incurred during the grace period will be forfeited. Forfeitures are used to help offset the plans' administrative expenses. All plan year and grace period claims must be submitted by the end of the run out period, typically April 30. TRANSFERRING CONTRIBUTIONS Your contributions to your Healthcare FSA and Dependent Care FSA are administered separately and cannot be transferred from one account to another. How To Use the FSAs 1. Choose how much to contribute. Estimate your total healthcare and/or dependent care expenses for the upcoming year. Contributions are deducted from your paycheck in equal amounts throughout the year and are deposited to the appropriate FSA. 2. Enroll during annual enrollment, within 30 days of hire or within 30 days of a qualifying event. You cannot change your contribution amount after the initial deduction has been made, unless you have a qualifying event. Changes must correspond with the qualifying event. 3. Pay as you go and keep your receipts. You'll pay a copay or coinsurance at the time of service, then pay yourself back with pre-tax dollars. 4. Get reimbursed. You have several ways to file for reimbursement, depending on the type of expense. See page 99 for more information.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 94 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER FSAHow an FSA Can Save You Money Since your FSA contributions are deducted from your paycheck before you pay federal income and Social Security taxes, participating in the FSAs reduces the amount you pay in taxes.Suppose you make $30,000 a year and contribute $5,000 to a Dependent Care FSA throughout the year to pay for child care.

Special Rules for the Medical HSA The Healthcare FSA has a grace period from January 1 to March 15 to use funds remaining in the Healthcare FSA at the end of the calendar year. If you newly enroll in the HSA option and you have funds remaining in a General Purpose Healthcare FSA from the prior year, you cannot contribute to an HSA until April 1st. For the 2021 plan year, which has a 12-month grace period from January 1 to December 31, if you newly enroll in the HSA option and you have funds remaining in a General Purpose Healthcare FSA from the prior year, you cannot contribute to an HSA until the extended grace period has run. Eligible Expenses In general, you may use a General Purpose Healthcare FSA for any expenses that qualify as medical deductions on your federal income tax return. You may use a Limited Purpose Healthcare FSA for any dental and vision expenses that qualify as medical deductions on your federal income tax return until you meet your deductible. In addition to deductible medical expenses, you may also use a Healthcare FSA for the following medical expenses: Medical supplies, such as bandages, first aid kits, athletic braces, and diabetic supplies (a prescription is not necessary), Beginning with expenses incurred after December 31, 2019, certain over-the-counter medications and menstrual care products, and Beginning with expenses incurred on or after January 1, 2020, amounts paid for personal protective equipment, such as masks, hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes, for the primary purpose of preventing the spread of COVID-19. The services must be received in the same year in which you made the account contribution, or during the grace period, typically March 15 of the following year. Also, you cannot use the Healthcare FSA for expenses you had before you began participating in the account or after your participation stops, unless you continue coverage under COBRA on an after-tax basis. Generally, expenses not paid by your insurance, such as deductibles, coinsurance, charges above recognized charges, etc., are eligible for reimbursement under your Healthcare FSA.

To qualify for reimbursement, the care must be necessary to allow you to work. If you are married, this means you must work and your spouse must work outside the home, attend school full time or be disabled.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 99 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER FSAAnnual Contribution Limit Minimum Maximum $100 Lesser of: $5,000 ($2,500 if you are married and file separate tax returns) Your earned income or your spouse's earned income The Dependent Care FSA limits are set by the federal government. If you participate in the Dependent Care FSA, you must make sure you comply with these federal limits. You may be responsible for additional taxes if your Dependent Care FSA contributions exceed these federal limits. Changing Your Contributions When you enroll in the Dependent Care FSA, your contribution election is effective for the rest of the calendar year, so plan your expenses carefully. You may change your participation only if you have a qualifying event (as described in the A Guide to Your Benefits section). Dependents Eligible dependents include: A dependent child under age 13 if you claim him or her as a deduction on your federal income tax return Your spouse who is physically or mentally unable to care for himself or herself and lives with you for more than half the year Other dependents of any age if they are physically or mentally unable to care for themselves and live with you for more than half the year To qualify, you must pay more than half the cost of these dependents' support and claim them as dependents on your federal income tax return. Tax Deduction Day care expenses may qualify you for a tax credit on your income tax return. You don't have to itemize expenses on your income tax return to qualify for the tax credit. You cannot claim the tax credit and be reimbursed from your Dependent Care FSA for the same expenses. However, if your day care expenses are more than the available tax credit, you may be able to use both the tax credit and the Dependent Care FSA. In general, it's more advantageous for you to use the Dependent Care FSA rather than a tax credit. If you participate in the Dependent Care FSA, you must file Form 2441 with your federal income 1040 tax return. Please see IRS Publication 503. To understand how these tax issues may affect you, you should consult a financial planner.Eligible Expenses In general, dependent day care expenses must be for the well- being and protection of an eligible dependent. The care must be needed to allow you and your spouse to work or look for work (or allow you to work if your spouse is a full-time student or disabled). Here are some other qualifications for eligible expenses: Care may be provided in your home, someone else's home or at a day care facility The care provider can be a relative who is age 19 or older, as long as this person is not also considered your dependent Care provided outside your home qualifies if the eligible dependent regularly spends at least eight hours a day in your home (i.e., nursing home expenses are not eligible) Education expenses qualify if your child is not yet in kindergarten, and the amount of education expense is incidental and cannot be separated from the cost of caring for your child Before- and after-school care for children in kindergarten and higher grades Specialized day camp programs (music, soccer, etc.) Cost of transportation provided by a day care center or care provider, when itemized separately on the invoice, to and from where the care is provided Indirect expenses related to receiving the care (i.e., application fees, deposits and agency fees).

Child Life Insurance is $10,000 per child for each of your eligible children. If you become terminally ill, you may be able to receive part of your life insurance benefit while you are still living. See the Accelerated Death Benefit section for more information. LIFE INSURANCE FOR YOU Participating If you're a regular, full-time employee or a part-time employee regularly scheduled to work at least 20 hours per week, you are immediately eligible to enroll in life insurance coverage. You may also cover your spouse and eligible dependent children under the plan. See the A Guide to Your Benefits section for more details about who can and cannot participate in the plan. When you are hired or become eligible for benefits, you are automatically enrolled in Basic Life coverage. You may purchase additional coverage through the Voluntary Life program. You must elect Voluntary Life coverage within 30 days from the date of your employment or if later, the date of your initial eligibility. If you do not elect the coverage by the deadline date, you must wait until the next annual enrollment period to enroll in the plan, unless you experience a qualifying event. If you are not actively at work due to a physical or mental condition on the day your coverage would normally become effective, coverage for you and your dependents starts as soon as you have been at work for one full day. Each year during annual enrollment, you may change your coverage for the next calendar year. The election you make is effective the following Jan. 1 and remains in effect for the entire year. You cannot make changes to your elections during the year unless you experience a qualifying event. See the A Guide to Your Benefits section for more information about enrolling, qualifying events and when coverage begins and ends. PAYING FOR COVERAGE Your cost for coverage depends on the options you choose. Baylor Scott & White Health pays the full cost of Basic Life coverage but you pay the cost for Voluntary Life coverage. Prices may change each year. When you enroll, your share of the cost for coverage will be deducted from your paycheck beginning with the first available paycheck after you enroll. Your cost is generally deducted from each paycheck during the year and is deducted on an after-tax basis.

It does not include income received from commissions, bonuses, overtime pay, shift differential or any other extra compensation, or income received from sources other than your Employer. If you are a commissioned employee with one or more years of service, \"Annual Base Pay\" also includes income actually received from commissions. Commissions are calculated for the period 9/1-8/31 of the previous year immediately prior to the date of loss.

PLAN HIGHLIGHTS If you enroll in the STD benefit timely, you will be eligible for STD benefits as of your hire date. STD benefits begin after you have been absent from work for a non-occupational illness, injury or pregnancy for seven consecutive calendar days. You become eligible for LTD benefits after you have been disabled (as defined by the plan) for 180 consecutive days. Benefits may continue for as long as you remain totally disabled (as defined by the plan) up to normal retirement age. See the chart on page 117. Baylor Scott & White Health pays the full cost of Basic LTD coverage and you are automatically enrolled as of your hire date. In addition to the Company paid Basic LTD benefit, you may purchase Voluntary STD coverage and/or Voluntary LTD buy-up coverage. You pay the full cost of both voluntary disability plans. Voluntary LTD buy-up is paid on an after-tax basis and STD benefits are paid pre-tax. SHORT-TERM DISABILITY (STD) Short-Term Disability (STD) coverage provides income replacement if you suffer a non-work related injury, illness or pregnancy that prevents you from performing the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation for more than seven consecutive calendar days. STD benefits are payable for up to 180 calendar days as long as you continue to be disabled. The date you are considered disabled is the first missed scheduled date of work due to a \"disability\" as defined by this Plan. For purposes of this plan, \"disabled\" means you are: Continuously unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation as a direct result of a non-work related injury, illness or pregnancy Unable to earn more than 80% of your covered earnings from working in your regular occupation Receiving appropriate care and treatment for your condition from a licensed medical provider, and Not working for pay in any occupation for an employer, other than Baylor Scott & White, for which you are or become qualified by education, training or experience. If you are required to have a professional license or certification for your occupation, loss of the professional license or certification does not by itself qualify as a disability. Who Can Participate See the A Guide to Your Benefits section for information about who can and cannot participate in the plan. Benefit Amount and Overview Your benefit amount will vary based on the benefit plan for which you are eligible, after you have satisfied a seven consecutive calendar day elimination period.

The benefit will begin as of the child's date of birth assuming the seven consecutive calendar day elimination period has already been met and will continue for up to five(5) weeks, which will count toward the 180 calendar day maximum entitlement under the STD Plan, should additional maternity disability time be required. Eligible employees may not receive more than 100% of the base salary when the maternity and the short-term disability plan and long-term disability plan benefits are added together. ** An employee must have elected STD coverage and be enrolled in the plan before the date of birth or placement in order to be eligible for the Parental and Adoption leave benefits. The parental leave is only appli - cable to the non-birthing parent of the newborn and the adoption leave is only applicable to the adoptive parent who legally adopts a child (not biologically related to either parent) under the age of 18. Time must be taken all at once on a continuous basis, and employees will be required to satisfy a seven (7) consecutive calendar day elimination period before any paid benefit is issued. Employees may use the benefit within the first twelve (12) months of the child's birth or adoption. When STD Benefits Begin and How They Are Paid You are eligible to begin receiving STD benefits on the eighth consecutive calendar day that you are disabled. For any work you miss during the first seven consecutive calendar days you are disabled, you must use your Paid Time Off (PTO) benefit. You will only be paid during this seven day period to the extent of your unused PTO up to your standard hours. If PTO is not available or exhausted, this time may be absent without pay. STD benefits are paid through the Baylor Scott & White Health time and attendance system for each scheduled day approved. If you are eligible for benefits for only part of a work week, your benefits will be prorated based on your work schedule reported at the time of your claim. These benefits are taxable when you receive them assuming you elected the STD coverage. If you receive an STD benefit less than 100% of your base pay, you are required to supplement that STD benefit with any available PTO. When Benefits End Your STD benefit payments end at the earliest of: The date you are no longer disabled as defined by the plan The date you fail to provide satisfactory proof of your continuing disability The date you are no longer under the continuing care of a doctor The end of the 180-day benefit period (which includes a seven calendar day waiting period prior to the commencement of benefits) The date the Plan is canceled The date You are no longer an eligible regular Full-Time Staff Member or Part-Time Staff Member The last day you are in active employment, or Your death If you are still disabled after 180 days, you may be eligible to continue receiving disability payments through the Long-Term Disability (LTD) plan. See page 116 for more information.Disability Payments from Other Sources Your STD plan is one of several sources that could pay benefits while you're disabled. Your STD benefit from this plan is based on your pre-disability weekly base pay, less any other sources of income you receive. It works together with other sources to replace 60% of the base weekly pay you were earning before you became disabled. This means that benefits you receive from the following sources may be deducted from your gross weekly STD benefit: Baylor Scott & White Health Safe Choice Social Security Disability and Retirement benefits, including any benefit for which your dependents are eligible due to your disability or retirement Veterans Administration An occupational disease act or law Pay you receive from a rehabilitation program or modified work duty program No-fault auto motor vehicle coverage Any other state or government agency providing similar benefits Compensation you receive if you suffer a disability because of the act or omission of a Third Party* *What are Baylor Scott & White's subrogation rights? If You: 1. suffer a Disability because of the act or omission of a Third Party; 2. become entitled to and are paid benefits under The Plan in compensation for lost wages; and 3. do not initiate legal action for the recovery of such benefits from the Third Party in a reasonable period of time; then We will be subrogated to any rights you may have against the Third Party and may, at our option, bring legal action against the Third Party to recover any payments made by us in con - nection with the Disability What Is Not Covered The STD plan does not pay benefits for a disability that results from: A cause other than an injury, sickness or pregnancy War or an act of war, insurrection or rebellion, whether declared or undeclared Service in the armed forces of any country, except for membership in the reserves or a call to active duty for a period of less than three months Commission of or attempt to commit a felony in the jurisdiction in which the act occurred Active participation in a riot Intentionally self-inflicted injury or illness, or attempted suicide, whether sane or insane Cosmetic surgery, except to correct congenital deformities or to treat a condition that results from injury or sickness (except where disability benefits are mandated by applicable law)Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 114 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER DISABILITY Conditions that are not supported by objective medical findings, including tests, investigational treatments, procedures and clinical exams not generally accepted as standard medical practice for the disabling condition A disability for which you are not receiving appropriate care and treatment from a medical provider Working for another employer or from self-employment On-the-job injury or illness while you are working for Baylor Scott & White Health and all of its subsidiaries Pre-Existing Conditions. If You Have a Pre-Existing Condition: Benefits will not be payable under the STD Plan for any disability that results from or is caused or contributed to by a pre-existing condition. You have a pre-existing condition if: You received medical treatment, medical advice, care or services including diagnostic measures, or took prescribed drugs or medicines in the three (3) months just prior to your effective date of coverage and the disability begins in the first 12 months after your effective date of coverage. You are exempt from limitations due to a pre-existing condition if you enroll in the plan within 30 days of hire or eligibility or were enrolled in the plan prior to 1/1/2019. What if you have a work-related injury or illness? The STD plan does not cover a work-related injury or illness. Disability due to a work-related injury or illness is covered by Baylor Scott & White Health Safe Choice. If you are approved for STD and you also receive benefits from Baylor Scott & White Health Safe Choice, or any other occupational disease act or law for the same disability, those benefits will offset your STD benefit, unless you are required to repay them and you do repay them. If there is uncertainty about whether your illness or injury is work-related, you may receive STD benefits while your claim is being evaluated, but if your claim is ultimately determined to be work- related and you receive work-related benefits, you must repay any STD benefits you received.If Your Disability Recurs If during the first six months after the end of the initial disability period you return to work and within less than 30 consecutive calendar days experience a relapse of the same medical condition for which you were previously receiving STD benefits, you will not have to complete another waiting period; benefits will resume immediately and your current disability will be treated as a continuation of the same claim, subject to the same 180- day maximum period payable. If you experience a relapse 30 days or more after you return to work, your current disability will be treated as a new claim with a new waiting period and a new 180-day maximum period payable. After six months from the end of the initial disability period, any disability that occurs within less than 30 consecutive calendar days (whether or not related to the prior disability) will be eligible for STD benefits only if you are disabled for longer than the waiting period of seven consecutive calendar days. If you experience a second disability that is unrelated to your prior disability and you return to work (full-time or part-time) for less than one full day, it will be treated as part of your previous disability and you will not be required to complete another waiting period. However, if you return to work for a full day or more, it will be considered a new disability and you will have to complete a new waiting period for benefits. Postponing Enrollment If you do not elect STD coverage when you are first eligible, you will have to wait until the next annual enrollment period or when you have a qualifying status change. In addition, you will be subject to the pre-existing condition exclusion, as defined in the \"What Is Not Covered\" section of this plan. Filing Claims To receive STD benefits in a timely manner, it's important to follow these steps: 1. Contact your manager immediately as soon as you know you will be absent from work. All department absence policies remain in effect while you receive STD benefits. 2.

You have a Voluntary LTD coverage option which replaces an additional 10% of your pay. You pay the full cost of any Voluntary LTD coverage you elect.

If your LTD benefit is overpaid for any reason, the insurance company will determine how the overpayment is to be repaid. In this case, you will receive a form from the insurance company stating the reason for overpayment, the payment amount and the method for repayment.What does it mean to be \"Disabled\"? For executives You are disabled when the insurance company determines that: you are limited from performing the material and substantial duties of your regular occupation due to your sickness or injury; and you have a 20% or more loss in your indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury The loss of a professional or occupational license or certification does not, in itself, constitute disability. For physicians You are disabled when the insurance company determines that either: you test positive for an Infectious Disease and solely as a result of the positive results, you are restricted by a state licensing board, other governing board, or your Employer's written employment policy from performing the material duties of your regular occupation or you are required to disclose your status to patients before performing certain procedures; and you have a 20% or more loss in your indexed monthly earnings due to the same positive results. Or: you are limited from performing the material and substantial duties of your specialty and sub specialty occupation due to your sickness or injury; and you have a 20% or more loss in your indexed monthly earnings due to the same sickness or injury The loss of a professional or occupational license or certification does not, in itself, constitute disability.

After 24 months of payments, you are disabled when the insurance company determines that due to the same sickness or injury, you are unable to perform the duties of any gainful occupation for which you are reasonably fitted by education, training or experience. The loss of a professional or occupational license or certification does not, in itself, constitute disability.Baylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 118 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER DISABILITYTaxes on Your Benefits Baylor Scott & White Health pays for your Basic LTD, which means you will pay income and Social Security taxes on any Basic LTD payments you receive. However, you pay the cost of Voluntary LTD on an after-tax basis. This means that you will not pay income or Social Security taxes on the Voluntary LTD portion of your benefit payment. When Payments End Benefits will end on the earliest of the following dates: 1. The date the Employee earns from any occupation, more than the percentage of Indexed Earnings set forth in the definition of Disability applicable to him or her at that time; 2. The date the Insurance Company determines he or she is not Disabled; 3. The end of the Maximum Benefit Period; 4. The date the Employee dies; 5. The date the Employee is no longer receiving Appropriate Care; 6. The date the Employee fails to cooperate with the Insurance Company in the administration of the claim.

If You Have More Than One Period of Disability You will not have to satisfy another 180-day waiting period if you recover from a disability after the waiting period, return to work and the same or a related disability recurs within six months of your return-to-work date. If you recover from your disability, return to work and have a new disability, this second condition will be treated separately. LTD benefits will begin after a new 180-day waiting period. Disability Payments from Other Sources Your LTD plan is one of several sources that could pay benefits while you're disabled. Your LTD benefit from this plan is based on the definition of \"current salary\", less any other sources of income you receive. It works together with other sources to replace your core benefit of 50% or 60%, as well as the additional 10%, of the pay you were earning before you became disabled if you have opted to enroll in the Voluntary LTD. The insurance company has the right to require proof that you, your spouse and dependent children have filed for all other income benefits for which you or they may be eligible. You will also be required to provide proof of any income you receive from any work while receiving disability payments. New York Life Group Benefit Solutions does not provide formal written notice that the employee does not need to apply for Social Security Disability Benefits. The employee would apply through our vendor advocacy service that provides New York Life Group Benefit Solutions updates on the status of the SSDI claim. The cases where an employee will not need to apply are: expected to return to work within a nine-month time frame, working part time and exceeding the maximum SSDI wage allowance per month, will reach full retirement age within 6 months, or they didn't meet the quarters earned to be eligible for SSDI. New York Life Group Benefit Solutions will refer the employee to apply for SSDI if something changes in their status by reaching out to them and starting the referral process so they can apply. If you do not provide proof of other income sources, the insurance company may suspend or adjust benefits by an estimated amount. This means that benefits you receive from the following sources may be deducted from your monthly LTD benefit: Any amounts received (or assumed to be received) by the employee or their dependents under: -the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans; -the Railroad Retirement act; -any local, state, provincial or federal government disability or retirement plan or law payable for Injury or sickness provided as a result of employment with the Employer; -any sick leave or salary continuation plan of the Employer; -any work loss provision in mandatory \"No-Fault\" auto insurance any Social Security disability or retirement benefits the Employee or any third party receives (or is assumed to receive*) on his or her own behalf or for his or her dependents; or which his or her dependents receive (or are assumed to receive*) because of his or her entitlement to such benefits any Retirement Plan benefits funded by the Employer. \"Retirement Plan\" means any defined benefit or defined contribution plan sponsored or funded by the Employer. It does not include an individual deferred compensation agreement; a profit sharing or any other retirement or savings plan maintained in addition to a defined benefit or other defined contribution pension plan, or any employee savings plan including a thrift, stock option or stock bonus plan, individual retirement account or 40l(k) plan any proceeds payable under any group insurance or similar plan. If other insurance applies to the same claim for Disability, and contains the same or similar provision for reduction because of other insurance, the Insurance Company will pay for its pro rata share of the total claim. \"Pro rata share\" means the proportion of the total benefit that the amount payable under one policy, without other insurance, bears to the total benefits under all such policiesBaylor Scott & White Health Summary Plan Descriptions - Health & Welfare Page 119 INTRO ADMIN MEDICAL DENT AL VISION FSA LIFE ACCIDENT DISABILITY OTHER DISABILITY any amounts received (or assumed to be received) by the Employee or his or her dependents under any workers' compensation, occupational disease, unemployment compensation law or similar state or federal law payable for Injury or Sickness arising out of work with the Employer, including all permanent and temporary disability benefits. This includes any damages, compromises or settlement paid in place of such benefits, whether or not liability is admitted any amounts paid because of loss of earnings or earning capacity through settlement, judgment,arbitration or otherwise, where a third party may be liable, regardless of whether liability is determined It is your responsibility to contact the insurance company if there is a change in your disability income from other sources or if your dependents' Social Security benefits change. Estimating Other Benefits Unless you have completed and returned a reimbursement agreement to the insurance company regarding payments from other sources, the insurance company will estimate any other benefits it believes you are eligible to receive. Then, your payment from this plan is adjusted based on that estimated amount. You will be reimbursed for any underpayment in your monthly benefit that results from this process. You are required to repay any overpayment as well. If you do not, the insurance company has the right to pursue legal action to recover the overpayment. You are responsible for the insurance company's legal fees and court costs if the court finds in the insurance company's favor. If you are paid other income benefits in a lump sum or settlement, you must provide proof satisfactory to the insurance company of: The amount attributed to loss of income, and The period of time covered by the lump sum or settlement. The insurance company will pro-rate the lump sum or settlement over this period of time. If you cannot or do not provide this information, the insurance company will assume the entire sum to be for loss of income, and the time period to be 24 months. The insurance company may make a retroactive allocation of any other retroactive income benefit. A retroactive allocation may result in an overpayment of your claim, which would require you to repay the amount of the overpayment you received.LTD Benefit Payment Examples Example 1: In this example, let's assume you have Basic LTD coverage only and you earn $30,000 annually, or $2,500 per month ($30,000 \u00f7 12 months = $2,500). Let's assume you are also eligible for a Social Security disability benefit equal to $600 per month. Here's how your monthly benefit from Baylor Scott & White Health is calculated: Monthly pay $2,500 LTD plan replacement percentage x 50% Total replacement amount $1250 Social Security disability payment - $600 Total LTD benefit from the insurance company $ 650 Example 2: Assume you elected Voluntary LTD coverage with the extra 10% benefit (60% total income replacement when combined with Basic LTD) and earn $48,000 annually ($4,000 monthly). You are eligible for a $1,000 monthly benefit from Social Security disability. Here's how your monthly benefit from is calculated: Monthly pay $4,000 LTD plan replacement percentage x 60% Total replacement amount $2,400 Social Security disability payment - $1,000 Total LTD benefit from the insurance company $1,400 What Is Not Covered and Limitations on Benefits Certain events (listed below) may affect your LTD benefit amount. If You Have a Pre-Existing Condition Benefits will not be payable under the Basic or Voluntary LTD Policy for any disability that results from, or is caused or contributed to by a pre-existing condition.
