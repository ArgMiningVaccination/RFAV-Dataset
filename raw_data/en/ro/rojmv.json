I suggest you call before you make the trip as many locations have sold out of product. As you are reaching out to these companies, please be patient. They are also being inundated with orders and inquiries, and will serve you as quickly as they possibly can. When purchasing products online or in stores, do not purchase a product if you cannot see and review the Supplement Facts Panel and the list of Ingredients. For ingredients, there should be ONLY pure green coffee bean extract and a vegetarian capsule. There should be ZERO fillers, zero binders and zero artificial ingredients, do not purchase products that contain these common ingredients listed in a section called 'other ingredients' and are of no benefit and only reduce the amount of pure green coffee extract that you are getting: - Maltodextrine - Calcium Carbonate - Microcrystalline Cellulose - Gelatin (sourced from animal skin and bones) - Magnesium Stearate - Silica Additionally, I would caution consumers to be very weary of websites with fake testimonials from paid product reviewers who have never used the product. Our research has unveiled companies that are capitalizing and attempting to make money from innocent consumers who are seeking pure green coffee bean extract. These websites claim to offer 'PURE' product; however its product actually contains numerous fillers and binders as well as gelatin capsules. Additionally, some of these companies have gone so far as to use my name and likeness without my permission as well as Dr. Oz' name and likeness without his permission, they have taken content from my blog and website to promote their product, and my team's research has shown that some of them have even paid women to 'review' their impure products that they have never even tried and claim that they have seen results! Do not trust these websites. Always be weary of overly attractive models and claims that seem too good to be true. My mission is to make the world a healthier place by educating on natural health and wellness and to make affordable healthy, all-natural products available and accessible for everyone. It is unfortunate that when the natural, medical or scientific community uncovers one of Nature's most incredible natural secrets that has the potential to make a significant impact and improve the lives of millions of people around the world - that so many scammers and marketeers jump on the bandwagon with only the mission to take advantage of innocent consumers who are searching for hope and seeking to improve their health and happiness.\" With over 28 years of clinical experience naturopathic doctor and celebrity nutritionist, Dr. Lindsey Duncan is often called the \" [Indiana Jones of Medicine](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DR7TgSj_WsME%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&esheet=50265845&lan=en-US&anchor=Indiana+Jones+of+Medicine&index=10&md5=af68a87f442d49ec245665bf947f4e82),\" and is one of the world's leading experts on superfoods, herbal medicine, natural remedies and natural health.
