Over vaccination of our beautiful pets has become a hot topic and although this isn't an area we would normally cover, we've got our awesome vet, Dr Nick to give us his thoughts on the subject and to hopefully address some of the more common questions that keep popping up. This article gets a bit technical but if you're skimming whilst enjoying a quick coffee break then pop on down to the notes section to get the scoop. If you're not already familiar with Dr Nick and know he's the bee's knees, he is a fully trained vet with over 30 years of experience. He is trained in homeopathy, [acupuncture](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/acupuncture-for-pets) , natural nutrition and veterinary herbal medicine. He has special interests in immunology, chronic disease, internal medicine in all species and Autism spectrum behavior in dogs and horses. Over to you Dr Nick... Thank you. By Nick Thompson BSc.(Hons) Path.Sci., BVM&S, VetMFHom, MRCVS. I've included a copy of The Executive Summary on Canine and Feline vaccination from the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA). WSAVA is the highest level of expertise in the veterinary world. It's worth reading as it covers the guidelines for the vaccination of dogs and cats that have global application and it indicates the scientific evidence on which the recommendations are based. At the end, I've put a few explanatory notes to clarify what the experts are saying and how this applies to you as the pet owner. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - The WSAVA Vaccination Guidelines Group (VGG) You can read the full article on the [vaccination guidelines](http://www.wsava.org/guidelines/vaccination-guidelines) but here is an extract of the summary: The WSAVA Vaccination Guidelines Group (VGG) was convened in order to develop guidelines for the vaccination of dogs and cats that have global application. The first version of these guidelines was published in 2007 and they were updated in 2010. The present document provides an updated and expanded version of these international guidelines for the vaccination of small companion animals and indicates the scientific evidence base on which the recommendations are made. The VGG recognises that the keeping of pet small animals is subject to significant variation in practice and associated economics throughout the world and that vaccination recommendations that might apply to a developed country may not be appropriate for a developing country. These guidelines are not a mandatory edict, but rather should be used by national associations and individual veterinary practices to develop vaccination schedules relevant to the local situation. However, the VGG strongly recommends that wherever possible ALL dogs and cats receive the benefit of vaccination. This not only protects the individual animal, but provides optimum 'herd immunity' that minimizes the likelihood of infectious disease outbreaks. With this background in mind, the VGG has defined core vaccines as those which ALL dogs and cats, regardless of circumstances or geographical location, should receive. Core vaccines protect animals from severe, lifethreatening diseases that have global distribution. - Core vaccines for dogs are those that protect against canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus (CAV) and the variants of canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV2) - Core vaccines for cats are those that protect against feline parvovirus (FPV), feline calicivirus (FCV) and feline herpesvirus1 (FHV1). - In areas of the world where rabies virus infection is endemic, vaccination against this agent should be considered core for both species, even if there is no legal requirement for routine vaccination. The VGG recognizes that maternally derived antibody (MDA) significantly interferes with the efficacy of most current core vaccines administered to pups and kittens in early life. As the level of MDA varies significantly among litters, the VGG recommends the administration of multiple core vaccine doses to pups and kittens, with the final dose of these being delivered at 16 weeks or older or above and then followed by a booster at 6 or 12months of age. In cultural or financial situations where a pet animal may only be permitted the benefit of a single vaccination, that vaccination should be with core vaccines at 16 weeks of age or older. The VGG supports the use of simple inpractice tests for determination of seroconversion to the core vaccine components (CDV, CAV, CPV2 and FPV) following vaccination, for determination of seroprotection in adult dogs and for management of infectious disease outbreaks in shelters. Vaccines should not be given needlessly. Core vaccines should not be given any more frequently than every three years after the 6 or 12month booster injection following the puppy/kitten series, because the duration of immunity (DOI) is many years and may be up to the lifetime of the pet. The VGG has defined noncore vaccines as those that are required by only those animals whose geographical location, local environment or lifestyle places them at risk of contracting specific infections. The VGG has also classified some vaccines as not recommended (where there is insufficient scientific evidence to justify their use) and has not considered a number of minority products which have restricted geographical availability or application. The VGG strongly supports the concept of regular (usually annual) health checks which removes the emphasis from, and client expectation of, annual revaccination. The annual health check may still encompass administration of selected noncore vaccines which should be administered annually, as the DOI for these products is generally 1 year. The VGG has considered the use of vaccines in the shelter environment, again recognizing the particular circumstances of such establishments and the financial constraints under which they sometimes operate. The VGG minimum shelter guidelines are simple: that all dogs and cats entering such an establishment should be vaccinated before, or at the time of entry, with core vaccines. Where finances permit, repeated core vaccines should be administered as per the schedules defined in the guidelines and noncore vaccines against respiratory disease may be included. The VGG recognizes the importance of adverse reaction reporting schemes, but understands that these are variably developed in different countries. Wherever possible, veterinarians should be actively encouraged to report all possible adverse events to the manufacturer and/or regulatory authority to expand the knowledge base that drives development of improved vaccine safety. These fundamental concepts proposed by the VGG may be encapsulated in the following statement: We should aim to vaccinate every animal with core vaccines. Noncore vaccines should be given no more frequently than is deemed necessary. Notes from the Guidelines There are basically two classes of vaccinations. 1) Core vaccinations 2) Non-Core Vaccinations. I've bullet pointed what I consider to be the main areas with the aim of making it as clear as possible to the non-veterinary eye. What Are \"Core Vaccines\"? - Canine Core vaccines (to Distemper, Adenovirus 1 and 2, Parvovirus) should be given to all puppies. - Feline Core vaccines (to Feline Parvo/Panleucopenia virus, Feline Herpes virus and Feline Calici virus) should be given to all kittens. - 'Seroconversion' (as mentioned above) is where the body produces antibodies in the blood/serum in response to vaccination or infection. - Pups and kittens should receive 'multiple core vaccines', at four weekly intervals, with the final dose being at or after 16 weeks of age. - If only one multiple vaccine can be given to pups or kittens, this must be given at or after 16 weeks of age. - All animals should receive a booster of core vaccines at 6-12 months old OR dogs should be Titer tested (a blood sample taken to determine antibody levels to the core diseases). - Core vaccines given to pups and kittens after 16 weeks old have a 'duration of immunity' (how long they last) of many years and may be up to the lifetime of the cat or dog. - In the UK, repeating core vaccines every three years is common, but may be considered excessive given the possible lifetime immunity from puppy/kitten shots. - Titer testing is becoming more common in dogs. Some dogs and cats may not need any core vaccination after their initial vaccination. - All pets should have an annual health check. What Are \"Non-Core Vaccines\"? - Canine non-core vaccines: Canine coronavirus and Canine Leptospirosis vaccine and Rabies vaccine. Coronavirus and Leptospirosis vaccines are present in the \u00d3ctuple vaccine in Argentina. - Feline non-core vaccines: FeLV vaccine, Feline Chlamydia vaccine, FIV vaccine, FIP vaccine. These should be considered depending on the lifestyle of your cat (e.g. indoor/outdoor cat) - Canine coronavirus on its own generally causes mild disease. However, if a pup is infected with both Coronavirus and Parvovirus, the disease is much worse than if the pup had Parvovirus alone. - Canine Coronavirus is recommended for puppies and show dogs. - Canine Leptospirosis is a fatal infectious disease restricted to certain geographical locations. Pups and dogs in these high incidence areas (ask your vet if you are in a high incidence area) should be vaccinated if their lifestyle (regular access to rat contaminated water) means they come into contact with highly infectious material. - Canine Leptospirosis vaccination duration of immunity is approximately one year. Vaccination must be repeated annually. There is no valid Titer Test for Leptospirosis vaccine. - Rabies vaccine is mandatory in Argentina. - In the UK, Nobivac Rabies vaccine is given after three months of age and every 3 years thereafter. General Notes - Minimal vaccination (as recommended in the WSAVA Guidelines above), will offer protection from the diseases covered. - It could be argued that using the \u00d3ctuple vaccine is most appropriate for puppies and show dogs and the S\u00e9xtuple vaccine for all other dogs if they need any vaccination at all. - Vaccinations stimulate the [immune system.](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/improve-your-pets-immune-system-with-this-recipes) Some veterinarians believe that giving unnecessary vaccinations can contribute to [auto-immune disease](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/auto-immune-diseases-in-pets) such as long standing allergic skin and gut problems, even [cancer](https://authenticapets.com/en/blog/cancer-dogs-cats). If your animal has any problem that does not clear up quickly take veterinary advice. Equally seek veterinary advice for serious acute problems. - The WSAVA recommends reporting all possible adverse vaccination events to the manufacturer and the regulatory authority in your country. - Homeopathic vets often give Thuja 30c, once, the day before and after any vaccination. Some give a homeopathic potency of the vaccine to be injected before and after any vaccination to help neutralise any side effects from the vaccinations. My Own Observations and Thoughts Historically we vets as a profession, used to over-vaccinate. Modern immunology and lab tests have allowed us to be more targeted and specific in our vaccination protocols. Many vets are suspicious of titer testing, stating that it can only measure antibodies, half the immune system and we are blind to the cellular side of the system. This is true, but if one has a choice of vaccinating blind, possibly immune animals, or titer testing, then I think titre testing is better medical protocol. Re-vaccinating an animal with existing vaccine immunity makes no difference at all to the immune status of the animal. i.e. the animal's immune system mops up the vaccine before it can 'boost' the immune system. I believe most booster vaccinations for cats and dogs are, at best useless, and at worst may contribute to immunologic disease including auto-immune disease, food hypersensitivities and atopic dermatitis and other itching skin diseases. I believe we should protect our animals, but do as much as we can to avoid over-vaccination. I believe vigilance in the local area (asking vets in your area, finding government disease statistics and asking local dog groups) will give a good idea of local threats. This should guide you as to the best vaccines to choose. The WSAVA state that core vaccines, if given after 16 weeks of age to pups and kittens can give lifelong protection. They also state the practice of 're-starting' vaccines if you are late for annual vaccinations 'is inconsistent with fundamental immune system function and the principles of immunological memory'. Quote from WSAVA. I do not vaccinate my animals, but might if there was a significant known threat to a specific disease. I do not vaccinate my children, but might if there was a significant known threat to a specific disease. NOW, we'd love to hear your feedback. Are you over-vaccinating your pet?
