Through this SPA, South Dakota has demonstrated compliance with the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP). This SPA has an effective date of March 11, 2021 and extends through th e last day of the first calendar quarter that begins one year after the last da y of the COVID-19 public health em ergency, as described in section 1135(g)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act). Section 9821 of the ARP amended sections 2103(c )(11)(B) and 2103(e)(2) of the Act to mandate coverage of COVID-19 testing, tr eatment, and vaccines and thei r administration without cost- sharing or amount, duration, or scope limitations. Sections 2103(c)(11)(B) and 2103(e)(2) of the Act also require states to cover, without cost sh aring, the treatment of cond itions that may seriously complicate COVID-19 treatment, duri ng the period when a beneficiar y is diagnosed with or is presumed to have COVID-19. The state provide d the necessary assurances to demonstrate compliance with the ARP in accordance with th e requirements of sections 2103(c)(11)(B) and 2103(e)(2) of the Act. Pursuant to section 1135(b )(5) of the Act, for the period of the public health emergency, CMS is modifying the requirement at 42 C.F.R. 457.65 that the state submit SPAs that are related to the COVID-19 public health emergency by the end of the st ate fiscal year in which they take effect. CMS is allowing states that submit SPAs after the la st day of the state fiscal year to have an effective date in the prior state fi scal year, but no earlier than the e ffective date of the public health emergency. South Dakota requested a waiver to obtain an earlier effective date of March 11, 2021. This letter approves South Dakota's request for a March 11, 2021 effective date.

Date: MODEL APPLICATION TEMPLATE FOR STATE CHILD HEALTH PLAN UNDER TITLE XXI OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM Preamble Section 4901 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) amended the Social Security Act (the Act) by adding a new title XXI, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Title XXI provides funds to states to enable them to initiate and expand the provision of child health assistance to uninsured , low -income children in an effective and efficient manner. To be eligible for funds under this program, states must submit a state plan, which must be approved by the Secretary. A state may choose to amend its approved state plan in whole or in part at any time through the submittal of a plan amendment. This model application template outlines the information that must be included in the state child health plan, and any subsequent amendments. It has been designed to reflect the requirements as they exis t in current regulations, found at 42 CFR part 457. These requirements are necessary for state plans and amendments under Title XXI. The Department of Health and Human Services will continue to work collaboratively with states and other interested parties to provide specific guidance in key areas like applicant and enrollee protections, collection of baseline data, and methods for preventing substitution of Federal funds for existing state and private funds. As such guidance becomes available, we will work to distribute it in a timely fashion to provide assistance as states submit their state plans and amendments.

South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 3 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 Section 1. General Description and Purpose of the State Child Health Plans and State Child Health Plan Requirements (Section 2101) 1.1 The state will use funds provided under Title XXI primarily for (Check appropriate box) (42 CFR 457.70) : 1.1.1 Obtaining coverage that meets the requirements for a separate child health program (Section 2103) ; OR 1.1.2. Providing expanded benefits under the State's Medicaid plan (Title XIX); OR 1.1.3. A combination of both of the above. Since July 1, 1998 South Dakota has provided SCHIP benefits to uninsured children by providing expanded eligibility under the State's Medicaid plan. The original SCHIP plan included children age 6 through 18 from 100% to 133% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). The initial SCHIP program was approved on August 5, 1998, and a subsequent eligibility expansion with Medicaid occurred on April 1, 1999 that increased eligibility from 133% FPL to 140% FPL for children from birth to age 19 for both Medicaid and SCHIP program. South D akota refers to its original SCHIP program, with subsequent expansion as M -SCHIP. Subsequently, in July 2000, South Dakota added a State operated SCHIP program for targeted uninsured children from families with income levels higher than previously approved SCHIP eligibility levels. The new eligibility level, active outreach and beneficiary enrollment began on July 1, 2000. There was no corresponding amendment to the Medicaid State Plan submitted in conjunction with the SCHIP expansion at that time as Medicaid eligibility income levels remained unchanged. South Dakota refers to its separate child health program as CHIP -NM. Collectively, M - SCHIP and CHIP -NM are referred to throughout this document as SCHIP. This State Plan Amendment does not seek to replace the approved SCHIP State Plan materials, but will add the appropriate information describing the additional requirements and assurances mandated as a result of the final SCHIP federal regulations. This State Plan Amendment will also update the exis ting pages of the current SCHIP State Plan. The Secretary of the Department of Social Services is the authorized State Official signing and submitting this State Plan Amendment. The Official responsible for program administration and financial oversight is Damian Prunty, Administrator, Office of Medical Services, South Dakota Department of Social Services, 700 Governors Drive, Pierre, South Dakota 57501 2291.

(42 CFR 457.40(d)) The State assures specific legislative authority to operate an expansion of the SCHIP program under Title XXI of the Social Security Act was granted by Act of the South Dakota Legislature and signed into law by the Governor of South Dakota. The authority for M -SCHIP was granted by Act of the S outh Dakota Legislature and signed into law by the Governor of South Dakota, effective July 1, 1998. No expenditures for child health assistance were claimed for M -SCHIP prior to July 1, 1998. The authority for CHIP -NM was granted by Act of the South Dakota Legislature and signed into law by the Governor of South Dakota, effective July 1, 2000. No expenditures for child health assistance were claimed for CHIP -NM prior to July 1, 2000. 1.3 Please provide an assurance that the state complies with all appli cable civil rights requirements, including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, 45 CFR part 80, part 84, and part 91, and 28 CFR part 35.

General Background and Description of State Approach to Child Health Coverage and Coordination (Section 2102 (a)(1) -(3)) and (Section 2105)(c)(7)(A) -(B)) 2.1. Describe the extent to which, and manner in which, children in the sta te including targeted low-income children and other classes of children, by income level and other relevant factors, such as race and ethnicity and geographic location, currently have creditable health coverage (as defined in 42 CFR 457.10). To the extent feasible, make a distinction between creditable coverage under public health insurance programs and public -private partnerships (See Section 10 for annual report requirements). (42 CFR 457.80(a)) South Dakota's original SCHIP state plan provided a complete description of South Dakota's population, estimates of the uninsured population and information on the populations served by the Medicaid program and IHS. Little has changed in the basic demographic profile of the State in the years that have ela psed. This SCHIP state plan amendment will recap the increases in enrollment in creditable health coverage and the corresponding reductions that have taken place in South Dakota since the 1998 SCHIP State Plan was implemented. The following table shows the number of Medicaid and SCHIP eligible children from just prior to SCHIP implementation and for the last day of each quarter through March of 2002. The number of Medicaid eligible children does not include children eligible in SSI categories. Quarter Ending Medicaid Children SCHIP Children Insurance Program State Plan 9 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: 7,972 Source: SD MMIS 1998,1999,2000,2001,2002 Beginning July 1, 1998 eligibility levels for Medicaid and M -SCHIP were increased to include children ages 6 through 18 in families with incomes above 100% but not exceeding 133% of the FPL. Beginning April 1, 1999 the income eligibility levels for Medicaid and M -SCHIP increased from 133% to 140% of the FPL for children from birth through age 18. Beginning July 1, 2000, eligibility levels for SCHIP were increased and included children birth through age 18 from 141% to 200% of the FPL, with implementation of CHIP -NM. Children from families with incomes in the expanded levels, who were uninsured and not otherwise eligible for Medicaid, received SCHIP coverage. All others who were eligible received Medicaid. The chart shows that the number of children with qualified coverage from Medicaid or SCHIP increased by 21,918 during the time period of SCHIP operation. During this time period, 83% of the Medicaid enrolled children had no other health coverage when enrolled in the Medicaid program. All SCHIP enrolled children were, by definition, uninsured. Using this information the following table shows the number of uninsured children who received qualified coverage since SCHIP implementation. Medicaid -SCHIP Enrollment of Uninsured Children Baseline Year Reporting Period Uninsured Medicaid SCHIP Total 1999 Census Bureau Current Population Survey reported 13,000 uninsured children under 200% of the FPL for South Dakota based upon its three year averages from 1996, 1997 and 1998. South Dakota believes the CPS estimate was the best source of baseline data available for the number of uninsured children when SCHIP was implemented. The data in the preceding table indicates the actual enrollees into the Medicaid or SCHIP programs that were uninsured prior to enrollment. In 2001, South Dakota was one of nine states awarded a one - year Health Resources and Services Administration grant to develop a plan for expanding access to affordable health coverage to all state residents. The State contracted with The Lewin Group to collect and analyze information about the uninsured and underinsured in South Dakota. The Lewin Group concluded that South Dakota 's uninsured population for children under the age of 19 is considerably less than the CPS estimates. The Lewin Group estimates that 9,600 children under the age of 19 are uninsured in South Dakota as of the year 2000. South Dakota believes that number to be further reduced, as evidenced by the preceding South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 10 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 table for inclusion of enrollment of uninsured children in the years 2001 and 2002. South Dakota believes the enrollment of nearly 20,000 uninsured children into Medicaid or SCHIP, since implementation of SCHIP in July of 1998, has had a major impact on the number of uninsured children in South Dakota. Minority enrollments have also increased significantly under the State's SCHIP efforts. The most recent Statistical Enrollment Data System (March 2002) indicates that South Dakota had 1,839 American Indian children enrolled in the SCHIP program. This represents over 23% of the total number of children enrolled in the SCHIP program. Enrollment of American Indian children in Medicaid and SCHIP collectively, has grown by 44% from July 1, 1998 to March of 2002. It is the Department's opinion that SCHIP efforts have been successful in increasing the number of American Indian children with creditable health coverage. 2.2. Describe the current state efforts to provide or obtain creditable health coverage for uncovered children by addressing: (Section 2102)(a)(2) (42CFR 457.80(b)) 2.2.1. The steps the state is currently taking to identify and enroll all uncovered children who are eligible to participate in public health insurance programs (i.e. Medicaid and state -only child health insurance): State efforts to enroll uninsured children prior to the implementation of the SCHIP program in South Dakota are documented in the original SCHIP plan. Medicaid was the primary public health insurance program at that time and the SCHIP program efforts built upon the existing Medicaid program. The key relationships with other DSS programs, Public Health, Education, Human Services and IHS will continue to be in place and are a vital part of SCHIP outreach efforts. The enrollment of SCHIP eligible children is greatly enhanced by the widespread availability of Medicaid eligibility throughout the state. Coordinated delivery of multiple programs fr om the Department of Social Services using generalized co - located eligibility workers and automated information systems enhance the identification and enrollment of children into SCHIP and Medicaid. Access to program coverage is greatly assisted by the wi despread availability of participating Medicaid providers throughout the state. Established relationships with other public health programs operated by the State of South Dakota also provide numerous opportunities to identify and enroll children into Medicaid and SCHIP. Interagency agreements between the Departments of Health and Social Services establish referral mechanisms between the programs operated by the agencies. WIC, Community Health Services, Baby Care, MCH, Title V and Children's Special Health Services programs are key referral sources for families seeking medical coverage for children. South Dakota's Federally Qualified Health Centers, community and migrant health centers are very involved as sources of information about the South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 11 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 State's medical assistance programs to assist in identifying and enrolling uncovered children, in addition to serving as primary care providers. Interagency agreements also exist with the Department of Education and the Department of Human Services to provide for the referral of children to the Department of Social Services for medical coverage. Individual school districts in the State also participate as direct services providers under Medicaid and therefore have incentives to identif y and assist enrolling children in Medicaid and SCHIP programs. Close collaboration between the Department of Social Services and the Indian Health Service to identify and enroll Medicaid and SCHIP eligible children is a key priority for both agencies. The Department of Social Services recognizes the critical importance of the IHS as a service provider in the Indian reservation areas of the State. The IHS as a provider and payer of services, relies very heavily upon third party funding for services they are responsible for, and therefore is a proven referral source for potentially eligible children. The initial implementation of the SCHIP program provided a number of opportunities for improved outreach and a greater opportunity for outreach partners to participate in SCHIP outreach. Administrative changes were some of the most significant improvements made with the implementation of SCHIP. Notable among these administrative changes were the development of a new, shorter application form for Medicaid and SCHIP, dropping the requirement for face to face interviews, elimination of assets testing, reduced documentation requirements and direction for DSS eligibility staff to actively participate in program outreach. The new application form for Medicaid l ow income children and SCHIP eligibility has been reduced to 3 pages from a form that had been over 30 pages in length. The new form, because of its size and simplicity has been widely distributed to outreach sites including other government agencies, schools, primary care and specialty health care providers, advocacy groups, tribal programs, and day care centers. In addition to the shortening of the form, and eliminating assets information the new form also has reduced documentation requireme nts as only earnings and childcare expenses need to be verified by the applicant family. The completed eligibility forms may be mailed or faxed to DSS eligibility offices without the need for a face to face interview. However, DSS caseworkers are available at DSS offices to assist with completing the applications if necessary. Workers at some outreach sites are also trained to assist with basic questions regarding Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility. Redetermination for low income Medicaid and SCHIP has also been simplified. South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 12 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 Redeterminations are conducted annually for eligible families and are initiated by DSS caseworkers that mail the redetermination materials to the families a month in advance. The redetermination materials do not require more information than the application process, and can be completed through the mail or fax. Eligibility for individuals applying for Food Stamps, TANF, or other Medicaid programs is also simplified, as an additional application form is not required to obtain low income Medicaid or SCHIP coverage. There is significant evidence to support the assertion that the changes to the application process have facilitated the identification and enrollment of uncovered children. Face value evidence exists in the grow th in the number of uninsured children in Medicaid and SCHIP. Annual surveys conducted of the families of children enrolled in the Medicaid and SCHIP programs in 1998 and 1999 reported that 95% and 98% respectively, responded positively to the question on the ease of the application process. Since the inception of the SCHIP program the State has used a number of approaches to conduct outreach to clients in addition to collaboration with other health or children's programs. Included among the ou treach approaches are direct mailings by the State to clients, the use of brochures and posters, client education sessions, an eligibility 800 -telephone number, ads on public access television, paid radio announcements and public service announcements. Mos t effective among these efforts are the education sessions, direct mailings, and collaborations with other programs and the use of brochures. Least effective have been the radio and public access television ads. Department of Social Services staff and col laborating agencies have conducted client outreach in many different settings. Included as some of the most effective settings for outreach are community health centers, health care provider locations, schools and adult education sites, Tribal agencies, so cial service agencies, local government offices, Headstart programs, and local charities. Many other locations such as laundries, fast food restaurants, libraries and senior centers have also been tried with less effectiveness. Surveys of SCHIP enrollees were conducted to assist in evaluating SCHIP implementation in South Dakota in both 1998 and in 1999. One of the items surveyed was outreach effectiveness. In the 1998 survey 76% of the respondents indicated that they had obtained information about the coverage program from the Department of Social Services. However, in comparison to the 1999 survey it appears the community based outreach efforts were increasing in effectiveness as only 55% of the respondents indicated the Department of Social Services was their source of information about SCHIP. Increasing in outreach effectiveness from 1998 to 1999 were community health nursing, health care providers and schools. Tribal health agencies also contributed effective outreach in both surveys . South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 13 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 American Indians are the largest minority population living in South Dakota. Approximately 7% of South Dakota's population is American Indian, primarily residing on the 9 Indian Reservations within the States boundaries. For this reason specific outreach approaches have been considered for this population. Among the efforts specifically directed at American Indian persons are Consultation meetings held between the State and Tribal Government and Tribal Health officials. In addition, the Dep artment has invited both Tribal Government and the IHS to be represented on the Medicaid Advisory Committee that assists in the monitoring of the Medicaid and SCHIP programs, and both entities are participating. Some Tribal health departments have requested specific training of the their Community Health Representative staff in the SCHIP program and this training was provided by Department eligibility staff. One reservation even adapted the SCHIP radio ad to use in reaching the Indian population on their reservation. Outreach brochures, posters and logos for SCHIP were designed with a culturally sensitive logo depicting children of varying ethnic backgrounds in an effort to convey that the program is intended for all races of children. South Dakota has also had a successful applicant for the \"South Dakota Covering Kids Initiative\" through grant funding from the Robert Wood Johnson foundation for a three -year period of time from July 1, 2000 through June 30, 2003. The Community Healthcare Association of Sioux Falls, SD was the successful applicant. The South Dakota Covering Kids Initiative has four goals. They are: designing and cond ucting outreach programs to identify and enroll children in the Medicaid and SCHIP programs; continuing to simplify access to and completion of enrollment information and applications; assisting in coordinating coverage programs for low income, uninsured c hildren; and designing programming specifically targeted to Native Americans and other special populations. The program will feature statewide initiatives to meet these goals and also pilot programs to address specific geographic areas and special populati ons. The Community Healthcare Association of Sioux Falls does not contribute any funds to the State of South Dakota for the operation of the Covering Kids Initiative. This organization conducts their own outreach and targets Native American and other spec ial populations in specific geographical areas of the state. This grant money is not being used to match any federal dollars for SCHIP. 2.2.2. The steps the state is currently taking to identify and enroll all uncovered children who are eligible to participate i n health insurance programs that involve a public -private partnership: South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 14 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 When South Dakota implemented its SCHIP program in July of 1998, the South Dakota Caring Program for Children was a public -private partnership to make very limited services available to eligible children. The Program operated on an annual donation from Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Dakota, administrative support from the South Dakota Department of Health, and private donations. The Caring Program did not p rovide qualified health care coverage, did not operate in all parts of South Dakota, and covered only a very limited number of children under 133% of FPL. No Caring for Children benefits would have ever been available to children expected to be served by t he CHIP -NM program. The South Dakota Caring for Children Program ceased to exist in 1999, long before action by the state to implement a CHIP -NM program. South Dakota counties continue to be required to provide medical services for persons in the State who are determined medically indigent. Eligibility is restricted to persons with very limited income and resources. Services are restricted to coverage of emergency hospital services only, with the exception of two counties, Minnehaha and Pennington which operate community health centers to make primary care clinic services available. As such, the County Indigent Program is not a health resource available to low income uninsured children with needs for full coverage of primary and preventive health ca re. All counties operate as the payer of last resort and provide referrals and assistance with Medicaid applications. 2.3. Describe the procedures the state uses to accomplish coordination of SCHIP with other public and private health insurance programs, sources of health benefits coverage for children, and relevant child health programs, such as title V, that provide health care services for low -income children to increase the number of children with creditable health coverage. (Previously 2102)(a)(3) and 2102(b)(3)(E)) key programs providing creditable coverage for low-income children in South Dakota are the Medicaid and M -SCHIP programs that are jointly administered by the South Dakota Department of Social Services. The interagency agreements identified in Section 2.2.1 on page 8 serve as the referral procedures that the State uses to accomplish the coordination with Title V, WIC and MCH for both the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. T he interagency agreements serve to assure the services provided under Title V, WIC, MCH, Title XIX and Title XXI are consistent with the needs of recipients and both the Department of Social Services and the Department of Health's objectives and requirements to promote high quality health care and services. There are no other State programs that provide creditable coverage for low - income children. The South Dakota Caring for Children program had existed as a South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 15 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 private effort to provi de very limited health coverage to low -income children, however operations under that program ceased in 1999. There are no other private programs that offer creditable coverage for low -income children in South Dakota. The Indian Health Service continues a s a provider of creditable coverage to Indian children. The IHS functions as a provider of services and also provides coverage for certain specialty services through their contract health program. Coordination with the IHS will continue in the same way as coordination with the Medicaid program. The IHS will be reimbursed for the direct services they provide to SCHIP children at the same rate of payment as the South Dakota Medicaid program. Since the IHS contract care program is the payer of last resort unde r Federal Regulations, the SCHIP program will be primary to IHS contract care. Benefit coordination will be accomplished by the IHS denying claims they receive and causing the claims to be submitted to the SCHIP program for payment just as currently happen s with Medicaid. Payment for those services under the SCHIP program will be on the same basis as established for the Medicaid program. The IHS also plays a very important role in the delivery of outreach services to facilitate the identification and enrollment of low -income children for Medicaid and SCHIP. This role will continue for potentially eligible SCHIP children using the established means to interface with the Department of Social Services medical assistance programs. There are no other public programs providing creditable coverage to low -income children. Children potentially eligible for other public programs will be referred to those programs for services in addition to those provided by Medicaid, M - SCHIP or CHIP -NM. Children covered by Medicare will not be enrolled in SCHIP as they have creditable coverage. Section 3. Methods of Delivery and Utilization Controls (Section 2102)(a)(4)) Check here if the state elects to use funds provided under Title XXI only to provide expanded eligibility under the state's Medicaid plan , and continue on to Section 4. 3.1. Delivery Systems (Section 2102(a)(4)) (42 CFR 457.490; Part 457, Subpart L) Describe the methods of delivery of the child health assistance using Title XXI funds to targeted low -income children. Include a description of the choice of financing and the methods for assuring delivery of the insurance products and delivery of health care services covered by such products to the enrollees, including any variations . (Section 2102)(a)(4) (42CFR 457.490(a)) South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 16 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 South Dakota's original implementation of SCHIP began in July of 1998 with the expansion of the State's Medicaid program to include children age 6 through 18 from 100% to 133% of the Federal Poverty Level. Under this program expansion eligible children with insurance coverage were enrolled in Medicaid and uninsured children not otherwise eligible for Medicaid were enrolled in SCHIP. In April of 1999, SCHIP implementation via Medicaid expansion continued as the income level for eligibility was increased from 133% of the FPL to 140% for children from birth to age 19 for both the Medicaid and M -SCHIP programs. Again, insured children received Medicaid benefits, and targeted uninsured children rece ived M -SCHIP. South Dakota's third effort under Title XXI to expand coverage to targeted uninsured children included the method of delivering child health assistance is through a state administered program. The State Administered program, called CHIP NM, is operated directly by the South Dakota Department of Social Services. Children to be covered under the CHIP -NM program are uninsured children from birth to age 19 in families with incomes above 140% of the FPL and not exceeding 200% of the FPL. Effec tive January 1, 2014, the implementation of the affordable care act required states to convert the established income limits to a Modified Adjust Gross Income (MAGI) equivalent. The MAGI equivalents are as follows: M-SCHIP uninsured children 6 to 19 - 111% to 181% M-SCHIP uninsured children 0 to 5 - 147% to 181% CHINP -NM uninsured children 0 to 19 - 182% to 204% Effective July 1, 2016 South Dakota added coverage of unborn children of pregnant women with incomes from 0% FPL and up to and including 133% FPL not otherwise eligible for Medicaid due to citizenship requirements. As the single state agency for Medicaid the Department is jointly administering CHIP -NM with the Medicaid and M- SCHIP programs using DSS eligibility, outreach, benefit payment, reporting and management resources. General Funds have been appropriated by the South Dakota State Legislature to provide matching funds for Federal Title XXI funds. Benefits delivered to targeted uninsured children under the CHIP -NM state admin istered program are identical to the benefits offered under the State's Medicaid and M -SCHIP programs, including EPSDT benefits. Health care services are delivered using the existing delivery and payment systems including primary care case management and access to specialty health service providers, as approved under the State's 1915(b) waiver under Medicaid. South Dakota will request the managed care waiver be incorporated into it's Medicaid and SCHIP state plans. The State can assure that children receiv ing services under SCHIP will receive the same beneficiary protections as children receiving Medicaid coverage including grievances and appeals, privacy and confidentiality, respect and non -discrimination, access to emergency services, and an opportunity t o participate in health care treatment decision and choice of providers. The State can also assure that it is South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 17 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 providing SCHIP services in an effective and efficient manner by using Medicaid policies and procedures. Children are considered uninsured if they do not qualify for Medicaid and have not had group health plan coverage in the three months immediately prior to application for the SCHIP program. 3.1.1 Choice of Delivery System 3.1.1.1 Does the State use a managed care delivery system f or its CHIP populations?

(Section 2102)(b)(3)(D)) (42 CFR 457.125(a)) SCHIP is available to all targeted low -income Indian children in South Dakota regardless of tribal membership, enrollment, or affiliation. Inasmuch as the program is a statewide program, SCHIP is also made available to children living on Indian reservations within the State's borders. Indian children not living on reservations are also potentially eligible for SCHIP coverage. The availability of services through the Indian Health Service is not considered insurance for the Medicaid, M-SCHIP or CH IP-NM program. To help assure SCHIP is provided to Indian eligible children the Department has outreach efforts directed towards the Indian reservation areas of the state. The Indian Health Services currently plays and will continue to play a very importa nt outreach role for targeted, low - income Indian children. Applications, enrollment assistance, and program information for SCHIP is available at IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian Health locations in South Dakota. SCHIP services will be provided to Indian ch ildren in the state eligible to receive services from the Indian Health Service as the Indian Health Service facilities and providers are enrolled as health care providers for the SCHIP program and eligible for reimbursement for services provided to SCHIP children. Tribal clinics and other providers are also eligible for reimbursement for covered services under SCHIP as are Urban Indian Health clinics. Section 5. Outreach (Section 2102(c)) Describe the procedures used by the state to accomplish: Outreach to families of children likely to be eligible for child health assistance or other public or private health coverage to inform them of the availability of the programs, and to assist them in enrolling their children in such a program: (Section 2102(c)(1)) (42CFR 457.90) The CHIP -NM program built on the existing programs of coverage for low income, and low - income uninsured children, (Medicaid and M -SCHIP), to provide health coverage for additional uncovered children in South Dakota. Ou treach for these programs in South Dakota was implemented with a strategy for statewide outreach coordination and a local outreach strategy. Statewide outreach was accomplished with the participation of other programs offered by the Department of Social Se rvices, other State agencies and the Indian Health Service. Outreach at this level relied on interagency agreements to facilitate referrals and the use of automated systems for information sharing on potentially eligible children. Administrative reforms of the eligibility process, publicity materials and advertising were also South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 61 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 part of this outreach. Local coordination has been effectively done in communities and service areas of the State by Department of Social Services eligibility staff establishing connections with local resources to facilitate the identification and enrollment of children. Health care providers, schools, Tribal agencies, and many others have been very involved in distributing materials, providing applications and inform ation, and assisting with enrollment. Outreach for CHIP -NM program built on the successful outreach strategies already in place for the State's medical assistance efforts. However, recognizing the differences in the income levels of the families targeted by CHIP -NM new efforts were made to supplement existing outreach, to help reach those potentially eligible for CHIP -NM. These additional outreach efforts began with a statewide training of Department of Social Services eligibility staff prior to the implem entation of the program. New materials were developed for distribution and use around the state to prepare for the operation of the program including application forms, information sheets, brochures, and posters. Local Department of Social Services staff r enewed connections with outreach partners to inform them of the new program and expanded eligibility levels. Medicaid and M -SCHIP providers were notified of the new program of coverage so they will be prepared to deliver health services. The Department will also consider expanding the range of outreach partners to include entities not traditionally involved in outreach for publicly financed health care programs including the South Dakota Department of Labor, Job Service and other employment agencies, large and small employers and job training programs.

Benefits to unborn children are delivered through the same delivery and utilization control systems. South Dakota uses a bundled payment methodology for prenatal services, labor and delivery, and postpartum visits.

(42 CFR 457.496(c)(3)) The State assures that it has developed a reasonable methodology to calculate the portion of covered medical/surgical benefits which are subject to the aggregate lifetime and/or annual dollar limit, as applicable. 6.2.4.3.1 - MHPAEA Please indicate the portion of the total costs for medical and surgical benefits covered under the State plan which are subject to a lifetime dollar limit: Less than 1/3 At least 1/3 and less than 2/3 At least 2/3 6.2.4.3.2 - MHPAEA Please indicate the portion of the total costs for medical and surgical benefits covered under the State plan which are subject to an annual dollar limit: Less than 1/3 At least 1/3 and less than 2/3 At least 2/3 6.2.4.3.2.1 - MHPAEA If the State applies an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit to at least 1/3 and less than 2/3 of all medical/surgical benefits, the State assures the following (42 CFR 457.496(c)(4)(i)(B)); (42 CFR 457.496(c)(4)(ii)): The State applies an aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits t hat is no more restrictive than an average limit calculated for medical/surgical benefits. 6.2.4.3.2.2 - MHPAEA If at least 2/3 of all medical/surgical benefits are subject to an annual or lifetime limit, the State assures either of the following (42 CFR 457.496(c)(2)(i)); (42 CFR 457.496(c)(2)(ii)): The aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit is applied to both medical/surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits in a manner that does not distinguish between medical/surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits; or South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 84 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 The aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit placed on mental health and substance use disorder benefits is no more restrictive than the aggregate lifetime or annual dollar limit on medical/surgical benefits. Quantitative Treatment Limitations 6.2.5 - MHPAEA Does the State apply quantitative treatment limitations (QTLs) on any mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification of benefits? If yes, s pecify the classification(s) of benefits in which the State applies one or more QTLs on any mental health or substance use disorder benefits. Yes (Specify: ) No 6.2.5.1 - MHPAEA Does the State apply any type of QTL on any medical/surgical benefits? Yes No 6.2.5.2 - MHPAEA Within each classification of benefits in which the State applies a type of QTL on any mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the State must determine the portion of medical and surgical benefits in the classi fication which are subject to the limitation. More specifically, the State must determine the ratio of (a) the dollar amount of all payments expected to be paid under the State plan for medical and surgical benefits within a classification which are subject to the type of quantitative treatment limitation for the plan year (or portion of the plan year after a mid -year change affecting the applicability of a type of quantitative treatment limitation to any medical/surgical benefits in the class) to (b) the dollar amount expected to be paid for all medical and surgical benefits within the classification for the plan year. For purposes of this paragraph, all payments expected to be paid under the State plan includes payments expected to be made directly b y the State and payments which are expected to be made by MCEs contracting with the State. (42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(C)) The State assures it has applied a reasonable methodology to determine the dollar amounts used in the ratio described above for each classification within which the State applies QTLs to mental health or substance use disorder benefits. (42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(E)) 6.2.5.3 - MHPAEA For each type of QTL applied to any mental health or substance use disorder benefits within a given cl assification, does the State apply the same type of QTL to \"substantially all\" (defined as at least two -thirds) of the medical/surgical benefits within the same classification? (42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(A)) Yes South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 85 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 No 6.2.5.3.1 - MHPAEA For each type of QTL applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the State must determine the predominant level of that type which is applied to medical/surgical benefits in the classification. The \"predominant level\" of a type of QTL in a classification is the level (or least restrictive of a combination of levels) that applies to more than one -half of the medical/surgical benefits in that classification, as described in 42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(B). The portion of medical/surgical benefits i n a classification to which a given level of a QTL type is applied is based on the dollar amount of payments expected to be paid for medical/surgical benefits subject to that level as compared to all medical/surgical benefits in the classification, as desc ribed in 42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(C). For each type of quantitative treatment limitation applied to mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the State assures: The same reasonable methodology applied in determining the dollar amounts used to dete rmine whether substantially all medical/surgical benefits within a classification are subject to a type of quantitative treatment limitation also is applied in determining the dollar amounts used to determine the predominant level of a type of quantitative treatment limitation applied to medical/surgical benefits within a classification. (42 CFR 457.496(d)(3)(i)(E)) The level of each type of quantitative treatment limitation applied by the State to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any classification is no more restrictive than the predominant level of that type which is applied by the State to medical/surgical benefits within the same classification. (42 CFR 457.496(d)(2)(i)) Non-Quantitative Treatment Limitations 6.2.6 - MHPAEA The State may utilize non -quantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs) for mental health or substance use disorder benefits, but the State must ensure that those NQTLs comply with all the mental health parity requirements. (42 CFR 457.496(d)(4)); (42 CFR 457.496(d)(5)) 6.2.6.1 - MHPAEA If the State imposes any NQTLs, complete this subsection. If the State does not impose NQTLs, please go to Section 6.2.7 -MHPAEA. The State assures that the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards or ot her factors used in the application of any NQTL to mental health or substance use disorder benefits are no more stringent than the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards or other factors used in the application of NQTLs to medical/surgical benefits within the same classification. 6.2.6.2 - MHPAEA The State or MCE contracting with the State must comply with parity if they provide coverage of medical or surgical benefits furnished by out -of-network providers. South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 86 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 6.2.6.2.1 - MHPAEA Does the State or MCE contracting with the State provide coverage of medical or surgical benefits provided by out -of-network providers? Yes No 6.2.6.2.2 - MHPAEA If yes, the State must provide access to out -of-network providers for mental health or substance use disorder benefits. Please assure the following: The State attests that when determining access to out -of-network providers within a benefit classification, the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards, or other factors used to determine access to those providers for mental health/ substance use disorder benefits are comparable to and applied no more stringently than the processes, strategies, evidentiary standards or other factors used to determine access for out - of-network providers for medical/surgical benefits. Availability of Plan Information 6.2.7 - MHPAEA The State must provide beneficiaries, potential enrollees, and providers with information related to medical necessity criteria and denials of payment or rei mbursement for mental health or substance use disorder services (42 CFR 457.496(e)) in addition to existing notice requirements at 42 CFR 457.1180. 6.2.7.1 - MHPAEA Medical necessity criteria determinations must be made available to any current or potentia l enrollee or contracting provider, upon request. The state attests that the following entities provide this information: State Managed Care entities Both Other 6.2.7.2 - MHPAEA Reason for any denial for reimbursement or payment for mental health or substance use disorder benefits must be made available to the enrollee by the health plan or the State. The state attests that the following entities provide denial information: State Managed Care entities Both South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 87 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 Other 6.3 The state assures that, with respect to pre -existing medical conditions, one of the following two statements applies to its plan: (42CFR 457.480) 6.3.1. The state shall not permit the imposition of any pre -existing medical condition exclusion for covered services (Section 2102(b)(1)(B)(ii)) ; OR 6.3.2. The state contracts with a group health plan or group health insurance coverage, or contracts with a group health plan to provide family coverage under a waiver (see Section 6.4.2. of the template). Pre- existing medical conditions are permitted to the extent allowed by HIPAA/ERISA (Section 2103(f)) . Please describe: Previously 8.6 6.4 Additional Purchase Options. If the state wishes to provide services under the plan through cost effective alternatives or the purchase of family coverage, it must request the appropriate option. To be approved, the state must address the following: (Section 2105(c)(2) and(3)) (42 CFR 457.1005 and 457.1010) 6.4.1. Cost Effective Coverage. Payment may be made to a state in excess of the 10% limitation on use of funds for payments for: 1) other child health assistance for targeted low -income children; 2) expenditures for health services initiatives under the plan for improving the health of children (including targeted low-income children and otherlow -income children); 3) expenditures for outreach activities as provided in section 2102(c)(1) under the plan; and 4) other reasonable costs incurred by the state to administer the plan, if it demonstrates the following (42CFR 457.1005(a)) : 6.4.1.1. Coverage provided to targeted low -income children through such expenditures must meet the coverage requirements above; Describe the coverage provided by the alternative delivery system . The state may cross reference section 6.2.1 - 6.2.28. (Section 2105(c)(2)(B)(i)) (42CFR 457.1005(b)) 6.4.1.2. The cost of such coverage must not be greater, on an average per child basis, than the cost of coverage that would otherwise be provided for the coverage described above.; Describe the cost of such coverage on an average per child basis . (Section 2105(c)(2)(B)(ii)) (42CFR 457.1005(b)) 6.4.1.3. The coverage must be provided through the use of a community -based health delivery system, such as through contracts with health centers receiving funds under section South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 88 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 330 of the Public Health Service Act or with hospitals such as those that receive disproportionate share payment adjustments under section 1886(c)(5)(F) or 1923 of the Social Security Act. Describe the community based delivery system. (Section 2105(c)(2)(B)(iii)) (42CFR 457.1005(a)) 6.4.2. Purchase of Family Coverage. Describe the plan to purchase family coverage. Payment may be made to a state for the purpose of family coverage under a group health plan or health insurance coverage that includes coverage of targeted low- income children, if it demonstrates the following: (Section 2105(c)(3)) (42CFR 457.1010) 6.4.2.1. Purchase of family coverage is cost -effective relative to the amounts that the state would have paid to obtain comparable coverage only of the targeted low -income children involved; and (Describe the associated costs for purchasing the family coverage relative to the coverage for the low income children.) (Section 2105(c)(3)(A)) (42C FR 457.1010(a)) 6.4.2.2. The state assures that the family coverage would not otherwise substitute for health insurance coverage that would be provided to such children but for the purchase of family coverage. (Section 2105(c)(3)(B)) (42CFR 457.1010(b)) 6.4.2.3. The state assures that the coverage for the family otherwise meets title XXI requirements. (42CFR 457.1010(c)) Section 7. Quality and Appropriateness of Care Check here if the state elects to use funds provided under Title XXI only to provide expanded eligibility under the state's Medicaid plan , and continue on to Section 8. 7.1. Describe the methods (including external and internal monitoring) used to assure the quality and appropriateness of care, particularly with respect to well -baby ca re, well- child care, and immunizations provided under the plan. (2102(a)(7)(A)) (42CFR 457.495(a)) The SCHIP program will use the methods that exist for the Medicaid program to assure quality and appropriateness of care since the programs will be jointly administered and delivered. There are numerous strategies that South Dakota uses under these programs to monitor quality and appropriateness of care including South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 89 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 both external and internal sources. The most comprehensive mechanism used by the State in the SCHIP program is the Primary Care Case Management system. Under this program each recipient of SCHIP selects a primary care physician or clinic (PCP) to provide primary care and authorize and manage all specialty medical care through a referral process. Under this program each PCP receives a monthly report of all the medical services used by each client enrolled with that PCP. In this way each PCP is able to provide case management services and monitor the appropriateness of services provided to enrollees. The state also monitors the performance of each PCP with regard to the number of clients enrolled with each PCP, the proportion of services provided directly or referred by each PCP, and the satisfaction of clients with PCP s via a complaint and disenrollment process used by recipients to change PCP's. Case file reviews will be conducted on quality complaints. This program operates for Medicaid recipients under waiver authority from CMS. The waiver process provides for a bian nual review of the program by CMS, and a number of focused clinical studies to be completed each renewal period. Monitoring of this program by CMS has been ongoing since 1993, with the third and most recent renewal expiring September 30, 2002. South Dakota will request the managed care waiver be incorporated into its Medicaid and SCHIP state plans. All of the quality and appropriateness monitoring available to Medicaid for the PCCM program will also be provided to the SCHIP program. External reviews of med ical, surgical and hospital services are conducted by the Professional Review Organization (PRO) in South Dakota. A large sample of services is selected for review each month on a variety of criteria, including specific diagnoses and random selections. Services provided to SCHIP clients will also be included in the sample selected for PRO review. The PRO reports to each provider and to the State the results of each review recommending approval, denial, changes or improvements to service delivery, action by the Medicaid program or referral to other entities for action. Drug utilization review activities will also be made available to SCHIP clients through the pharmacy benefit management system used by the Department to provide prescription drug coverage. Each drug prescription is processed through a prospective drug use review protocol prior to authorizing a pharmacist to dispense a drug product. This point of service process checks for drug to drug interactions, contraindications, duplicate ther apy, dosage, early refill, and days -supply edits to help assure appropriate and quality prescription drug services. The drug utilization review requirements are purchased from a national vendor and incorporated into the Department's system. A licensed phar macist employed by the Department oversees the operation of the DUR system. South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 90 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 The SCHIP program will also make use of the capabilities of the MMIS claims processing system to process and pay claims for SCHIP clients using the same procedures an d rates as the Medicaid program. The MMIS claims systems has numerous edits, reports and capabilities to assist in assuring appropriate and quality services are delivered to SCHIP clients. The MMIS is the source for the Medicaid reporting of EPSDT screenin g services to CMS, and these reporting capabilities will be available to report on the SCHIP children also. Surveillance and utilization review system (SURS) capabilities used by the Department to monitor Medicaid services will also be used to monitor the services obtained by SCHIP clients for fraud and abuse. This will provide the SCHIP program a capacity for the full investigation, referral to appropriate law enforcement, and reporting of sanctions as required. The SURS is the designated unit in the Department of Social Services for investigation of fraud, and collaboration with the South Dakota Attorney General's office and U.S. Attorney. A toll free fraud reporting telephone number is also available to provide a convenient means to report fra ud. Surveys and quality assurance reports will also be used to monitor the quality and appropriateness of services provided the SCHIP clients. Client surveys have been an important part of the SCHIP annual reporting that has been completed by South Dakota for each year of the SCHIP program. . Specific questions are addressed to the families of SCHIP children asking about the quality and satisfaction that families have with the services provided. These surveys and the specific questions will continue under the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. A number of quality assurance reports based on the HEDIS model have been completed for the SCHIP eligible children covered under South Dakota's SCHIP program. These reports specifically address the key areas of immunization, well child and well baby. In addition to reports on those subjects reports have been completed on Dental, Optometry, Asthma, Substance Abuse, and Eating Disorders. Plans include repeating these measure to monitor progress and also to expand the number of measures under the HEDIS to be completed for the SCHIP children in South Dakota. Will the state utilize any of the following tools to assure quality? (Check all that apply and describe the activities for any categories utilized.) 7.1.1. Quality standards The state will establish standards for the performance of PCP's to meet for the well child screenings and immunization levels for children in the CHIP NM program. 7.1.2. Performance measurement South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 91 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 The state will conduct HEDIS based measurement studies for immunization, dental, well child screenings, optometry, substance abuse and mental health services. 7.1.3. Information strategies 7.1.4. Quality improvement strategies 7.2. Describe the methods used, including monitoring, to assure: (2102(a)(7)(B)) (42CFR 457.495) 7.2.1 Access to well -baby care, well -child care, well -adolescent care and childhood and adolescent immunizations. (Section 2102(a)(7)) (42CFR 457.495(a)) In addition to inclusion on the HCFA 416 report that measures utilization of EPSDT services, South Dakota, as part of its SCHIP general satisfaction survey of recipients routinely asks recipients access to care questions. The survey instrument specifically asks questions relating to well child care, immunizations, vision services, substance abuse and dental services. The surveys provide excellent feedback regarding recipients access to care. Parents of SCHIP kids are routinely provided with educational materials relating to EPSDT services to inform them on the importance of preventive healthcare. Access to quality primary and preventive health services will be measured by the number of new SCHIP children enrolled in medical assistance primary care case management system. Utilization based studies for immunization, dental, well child screenings, optometry, substance abuse and mental health services will be used to provide additional measurement of access to services. Further, additional measurements are c ollected in accordance with Section 9.3.7 of this state plan and are included in the SCHIP annual reports. 7.2.2 Access to covered services, including emergency services as defined in 42 CFR 457.10. (Section 2102(a)(7)) 42CFR 457.495(b)) SCHIP will use the same delivery system, provider network and covered services as the Medicaid program in South Dakota. One of the benefits of this arrangement is the excellent provider participation for all types of service providers in the State. Nearly all primary care an d specialty physicians participate in the program, all inpatient and outpatient hospitals participate, nearly all pharmacies participate, and participation from allied health providers is also very good. Using the PCCM system for SCHIP facilitates access t o primary care and the use of PCP's to provide referrals for non- emergency specialty services enhances access to specialty services as referral arrangements with PCP's are established and specialists are not accessed for primary care purposes. The selected SCHIP program structure allows the maximum use of the available South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 92 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 rural providers to enhance access to services in the rural areas of South Dakota. The Indian Health Service and Tribal services are key resources in the most under -serve d areas of the State. Each IHS service unit has participating PCP providers in the PCCM program. The SCHIP program is also structured so those eligible clients have maximum access to IHS programs without a referral from another PCP if the individuals have selected a non-IHS PCP. Tribal clinics are also eligible to be PCP providers as federally qualified health centers (FQHC's). Rural areas outside of American Indian reservation are served by rural health clinics and federally qualified health centers that are also enrolled as PCP entities to enhance service availability. Favorable reimbursement mechanisms are in place for all of these provider types to ensure the availability of services. Under the PCCM program the Department of Social Service s carefully monitors the capacity of each participating PCP and presently averages about 85 enrollees per PCP entity, with very few PCP's closed to new enrollees. PCP's are limited to a maximum of 750 enrollees. County and sub -state areas are also monitored for PCP availability. Most PCCM participants select their own PCP's and have free choice of providers for non -PCCM services. Time and distance standards ensure that P CCM enrollees do not have to travel more than 75 miles to their PCP. Routine monitoring of PCP performance also includes an analysis of PCP provided services versus referred services with the dual purpose of ensuring PCP's are accessible and providing serv ices to enrolled clients, and also not withholding appropriate referrals for specialty care. The Department also carefully monitors the PCP changes and disenrollment reasons to assure that access to care issues are resolved. In addition, the Department randomly monitors PCP compliance with 24 hour per day, seven day per week requirement for PCP availability. The SCHIP program uses the definition and procedure for accessing emergency services that applies to Medicaid that are consistent with Federal law. Access and availability to services are presently monitored under Medicaid. This monitoring will also include SCHIP enrollees. Surveys of participants to measure access to services, waiting times, and satisfaction with service availability will conti nue to be completed with all Medicaid and SCHIP children. 7.2.3 Appropriate and timely procedures to monitor and treat enrollees with chronic, complex, or serious medical conditions, including access to an adequate number of visits to specialists experienced in treating the specific medical condition and access to out -of-network providers when the network is not adequate for the enrollee's medical condition. (Section 2102(a)(7)) (42CFR 457.495(c)) Individuals with special healthcare needs are exem pt from managed care South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 93 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 requirements. As such, these individuals are not restricted under the SCHIP program. All SCHIP recipients have the same access to specialists as private pay individuals or individuals with private health insurance. 7.2.4 Decisions related to the prior authorization of health services are completed in accordance with state law or, in accordance with the medical needs of the patient, within 14 days after the receipt of a request for services. (Section 2102(a)(7)) (42CFR 457.495(d)) Decisions related to the prior authorization of health services are completed in accordance with the medical needs of the patient, within 14 days after the receipt of a request for services. The prior authorization policy is consistent with the prior authorizations under the South Dakota Medicaid Program. Oftentimes, the request for prior authorization does not contain sufficient documentation to make a determination. When that occurs, the physicians are contacted, additional documentat ion is requested, and the determination is made upon receipt of the additional documentation. The department maintains a database of prior authorizations, and monitoring of the determination within 14 days of receipt can be easily documented. Section 8. Cost Sharing and Payment (Section 2103(e)) Check here if the state elects to use funds provided under Title XXI only to provide expanded eligibility under the state's Medicaid plan , and continue on to Section 9. 8.1. Is cost-sharing imposed on any of the children covered under the plan? (42CFR 457.505) 8.1.1. YES 8.1.2. NO, skip to question 8.8. 8.2. Describe the amount of cost-sharing, any sliding scale based on income, the group or groups of enrollees that may be subject to the charge and the service for which the charge is imposed or time period for the charge, as appropriate. are excluded from cost-sharing requirements. 8.3. Describe how the public will be notified, including the public schedule, of this cost- sharing (including the cumulative maximum) and changes to these amounts and any differences based on income. (Section 2103(e)((1)(B)) (42CFR 457.505(b)) 8.4. The state assures that it has made the following findings with respect to the South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 94 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 cost in its plan: (Section 2103(e)) 8.4.1. 8.4.2. 8.4.3 Cost-sharing does not favor children from higher income families over lower income families. (Section 2103(e)(1)(B)) (42CFR 457.530) No cost-sharing applies 2103(e)(2)) (42CFR 457.520) No additional cost-sharing applies to the costs of emergency medical services delivered outside the network. (Section 2103(e)(1)(A))(42CFR 457.515(f)) 8.5. Describe how the state will ensure that the annual aggregate cost -sharing for a family does not exceed 5 percent of such family's income for the length of the child's eligibility period in the State . Include a description of the procedures that do not primarily rely on a refund given by the state for overpayment by an enrollee: (Section 2103(e)(3)(B)) (42CFR 457.560(b) and 457.505(e)) 8.6 Describe the procedures the state will use to ensure American Indian (as defined by the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976) and Alaska Native children will be excluded from cost -sharing. (Section 21 03(b)(3)(D)) (42CFR 457.535) 8.7 Please provide a description of the consequences for an enrollee or applicant who does not pay a charge. (42CFR 457.570 and 457.505(c)) 8.7.1 Please provide an assurance that the following disenrollment protections are being applied: State has established a process that gives enrollees reasonable notice of and an opportunity to pay past due premiums, copayments, coinsurance, deductibles or similar fees prior to disenrollment. (42CFR 457.570(a)) The disenrollment process affords the enrollee an opportunity to show that the enrollee's family income has declined prior to disenrollment for non payment of cost-sharing charges. (42CFR 457.570(b)) In the instance mentioned above, that the state will facilitate enrolling the child in Medicaid or adjust the child's cost -sharing category as appropriate. (42CFR 457.570(b)) The state provides the enrollee with an opportunity for an impartial review to address disenrollment from the program. (42CFR 457.570(c)) 8.8 The state assures that it has made the following findings with respect to the payment aspects of its plan: (Section 2103(e)) 8.8.1. No Federal funds will be used toward state matching requirements. (Section 2105(c)(4)) (42CFR 457.220) 8.8.2. No cost-sharing (including premiums, deductibles, copays, South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 95 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 coinsurance and all other types) will be used toward state matching requirements. (Section 2105(c)(5) (42CFR 457.224) (Previously 8.4.5) 8.8.3. No funds under this title will be used for coverage if a private insurer would have been obligated to provide such assistance except for a provision limiting this obligation because the child is eligible under this title. (Section 2105(c)(6)(A)) (42CFR 457.626(a)(1)) 8.8.4. Income and resource standards and methodologies for determining Medicaid eligibility are not more restrictive than those applied as of June 1, 1997. (Section 2105(d)(1)) (42CFR 457.622(b)(5)) 8.8.5. No funds provided under this title or coverage funded by this title will include coverage of abortion except if necessary to save the life of the mother or if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest. (Section 2105)(c)(7)(B)) (42CFR 457.475) 8.8.6. No funds provided under this title will be used to pay for any abortion or to assist in the purchase, in whole or in part, for coverage that includes abortion (except as described above). (Section 2105)(c)(7)(A)) (42CFR 457.475) Section 9. Strategic Objectives and Performance Goals and Plan Administration (Section 2107) 9.1. Describe strategic objectives for increasing the extent of creditable health coverage among targeted low -income children and other low -income children: (Section 2107(a)( 2)) (42CFR 457.710(b)) South Dakota implemented CHIP -NM as an additional effort to address the objectives stated in the original M-SCHIP state plan. Those objectives are: 1. Achieve a measurable reduction in the number of uninsured children in South Dakota beginning July 1, 1998. 2. Improve access to quality primary and preventive health care services under Medicaid for approved SCHIP eligibles, new Medicaid eligibles, and previously non-enrolled children on July 1, 1998. 3. Develop better measurement capabilities of health insurance coverage, and health care service availability and quality to children in South Dakota, beginning July 1, 1998.

Measures will come from the HCFA 416 report, the Department of Health Immunization tracking system, and the evaluation process used in South Dakota's PRIME managed care program operated under 1915(b) waiver authority. This evaluation process also uses client and provider surveys independent evaluations and clinical studies to report cost effectiveness and quality to CMS for waiver renewal purposes, and annual SCHIP reporting requirements. South Dakota will request the managed care waiver be incorporated into its Medicaid and SCHIP state plans. 3. Develop better measurement capabilities of health insurance coverage, health care service availability and quality to children in South Dakota. 3.1 Modify the Medicaid Management Information System to make CHIP -NM tracking and reporting capabilities available to measure enrollment, service, utilization, and overall program effectiveness. This enhancement will make all MARS and CMS reports available for CHIP -NM. 9.3. Describe how performance under the plan will be measured through objective, independently verifiable means and compared against performance goals in order to determine the state's performance, taking into account suggested p erformance indicators as specified below or other indicators the state develops: (Section 2107(a)(4)(A),(B)) (42CFR 457.710(d)) 1. Achieve a measurable reduction in the number of uninsured children in South Dakota. The success of this objective will be determined by the number of uninsured children in South Dakota who receive health insurance coverage as the result of the CHIP - NM State Plan amendment, M -SCHIP, or Medicaid coverage. Evidence of this reduction will come from South Dakota medical assistanc e enrollment figures, estimates provided by the United States Census Bureau and supported with survey data from the Behavioral Health Survey and other publications. (The South Dakota Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is designed to collect information on the health behaviors in the State. The survey was initiated in 1987 by the South Dakota Department of Health with the assistance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and has been on -going since 1987. For the SCHIP Program in South Dakota, the BRFSS surveys South Dakotans to assist in measurements as to why a child is without health insurance, whether coverage such as Medicaid and SCHIP have been considered for those who respond that the child is uninsured, crowd out issues, etc. to determine effectiveness of outreach promotions.) 2. Improve access to quality primary and preventive health care services under Medicaid for CHIP -NM eligible children. South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 98 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 Access to quality primary and preventive health services will be measured by the number of new CHIP -NM children enrolled in medical assistance primary care case management system. Utilization based studies for immunization, dental, well child screenings, optometry, substance abuse and mental health services will be used to provide additional measurement of access to services. 3. Develop better measurement capabilities of health insurance coverage, and health care service availability and quality to children in South Dakota. Adequate data is available for the completion of annual reports and evaluations for CHIP -NM as well as the original M-SCHIP program in compliance with Section 9.5 of this State Plan Amendment.

Briefly describe the state's plan for these annual assessments and reports. (Section 2107(b)(2)) (42CFR 457.750) The South Dakota Department of Social Services will evaluate the operation and effectiveness of its State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) on an ongoing basis and report the findings to CMS by January 1 of each year. A variety of data sources will be utilized to evaluate South Dakota's program.

(Section 2107(c)) (42CFR 457.120(a) and (b)) The SCHIP program was initiated and authorized by specific action of the 1998 and 2000 South Dakota State Legislature which authorized the Department of Social Services to develop a program for low income uninsured children up to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level under the Federal Title XXI program. South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 100 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 Pursuant to this direction from the Legislature the Department of Social Services developed Administr ative Rules for the administration and delivery of the SCHIP process. These rules were promulgated, heard, and implemented with the public process specified in the South Dakota Administrative Procedures Act. Public Notice was made in several newspapers and a Public Hearing was conducted to inform the public of the new program, eligibility, covered services, and other provisions of the SCHIP program. Further public involvement was obtained by presentation of the SCHIP program to the Medical Advisory Committe e, (meets semi -annually) and the Board of Social Services (meets quarterly) prior to implementation. The Medical Advisory Committee and the Board of Social Services are advisory groups that provide input into the design, implementation and operation of the Medical Assistance Program. (Titles XIX and XXI) Inasmuch as the State Plan Amendment does not include a reduction in services or increase in cost sharing, but rather an expansion of services and coverage under the SCHIP program a pu blic process is not required. However, with the public action of the South Dakota Legislature and the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act, the Department has, in its judgement, allowed adequate public input in the design and implementation of SCHIP. The Department recognizes that the SCHIP program does not differ significantly from the current delivery system and coverage under medical assistance programs in South Dakota, with the exception of expanded eligibility. The Department will continue to actively solicit public involvement in the delivery of the Medical Assistance Program benefits under Titles XIX and XXI. The Department will ensure ongoing public involvement in the design and implementation of the SCHIP state plan through the processes described above. In addition, the Department continues it's long -standing policy to provide for ongoing public involvement in the operation of the Medical Assistance Program. (Titles XIX and XXI) The Department has regular contacts with advocacy groups, and an open door policy to provide advocacy groups and individuals the opportunity to present input and feedback on the operation of the program. The Department meets with advocacy groups and individuals that request such a meeting. 9.9.1 Descr ibe the process used by the state to ensure interaction with Indian Tribes and organizations in the state on the development and implementation of the procedures required in 42 CFR 457.125. (Section 2107(c)) (42CFR 457.120(c)) Consultation meetings have been held between the State and Tribal Government and Tribal Health officials. In addition, the Department has invited both Tribal South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 101 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 Government and the IHS to be represented on the Medicaid Advisory Committee that assists in the monitoring of the Medicaid and SCHIP programs, and both entities are participating. Some Tribal health departments have requested specific training of the their Community Health Representative staff in the SCHIP program and this training was provided by Department eligibility staff. One reservation even adapted the SCHIP radio ad to use in reaching the Indian population on their reservation. Outreach brochures, posters and logos for SCHIP were designed with a culturally sensitive logo depicting childr en of varying ethnic backgrounds in an effort to convey that the program is intended for all races of children. 9.9.2 For an amendment relating to eligibility or benefits (including cost sharing and enrollment procedures), please describe how and when prior public notice was provided as required in 457.65(b) through (d). 9.10. Provide a one year projected budget. A suggested financial form for the budget is attached. The budget must describe: (Section 2107(d)) (42CFR 457.140) The following budget figures re present the estimated cost of serving the CHIP -NM, and M-SCHIP children for FFY 2000, FFY 2001, and FFY 2002 . All of the funds used to operate the SCHIP programs by matching the federal funds have been allocated from the State's General fund, as part of the General Appropriation bill. The State assures no general funds have been raised from impermissible provider taxes or donations, and that the State is in compliance with Section 1903 (w) of the Social Security Act. Three budget sheets are presented, one for the CHIP -NM, one for the existing M -SCHIP program, and the total for South Dakota SCHIP. A three year CHIP -NM budget is presented. FFY2000 budget amounts are estimated using three months of FFY 2000 from July to September of 2000. Estima tes for FFY2001 and FFY2002 represent a full year of operation. This budget assumes 600 clients for FFY 2000, 2,400 clients for FFY 2001, and 2,700 for FFY 2002. The CHIP -NM service budget is based upon funds appropriated by the South Dakota Legislature. This appropriation was based on an average cost of $991 per eligible child per year. Amounts were then allocated to service categories using utilization figures from currently eligible M -SCHIP children from July, 1999 through April, 2000. Administrative co sts for CHIP -NM are calculated at 10% of the allowable service and administration costs. The percentages allocated to administrative categories reflect the best estimates of actual anticipated expenditures by the State. Recognizing that South Dakota curre ntly operates a M-SCHIP program, an updated 3 year budget for M -SCHIP is also presented for all of FFY 2000, FFY 2001, and FFY 2002. This budget is based on 3,839 clients for FFY 2000, 3,839 clients for FFY 2001, South Dakota Children's Health Insurance Program State Plan 102 Effective Date: October 24, 2019 Approval Date: December 13, 2021 and 4,139 clients for FFY 2002. The average cost per client for FFY 2000 and FFY 2001 is $1,033 per child, per year based on actual costs from July -April of SFY 2000. Amounts have been allocated to service categories using utilization figures from the same time period. Administrati ve costs are estimated at 10% of the allowable expenditures for services and administration. These costs are based upon current state estimates of anticipated expenditures. A total SCHIP budget for South Dakota for the three federal fiscal years is also presented. This budget is the sum of the anticipated expenditures for CHIP -NM and M-SCHIP in South Dakota.
