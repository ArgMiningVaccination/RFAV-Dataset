You may often remind yourself and others that it's likely easier to prevent illness than it is to treat it, and are mindful of staying in a constant healthy state. 7. You don't get lost in the details Instead of focusing on minor, insignificant details, you think big. From relationships and professional projects to life goals and travel plans, you use \"big picture\" thinking to ensure optimal results. 8. You like being alone Regardless of your passion to help and love people, frequently being around others can drain you of your energy. Because of your sensitivity to the emotions and energies of other people, you enjoy being alone and require independent quiet time to recharge. 9. Helping people is your purpose Many great energy practitioners feel that their primary purpose on this earth is to help others. If you feel this way - like helping others is actually your job and any money earned is simply an added benefit - you might want to consider a career in energy healing. 10. You've suffered from mental health issues If you've had this struggle, you're definitely not alone! Many energy practitioners have struggled with their own feelings of anxiousness, melancholy, or other issues. These things tend to arise because fitting into the fast-paced, ever-competitive world can feel impossible and exhausting to someone with your sensitivity. All of us are human and susceptible to similar struggles. 11. You can point out patterns Odd as it may seem, noticing and perceiving patterns may be a sign of natural energy healing abilities. If you're able to quickly and easily identify patterns in virtually everything - it may not be a coincidence; it may be a sign of your natural talents! 12. You're an outsider Unlike some people who yearn to be the center of attention or at the forefront of social events, you've always tended to be an outsider and have felt like an outcast for a majority of your life. 13. You are an introvert You are a multi-dimensional being who has the power to dial in to both the seen and the unseen world. This can sometimes make the visual, conscious world difficult to navigate, which prompts you to withdraw and be more introverted than others. 14. You know when someone is suffering You may have a keen ability to identify when someone is suffering. Without speaking to them or observing any blatant, indicative actions, you may simply feel and sense when someone is possibly struggling with trapped energies and emotions. 15.

You connect with animals Regardless of whether you currently own or would like to own a pet, your connection with animals is undeniable. Like people who may be very vulnerable to their emotions, feelings, and experiences, animals are often helpless when it comes to communicating wants and needs. Furthermore, you - like many animals - have heightened senses that enhance your ability to help and comfort others. 17. You're a peacemaker Your uncanny ability to maintain peace in hostile, volatile situations could be a prime sign of your special abilities. Whether people come to you or you seek out others, your peacemaking skills make you a go-to source for tranquility, understanding, and harmony. 18. You don't see in black and white Instead of categorizing everything as black and white or right and wrong, you may think in shades of grey. This trait allows you to not only connect with others on a deeper level, but also enables you to reach levels of understanding that others can't. 19. People are drawn to you Despite your introverted predisposition, your energy may draw people to you.

Your calm demeanor and deeply empathetic spirit may make people gravitate toward you for comfort. 20. You're different than those you surround yourself with Though we are all unique and different in our own ways, as a potential energy healer, your differences may stand out immensely from your friends and those around you. Not only might you think and act differently, but you could also have very different hobbies and prefer to spend your free time in other ways. 21. You've experienced emotional trauma As crushing and heartbreaking as emotional trials can be, they can also heighten your senses and improve your ability to ease those burdens in others. Whether you've experienced the loss of a loved one, a life-threatening disease, violence, or a near-death occurrence, the upheaval you've been through can help you help others. 22. You have vivid dreams Energy healers may have notably vivid dreams and nightmares. Your hypersensitivity to emotions and energies can often have a profound effect on your subconscious as you sleep. 23. You can control your own energy Being able to control the energy in and around yourself is another trait energy healers may possess. Unlike others who have little control over their emotions and energies, you might be able to not only distinguish between energies, but even adjust them for your own personal balance as well as the balance of those around you. 24. You have physical sensations you can't explain Do you frequently suffer from discomfort in your head, joints, neck, or shoulders? Do you or have you experienced chronic, inexplicable physical distress? These may be common traits in someone who would make a good energy healer. 25.

Regardless of the inconvenience or risk of loss for yourself, your impulse is to give, help, ease, and comfort. 26. People turn to you for advice People may be attracted to your energy in a way that makes you a target for people needing advice, guidance, and help in life. Regardless of your confidence and ability to find your purpose or answer your own pressing questions, you're likely excellent at guiding others through the ups and downs of life. 27. You're feel spurred to show others deeper levels of consciousness Do you feel a shift happening in our global consciousness? Do you feel a natural inclination to help those around you reach deeper levels of spiritual and emotional understanding? These may be characteristics of someone who might want to pursue energy healing. 28. You can sense changes in weather Perhaps your heightened sense of energies allows you to notice small details that others don't. For example, you may find that you're able to detect changes in the weather sooner than the average person. This trait, called weather sensitivity, is often possessed by those in the alternative healing arts. 29. You listen to hear Communicating with people can be a challenge, especially if you're talking with someone who hears to you, but doesn't actually listen to what you're saying. As an empathetic person with a natural inclination to help people, you may be a superb listener who has the ability to deeply understand what others are saying. Because of this, you can better perceive who they are, what they need, and how you can help. 30. You make people happy Along with your goal to help the wants and needs of others, you might also have a deep-rooted desire to ease people's pain and boost their happiness. When someone is sad, your empathetic instincts can help buoy them up. 31. Nature is your solitude As a bridge between nature and humans, you might feel most at home when you're surrounded by nature. Whether meditating in the mountains, reading by a river, or walking along the seashore, the more time you're able to spend in the natural world, the better your abilities may become. 32. You have uniquely spiritual superpowers Maybe you frequently have unique impressions about other people or things to come, or find that a simple touch from you makes someone else feel better. Maybe you've experienced psychic powers or have been able to communicate with others without using words. These things don't make you crazy; they make you special. 33. You're easily exhausted As a compassionate, empathetic person, you may hear, see, feel, and sense things that others don't. You may sense and even personally feel the emotions or pain of others, which can make social situations extremely taxing. Because of this, you often find yourself exhausted after a day of interacting with others. 34. You're drawn to holistic happenings Your inclination to help others might have lead you down various holistic paths, or prompted you to live a non-traditional lifestyle. Whether you have a collection of healing gemstones or have spent a lot of time at holistic retreats, you're always looking for ways to boost your understanding of spiritual, energetic realms. 35. Doctor's aren't your thing Because of your homeopathic inclinations, you might tend to maintain optimal health and rarely need to go to the doctor for medical treatment. 36. You have a knack for leadership Despite your preference to spend time alone and avoid big groups, you may have a natural ability to lead. Maybe you don't shy away from opportunities to show others the way - especially when it involves anything surrounding energy healing and enlightenment. 37. Strangers open up to you Friends, family, and acquaintances may often turn to you for help. However, you might also be approached by strangers, or strike up conversations with them, to find that they open up to you right away. Again, your empathetic energy tends to draw these people to you. 38. Children are drawn to you You enjoy spending time with children and find that kids who are particularly withdrawn or shy feel more comfortable and less reluctant in your presence. 39. You're always gauging the mood Maybe you walk into a room and immediately assess the mood or vibe of the people in it. Whether you're at a family gathering or a work event, your impulse to gauge the mood is evidence of your natural skills in energetic \"pinging\" that can be used to quickly read another's energy. 40. You're excited to help people Perhaps the most important characteristic of energy practitioners is their passion. You might be constantly excited about the concept of using energy and holistic methods to ease an array of physical, emotional, or mental distress. If you possess all or some of these traits, a career in energy healing might be the perfect calling for you.
