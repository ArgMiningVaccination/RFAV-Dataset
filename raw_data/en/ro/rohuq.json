Testimonials \"Reiki and the homeopathic supplements helped me be able to continue working. (They) have been helping me with the side effects (of chemotherapy) and I am so thankful for the relief this has provided. I believe that we still have much to learn about treating cancer, but the use of Reiki and homeopathic medicine is finally becoming recognized for its ability to improve your health and prognosis as part of an overall treatment plan.\" -Patty B. Stage IV Cancer Patient, Colfax, IL \"A month ago I had surgery. Before hand I saw Homeopathic physician Janine Maere. She gave me her full attention and did not rush through our visit. She explained all of the supplements and how to properly use them. Although I had swelling after my surgery I had absolutely none of the bruising my surgeon had told me to expect. \" -Jeri M.
