Lawmakers Are Now Mulling Limits.](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/temp-nurses-missouri-legislation-hospital-costs/) Missouri is considering making it a felony to jack up temporary health care staffing prices during a statewide or national emergency. It's one of at least 14 states looking to reel in travel nurse costs, after many hospitals struggled to pay for needed staffers earlier in the covid pandemic. (Bram Sable-Smith, ) [ California's Covid Misinformation Law Is Entangled in Lawsuits, Conflicting Rulings](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/california-lawsuits-covid-doctor-misinformation-law/) A state law says giving false information to patients about covid-19 constitutes unprofessional conduct for which regulators can discipline doctors. Vaccine skeptics, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., join civil liberties groups and others in arguing that it violates free speech. (Bernard J.

Summaries Of The News: [ Sanofi Joins Competitors In Capping Out-Of-Pocket Insulin Costs ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/sanofi-joins-competitors-in-capping-out-of-pocket-insulin-costs/) Sanofi announced Thursday that it will cap out-of-pockets insulin costs at $35 a month for consumers with private insurance, following in the footsteps of the other two biggest insulin makers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Sanofi will also lower list prices of its most prescribed insulin, Lantus, and its fast-acting insulin, Apidra. [ NBC News: Sanofi Announces Insulin Price Cap Of $35 Per Month Out-Of-Pocket ](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/sanofi-insulin-price-cap-rcna75346) Sanofi will cap the out-of-pocket cost of its most popular insulin, Lantus, at $35 per month for people with private insurance, the French drugmaker said Thursday. The change will take effect Jan. 1, 2024. Sanofi is the last of three major insulin makers in the United States to cut or cap the price of the drug. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk announced changes to how they price their insulin this month. Together, the three drugmakers make up roughly 90% of the insulin market in the U.S. (Lovelace Jr., 3/16) [ Reuters: Sanofi To Cut US Price Of Its Most-Prescribed Insulin By 78% ](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/sanofi-cut-price-its-most-prescribed-insulin-by-78-us-2023-03-16/) In addition to Lantus, Sanofi said it will cut by 70% the list price for its fast-acting insulin, Apidra. Sanofi said it already offered a lower priced version of Lantus but that it had not been taken up widely by insurance programs. The branded list price of Lantus is $438.07 for the pre-filled pens and $292.07 for a 10 ml vial. Those would come down to $96 and $64, respectively.

Medicaid has required drug companies to pay rebates when they significantly raise prices over time. But the amount drug companies paid Medicaid was capped in previous years. The new provision, part of the American Rescue Plan Act passed in 2021, eliminates the rebate cap beginning next year. In other words, drug companies could face significant financial penalties beginning next year, said Antonio Ciaccia, CEO of 46brooklyn Research, a nonprofit that researches drug pricing.

CBS News reports on shortages of Pluvicto, a drug used against advanced prostate cancer. [ CIDRAP: Shortages Of 4 Drugs May Complicate Cancer Care ](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/shortages-4-drugs-may-complicate-cancer-care) Amid shortages of three generic drugs widely used to treat common cancers in both adults and children, hospital officials worry that they may have to treat patients with less-effective medications or lower-than-recommended doses, Endpoints News reports. Injectable methotrexate, cisplatin, and fluorouracil are all in shortage, according to the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP). Methotrexate comes in both oral and injectable forms, while the other two drugs are available only as injectables. (Van Beusekom, 3/16) [ CBS News: Drug Used To Treat Advanced Prostate Cancer In Short Supply, Novartis Says ](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pluvicto-short-supply-advanced-prostate-cancer-novartis/) Pluvicto, a drug used to treat advanced prostate cancer, is in short supply, the Food and Drug Administration reported last week.

It's a new request from the agency chief, who's long pushed to find new ways to test drugs. \"I'm not aware of a major effort by the insurance plans to help people get studies done,\" he said at America's Health Insurance Plans conference on Thursday. \"In fact, what I'm hearing from clinicians out there is just the opposite, that it's very hard to do research in the current environment.\" (Wilkerson, 3/16) [ Stat: FDA To Ask For Expert Review Of Sarepta Gene Therapy For Duchenne ](https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/16/fda-to-convene-advisory-panel-for-sareptas-gene-therapy-for-duchenne/) In a sudden about-face, the Food and Drug Administration will hold a meeting of outside experts to consider whether or not to approve Sarepta's experimental gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The announcement Thursday comes just weeks after the company said the FDA had told it an advisory panel meeting to review the treatment, called SRP-9001, would not be necessary. The decision to review Sarepta's gene therapy without input from outside experts surprised some analysts and patient advocates.

It's now clear that theoretical risk is a real one. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative announced Thursday that six children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and one in Burundi have been paralyzed by viruses from the new vaccine, which is referred to as novel oral polio vaccine, or nOPV2.

[ The Atlantic: The Strongest Evidence Yet That An Animal Started The Pandemic ](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/03/covid-origins-research-raccoon-dogs-wuhan-market-lab-leak/673390/) This week, an international team of virologists, genomicists, and evolutionary biologists may have finally found crucial data to help fill that knowledge gap. A new analysis of genetic sequences collected from the market shows that raccoon dogs being illegally sold at the venue could have been carrying and possibly shedding the virus at the end of 2019. It's some of the strongest support yet, experts told me, that the pandemic began when SARS-CoV-2 hopped from animals into humans, rather than in an accident among scientists experimenting with viruses. (Wu, 3/16) [ The New York Times: New Data Links Pandemic's Origins To Raccoon Dogs At Wuhan Market ](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/science/covid-wuhan-market-raccoon-dogs-lab-leak.html) An international team of virus experts said on Thursday that they had found genetic data from a market in Wuhan, China, linking the coronavirus with raccoon dogs for sale there, adding evidence to the case that the worst pandemic in a century could have been ignited by an infected animal that was being dealt through the illegal wildlife trade. ... The jumbling together of genetic material from the virus and the animal does not prove that a raccoon dog itself was infected. And even if a raccoon dog had been infected, it would not be clear that the animal had spread the virus to people. Another animal could have passed the virus to people, or someone infected with the virus could have spread the virus to a raccoon dog. (Mueller, 3/16) [ Science: Unearthed Genetic Sequences From China Market May Point To Animal Origin Of COVID-19 ](https://www.science.org/content/article/covid-19-origins-missing-sequences) A scientific sleuth in France has identified previously undisclosed genetic data from a food market in Wuhan, China, that she and colleagues say support the theory that coronavirus-infected animals there triggered the COVID-19 pandemic. Several of the researchers presented their findings on Tuesday to the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), an expert group convened last year by the World Health Organization. \"The data does point even further to a market origin,\" says Kristian Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at Scripps Research who attended the meeting and is one of the scientists analyzing the new data. If so, the findings weaken the view of a vocal minority that a virology lab in Wuhan was the likely origin of SARS-CoV-2, perhaps when the coronavirus infected a lab worker, who spread it further.

The briefing follows the news that the department now concludes with \"low confidence\" that the virus more likely originated in a lab in Wuhan, China, rather than through natural evolution. (Clason, 3/16) [ Focus On Paxlovid's Effectiveness Against Covid With FDA Endorsement ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/focus-on-paxlovids-effectiveness-against-covid-with-fda-endorsement/) News outlets cover developments about covid treatment Paxlovid, as a study shows it's 80% effective against severe covid if taken inside the first five days. A panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration also endorsed the drug as an option for adults at high risk for severe covid. [ The New York Times: F.D.A. Advisers Endorse Paxlovid's Benefits As A Covid Treatment ](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/health/fda-paxlovid-covid.html) A panel of expert advisers to the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday endorsed Paxlovid as a treatment for adults with Covid who are at high risk for progression to severe illness. The move is likely to lead to full approval of the drug, which has been available under emergency use authorization. The 16-1 vote came after the agency released a new analysis showing that Paxlovid reduced hospitalizations and deaths among both unvaccinated and vaccinated people. Agency researchers estimated, based on Covid rates in January, that Paxlovid could \"lead to 1,500 lives saved and 13,000 hospitalizations averted each week in the United States.\" (Zimmer and Jewett, 3/16) [ Axios: Questions Still Swirl Over Paxlovid As FDA Full Approval Nears ](https://www.axios.com/2023/03/17/paxlovid-fda-approval-nears) Pfizer's antiviral Paxlovid is one step closer to gaining full approval from the Food and Drug Administration, but whether that convinces more doctors to prescribe it is an open question.

SSM Health, Mercy and St. Luke's no longer require patients, visitors or staff to wear masks, the hospitals said, citing decreased levels of COVID-19 in the community and low hospitalizations. \"We cannot have a black-and-white approach to mandates just because the overwhelming number of us are fortunate enough to maybe be of a certain demographic that doesn't put us at risk,\" Dr. Mati Hlatshwayo Davis, the health director for St. Louis, said Thursday.

In a message to lawmakers, the governor warned of \"the chilling effect other potential laws may have\" on the ability of doctors to speak frankly with patients but expressed confidence that the one he was signing did not cross that line. Yet the law \u2014 meant to discipline doctors who give patients false information about covid-19 \u2014 is now in legal limbo after two federal judges issued conflicting rulings in recent lawsuits that say it violates free speech and is too vague for doctors to know what it bars them from telling patients.
