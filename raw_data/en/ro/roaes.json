At a media briefing on Thursday he advised \"It protects you; it also protects those around you. It stops you eventually if you do become ill, transmitting that, getting sick and causing someone else to become sick. And of course, it protects our healthcare system, and reduces the burden of illness.\" Cavan and Monaghan COVID-19 Vaccination Centres and Pop up mobile clinics are offering primary vaccinations and adapted bivalent booster doses to eligible cohorts.
