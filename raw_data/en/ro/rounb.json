The center has a history of supporting high-impact research and discovery in regenerative medicine, reproductive biology, immunology, virology, aging and metabolic disease, neuroendocrinology, and behavior. Our NIH-funded research has helped advance therapies for people with HIV, kidney disease, glaucoma, developmental disorders, autoimmune diseases, mental illness, polycystic ovary syndrome, infections that threaten healthy pregnancies and much more. Our research last year contributed to the COVID-19 vaccines we have today. Our center's pioneering stem cell research has led to clinical trials for heart disease, blood cancers, organ transplant, blindness, spinal cord injury and more. This year, we reported a major preclinical, stem-cell based Parkinson's disease treatment that our researchers hope to advance to human clinical trials soon. As we continue to make lifesaving discoveries, we take our responsibility to care for animals in research seriously. We follow animal welfare laws and guidelines and our research and animal care is scrutinized by numerous campus committees and federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health and US Department of Agriculture.

(Yuri Saalmaan and colleagues, 2021) Historically, we also note the related discovery of the Rh factor and its link to Rh disease, or hemolytic disease of the newborn in the 1930s and 1940s. Rh is named after the rhesus monkey. Studies in monkeys leading to this critical blood typing knowledge and safe blood transfusions to treat Rh disease were conducted by Karl Landensteiner, Alexander Wiener and Philip Levine. Levine was a physician who conducted research as well as Rh disease awareness and prevention advocacy at the Rockefeller Institute in New York beginning in 1925, and from 1932-1935 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the Wisconsin General Testing Apparatus (WGTA) were invented at UW-Madison in 1948 by researchers David Grant and Esta Berg. Today, this test and method are the worldwide gold standard for cognitive testing in both animals and people. Computer testing has long replaced the WGTA; however, the method remains essentially the same. Finally, the research of Harry Harlow in the UW-Madison Psychology Department, before he became the Primate Center's first director in 1961, revealed for the first time the critical importance of caregiving and companionship in social and cognitive development.
