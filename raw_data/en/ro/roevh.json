Weese 2:06 PMAAEP News July 2022 III WELLNESS Finding your way back home Using boundaries to become a priority in your own life By Caitlin Daly, DVM Identifying and implementing boundaries doesn't come natural to most of us. Veterinarians are notoriously hard workers, helping others well before we help ourselves. We can tell someone exactly what a patient needs, but rarely have any awareness of our own needs, let alone how to communicate them. As with most newly learned skills, implementing bound- aries can feel incredibly awkward and frustrating at times. We didn't graduate from vet school experts in our field; proficiency develops over time with experience. The grace and understanding we provide to new graduates should also be provided to ourselves. It's worth making ourselves slightly uncomfortable telling someone how we feel and what we need. You'll be surprised how many people will kindly step up to meet your needs. People want to help. They want to show that they care about and respect you. It's just that they don't always know how, and it's on us to tell them. Then if they don't, you can choose if they get to remain a part of your life professionally or personally. Confronting negative emotions It may be counterintuitive, but anger and resentment are very helpful emotions to acknowledge. Experiencing them often means a boundary is being crossed\u2014one you may or may not know was there. Whether it's with a client, office staff, colleague or family member, when you're feeling upset, it is essential that you find time in your day to ask yourself why. Our minds, while brilliant at times, can also be an incredibly toxic place. We will tell ourselves things we would never say to someone else: that we're overreacting, that we have no right to be upset or, better yet, that we should hurry up and get over it. As you would for a child, creating a safe space free of blame, shame and self-depre - cation will help you get to the bottom of your problem and on to a resolution much more effectively. Implementing practice boundaries Want to know one of the most impactful boundaries I've put into practice? It's deciding the type of people I want to work for. In my practice, emergency services are now provided only to current clients. To be a client, one must have a wellness exam, dental and vaccinations performed on their horse annually. No outstanding balances are allowed. I don't sedate, nor do I provide sedation for lay floaters. And I will not tolerate any abusive behavior toward me or my staff. If a client's needs or personal phi - losophies on veterinary care fall outside of that, it's best in the long run that we don't work together. Most importantly, if a client repeatedly refuses services or medication that's in the best interest of the animal while also refusing euthanasia as an alternative to relieving suffering, I'm done. I refuse to be held emotionally hostage by clients. I'm not willing to drown by the weight of their guilt and denial. Just because someone needs a veterinarian, it doesn't mean it has to be me or you. I often hear of veterinarians being upset with clients texting after hours. I understand the frustration, and I also understand why a client would reach out. The thing is, we can't control what others do, we can only control our response. Full disclosure: This is a work in progress for me, but it's incredibly important that I honor my own boundary by not looking at the text until the next business day. It all comes down to self-trust. Do you trust yourself enough to honor your own boundary? To help ourselves be successful, we must provide clients with realistic expectations. This means your auto-response should include when a client can expect to hear back from you (i.e., the next business day) and what they need to do if it's an emergency. A lack of clear expectations opens the door for frustration and confusion. Boundaries became a part of my life out of necessity; now, they're here to help facilitate healthy relationships, including the one I have with myself. I first viewed boundaries as a way of protecting myself and, conse - quently, often communicated them in a rather aggressive manner. I didn't like what was going on, but I didn't know what to do about it other than put an immediate stop to the behavior. Not knowing how I felt had me living in a helpless state of suffocating chaos. Things began to change when I started listening to the voice in my head. More important - ly, it was when I discovered and began believing that deep in my core, I deserved to have my needs met. I'm here to tell you that you do, too.

The guidelines present the clinical features, risk factors, treatment, control measures and more for a form of bacterial placentitis that can cause abortion, stillbirth, or delivery of a weak premature or term foal. NP was first diagnosed in central Kentucky in the mid-1980s, and its occurrence since has varied from sporadic cases to outbreak years in the region. Outside of Kentucky and the United States, NP has been reported primarily as isolated cases and rarely as outbreaks. The suggested window from exposure to clinical signs is generally three to five months. In addition, there is a strong association between weather conditions during mid- to late-pregnancy and increased occurrence of NP, specifically exposure to low rainfall and high tempera - tures during August and September in central Kentucky. \"The insidious nature of NP makes the early diagnosis and onset of treatment rather challenging in clinical practice,\" said guidelines co-author Dr. Igor Canisso, associate professor of theriogenology at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine. Attempts to create experimental NP infection have been unsuccessful, limiting evidence-based assessment of therapy efficacy. Currently, mares suspected to have NP based on ultrasonographic lesions are usually empirically treated with antibiotics (e.g., sulfa, doxycycline, or gentamicin), anti-inflammatories (flunixin and vitamin E).Dr. Canisso co-authored the Nocardioform Placentitis Guidelines with Dr. Maria shareholder and & Riddle Equine Hospital; Carleigh Fedorka, postdoctoral fellow at the University of Kentucky's Maxwell H. Gluck Equine Research Center; and Dr. Barry Ball, who recently retired as the Albert G. Clay Endowed Chair and Professor in Equine Reproduction at the Gluck Equine Research Center.

During the June episode of the AAEP Practice Life podcast, host Dr. Mike Pownall discusses physical and emotional safety in veterinary practice with Dr. Louise Batt, founder of High Country Veterinary Services in Steamboat Springs, Colo., and Dr. Tovah Caldwell, associate with McKee-Pownall Equine Services in Campbellville, Ontario. During a discussion of the importance of having an escape route to minimize the risk of anyone getting hurt during a procedure, Dr. Caldwell stressed the importance of being assertive. \"I've become much more comfortable in having very frank discussions with people\u2014mares that are in the wrong spot or owners not being respectful of the horse's energy or behavior ... Learning to be more direct without being rude and just being very thoughtful in how I speak to people in those moments to imply that this is not safe and you need to move has helped a lot in planning and in just keeping the situation safe and making sure everybody knows what they should be doing in a particular moment.\" Additional topics covered include tips for when you don't have a technician or competent horse handler; approaches to restraint, including sedation; the stigma around wearing a helmet; advice on blocking; maintaining your personal safety when responding to a late-night call or to an unknown property; promoting a practice culture of physical safety; and a preview of Dr. Caldwell's 2022 AAEP Annual Convention paper on how equine veteri - narians are using mindfulness to support their work life.

FoUND AtioN Vet Direct funds help save Kentucky donkey attacked by dogs The Foundation-AAEP-ASPCA partnership enables care when funds run low By Sarah E. Coleman Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Ky., had only been a part of the Vet Direct Safety Net program for a few weeks in early 2022 when a call came in about a donkey that needed immediate help. Dr. David Alexander, a second-year intern with the hospital, headed out to see how he could help. When he arrived, he found a Miniature Mediterranean Donkey named \"Perk\" had been attacked by a pack of dogs, receiving significant trauma and puncture wounds to his inguinal area and scrotum. \"He was missing part of his scrotum and was presenting with an exposed testicle,\" Dr. Alexander said. In order to save Perk, Dr. Alexander performed a castration with scrotal ablation and flushed all of his puncture and bite wounds. \"The donkey would have likely had to have been euthanized without the help from this program,\" he said. Instead, Perk is healing well and doing great, he reports. Designed to reduce the number of horses relinquished to rescues or sent to auction, the Vet Direct program reimburses veterinarians up to $600 per horse when services are rendered for emergency stabilization procedures, euthanasia or disposal to owners who are unable to pay for them. Dr. Alexander and a few of his Rood & Riddle colleagues were onboarded in a group, and information on the program was disseminated to all of the more than 60 vets across the practice's three divisions in Lexington, Ky., Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and Wellington, Fla. Dr. Alexander encourages AAEP-member veterinarians to get onboarded into the program even if they don't have a client who comes to mind immediately who may be able to use it. Enrollment is as easy as filling out the initial form and online questionnaire. \"This is a great program that has been super helpful, and I've been able to use it twice,\" he said. \"You never know when you'll need it!\" In addition to assisting equine owners, the Vet Direct program eases the minds of veterinarians, allowing them to care for horses in immediate need without the stress of offering free services. \"It's a great option for us to provide care to patients where the only barrier we face is the owner's financial constraints,\" Dr. Alexander said. \"It's very challenging to have the knowledge to help and treat patients, but not be able to [do so] due to the owner's financial constraints. This program alleviates that.\" If you are an AAEP-member veterinarian in the U.S. with clients who potentially could struggle to pay for veterinary care, put yourself in a position to help by enrolling in Vet Direct Safety Net.

Platinum Colic Coverage EligibleHighlights of recent clinically relevant papers Rib fractures in adult horses The aim of this retrospective case series by Suzy Hall and co- workers in the UK was to describe the presenting signs , diagnosis ,treatment and outcome of horses diagnosed with rib fracture . The clinical records and diagnostic images of all adult horses diagnosed with a rib fracture at three referral centres over a 15-year period were reviewed. Seventy-three horses met the inclusion criteria. Horses presented due to either resistance to ridden work and poor performance (clinical signs included poor response to rider aids, bucking, bolting, napping, rearing or a reluctance to jump; n =41), lameness (n=21) or trauma (n =7). In four horses, the presenting complaint was not recorded. Clinical assessment and palpation localised the site of injury in 18/47 cases where recorded. In 64 horses (88%; 95% CI 79 -94), one rib was affected; in two horses, two ribs were affected; in three horses, three ribs were affected, and in four horses, four or more ribs were affected. One horse had fractures on both the left and right sides, but in all other horses, the fractures were unilateral: 40 on the left side and 32 on the right side. The 18th rib was the most commonly affected (n =32; 42%; 95% CI 32 -54). Nuclear scintigraphic examination identi ed all fracture sites in which it was performed (59/59). In 10/ 24 horses, radiographic examination con rmed rib fracture. Ultrasonographic examination con rmed rib fracture in 58/ 59 horses (98%; 95% CI 92 -100). Six horses underwent surgery due to ongoing clinical signs and nonhealing fracture; all other horses were managed conservatively. Fifty- ve horses were available for long-term follow-up ( >1 year), of which 28 (51%; 95% CI 38 -64) returned to their previous level of exercise. Twelve horses did not return to their previous level of exercise due to lameness unrelated to the rib fracture, and seven horses were subjected to euthanasia, of which three were due to the rib fracture. Eight horses did not return to their previous level of exercise for other reasons. Although uncommon, rib fractures should be considered in cases of reduced performance or resistance during ridden exercise. Palpation may be unrewarding. Scintigraphy and ultrasonography are useful in identifying the fracture site. Rib fractures in horses carry a fair prognosis and can be managed conservatively in most cases. Recurrent ipsilateral fractures In this retrospective study ,Hiroshi Mita and co-workers in Japan aimed to investigate the recent incidence of carpal fractures and the risk factors for recurrent ipsilateral fractures after arthroscopic removal of clinically active unilateral carpal chip fracture fragments in Thoroughbred racehorses . The records of horses managed under the Japan Racing Association that developed carpal bone fractures between 2014 and 2018 were reviewed. The proportion of cases that developed a recurrent carpal fracture in the originally affected joint was calculated, and the risk factors for recurrent fractures were analysed.In total, 2858 carpal fractures were recorded in the study period (incidence, 0.8%). Of the 554 horses that resumed racing after the treatment of the unilateral major carpal chip fracture, 144 had a recurrent fracture (26.0%). Chip fractures of the third carpal bone (OR 3.7) or a combination of the distal end of the radius and intermediate carpal bone (OR 3.0) were associated with a signi cantly higher risk of recurrent fractures than the distal aspect of the radial carpal bone. The incidence of carpal fractures remained similar to that reported in Japan in the 1990s. The rate of recurrent ipsilateral fractures differed among lesion sites. Transvenous electrical cardioversion Transvenous electrical cardioversion (TVEC) is of the main treatment options for atrial brillation (AF) in horses .The objective of this retrospective study by Ingrid Vernemmen and co-workers at Ghent University ,Belgium was to determine factors affecting cardioversion success ,cardioversion dif culty and recurrence in a Warmblood study sample . Data were obtained from the TVEC records of 199 horses admitted for AF without severe echocardiographic abnormalities. Horse and procedural factors for success and cumulative amount of energy ( 600 J vs. >600 J) were determined using multivariable logistic regression. A survival analysis was performed to determine risk factors for recurrence. A total of 231 TVEC procedures were included, with a 94.4% success rate and 31.9% recurrence 95% CI 1.01 -1.09) were independent determinants for success. type (OR 0.154; CI 0.074 1.003 -1.015) were signi cantly correlated with cumulative amount of energy delivered. Signi cant risk factors for recurrence after a rst AF episode were sex (stallion; HR 1.001; 95% CI 1.0001 -1.0026). Both horse and procedural factors should be considered when assessing treatment options and prognosis in horses with AF. Risk factors for primary uveitis The objectives of this prospective case -control longitudinal study by Fernando Malalana and co-workers atthe University of Liverpool were to determine risk factors for the development of a rst episode of primary uveitis in horses in the UK and to document the proportion of cases that experience recurrence following this rst episode . Horses with the rst episode of primary uveitis between July 2014 and August 2018 were recruited for the study. For each case, two controls were selected. A questionnaire was completed for each horse and multivariable logistic \u00a92022 10.1111/eve.13664regression analysis carried out to identify associations between horse and management-level variables and the risk of uveitis. Each case was then followed longitudinally to determine the rate of recurrence of uveitis. In total, 23 cases and 46 controls were recruited. Being close to a pig farm (OR 27.8; CI 1.31 -592.06) and a recent history of flooding of the pasture (OR 15.43; CI 2.80 -84.98) were associated with increased risk of uveitis. Being in the same owner 's possession for a longer amount of time had a protective effect (OR 0.79; CI 0.68 -0.93). Horses recovered uneventfully following treatment and showed no evidence of recurrence in 59.1% of the cases (n =13). In ve horses (22.7%), the initial episode of uveitis could not be controlled and required surgical therapy. Recurrence was observed in four horses (18.2%). These results indicate that the proportion of cases that experience recurrence is low in the UK. Equine ulcerative keratitis This study by Eline Vercruysse and co-workers in Belgium aimed to describe bacterial isolates and associated antibiotic resistance from horses with ulcerative keratitis . Medical records from horses with ulcerative keratitis presented to a teaching hospital in Belgium over an 8-year period were evaluated. Bacterial isolates were identi ed, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing and resistance detection were performed using an automated system. Samples from 200 eyes of 196 horses were evaluated; 97 eyes had a positive bacterial culture (48.5%), and 139 bacterial isolates were identi ed. Staphylococcus (63/139: 45.3%) and Streptococcus (33/139: 23.7%) were the most frequent genus isolated. Staphylococcus aureus (21/139: 15.1%) was the most frequent species isolated of which were methicillin-resistant (MRS). Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (19/139: 13.7%) was most identi ed bacterial isolate. Only two Pseudomonas species were isolated (2/139: 1.4%). The overall resistance of all bacterial isolates against chloramphenicol (12.4%) and fluoroquinolones (14.3%) was tetracycline and neomycin ranged from 40.8% to 58.6%. When separating the MRS from the other staphylococci, a signi cant difference was noted in percentage of resistance to gentamicin and tetracycline. MRS were highly resistant to gentamicin (75%) tetracycline (100%), whereas the gentamicin (17%) and tetracycline (40.4%). Although Pseudomonas species has been rarely cultured, these results are roughly consistent with previous studies. Multiple drug resistance was high, and resistance to rst- choice antibiotics in ulcerative keratitis was noted. These results warrant continued monitoring of susceptibility pro le.Faecal PCR testing This study by Gary Magdesian and co-workers at the University of California-Davis, USA, evaluated faecal PCR testing for detection of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridioides and other pathogens in 28 foals with diarrhoea . This study evaluated the results of a comprehensive faecal diarrhoea PCR panel in 28 foals that had been presented to a referral hospital because of diarrhoea. Sixteen (57%) foals were positive for C.perfringens and/or gene on faecal PCR, including three foals positive for NetF toxin. These foals were younger and had higher haematocrits, haemoglobin and red blood cell concentrations than foals with diarrhoea that tested negative for clostridial toxins. The foals had lower total protein concentrations and were more likely to have band neutrophils on a CBC (OR: 16.2). All three foals with NetF toxin gene sequences detected in faeces survived to discharge, indicating that diarrhoea caused by NetF toxigenic C.perfringens isolates is not uniformly fatal. S.

Bailey,*, I. M. Bowen, B. Anghileri, K. Baikerand F. M. D. Henson School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham; andOakham Veterinary unbroken Irish Draught horse was examined to further investigate a gait abnormality. The horse had been in the owner 's possession for 4 months with its clinical signs being consistent during this time. The horse was found to have quadrilateral ataxia with the right pelvic and thoracic limbs displaying more severe clinical signs (grade 3/5) than the left (grade 2/5). There were no other abnormalities found during a clinical examination and lameness evaluation. Magnetic motor evoked potentials (MMEPs) were used to provide an objective measurement of motor tract patency. This involved transcortical magnetic stimulation with a hand- held electromagnetic coil and simultaneous monitoring of electrical activity the radialis (ECR) and left ECR and TC muscles were within established cut-offs, but the latencies acquired to the right ECR and TC muscles weremarkedly increased, highly suggestive of cervical spinal cord disease affecting the right-hand side. Laterolateral radiographs were acquired to ensure that the horse did not have pathology, which would contraindicate general anaesthesia. The horse was anaesthetised, and a (CT) myelogram was obtained. The CT images identi ed multiple markers of degenerative joint disease associated with the right articular process joint between the fourth and fth cervical vertebrae ( Fig 1 ). The dye column closely associated with this joint demonstrated spinal cord compression and highlighted an accumulation of soft tissue within the spinal canal. Due to the chronicity, poor prognosis and the horse 's intended use, the horse was subjected to euthanasia and a post-mortem examination completed. Grossly, the spinal cord at the level of the lesion was found to have multiple engorged blood vessels on its surface. The joint surfaces were examined and found to have brillated, ssured cartilage. Formalin- xed sections of the spinal cord were further evaluated. At the level of the compressive lesion, there were degenerative changes in all white matter tracts (left and right dorsolateral and ventral funiculi). Cranial to the lesion, there were degenerative changes in ascending tracts, and caudal to the lesion, there were degenerative changes in descending tracts con rming the signi cance of the compressive lesion. Key points baited stretches and radiography have a poor diagnostic acuity for cervical disease. \u0081Magnetic motor evoked potentials show good agreement with the unilateral compression and the more severe pathological features of disease. However, this case highlights that normal MMEPs do not preclude mild pathological changes as seen on the left side of this horse. \u0081Although MMEPs indicated the unilateral nature of disease, CT myelography was essential to document the articular joint pathology causing the compression and should be considered as the gold standard imaging modality for the investigation of spinal ataxia in the horse.

Fridel,A .E .F \u20acurst, A. Pozzi, F. Del Chicca\u00a7and M. A. Jackson,* Clinic for Equine Surgery;Clinic for Small Animal Surgery; and\u00a7Clinic of Diagnostic Imaging, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland *Corresponding author email: mjackson@vetclinics.uzh.ch Summary This report describes the successful surgical stabilisation of elbow joint luxation using knotless bone anchors and FiberTape to repair the medial collateral ligament in an 11- year-old mare (Case 1) and both, medial and lateral, collateral ligaments in a 3-month-old foal (Case 2). Radiography (both cases) and computed tomography (Case 2) were used to diagnose subluxation (Case 1) and complete luxation (Case 2, Fig 1 ) with suspected rupture of both collateral ligaments. In Case 1, closed reduction was carried out. Manipulation of the limb showed marked instability of the medial aspect of the joint because of disruption of the medial collateral ligament. The rst suture anchor (5.5 919.1 PEEK SwiveLock C) was therefore placed in the distal medial humeral metaphysis, and then, the second suture anchor in the proximal medial radial metaphysis. A 2-mm braided composite suture tape (FiberTape) was inserted into the eyelet of the suture anchor, which was then implanted into the prepared pilot hole. In Case 2, closed reduction was completed similarly to Case 1. Fixation with prosthetic collateral ligaments was undertaken. The surgical procedure for replacement of the collateral ligaments was analogous to that used for Case 1 except that the medial collateral ligament was repaired at its avulsed origin and prostheses were inserted bi-axially to provide suf cient mechanical stabilisation of the elbow joint. The origin of the medial collateral ligament at the humerus was disrupted, and it was xed to the bone with a 26 mm 93.5 mm cortex screw anda washer. The rst suture anchor (5.5 919.1 PEEK SwiveLock C) was then placed just cranial to the collateral ligament. The second suture anchor was placed in the proximal medial radial metaphysis. The suture tape (FiberTape) was inserted into the eyelet of both suture anchors and implanted into pilot hole as described for Case 1. Case 1 was sound at the walk at the time of discharge 8 weeks after surgery and 1 year later at the follow-up visit. Case 2 was discharged 3 weeks after surgery and was sound at the trot when re-evaluated 2 ( Fig 2 ) and 6 months postoperatively. Key points \u0081Although closed reduction in elbow joint luxation may be successful, damage to the collateral ligaments can lead to instability of the joint, necessitating a surgical reconstruction of the collateral ligaments \u0081Knotless bone anchors and FiberTape allowed full return to the intended use of the mare and normal locomotion of the foal 1 year after surgery \u0081Additional studies are required to determine whether the presented technique is superior to previously described mono lament nylon or stainless-steel wire for tension band wiring Fig 1: Mediolateral radiographic view of the left elbow joint of Case 2 before surgery.

Collar Department of Large Animal Clinical Science, University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA Corresponding equids is rare, a sufcient number of case reports have accumulated in the literature to allow for meta-analysis ( Table 1 ), with the goal of providing a better overall understanding of occurrence, treatment options, and prognosis (Collar et al., 2021; Crawley & Grant, 1986; Daradka et al., 2022; al., 2007; Jalim al., 2009; Jones, Levine & Meagher, 1980; Rubio-Martinez et al., 2008; Trostle et al., 2001). A recent case report by Fridel et al. (2022) describes a promising surgical option for stabilisation of the equid elbow joint after collateral ligament rupture utilising bone anchors and FiberTape, and adds to the overall understanding of prognosis in these cases. Appropriate decision-making in clinical management of individual cases of elbow joint luxation requires a review of the relevant anatomy. The elbow joint is classi ed as a hinge joint, and the osseous structure of the joint comprises the humerus, radius and ulna. The anconeal process and trochlear notch of the ulna closely interdigitate with the humerus within a large fossa at the caudodistal aspect of the humerus created by the lateral condyle, much larger medial condyle, and an enlarged medial epicondyle extends further caudal than the lateral epicondyle. This interdigitation, along with support from medial and lateral collateral ligaments, allows for movement in only the sagittal plane. There is some disagreement among textbooks regarding the anatomy of the collateral ligaments. Two texts (Barone, 1986; Tnibar et al., 2001) describe or reference three parts to the medial collateral ligament: cranial deep, caudal deep and long super cial parts. More frequently, texts describe two parts: a short, deep part that inserts on the radial tuberosity which is located on the cranial, proximal aspect of the radius, and a long, super cial part that inserts on the radius just distal to the interosseous space between the radius and ulna (Dyce et al., 2009; Dyson, 2011; Kidd et al., 2014; Nelson & Goodrich, 2014). The lateral collateral ligament is also variably described as having: two parts (super cial, vertical and deep, short, oblique) (Barone, 1986; Tnibar et al., 2001); spiral bres with two portions (deep and super cial) (Kidd et al., 2014); or one part (Dyson, 2011; Fails, 2020). Some texts comment that the medial collateral ligament is thin, while the lateral collateral ligament is a stout, stronger ligament (Kidd et al., 2014; Tnibar et al., 2001). The joint capsule is adherent to and blends with both medial and lateral collateral ligaments, making joint capsule injury inevitable in cases of collateral ligament rupture. The biceps brachii and brachialis muscles constitute the flexor muscles of the elbow. Extension of the elbow joint is primarily accomplished by the triceps, tensor fasciaeantebrachia and the anconeus. The radial nerve innervates the elbow extensors, and the musculocutaneous nerve and a contribution from the radial nerve innervate the elbow flexors. Additional anatomy that should be considered when planning case assessment and treatment includes the close association of the median nerve and the brachial and median arteries which lie super cial and just caudal to the medial collateral ligament. The transverse pectoral muscle overlies these structures, making palpation and assessment of the medial collateral ligament dif cult. The large medial condyle and of the humerus and additional overlying musculature add signi cant stability and protection to the medial aspect of the joint, while a more robust lateral collateral ligament provides added stability to the lateral aspect of the joint. When the elbow is extended, the anconeal process is anchored in the fossa of the caudodistal aspect of the humerus. In small animals in particular, luxation is only considered possible when the limb is flexed beyond 45 degrees (Slatter, 2003; Tobias & Johnston, 2013), and the described procedure for closed reduction of elbow luxation includes flexion of the joint beyond 90 degrees (Fridel et al., 2022; Slatter, 2003; Tobias & Johnston, 2013). However, elbow luxation with concurrent ulna fracture, referred to as Monteggia fracture, is thought to occur during weight bearing or extension of the elbow joint (Slatter, 2003). It is likely that, in horses, the interdigitation of the humerus, radius and ulna protects the joint from re-luxation after reduction, dependent on degree of soft tissue injury (Collar et al., 2021; Levine & Meagher, 1980; Trostle et al., 2001). After anatomic reduction, maintenance of the limb and joint in extension also likely provides increased stability and decreased risk of re-luxation (Collar et al., 2021; Jones, 1995) and should be encouraged in case management when possible. During extensive literature review, 16 cases of elbow joint luxation were found in the current body of literature ( Table 1 ). Of these 16 equids, 8 equids were <12 months of age and 8 equids were >12 months of age (Arnbjerg, 1969; Bottegaro et et 1986; Daradka et al., 2009; 1980; et al., 2008; Senior et al., 2002; Trostle et al., 2001). Seven cases included concurrent fracture of the ulna (Monteggia fracture) (Arnbjerg, & Meagher, 1980; Nixon, 2019; Trostle et al., 2001), and 9 cases of luxation had no accompanying fracture (other than possible fragmentation of the anconeal process) (Bottegaro et al., 2017; Collar 1995; Rubio-Martinez et al., 2008; Senior et al., 2002). One of the Monteggia fracture cases also suffered a fracture of the humerus in addition to the ulna (Daradka et al., 2020). Of the luxation cases without fracture, 6 of the 9 (67%) were <12 months of age (Bottegaro et al., 2017; Crawley & Grant, 1986; Fridel 2022; Hu et al., 2007; Jones, 1995; Rubio-Martinez et al., 2008). Collateral ligament rupture was reported in the medial collateral ligament only in 4 cases (one 8 month old and three cases aged 4 -11 years) (Collar et al., 2021; Fridel et al., 2022; Jones, 1995; Senior et al., 2002), both medial and lateral collateral ligaments in 4 cases (all animals aged 1-10 months) (Bottegaro et al., 2017; Crawley & Grant, 1986; Fridel et al., 2022; Rubio-Martinez et al., 2008), and the lateral collateral ligament in 2 cases (Daradka et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2007). Collateral ligament rupture was either not found (Trostle et al., 2001) or not described (Arnbjerg, 1969; Jalim et al., 2009; Janicek, 2005; Levine & Meagher, 1980; Nixon, 2019) in 6 of the cases. Five of the 16 cases were euthanised with no attempt at treatment (Bottegaro et al., 2017; Daradka et al., 2020; Janicek, 2005; Nixon, 2019; Senior et al., 2002). One additional case had biaxial collateral ligament surgical repair and was euthanised after infection of the implants occurred (Rubio- Martinez et al., 2008). The remaining 10 cases (91% of cases where treatment was attempted) had successful outcomes (2 cases closed reduction only, 4 cases with ulna fracture repair and luxation reduction, 4 cases with reduction and surgical collateral ligament repair). Lameness evaluations werelimitedly described, but 8 of the 10 equids (80%) were found to be sound at the trot post-operatively (follow up range 10 weeks -19 months) (Arnbjerg, 1969; Collar et al., 2021; 1986; al., 2022; Jones, 1995; Levine & Meagher, 1980; Trostle et al., 2001). One horse was described as being sound at a walk and free of osteoarthritis based on radiographs (no comment on evaluation at a trot) (Hu et al., 2007). Another horse was found to be \"pasture \"sound with radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis (Jalim et al., 2009). Of the 4 horses with Monteggia fractures that received surgical repair, all horses survived and were sound (n =3) (Arnbjerg, 1969; Levine & Meagher, 1980; Trostle et al., 2001) or pasture sound (n =1) (Jalim et al., 2009) post-operatively. Only repair of the fractured ulna was performed in all 4 cases, with no stabilisation of the collateral ligaments. Of the 16 luxation cases (including cases with and without fracture), 7 had reduction of the luxation performed with no surgical collateral ligament stabilisation. Of these 7 equids, re-luxation occurred in only one (14%) case (Rubio-Martinez et al., 2008). Collateral ligament repair was performed in 5 cases (including the case that re- luxated) (Crawley & Grant, 1986; Fridel et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2007; Rubio-Martinez et al., 2008). One foal was euthanised due to implant-related infection (Rubio-Martinez et al., 2008). Of the 4 remaining cases, 2 cases had implants break (screws and wires) (Crawley & Grant, 1986; Hu et al., 2007), and 2 had implants that were not re-evaluated through imaging (Fridel et al., 2022). All 4 cases had successful outcomes despite implant breakage.TABLE 1: Case details from the 16 equid cases of elbow luxation found within the literature Author, year Age FractureCollateral ligament rupture TreatmentOutcome (Post- Op Re-check) 1 Rubio-Martinez, Surgical biaxial stabilisation (screws/ wires) 2 Hu, et al., 2007 2.5 months None Lateral Closed reduction and lateral stabilisation (screws/Securos suture)Sound at walk (7 months) 3 Fridel, et al., 2022 3 months None Biaxial Closed reduction and biaxial stabilisation (bone anchors and FiberTape)Sound (10 months) 4 Jalim, et al., 2009 4 months Monteggia No comment Closed reduction and ulna repair Pasture sound (10 months) 5 Jones, 1995 8 months None Medial Closed reduction Sound (19 months) 6 Crawley & Grant, 1986 8 months None Biaxial Open reduction and biaxial stabilisation (screws and wires)Sound (14 months) 7 Arnbjerg, 1969 1.7 years Monteggia No comment Closed reduction and ulna repair Sound (>6 months) 8 Trostle, et al., 2001 2.25 years Monteggia None Open reduction and ulna repair Sound (6 months) 9 Levine & Meagher, 1980 3 years Monteggia No comment Reduction and ulna repair Sound (3 months) 10 Collar, et al., 2021 9 years None Medial Closed reduction Sound (8 months) 11 Fridel, et al., 2022 11 years None Medial Closed reduction and medial stabilisation (bone anchors and FiberTape)Sound (7 months) 1 Daradka, et al., 2020 7 months Monteggia +humerusLateral N/A Euthanised N/A Euthanised Nixon, 2019 >1.5 years Monteggia No comment N/A Euthanised 4 Senior, et al., 2002 4 years None Medial N/A Euthanised 5 Janicek, 2005 14 years Monteggia No comment N/A Euthanised Cases are arranged in order of ascending age, with the cases that received treatment listed rst. \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd343 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / jul y 2022 Based on the cases in the current literature, prognosis for elbow luxation in equids should be considered good, even in cases with Monteggia fractures. Cases in the current body of literature include animals either not used for high levels of athleticism or animals too young to be exercised. However, case follow-up indicates that equids are likely able to be athletic following elbow luxation. Monteggia fractures may occur more frequently in horses >12 months of age, while luxation without fracture may occur more commonly in equids <12 months of age. Contrary to previous reports that lateral collateral ligament rupture is more common (Nelson & Goodrich, 2014), analysis of the literature found that medial collateral ligament rupture appears to be more common than lateral collateral ligament rupture in cases of elbow luxation. Biaxial collateral ligament rupture appears to occur more frequently in equids <12 months of age. It is likely that fracture of the ulna preserves the soft tissues, resulting in less severe collateral ligament damage when compared to luxation without fracture, as evidenced by the fact that all Monteggia fractures were stable on palpation after ulna repair only. Based on the anatomy of the equid elbow joint, case reports on equid elbow luxation, and knowledge from elbow luxation in small animals and people, recommendations for treatment of equid elbow luxations can be made. An attempt at repair of equid elbow luxation and Monteggia fractures should be considered as the prognosis is good for soundness long term. Closed reduction can be challenging but successful, and may be accomplished through traction applied to the distal limb (Collar et al., 2021; Jones, 1995) or through the described methods for elbow luxation reduction in small animals ( flexion of the joint past 90 degrees, with internal rotation and abduction of the antebrachium while applying pressure to the proximal lateral aspect of the radius) (Fridel et al., 2022; Slatter, 2003; Tobias & Johnston, 2013). Cases with medial collateral ligament rupture in equids that can be maintained with the elbow in extension, using splints, hobbles, cross ties, or a sling, likely do not need surgical intervention, even with medial instability. However, equids that cannot be maintained with the elbow kept in extension (foals) and/or those with dramatic instability post reduction (biaxial collateral ligament rupture) may bene t from surgical stabilisation of the joint. It is unknown if the use of screws with wires or suture, or the use of bone anchors and FiberTape, is superior for repair of collateral ligament rupture. Based on the literature, the joint does not appear to need support from implants for extended periods of time for the horse to heal and regain soundness post-operatively. Rehab and range of motion exercises are likely to increase the chances of maintaining range of motion and the ability to be athletic in the future (Collar et al., 2021; Tobias & Johnston, 2013). In summary, with treatment, elbow luxation in equids carries a good prognosis with or without fracture or collateral ligament rupture. It is unknown if equids could attain a high level of athleticism after elbow luxation. Based on the limited number of cases, athletic performance is likely attainable, dependent on the level of joint and cartilage damage at the time of injury. Medial collateral ligament rupture with luxation is more common than lateral collateral ligament rupture, and biaxial collateral ligament rupture appears to be more common in foals. Surgical intervention is likely unnecessary in cases of uniaxial ligament rupture when the joint isanatomically restored and the equid can be maintained with the limb in extension. Surgical stabilisation may be warranted in cases where the leg cannot be maintained in extension or in cases of biaxial collateral ligament rupture. Surgical stabilisation does not appear to need to be in place for long periods of time for cases to be successful. While stabilisation with screws and wires/suture can be successful, use of bone anchors and FiberTape appears to be a promising surgical approach.

Goehringand A. May Equine Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich andInstitute of Veterinary Pathology, *Corresponding theresa.maria@gmx.de block; dysrhythmia; selenium Summary This case report is about a 1-day-old, full-term Quarter Horse colt presented for progressive inability to rise and nurse. Besides the general weakness, a marked bradycardia was evident. The blood work revealed markedly increased muscle enzymes, azotaemia, hypoproteinaemia and hyperlactataemia, as well as hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia, acidosis and hypoxaemia. Blood samples also yielded low concentrations of selenium and vitamin E and an elevated troponin I value. An ECG revealed complete atrioventricular (AV) dissociation ( Fig 1 ). The low ventricular escape rhythm was regular with monomorphic QRS complexes. Occasionally, ventricular premature beats of bizarre, widened shape occurred, suggesting additional ectopic foci somewhere else in the ventricle. An echocardiographic examination showed no congenital cardiac defects and revealed only mild alterations in cardiac dimensions which mainly reflected compensatory mechanisms to increase ventricular stroke volume and thereby cardiac output. Subsequently, the diagnosis of acute nutritional myodegeneration (NMD) was made based on clinical signs, elevated muscle enzymes, ECG ndings, as well as low serum selenium and vitamin E values. The complete AV block and slow ventricular escape rhythm was attributed to damage of the myocardium involving the conduction pathways. Despite intensive care and supportive therapy with intravenous fluids, anti-in flammatory drugs, and antimicrobials, as well as selenium and vitamin E substitution, the foal \u00b4s condition deteriorated. Administration of parasympatholytic and sympathomimetic drug s did not result in a signi cant increase in heart rate or AV conduction. Due to the poor prognosis and thelack of response to intensive therapy, the owner elected euthanasia. Necropsy con rmed the diagnosis of NMD and revealed diffuse necrosis and resorptive cell in ltration of the skeletal and myocardial muscula ture. Apart from these typical mineralisation of Purkinje bres ( Fig 2 ), as a part of the cardiac conduction system, were detected and might have caused complete AV block and ventricular ectopy. Prevention of NMD is the key since treatment of the acute form is often unsuccessful as shown in the present case. Therefore, the selenium status of the dam should be monitored throughout the gestation period, especially in regions with selenium-de cient soils. Key points \u0081Due to unspeci c clinical signs, like weakness and dysphagia, NMD needs to be differentiated from other diseases affecting young foals. \u0081Dysrhythmia due to myocardial damage and degeneration of the cardiac conduction system in NMD foals may mask the underlying disease. \u0081Since the prognosis for foals suffering from acute NMD is poor, herd surveillance programs with selenium supplementation as required are paramount in selenium-de cient areas.

Decloedt Equine CardioTeam, Department of Large Animal Internal Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Merelbeke, Cardiac arrhythmias can often be detected in horses, ranging from physiological arrhythmias driven by changes in vagal tone to potentially lethal arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia. Differentiating physiological from pathological arrhythmias is difcult based on auscultation alone, and electrocardiography (ECG) is usually needed for a de nite diagnosis (Mitchell, 2019). The increased availability of telemetric ECG equipment and smartphone-based ECG recordings will undoubtedly lead to improved detection of cardiac arrhythmias in horses. However, the correct classi cation of arrhythmias can be complicated as standardized criteria for de ning and reporting arrhythmias are lacking. For example, supraventricular and ventricular premature beats are traditionally differentiated based on the P wave presence and morphology, QRS morphology and the absence or presence of a compensatory pause (Reef et al., 2014). A supraventricular premature complex is typically described as an early P0wave followed by a QRS complex with normal morphology and a so-called 'non-compensatory pause ' caused by resetting of the sinus node. A ventricular premature complex typically has no associated P wave, an abnormal QRS morphology, and is followed by a 'compensatory pause 'as the sinus rhythm is not interrupted. However, P waves are often hard to identify during tachycardia as they are buried in the preceding T wave or ST segment (Verheyen et al., 2010). In addition, the QRS morphology can also be altered in case of supraventricular premature complexes (Broux et al., 2016), while ventricular ectopy can sometimes result in QRS complexes which are very similar to sinus beat QRS morphology. Finally, the presence of a compensatory or non-compensatory pause is also not conclusive. In a study describing the arrhythmic events found in poorly performing trotters undergoing high-speed treadmill testing, the majority of isolated premature depolarizations showed compensatory or close to compensatory pauses while subjective QRS assessment revealed mainly sinus morphology (Slack et al., 2021). These ectopic beats would be classi ed either as ventricular premature beats based on the compensatory pause or as supraventricular based on the QRS morphology. Therefore, Slack and colleagues suggested that in future studies objective descriptions of cardiac arrhythmias should be preferred over classifying arrhythmias as supraventricular or ventricular. Labelling premature complexes as narrow or wide, and with or without a compensatory pause, may improve observer agreement. Once an arrhythmia is identi ed, the next challenge is to distinguish what can be accepted as physiological and what is pathological. At rest, horses commonly show a large heartrate variability and presence of second-degree atrioventricular block due to high vagal tone. These physiological arrhythmias should be distinguished from pathological bradyarrhythmia, in which the rate and rhythm are inappropriate relative to the state of arousal and activity of the horse (Keen, 2020). De ning 'pathological 'arrhythmias is particularly complicated for exercise-associated rhythm disturbances. While these have been linked to poor performance, collapse and sudden death (Lyle et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2000), the prevalence of arrhythmias during exercise and recovery is also high in healthy well-performing equine athletes (Buhl et al., 2010; Navas de Solis, 2016). Cardiac or systemic underlying disease When a pathological arrhythmia is detected, further examination should be performed to identify the potential presence of underlying disease. While arrhythmias may develop as isolated electrical disorders, other aetiological factors include primary cardiac disease, inadequate oxygenation of myocardial tissue, metabolic or endocrine disorders, systemic in flammation, autonomic imbalance, infection, intoxications or drugs (Reef et al., 2014). The history and clinical signs can be suggestive for underlying systemic disease, for example the presence of fever, anorexia and lethargy in case of viral or bacterial infection (Jesty & Reef, 2006). However, the clinical presentation is often unspeci c and primary cardiac disease may also result in systemic clinical signs. For example, the case report by Conze et al. (2022) in this issue of Equine Veterinary Education describes a foal presented due to progressive inability to rise and nurse, which showed bradycardia caused by third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block at presentation. While the foal 's weakness and apathy could also be caused by other conditions, blood work con rmed underlying nutritional myodegeneration. The clinical signs could be attributed to massive rhabdomyolysis, although they could also be associated with the pathological bradycardia. The arrhythmia detected in this case was a rather unusual consequence of cardiac involvement with myocardial in flammation andAbbreviations AV atrioventricular block in itself can cause lethargy, syncope and episodic collapse (Keen, 2020). Similarly, any primary cardiac disease with decreased cardiac output may result in various unspeci c clinical signs such as depression, lethargy, poor performance, exercise intolerance, weakness or ataxia (Keen, 2019). In horses with arrhythmias, echocardiography is indicated to evaluate the presence of structural heart disease. This includes the assessment of cardiac size and function, presence of valvular regurgitation, as well as screening for endo-, myo- or pericardial abnormalities. In the case report by Conze et al. (2022), echocardiography revealed a hyperechoic zone in the atrioventricular node region which was indicative for myocardial damage. This should be differentiated from the normal echogenic appearance of the ventral part of the interatrial septum which can often be seen on a four- chamber view in healthy individuals ( Figure 1 ). Laboratory testing Laboratory tests are important to identify cardiac arrhythmias which develop as a result of systemic or metabolic diseases. However, it should be kept in mind that primary cardiac disease may also alter routine laboratory tests; for example, horses with a low cardiac output may present prerenal azotaemia (Schwarzwald, 2018). Table 1 contains a list of laboratory tests that can be valuable in horses with cardiac arrhythmias to identify underlying cardiac or systemic disease. A complete blood count and serum protein test is useful to identify anaemia or in flammation, for example, acute haemorrhage has been shown to result in myocardial injury and ventricular ectopy (Navas de Solis et al., 2015). Markers of inflammation such as serum amyloid A and brinogen can be indicators for viral or bacterial myocarditis (Decloedt, 2019). Serum biochemistry to assess muscle enzymes, renal function and hepatic function is helpful to identify the presence of systemic disease or to assess the consequences of primary cardiac disease. Nutritional myodegeneration was suspected in the case report byConze et al. (2022) based on the markedly increased muscle enzymes. The diagnosis was con rmed by the analysis of vitamin E and selenium concentrations in blood samples of the foal and dam, which revealed remarkably low selenium levels. While nutritional myodegeneration typically occurs in foals, adult horses may also be affected. The typical presentation in adult horses is masseter myodegeneration resulting in dysphagia and mastication problems. However, cardiac muscle involvement may result in cardiac arrhythmias and even sudden death (Polledo et al., 2013; Schefer et al., 2011). Atypical myopathy should also be considered as a differential diagnosis in case of massive rhabdomyolysis with presence of cardiac arrhythmias (Verheyen et al., 2012). Serum electrolyte levels should always be evaluated in case of cardiac arrhythmias, as electrolyte abnormalities may cause alterations of the cardiac rhythm. Potassium is particularly important, as hyperkalaemia results in increased excitability of the myocardial cells and slowed conduction, which may lead to ventricular b r i l l a t i o nd u et or e - e n t r y . Severe hyperkalaemia, for example in case of uroperitoneum in foals, can result in bradycardia due to impaired sinus and AV node function and depression of intra-atrial conduction (Marolf et al., 2018). A rare nding in horses with hyperkalaemia is the presence of atrial standstill, with absence of atrial myocardial depolarization and therefore absence of P waves ( Figure 2 ). Hypokalaemia may result in enhanced automaticity of pacemaker cells, with supraventricular or ventricular ectopy. Hypercalcaemia may also cause arrhythmias, although the effects depend on the potassium levels. Hypomagnesaemia can cause ventricular arrhythmias, and magnesium sulphate may be administered intravenously as a physiological calcium channel blocker in case of ventricular tachycardia (Schwarzwald, 2018). Elevated levels of serum cardiac biomarkers such as cardiac troponin I (cTnI) or cardiac troponin T (cTnT) indicate Fig 1: Four-chamber view demonstrating the echogenic appearance of the ventral part of the interatrial septum detected as a coincidental nding in a 3-year-old Warmblood horse with mild mitral valve regurgitation. This can often be seen on a four- chamber view in healthy individuals.TABLE 1: List of laboratory tests that can be useful in case of cardiac arrhythmias to identify underlying cardiac or systemic disease Complete blood cell count Markers of in flammation, for example serum amyloid A and brinogen Serum biochemical tests: Electrolytes, particularly potassium, calcium and magnesium Renal function tests Muscle enzymes Serum protein and electrophoresis Liver enzymes Vitamin E/selenium Cardiac troponin I or T (cTnI, cTnT) Arterial and blood Serum/plasma assays for digoxin, digitoxin and other cardio- active drugs Gastro-intestinal and feed sample analysis for toxicology screening, for example, ionophores Urinalysis Cytology / jul y 2022 the presence of myocardial damage, but this may be due to primary or secondary cardiac involvement. Horses with colic showed increased cTnI levels and ventricular arrhythmias, most likely due to secondary myocardial damage caused by endotoxaemia (Diaz et al., 2014). Arterial and venous blood gas analysis and blood lactate measurements are necessary to evaluate pulmonary and renal function and to evaluate acid -base status. In exercising horses on a high-speed treadmill, hypercapnia and hyperlactataemia were positively associated with the presence of higher-grade arrhythmias (Reef et al., 2020). It is unclear whether there is a causative mechanism or whether these are merely co-markers of generalized muscle fatigue and hypoventilation. Urinalysis can be useful to identify renal injury caused by heart failure or endocarditis and to determine fractional excretion of potassium. Blood culture is indicated if sepsis or endocarditis is suspected, while serum/plasma assays for digoxin and digitoxin should be performed in case of suspected intoxication with cardiac glycosides. Gastro- intestinal or feed samples should be collected for toxicology screening, for example ionophores. In horses with pericardial effusion, cytologic examination and culture after pericardiocentesis may provide additional information. Endomyocardial biopsies are also feasible in horses using a minimally invasive ultrasound-guided approach through the jugular vein and may reveal histological myocardial abnormalities (Decloedt et al., 2017). Despite the abundance of possible laboratory tests, the aetiology of cardiac arrhythmias often remains unknown in horses. As a result, targeted treatment of the underlying disease is not always possible and the treatment mainly consists of rhythm control and general supportive care. If myocardial in flammation in absence of infection is suspected to be the primary cause of arrhythmia, a resting period combined with steroid treatment is often attempted.Author 's declaration of interests No con flicts of interest to declare.

Pastrana Sorum horse; donkey; C occidioides ; osseous; valley fever Summary This case report discusses the clinical signs, diagnostic ndings, treatment and outcome for a donkey (Equus asinus) diagnosed with coccidioidomycosis. At presentation, the donkey was lame, was in poor body condition, had a draining tract over the left femur and was hyporexic. Further investigation of the draining tract via radiography and ultrasound showed a focal lesion of extensive bony proliferation and lysis on the mid-shaft of the left femur ( Fig 1 ). There was also a soft tissue swelling over the fth left rib, which contained Coccidioides spherules ( Fig immitis . Recommended treatment for C. immitis consists of two antifungal classes, the azoles and amphotericin B, with this donkey being prescribed daily fluconazole. A recheck 3 months from the initial diagnosis showed marked improvement of clinical signs, but the C.immitis titre remained unchanged. The 18-month recheck showed an improvement radiographically and signi cantly decreased titres. After 3 years of daily treatment offluconazole, the C.immitis titre was decreased, but radiographs of the femur still showed persistent bony proliferation. Key points \u0081Valley fever should be considered in equids for lameness cases despite the lack of clinical respiratory disease in endemic areas. \u0081Serum titres and diagnostic imaging are useful in diagnosing valley fever in equids. \u0081Long-term treatment with fluconazole can result in improvement in clinical signs, but clear guidelines for discontinuing treatment are as yet unknown.

Stewart School of Veterinary Science, Equine Specialist Hospital, University of Queensland, Gatton, Queensland, Australia Corresponding email: stewaaj@gmail.com Keywords: horse; coccidiomycosis Coccidiomycosis is a fungal infection that can infect any mammalian species, with reports in people, dogs and cats, horses and now a donkey (Sorum et al., 2022). Coccidioides spp. is a cause of pulmonary and systemic infections in the desert regions of the Americas. Diagnosis is usually made by serology, although culture is possible. In human patients, there is frequently disease resolution in cases of pneumonia without antifungal therapy. When antifungal therapy is required, fluconazole and itraconazole are recommended for the treatment of coccidioides. Response to treatment is indicated by resolution of clinical signs, bloodwork abnormalities and reductions in the serological titre. After treatment discontinuation, monitoring of serological titres is recommended to diagnose disease recrudescence. Coccidiomycosis is a problem in immunocompromised people with lifetime antifungal therapy often required. Endemic regions Coccidioides spp. are soil saprophytes found in semiarid areas with alkaline sandy soils (Ziemer et al., 1992). The disease is acquired from speci c regions of the southern deserts of Arizona, central valley and southern California, southern tip of Nevada, southern Utah and New Mexico, western Texas, northern and western Mexico and areas of Central and South America. Recently, a pocket of Coccidioides was identi ed in people in Washington State (Chastain et al., 2017). Two species have been differentiated based on genetic analysis: C.immitis and C.posadasii . Most C.immitis cases originate from California while most C.posadasii infections are acquired in other south-western US states (Galgiani et al., 2005). Organism characteristics Coccidioides spp. survive as soil mycelia, which proliferate within the aerobic topsoil layers during rainy periods. The branched mycelia produce arthroconidia. As the soils dry, single cell, barrel-shaped arthroconidia are released. As these arthroconidia are 3 -5\u00b5m in diameter, they can become suspended in the air after soil disruption, with inhalation deep into the lungs being the most common route of infection in people. The arthroconidium transforms and enlarges into a multi-celled sphere, which ruptures releasing numerous endospore progeny, each of which can develop into another spherule. If these spherules are obtained by lung biopsy and cultured in a laboratory, the fungus will revert to its mycelial form (Galgiani et al., 2005).Epidemiology and pathogenesis people Although approximately 150,000 people are infected annually, only 50,000 have illness that warrants medical attention (Huang et al., 2012). It is estimated that 1% of the human population living in endemic areas are treated annually for coccidiomycosis, which is known as Valley Fever (Campion et al., 2003). Inhaled arthroconidia enlarge to form nonbudding spherules, which incite an in flammatory reaction in the lungs and lymph nodes. The incubation period of coccidioidal infection in human patients ranges from 7 to 21 days. Most human cases resolve without treatment due to induction of immunity, although the historical illness may have lasted many weeks to months. Clinical signs Clinical signs in people consist of fatigue, fever, cough, chest pain, headache, joint pain and skin rashes (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). The disease can be mild and insidious, with human patients experiencing clinical signs on average for 44 days prior to seeking medical care for mild to moderate respiratory signs, similar to pneumonia. Approximately 5 -10% of human infections have serious pulmonary sequelae, and <1% spread to tissues beyond the lungs resulting in lesions within bones, joints, skin, meninges or other organs (disseminated disease) (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Approximately 160 people die per year of Valley fever (Huang et al., 2012). Once infected, animals or human patients are not considered contagious to others (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Horses diagnosed with Coccidioides commonly have weight loss, fever, abdominal pain and signs of respiratory disease. Localised, recurring nasal granulomas also have been reported. Diffuse infections, with granulomas in the lungs, liver, kidney or spleen have a grave prognosis (Hodgin et al., 1984). Przewalskii horses may be more susceptible (Terio et al., 2003). Diagnosis Coccidioides immitis is dif cult to culture, and spherules may be missed on histology from antemortem lung biopsies. However, serology is very useful for diagnosing infection, and decreasing titres are associated with clinical improvement in horses and human patients (Higgins et al., 2005a) (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016; Ziemer et al., 1992). Various serological tests exist and measurement of IgM and IgG antibodies is available. In humans, up to 90% of patients will have tube \u00a92021 10.1111/eve.13586precipitation IgM antibodies detected within the rst 3 weeks of symptoms, and this will decline to <5% after 7 months from the onset of a self-limiting illness (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Therefore, presence of IgM can be used to detect a current or recent infection. Most IgG tests are based on compliment xing antibodies involving chitinase, a protein enzyme important in the structure of the fungal cell wall and these antibodies will persist beyond disease resolution. Compliment xation antibodies can be detected in other body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for the diagnosis of coccidioidal meningitis. Compliment xation results are expressed as titres, such as 1:4 or 1:64, and indicate the greatest dilution of serum at which complement consumption is still detected. Higher titres re flect more extensive coccidioidal infection, and rising titres are associated with worsening disease. Therefore, serial determinations of complement xation titres are of prognostic value in human patients (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Immunodiffusion tests and enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA) to detect IgG and IgM antibodies are also available as commercially prepared kits. Positive ELISA results are highly sensitive for coccidioidal infection, however, false-positive results have been noted with the IgM ELISA test (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Latex tests for coccidioidal antibodies are also commercially available and are attractive to clinical laboratories because of their ease of use and rapidity of obtaining results. However, false-positive reactions occur and positive samples should be retested using other more speci c tests (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Negative serologies do not exclude the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis, therefore culture may be required for early diagnosis in some patients. In acute serious human illness, cultures are recommended, but generally serology is sufcient (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Coccidioides spp. grow well on most mycologic and bacteriologic media with a white (nonpigmented) mould typically apparent within 4 -7 days of incubation. However, morphologic appearance is not reliable to diagnose Coccidioides spp. Culture containers should only be opened in an appropriate biocontainment cabinet, as cultures during growth phase are infectious if not properly handled. Con rmation of diagnosis is usually by speci c DNA sequence using a commercially available DNA probe from the cultured inoculum, which may need to be performed at a reference laboratory (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). It is not uncommon for human patients with persistent respiratory disease to receive empiric antibiotics prior to a diagnosis of coccidioides. In one study, 81% of human patients with Valley Fever pneumonia received at least one course, and 31% received multiple courses of antibacterials. Therefore, early serological testing can reduce unnecessary antibacterial therapies, reducing costs, adverse events and antibiotic resistance in the community. Unfortunately, due to cutaneous or rheumatologic conditions that can accompany coccidioidal infections in human patients, corticosteroids are sometimes inadvertently prescribed. Corticosteroids may impede host defences, and their use in patients with coccidioidal infections is contraindicated (Galgiani et al., 2016; Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Serum antibodies are detected rarely in healthy horses (Higgins et al., 2005b). Higher serological antibody titres are associated with a poorer prognosis for survival (Higgins et al., 2007). Horses with disseminated disease and pneumonia withthoracic effusion usually have severe clinical disease and frequently die (19 of 21 cases) (Higgins et al., 2007). The donkey in the associated case report had osteomyelitis and subcutaneous infection. Microbiologic culture of a draining only Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but coccidioides AGID assay immunodiffusion titre was 1:256 (Sorum et al., 2022). Immune dysfunction Treatment for coccidioides is often required for many months to years in human patients (Galgiani et al., 2016), as reported in the donkey by Sorum et al. (2022). After treatment discontinuation in human patients, approximately one-third of apparently successfully controlled cases relapse. Therefore, some patients may require lifelong therapy, though these patients often have de ciencies in cellular immunity (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Complications from coccidioidal infection are not uncommon when there is coexistence of major immunosuppressive conditions such as in AIDS in HIV- infected persons, and those being treated with antitumour necrosis factor therapy for rheumatologic conditions or immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection of organ transplants (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Human patients with diabetes have an increased risk of pulmonary complications (Santelli et al., 2006). Pregnant women who contract Valley Fever during pregnancy are at particular risk of serious infection, especially in the third trimester or immediately post- partum (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Although there was no investigation of immunode ciency in the donkey, serum protein electrophoresis to measure relative IgM and IgG antibody concentrations; immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocytes using flow cytometry to determine B cell, CD4+and CD8+T cell lymphocyte proportions and cell-mediated immune responses such as opsonisation capacity, phagocytosis and oxidative burst functions of peripheral neutrophils and monocytes could be recommended (Costa, 2020). Treatment In human patients, many infections are resolving by the time of diagnosis and antifungal therapy is not required. The recommendation is to provide patient education, close observation and physical therapy for patients with mild or non-debilitating symptoms (Galgiani et al., 2016). Antifungal therapy with oral fluconazole is only recommended for human patients with signi cant debilitating illness, those with extensive pulmonary involvement, concurrent diabetes, the elderly or those frail with comorbidities. Surgical resection is occasionally required in people with thoracic cavity lesions that are persistently symptomatic despite antifungal treatment for more than 2 years and if symptoms recur on cessation of antifungal therapy (Galgiani et al., 2016). Antifungal agents successful in the treatment of infected human patients, dogs, horses and other mammalian species include oral administration the azole antifungals itraconazole and fluconazole (Galgiani & Thompson, inhibit cytochrome P450-dependent 14 a-sterol demethylase, which is required for the formation of ergosterol, which is a component of fungal cell membranes. Oral fluconazole at 5 mg/kg bwt q. 24 h after a dose of 14 mg/kg bwt, \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd353 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / y 2022 results in plasma, CSF, synovial fluid, aqueous humor and urine concentrations above the MIC reported for several equine fungal pathogens (Latimer et al., 2001). Compounded fluconazole formulations are very stable. The cost of fluconazole has been markedly reduced since the availability of generic products and would be the treatment of choice for coccidioides in equids (Stewart, 2020b). The proprietary itraconazole is absorbed well 60%), with a dose of 5 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h recommended (Davis & Gilger, 2004), however, it is often cost prohibitive for use in large animals (Stewart, 2005, 2020b). The use of compounded itraconazole is not recommended. It is very unstable (requires low pH), and owing to its lipophilic nature it is dif cult to formulate in aqueous solution (Davis et al., 2004; Stewart, 2020b). Although associated with a signi cant risk of renal side effects, in rapidly progressing disease, intravenous amphotericin B may be recommended in humans (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). The duration of antifungal therapy is dif cult to determine for any chronic fungal infection (Stewart, 2019, 2020a; Stewart et al., 2009). Resolution of clinical signs, bloodwork abnormalities and serum coccidioides IgM titres, with dramatic reduction in serum IgG titres may help the clinician determine when to eliminate antifungal therapy. After discontinuation of therapy, reassessment of serum titres every 3 -6 months may help to determine if there is recrudescence of the coccidioides infection. Post infection, most people develop lifelong immunity and serum IgG titres may persist (Galgiani & Thompson, 2016). Fluconazole therapy in the donkey described by Soren had been administered for 3 years, where the serum IgM titre was negative for coccidioides, and the IgG titre having decreased from 1:256 to 1:8 (Sorum et al., 2022). Although there was mild lameness, radiographic persistence of bony proliferation of the left femur and a slight anaemia, the coccidioides infection may have resolved. Discontinuation of fluconazole and monitoring of serum IgM and IgG titres every 3-6 months could be considered, with immune function testing if the condition reoccurred to determine if life-long therapy was truly required.

Lessa of Veterinary Medicine, Department of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA *Corresponding Summary The objectives were: 1. to investigate the occurrence of equine asthma syndrome (EAS) in a group of Campolina and Mangalarga Marchador horses through post-exercise respiratory endoscopy and cytology; 2. compare the efciency of different diagnostic criteria; and 3. compare the incidence of EAS by breed, age group and sex. A standardised exercise test was conducted in the eld, followed by respiratory endoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage and fluid collection 30 min post-exercise. Clinical evaluation pre- and post-exercise, respiratory endoscopy post-exercise and bronchoalveolar lavage, also post-exercise, were in 30 horses (15 Campolina and 15 Mangalarga Marchador) aged 3 -18 years, without a history of respiratory illness and without clinical evidence of active respiratory disease. All horses were in active training and were considered t to participate in equestrian competition characteristic of these breeds. Post-collection, the horses were subdivided into healthy or EAS-positive, depending on several diagnostic criteria. Statistical comparisons between breeds, age brackets (up to 7 years of age and above 7 years of age) and sex were conducted using appropriate statistical tests. According to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology, 56.7% of the horses showed at least one inclusion criteria that contributed to classi cation as EAS- positive. Of those, only one was classi ed as moderate EAS, while the others were classi ed as mild. Total cell count in the BALF above 530 cells/ \u00b5L was the single most common diagnostic criteria (100%), by increased were found between macrophage and lymphocyte numbers according to breed, but no other differences between breeds, age brackets, sex or status (healthy vs. EAS-positive). A high occurrence of EAS was found in competition-ready Mangalarga and Campolina pacer horses in this study. Introduction According to the literature, in flammatory airway disease (IAD) and recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) are two of the most important respiratory diseases affecting horses (Mazan 2018), causing signi cant economic losses to the equine industry worldwide (Wysocka and Kluci /C19nski 2014). Recently, a phenotypic classi cation was suggested to include IAD and RAO under the term equine asthmasyndrome (EAS). According to the newly introduced classi cation criteria, IAD was classi ed as mild-to-moderate EAS, while RAO was classi ed as severe EAS (Bullone and Lavoie 2017). Detailed description of the phenotypic characteristics of each classi cation, together with diagnostic criteria, is presented in a Consensus published in 2016 (Cou \u20acetil et al . 2016). Despite careful description of cytologic ndings from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, the Consensus is unclear as to the cut-off point to classify EAS into mild or moderate and emphasises that the conditions are not necessarily part of a continuum. Combining clinical, endoscopic and cytologic criteria, summarised in Table 1 (Cou \u20acetil et al . 2016), a better diagnosis of EAS can be achieved. Equine asthma syndrome is well documented and prevalent in horses participating in several equestrian sport modalities, such as horseracing, endurance and dressage (Burrell phenotypic characteristics of CharacteristicEAS\u2014mild to Airway neutrophilia Age of onset Younger horses to matureOlder than 7 years of age Clinical featuresOccasional cough, poor athletic performance, increased respiratory effort post-exercise, signs for at least 4 weeksFrequent cough, exercise intolerance, increased respiratory effort at rest, large variation of clinical signs over time History Stable environment Exposure to dust or allergens; stable or pasture * Other infectious causes of increased mucus secretion should be eliminated. Excessive mucus classi cation according but it has not yet been described in Brazilian pacer ( 'Marchadores ') breeds such as Campolina and Mangalarga Marchador. These horses participate in a speci c format of competition designed to test their resistance, riding comfort, manoeuvrability and ability to execute speci c farm-related tasks. The competitions typically last between 2 and 4 h of continuous pacing with judging based on criteria elaborated by the Breeders Associations (ABCCMM and ABCCC). This study investigated the occurrence of subclinical EAS in Campolina and Mangalarga Marchador horses through endoscopy and BALF collection for cytology conducted after a standardised exercise test in the eld. Statistical queries were made to determine effects related to age group, sex and breed. Ef ciency of different diagnostic criteria was also demonstrated. Materials and methods This study was approved by the Universidade Federal Fluminense Ethics Committee (CEUA-UFF) under the number 964/18. All privately owned horses had informed written consent provided by the responsible person before the start of the experiment. Horses Thirty Brazilian pacers ( 'Marchadores ') from two Campolina (Campo) and four Mangalarga Marchador (MM) stud farms were included in this study. Fifteen Campo and 15 MM, all in training and considered t to participate in competitions, aged 3 -18 years, with no recent history (6 months) of respiratory illness and no clinical signs of active respiratory disease, were chosen by their owners to participate in this research. Horses were picked due to their clinical and athletic status, based on owner convenience. Apart from the inclusion diagnostic criteria described above, horses had to be sound (no lameness), free of systemic diseases, with a normal haematology examination and not pregnant if female. Physical examination, endoscopic mucus scoring and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collection Each horse underwent a complete clinical examination by an experienced equine veterinarian before being authorised to participate in the study. Venous blood for a complete blood count and differential leucocyte count was collected prior to the study in EDTA vacuum tubes (BD Vacutainer/C226)1. Horses allowed to participate in the study were subjected to a standardised ridden exercise programme consisting of a brief warm-up at the walk and 30 min of fast pacing (between 12 and 14 km/h), alternating left and right reins. All exercise tests were conducted on sand at the properties where the animals were housed. Immediately before, immediately after and 30 min after the exercise, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and rectal temperature ( T) were measured and recorded. Thirty minutes after the end of the standardised exercise programme, horses were sedated with 10 \u00b5g/kg of intravenous detomidine and respiratory endoscopy and BALF collection were conducted. Endoscopy was done according to prescribed techniques (Gerber et al . 2004b) using an Olympus/C226Fibrescope model CF-10L2. Visible mucus in the trachea was classi ed by the same observer according toGerber (Gerber et al . 2004a) as follows: 0 (no visible mucus), 1 (single blob or multiple small noncon fluent blobs), 3 (con fluent or stream forming mucus), 4 (pool-forming mucus) and 5 (profuse amounts of mucus). Immediately after the endoscopy, BALF was collected according to prescribed techniques (Hoffman 2008) using 250 mL of warmed saline for infusion through a silicone BAL tube (MILA/C226, 300 cm, 2.5 mm)3. BALF was processed and analysed according to the Consensus guidelines (Cou \u20acetil et al . 2016). In brief, samples were collected into sterile laboratory grade glass vials, placed on ice and immediately an aliquot of 250 \u00b5L was placed on a cytocentrifuge (Serocito, Fanem)4and spun at 110 gfor 5 min to produce cytology slides. Slides were stained with Romanowsky and Giemsa stains for differential cell counts (300 cells counted at 10009magni cation in a Bioval L2000 optic microscope)5. For the investigation of the effect of age on the diagnosis of EAS, the horses were subdivided into two groups: those up to and including 7 years of age and those older than 7 years of age. This division was based on criteria published in the Consensus for EAS (Cou \u20acetilet al . 2016). Occurrence of EAS in males in comparison with females and in Campolina horses in comparison with Mangalarga horses was also investigated. EAS diagnostic criteria All horses with one of more of the following ndings were considered EAS-positive: BALF neutrophils above (TCC) above 530 cells/ \u00b5L and tracheal mucus above grade 2. Only horses with all values below these cut- off points were considered healthy. The authors chose neutrophil percentages in the BALF as the criteria for classi cation into mild (5 -10%), moderate (11 -25%) and severe (above 25%) EAS, given the Consensus does not provide a guideline for such classi cation. Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were conducted using Minitab 1.8 and GraphPad 8 software6. Individual results as well as averages and standard deviations for BALF cytology, HR and RR were analysed, and descriptive statistics are presented. For comparison of cell percentages in the BALF in each of the breeds, a Student ttest was used. For comparison of number of EAS-positive horses by age group, Fisher 's exact test was used. For comparison of mucus score between breeds, age groups, sex and state (healthy vs. EAS-positive), Mann -Whitney test was chosen. ANOVA was used to compare HR, RR and T between groups and state, followed by Tukey 's test for multiple comparisons. For comparison between diagnostic criteria, a chi-square test was used. For all statistical tests, a signi cance level of 95% (P <0.05) was used. Results Mean values and standard deviation (s.d.) for age; volume of fluid recovered during BAL procedure (mL); TCC BALF (cells/ \u00b5L); and percentages of neutrophils, mast cells and epithelial cells in BALF are shown inTable 2 . There was no signi cant difference between the ages of the Mangalarga and Campolina horses when grouped (P =0.12) or separated by sex (P =0.27). A Student t \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd356 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / jul y 2022 test for independent samples showed no signi cant differences by breed in neutrophil (P =0.12), eosinophil (P=0.71), mast cells (P =0.90), epithelial cell (P =0.70) percentages and TCC in BALF, but a signi cant difference in macrophage (P =0.02) and lymphocyte (P =0.02) percentages. HR, RR and Tmeans and standard deviations (SD) separated by group (MM healthy and EAS, CAMPO healthy and EAS groups) are shown in Table 3 . Apart from changes in HR, RR and Trelated to activity, all other physiological parameters and baseline haematology were within normal reference rages for the species. ANOVA demonstrated a signi cant variation in HR, RR and Tattributed to individual horse (P =0.003) and time (pre-exercise, immediately post- exercise or 30 min after exercise, P <0.001) in Mangalarga horses, while in Campolina horses the only signi cant variation was attributed to time (P <0.001). There was no signi cance in HR, RR and T attributed to state (healthy vs. EAS-positive, P=0.47) in either breed. Only horses negative to all criteria as per the Equine Asthma Syndrome Consensus (Cou \u20acetil et al . 2016) were considered healthy (n =13). According to the various endoscopic/BALF diagnostic criteria listed in the material and methods section, 17 from the 30 horses (56.7%) in the sample were diagnosed as EAS-positive, although only one (3%) of these was classi ed as moderate due to eosinophilia above 5%. Fisher 's exact test showed no differences in the numbers of healthy and EAS-positive horses by breed (P =1.0), age group (P =0.40) or sex (P =1.0). Individual observations for each of the diagnostic criteria are available inSupplementary Item 1 . The Mann -Whitney test showed no differences in mucus grades between breeds (P =0.12). None of the horses presented with clinical signs of EAS during the experiment. When individual diagnostic criteria where considered, all horses (17/17; 100%) diagnosed as EAS-positive through more than above \u00b5l, (6/17) had elevated neutrophils. Chi-square test showed no differences in percentages of positive animals as far as mucus score (P =0.22), total cell count (P =0.86), neutrophilia (P=0.41) or eosinophilia =0.50) between breeds. However, outcome percentages were signi cantly different for the various diagnostic criteria (P =0.02, Fig 1 ), with per cent differences between observed and expected counts being larger than expected for TCC and lower than expected for neutrophils. Representative images of the BALF cytology are shown in Figures 2 -4. Discussion This study demonstrated a high occurrence of EAS in asymptomatic horses, contributing to the notion that subclinical disease is prevalent among equine athletes. A recent publication has identi ed pathological changes in the airways of racehorses actively engaged in competition, even though histology rather than BALF cytology was used (Ter Woort et al . 2018). Other authors using endoscopic examination also found a high occurrence of EAS in seemingly healthy horses (Gerber et al. 2003; Cullimore et al. 2018; Davis and Sheats 2019).TABLE 2: Summary statistics of variables from Mangalarga 20.3 484.7 15.5 17.3 1.8 1.2 0.3 0.7 Campo Mean 5.5a167.9a729.2a53.6b40.3b3.7a1.2a0.4a0.8a Campo S.D. 1.6 13.8 563.3 5.8 5.1 1.6 1.2 0.5 0.7 Age, Vol =recovered volume of saline (mL); Different superscripts in each column indicate a signi cant difference (P <0.05).

To our knowledge, this is the rst report of BALF cytology post-exercise in Brazilian pacers. Our results demonstrate that post-exercise BALF cytology can be a valuable tool for diagnosing EAS in subclinical cases. From all the diagnostic criteria used, the only one common to all horses was total cell count in the BALF, suggesting that in post-exercise BALF this criterion might be the most sensitive one for identifying subclinical EAS. During this research, horses were subjected to a standardised exercise test (SET) in the eld inspired by the work these breeds of horses perform during competition. Other SET might not be appropriate since they would impose metabolic and musculoskeletal demands very different than those sustained by Brazilian pacers. It is the view of the authors that modality-speci c SETs should be employed whenever possible. Other equestrian modalities and authors share similar views (Art et al . 1990; Barbesgaard et al . 2010; Munsters et al . 2014). Axed speed for the SET was not determined since there is large variation in the speed pacers can achieve within their morphologic con guration. Previous studies have shown pacing speeds for MM to vary greatly and be largely individual (Lage et al . 2017). We considered suf cient amovement pattern that was quick, between 12 and 14 km/h, similar to what is seen during competition, especially considering these breeds use mostly aerobic metabolism (Wanderley et al . 2010). The endoscopic evaluation was conducted 30 min after exercise in order to allow for animals to fully recover from the SET and return to baseline heart rate and respiratory rate for sedation to be carried out with minimal complications. The possible detection of exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EPIH), should that be a feature, was also taken into consideration when deciding the time of post-exercise endoscopy. Thirty minutes post-exercise is considered to be the minimum amount of time required for EIPH to be consistently detected (Hinchcliff et al . 2014). Low-grade EIPH was in fact detected in three animals (data not shown), but evaluation of degree through cytology using a total haemosiderin score was not conducted due to its impracticality in a eld setting. Due to the importance of respiratory diseases to equine health and welfare, diagnostic criteria helping clinicians identify subclinical and clinical illness are of paramount importance. In this sense, the phenotypic characterisation of EAS by the Asthma Consensus (Cou \u20acetil et al . 2016) is a hallmark for equine clinicians worldwide. However, the publication did not clarify cut-off values for differentiation between mild EAS and moderate EAS, with horses classi ed as severe presenting neutrophilia above 25% in the 1: Relative values for each test results and the average of all criteria for EAS-positive and EAS-negative horses. \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd358 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / jul y 2022 this sense, in the course of planning this study the authors decided to use neutrophil count in the BALF as a classi cation criterion for EAS severity. This choice was based on clinical experience and the fact that neutrophils are the rst cells recruited to the site of airway in flammation, despite the importance of eosinophils in the pathophysiology of asthma (Monteseir /C19n 2009). Neutrophils have been recognised as drivers of asthma-associated airway remodelling and are the primary cells in noneosinophilic asthma phenotypes (Ciepiela et al . 2015). In horses, neutrophils rather than eosinophils are recruited to the lungs (Fairbairn et al . 1993), and equine heaves (RAO) has been demonstrated to be neutrophilic in nature (Lavoie et al . 2001). Total cell count in the BALF was greater than that previously reported (Gerber et al . 2003) and there were more horses with eosinophilia than neutrophilia, in contrast to previous publications (Cullimore et al . 2018) and to our ownexpectations. Eosinophilia is commonly seen in young racehorses as a response to inhaled particles (Ivester et al . 2014), and 78% of the horses in the present study were younger than 7 years of age. In temperate climates in the Northern Hemisphere, between 10 and 20% of adult horses have been reported to present severe EAS (Hotchkiss et al . 2007; Leclere et al . 2011). In this study, only one horse (3%) had cytology compatible with moderate EAS as evidenced by eosinophilia above 5%. An effect of climate can be inferred (Davis and Sheats 2019), but we did not investigate the effects of temperature, humidity or seasonality on EAS given that a single collection was done. Breed did not play a role in each of the different criteria used for diagnosis of EAS, nor in the total number of positive animals; however, CAMPO had higher lymphocyte, while MM had higher macrophage percentages. The exact reason for this nding is unknown, and further studies are required to clarify this aspect. It can be hypothesised that differences might arise from vaccination protocols, stress or environment, rather than purely due to breed, although the present study did not investigate any of these factors. To investigate age as a factor in the diagnosis of EAS, we compared horses with ages up to and including 7 years with horses older than 7. This division was based on the phenotypic description of mild and severe EAS presented in the Consensus (Cou \u20acetilet al . 2016). Our results indicate that when mucus score and cytological ndings are used as diagnostic criteria, age is not a factor in the occurrence of subclinical EAS. A similar nding was published previously (Gerber et al . 2003). This study did not nd any association between sex and occurrence of subclinical EAS, as previously reported for other horse breeds (Davis and Sheats 2019). Equine asthma constitutes a common cause of poor performance in horses (Pirie 2014; Cou \u20acetilet al . 2016). In this study, HR and RR were measured as indicators of physiologic responses to exercise. Even though there were differences in baseline values in relation to reference ranges (Knottenbelt 2009), which could be attributed to heat or stress, immediately post-exercise and 30 min post-exercise values 10 \u00b5m cytology. of mononucleated cells (macrophages - red arrow and lymphocytes - yellow arrow) and rare neutrophil; bar 10 Romanowsky -Giemsa stain.

There were no signi cant differences in HR, RR or T in relation to status (healthy vs. EAS-positive). It has been widely accepted that poor performance is a feature in EAS (Cou \u20acetilet al . 2016), although not necessarily in subclinical cases. As stated above, other authors have found evidence of airway inflammation in horses that were actively competing in racing (Ter Woort et al . 2018). These ndings suggest that poor athletic performance might not be a requirement for diagnosis of mild-to-moderate asthma in horses. This work is the rst to present cytological evidence of EAS in Brazilian pacers t to compete and to use post-exercise BALF cytology, especially the total cell count, in this population of horses to diagnose EAS.

Original Article A histological evaluation of facial suture lines in six horses aged 1 day to 9 years L. Geitzenauer, H. Geyer,A .E .F \u20acurst, L. Kleinand M. A. Equine Department, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich; andInstitute of Veterinary Anatomy, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, are brous connections between the flat bones in the skull, allowing a small amount of movement to absorb strain and load as long as they are patent. In the present study, we examined the histological appearance of facial suture lines in horses of different ages. The internasal, nasofrontal and maxillolacrimal sutures were macroscopically identi ed and extracted from the skulls of six horses aged 1 day (two horses), 5 days, 2, 6 and 9 years and prepared into histological samples. The suture lines were then examined for width, form, cell density and morphology, vascularisation and morphology of the surrounding tissue and compared based on the age of the horse. Although macroscopically the sutures became dif cult to identify in the 6- and 9-year-old horses, histologically they were clearly visible in all samples, indicating that the sutures were patent and consisted of connective tissue in all analysed horses. The sutures became subjectively narrower with lower cell density in older horses as compared to young horses, and there was a noticeable maturation from woven to cancellous bone surrounding the sutures. Vascular structures were present in all sutures regardless of age or location. In conclusion, this study raises awareness of the histological suture conformation in neonatal and adult horses and their persistence into adulthood. A better understanding of the histological structure of facial sutures and their continued patency into adulthood can aide in the interpretation of radiographs and computed tomography images of the head and in improving treatment methods and outcomes for horses affected with suture exostosis. In addition, if biopsies are taken, clinicians will have a basis on which to determine which cells are related to the disease process and which are normally occurring. Introduction Craniofacial sutures are brous connective tissue articulations found between neighbouring flat bones in the skull (Jaslow 1990; Nickel et al . 2004; Rice 2008). Sutures not only function as connections between adjacent bones but also are primary sites of osteogenesis in the skull (Rice 2008). Sutures do not have a cartilaginous precursors such as bone growth centres but rather function as intramembranous bone growth sites (Opperman 2000). A small amount of movement occurs as long as they remain patent -meaning the interdigitated bone is separated by connective tissue -which is important during birth (Rice 2008) as well as for load absorption during mastication, as researched using miniature swine (Rafferty and Herring 1999; Herring et al . 2001). In humans, the cranialsutures begin to close in the second to third decade of life, whereas the facial sutures remain patent and separated by brous connective tissue for much longer, fusing only in the seventh or eighth decade of life (Opperman 2000; Rice 2008). The reason for this difference is that the calvaria of the mammal has its most active period of growth during embryogenesis and shortly after birth, whereas the facial skeleton does not experience the majority of its rapid growth until adolescence (Rice 2008). It is not known at what age the facial sutures close histologically in horses, but it stands to reason that this cannot happen until rapid facial growth has been completed (Jaslow 1990; Dixon 2014). The nasofrontal suture is recorded as closing (at least radiographically) in horses at 1 year of age (Butler et al . 2017). Suture line exostosis in horses causes nonpainful, usually bilateral swelling in the dorsal aspect of the equine head (Dixon 2014; Klein et al . 2014; Butler al Radiographs commonly show a proliferative periosteal (and endosteal) reaction and new bone growth around the suture lines characterised by a radiolucent defect and some degree of soft tissue swelling (Wyn-Jones 1985; Gibbs and Lane 1987). Several case studies have been published focusing on diagnosis, imaging and treatment options of suture exostosis in . 2014; Klein et al . 2019). However, there is still a distinct lack of information on the histological morphology of equine facial sutures. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine facial sutures in horses aged 1 day to 9 years in order to identify histological features of normal facial sutures. This information can then be used to better understand the disease process and hopefully optimise treatment options and outcomes. Moreover, the understanding of histological morphology of facial sutures could help in the interpretation of radiographs and computed tomography images of the equine head. Based on the research of Rice (2008) and Rafferty and Herring (1999), we hypothesised that the sutures would contain brocytes/ broblasts, interdigitation varying with age and anatomic location as well as osteoblasts in areas where new bone growth is expected, at least in the samples of the foals. Materials and methods Samples from six horses ranging in age from 1 day to 9 years were taken from the Sutura internasalis, Sutura nasofrontalis and Sutura maxillolacrimalis ( Fig 1 ). Since samples were taken only over a period of 2 months, the age groups were not \u00a92020 EVJ distributed. The foals and horses were patients of the University of Zurich and the owners agreed to the collection of post-mortem specimens. The foals and horses were subjected to euthanasia for reasons unrelated to this study and did not present with any clinical indications of suture exostosis. The horses were not exsanguinated, and suture samples were collected between one and 24 h after euthanasia. After removal of the skin and subcutaneous tissue over the expected suture lines, the bone was exposed until the suture was identi ed. Then, sections of bone of 1.5 91.5 cm were removed from the selected sites with a mallet and hammer, with the suture line in the middle of the sample.Samples of all three sutures were collected for all horses except the 5-day-old foal, where only the Sutura maxillolacrimalis could be evaluated and the 6-year-old horse, where only the specimens of the internasal and nasofrontal (MMA sample only) sutures could be evaluated. The specimens were xed in a 4% formaldehyde solution. The specimens were divided into two pieces: one part was completely decalci ed with EDTA for 2 months and then embedded in paraf n. The second part was incompletely decalci ed and then in ltrated and embedded in methyl methacrylate (MMA). The paraf n sections were regularly cut in a 90 \u00b0angle to the suture; after ve to 10 serial sections of 2-5\u00b5m, the specimens were adapted so that some sections could be cut parallel and within the suture line. The sections were stained with haematoxylin -eosin as a routine staining. The MMA blocks were cut with a diamond-coated band saw in sections (1 mm thick), mounted on polyacrylate slides and then milled with a microtome milling machine (Leica 2600/C226) to sections of 300 \u00b5m, which were stained with Giemsa or Giemsa eosin. The Giemsa staining enables differentiation of bone and connective tissue and cartilage in MMA sections. The MMA sections were cut in the same directions as the paraf n sections. From the serial sections, which showed very similar results, the qualitative best sections were evaluated independently, but unblinded for age and location of the sample by three authors (L.G., L.K. and H.G.). The sections where the suture lines were clearly visible were analysed for width, form, cell density and morphology, vascularisation and morphology of surrounding tissue. The samples were viewed by the authors under a Leica DM LB2/C226light microscope, and digital images were obtained using a Leica DC480/C226camera mounted on the microscope. Measurements of the sutures were made using a magni cation of 950 with light microscopy. The sutures were visually examined and then measured at three locations each that appeared to ful l the following measurement criteria: wide, narrow and most common width. The widest and narrowest measurements were recorded as well as median of the common width. The interdigitation was evaluated subjectively based on the angle of the suture loops visible in the 950 magni cation -that is does the suture make a full 180 \u00b0turn (tight interdigitation) or only 90 \u00b0(mild) or somewhere in between (moderate). This is illustrated in Fig 2 ; 2 31 Fig 1: Equine skull showing the location of sample collection of the facial suture lines 1: Sutura internasalis. 2: 1-day-old MMA sample, Giemsa stain. The -moderate in this sample. b) Sutura nasofrontalis 6-year-old horse, MMA sample, Giemsa -Eosin stain. The suture is visible along the entire length of the sample and is denoted by an arrow. It is surrounded by mature cancellous bone (CB). The interdigitation is tight in this sample. The interdigitation was evaluated by measuring the approximate angles at which the suture changed course (lines); a directional change in 90 \u00b0or less was deemed mild interdigitation, greater than 90 \u00b0but less than Fig 2a shows a suture with mild-to-moderate interdigitation - the angles at which the suture changes direction are between approximately 90 \u00b0and 145 \u00b0. In comparison, Fig 2b shows a suture with tight interdigitation; the two marked suture sections run essentially parallel to one another after a short section in which the suture changes course, corresponding to an approximately 180 \u00b0turn. Results Histologically, the sutures can be identi ed in the photomicrographs as structures interdigitated with surrounding bone that are composed of connective tissue (Fig 3 ). The sutures contain mostly brocytes and broblasts, but also some osteoblasts as well as blood vessels ( Fig 4 ). The sutures are wider where large vessels are found within the sutures and these vessels are often concentrated in the central portion of the width of the suture. Many of the larger vessels have a diameter of approximately 200 lm. The sutures course between two adjacent skull bones, joining them together with varying levels of interdigitation ( Fig 3 ). The interdigitation of the sutures is being evaluated on a two-dimensional plane in the photomicrographs, when in reality the sutures interdigitate three-dimensionally. For this reason, the plane of intersection of the suture becomes relevant in the interpretation of the degree of interdigitation. Ideally, the photomicrographs show the suture along its length at one depth -this was approximated in several samples and is shown in Fig 2 . However, this was not always possible to achieve macroscopically, and some samples appear to transect the suture tangentially, resulting in a nonlinear view of the suture and making an evaluation of its interdigitation dif cult ( Fig 5 ). Table 1 summarises the results of representative photomicrographs in each of the age categories and sutures.There are several features that can be used to mark the maturation of the suture as the age of the horse increases. The connective tissue is loose in the 1-day-old and 5-day-old foals and appears denser with a lower cellularity in the adult horses ( Fig 6 ). Osteoblasts, which are indicators of new bone formation, are present in a higher concentration in the 1-day-old and 5-day-old foals and rarely found in the adult horses ( Fig 7 ). The borders of the suture are identi ed by the intersection of brous connective tissue with bone. In the foals and 2-year-old horse, these borders have a high cellularity and walls of osteoblasts and/or brocytes and broblasts are present on the suture side of the border. In adult horses, the borders are composed of connective tissue interspersed with 100 \u00b5m240 \u00b5m a c b Fig 3: Sutura maxillolacrimalis 5-day-old foal, HE stain.

The bony interface is identi ed in the foals and 2-year-old horse by woven bone and medullary cavities; in the 6- and 9-year-old horses, this is replaced by cancellous bone with osteons ( Figs 2b ,6and 8). Discussion The aim of the present study was to histologically examine the internasal, nasofrontal and maxillolacrimal sutures in horses aged 1 day to 9 years and identify key histological features of facial sutures in horses of different ages. The sutures became increasing dif cult to identify macroscopically on the skull -the Sutura maxillolacrimalis was not identi able in the 6-year-old horse -however, all of the sutures examined were clearly visible on histology and contained connective tissue and blood vessels. There islimited information as to proposed ages of fusion in facial sutures in horses; Butler et al . (2017) suggest that the nasofrontal suture is obliterated at 1 year of age, the left and right nasal bones (the internasal suture) do not fuse, and the maxillolacrimal suture is not speci cally discussed, although the premaxilla suture is listed as being obliterated in the fourth year of life. However, as the authors are unaware of any previous studies examining facial suture patency in horses, these fusion times could be based on radiographic and gross visibility. The results of this study suggest that the patency of the facial sutures could be much longer than was previously thought and in fact, similar to that of the facial sutures in humans, which do not fuse until the seventh or eighth decade of life (Opperman 2000; Rice 2008). As the horse 's age increased, a progressive maturation of all three sutures was observed. This is evident through aTABLE 1: Summary of the results Suture Age Cell 260 480 60 Internasalis 1 d High Fibrocytes Fibroblasts Some osteoblastsHigh Moderate 500 700 420 Internasalis 2 y Moderate - highFibrocytes Fibroblasts Some osteoblastsHigh Moderate 560 940 340 Internasalis 6 y Moderate Predominantly Fibrocytes & broblastsModerate - highModerate 320 800 160 Internasalis 9 y Moderate Predominantly brocytes & broblastsModerate - highTight 200 500 80 Nasofrontalis 1 d High Fibrocytes Fibroblasts Some osteoblastsHigh Moderate - tight200 500 100 High Predominantly brocytes & broblastsModerate - highUnable to evaluate200 500 100 Nasofrontalis 2 y Moderate - highFibrocytes Fibroblasts Some osteoblastsHigh Tight 200 400 50 Nasofrontalis (MMA)6 y Unable to evaluateUnable to evaluate Moderate - highTight 200 240 100 Nasofrontalis 9 y Moderate Predominantly brocytes & broblastsModerate - highTight 140 560 60 Maxillolacrimalis 1 High Fibroblasts Some osteoblastsHigh Unable to 1300 d Moderate - highPredominantly brocytes & broblastsHigh Tight 300 800 200 Maxillolacrimalis 5 d High Predominantly brocytes & broblastsHigh Unable to evaluate240 420 180 Maxillolacrimalis 2 y Moderate - highPredominantly brocytes & broblastsHigh Tight 100 400 40 Maxillolacrimalis 9 y Moderate Predominantly brocytes & broblastsModerate - highTight 160 360 60 d, day; years. \u00a92020 EVJ Ltd365 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / jul y 2022 juxtaposition of the internasal sutures of the 1-day-old foal and the 2- and 9-year-old horses, which clearly shows the change in density of the connective tissue and cellularity as well as the maturation of the adjacent bone from woven to cancellous. In fact, newborn foals have wide sutures with a high degree of highly cellular loose connective tissue and a high level of vascularisation, surrounded by woven bone. As the horse matures, there is a clear reduction in the number of cells present in the suture and osteoblasts become rare. Interpretation of width measurements in this study is prone to error because of the limited number of values obtained in each location and the width appeared to beinfluenced by the plane of sample transection, which appeared in some samples inconsistent. Despite this, we feel that in the samples examined from individual horses there was subjectively, a slight narrowing of overall suture width from all locations with increasing horse age. This could be made more objective by using larger sample numbers, ensuring that all samples were extracted from the same anatomical location (i.e. relative location to gross landmarks irrespective of gross identi cation of the suture) and taking more measurements. Additionally, analysing sutures along a larger portion of their length, as well as at comparable levels of depth, would provide additional information as to whether sutures tighten at similar or a) MC MC CB ONSC 1000 \u00b5m \u00b5m 100 c) cation interest shown in the low magni cation photomicrograph.

In all three suture locations (internasalis, nasofrontalis and maxillolacrimalis), there was clear interdigitation visible and the interdigitation seemed to increase with the age of the horse. Moreover, the serpent-like suture lines appear in all sutures not only in the outer, more horizontal plane but also in the vertical plane that connects the adjacent bones with one suture, the Sutura maxillolacrimalis in the 2-year-old horse, even appearing to be transected tangentially. However, the interpretation of the interdigitation is biased to the angle that the tissue was sectioned and therefore limited in its value. For this reason, the authors did not take a quantitative approach to describing the interdigitation of the sutures. Mature sutures unite bone surfaces through various degrees of overlapping or interdigitation corresponding to the strain applied to it and are characterised by brous tissue that absorbs the load at a much higher level than the rigid skull bones are able to do (Jaslow 1990; Herring et al . 2001; Herring 2008). Research has shown that higher strain energy, and therefore a higher degree of interdigitation, in the suture corresponded to a greater ability to absorb shock (Jaslow 1990; Maloul et al . 2014). Three types of strain have been identi ed to in fluence the mechanical properties of sutures: impact loading, for example from falling or contact with a foreign object or intentional forces such as ghting; cyclic loading, for example during mastication; and quasi- static strain from the presence of adjacent tissues such as changes in intracranial pressure or direct strain to the facial sutures through growth of adjacent structures (Herring 2008; Moazen et al . 2016). Studies examining the skulls of mice and children reported an increase in suture interdigitation after birth as well as new bone growth, a dense network of collagen bres and a high level of vascularisation in the suture borders (Rice 2008; Khonsari et al . 2012). Similarly, inthe present study we could observe an increase in suture interdigitation between birth and adult age, suggesting an increased adaptation for shock absorption. However, what level of strain different suture lines in horses undergo during mastication is not known. In miniature swine, during normal mastication, the frontonasal suture has been shown to experience predominant compressive loading and exhibited a greater degree of interdigitation (Rafferty and Herring 1999). It can be hypothesised that in horses the frontonasal suture will also absorb the most compressive forces during mastication, which could explain why suture exostosis occurs most frequently at this location. However, we were not able to objectively identify different grades of interdigitation for each location in the present study. This study has a number of limitations including a small sample size that does not include weanlings, yearlings or horses over the age of nine. In addition, the lack of samples where the sutures were grossly fused does not allow conclusions to be made as to how gross fusion corresponds to histological fusion. This could be improved in further research by optimising consistency of sample location among horses as well as removing a larger area of suture line for comparison. In hindsight, it would have been bene cial to evaluate gross appearance before removing bone sections from the anatomical site where the suture was expected to be located. This would also have allowed bone to be removed for analysis in horses that no longer had grossly visible sutures. However, Klein et al . (2019) showed that the sutures are not always located in the same anatomical location -therefore, it would be necessary to take bone samples over a much larger area in cases where the suture is not grossly visible and examine a much larger number of histological samples. A number of methods have been suggested to evaluate suture patency, including a qualitative method rst suggested by Broca in 1875 that uses a scale of 0-4 based on the macroscopically visible degree of synostosis or a more quantitative analysis of suture closure such as that used by Hershkovitz et al . (1997) which measures the percentage of visible suture obliteration in order to classify a suture as totally closed, partially closed, partially open, totally open or prematurely closed (Broca 1875). Recent advancements in technology have allowed more sophisticated quantitative methods of evaluating suture morphology and patency such al . 2016). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the examined internasal, nasofrontal and maxillolacrimal sutures in horses up to 9 years of age are comprised of connective tissue and therefore histologically patent. Further studies would need to be done with horses of various ages, possibly horses up to 30 years of age, in order to determine whether these results are consistent among a larger sample group and at what age the facial sutures in horses fuse.

CONTROLLED SIGNS: Clinical signs improved within 3 months and continued through 6 months.1PROVEN SUCCESS: 3 out of 4 horses evaluated were considered treatment successes.1CLEAR IMPROVEMENT: Hypertrichosis (delayed shedding) improved in 89% of treated horses within 6 months.1Dopamine receptor agonist for oral use in horses only Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. Description: PRASCEND Tablets are rectangular light red colored, half-scored tablets containing 1 mg pergolide, as pergolide mesylate. Pergolide mesylate is a synthetic ergot derivative and is a potent dopamine receptor agonist. The chemical name of pergolide mesylate is 8\u00df-[(Methylthio) methyl]-6-propylergoline The chemical structure is:Prascend\u00ae (pergolide tablets) 1 mg Indication: For the control of clinical signs associated with Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (Equine Cushing's Disease) in horses. Dosage and Administration: Administer orally at a starting dose of 2 mcg/kg once daily. Dosage may be adjusted to effect, not to exceed 4 mcg/kg daily. It has been reported that pergolide tablets may cause eye irritation, an irritating smell, or headache when PRASCEND Tablets are split or crushed. PRASCEND Tablets should not be crushed due to the potential for increased human exposure and care should be taken to minimize exposure when splitting tablets. The tablets are scored and the calculated dosage should be provided to the nearest one-half tablet increment (see Table 1). Dosing should be titrated according to individual response to therapy to achieve the lowest effective dose. Dose titration is based on improvement in clinical signs associated with Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID) and/or improvement or normalization of endocrine tests (for example, dexamethasone suppression test or endogenous ACTH test). In some cases, adverse events were reported after a dose increase (see Post-Approval Experience ). If signs of dose intolerance develop, the dose should be decreased by half for 3 to 5 days and then titrated back up in 2 mcg/kg increments every 2 weeks until the desired effect is achieved. Contraindications: PRASCEND is contraindicated in horses with hypersensitivity to pergolide mesylate or other ergot derivatives. Warnings: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. Keep PRASCEND in a secure location out of reach of dogs, cats, and other animals to prevent accidental ingestion or overdose. Dogs have eaten PRASCEND tablets that were placed in food intended for horses or dropped during administration of the tablets to the horses. Adverse reactions may occur if animals other than horses ingest PRASCEND tablets (see Post- Approval Experience ). Human Warnings: Not for use in humans. Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children. PRASCEND should not be administered by persons who have had adverse reactions to ergotamine or other ergot derivatives. Pregnant or lactating women should wear gloves when administering this product. It has been reported that pergolide tablets may cause eye irritation, an irritating smell, or headache when PRASCEND Tablets are split or crushed. PRASCEND Tablets should not be crushed due to the potential for increased human exposure and care should be taken to minimize exposure when splitting tablets. Consult a physician in case of accidental ingestion by humans. Precautions: Treatment with PRASCEND may cause inappetence. The use of PRASCEND in breeding, pregnant, or lactating horses has not been evaluated. The effects of pergolide mesylate on breeding, pregnant, or lactating horses are not known; however, the pharmacologic action of pergolide mesylate suggests that it may interfere with reproductive functions such as lactation. PRASCEND is approximately 90% associated with plasma proteins. Use caution if administering PRASCEND with other drugs that affect protein binding. Dopamine antagonists, such as neuroleptics (phenothiazines, domperidone) or metoclopramide, ordinarily should not be administered concurrently with PRASCEND (a dopamine agonist) since these agents may diminish the effectiveness of Prascend.Table 1 Dosing Table Dosage Body Weight 2 mcg/kg 4 mcg/kg 136 - 340 kg (300 - 749 lb)0.5 tablet 1 tablet 341 - 567 kg (750 - 1,249 lb)1 tablet 2 tablets 568 - 795 kg (1,250 - 1,749 lb)1.5 tablets 3 tablets 796 - 1,022 kg (1,750 - 2,249 lb)2 tablets 4 tabletsEffectiveness: An open-label, historical control, field study evaluated the effectiveness of PRASCEND for the control of clinical signs of PPID. A total of 122 horses with PPID were enrolled in the study, 113 of which were included in effectiveness evaluations. The success of each horse was based on results of endocrinology testing (dexamethasone suppression test or endogenous ACTH test) and/or improvement in clinical signs related to PPID (hirsutism, hyperhidrosis, polyuria/polydypsia, abnormal fat distribution, and/or muscle-wasting) on the Day 180 evaluation. Based on endocrine testing and investigators' clinical assessment scores, 86 (76.1%) of the 113 evaluable cases were treatment successes. Enrolled horses were diagnosed with PPID based on the presence of hirsutism and an abnormal pre-study endocrine test result. All horses were treated with 2 mcg/kg PRASCEND (to the nearest one-half tablet) orally once daily for the first three months. If the endocrine test result on Day 90 was normal or adequately improved, the horse continued on the same dose through Day 180. If the endocrine test result on Day 90 was abnormal, the dose increased to 4 mcg/kg given once daily through Day 180. Forty-seven (41.6%) of the 113 horses included in the effectiveness database required a dose increase at Day 90. Improvement was noted in scores for all clinical sign categories and in mean results for endocrine tests. Animal Safety: In a six month target animal safety study healthy adult horses received PRASCEND administered orally, once daily, at doses of either 0 mcg/kg, 4 mcg/kg, 6 mcg/kg, or 8 mcg/kg (0X, 1X, 1.5X, or 2X the maximum recommended dose). There were eight healthy horses (four males and four females) in each treatment group. Doses were prepared by dissolving tablets in approximately 10 mL of a 50% sugar water solution. PRASCEND treated groups had lower mean heart rates and higher mean temperatures than the control group. Horses in all treatment groups had minimum heart rates within the normal range and maximum temperatures below 101.5\u00b0F. One 1.5X horse experienced a mild episode of spasmodic colic on Day 3 that resolved after treatment with flunixin meglumine. Mean red blood cell counts and hemoglobin values were lower in PRASCEND treated groups as compared to the control group. Other hematology parameters including hematocrit, white blood cells, absolute neutrophils, and absolute lymphocytes exhibited mild, transient decreases as compared to the control group. The hematology parameters generally decreased over the first 30 to 60 days after treatment initiation and then returned to values similar to pre-treatment levels. No treatment related alterations were identified on histopathology evaluation of bone marrow. Storage: Store at or below 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F).

At the baseline evaluation 1.6% of owners reported a history of inappetence or decreased appetite as compared to the 32.8% of horses that experienced inappetence or decreased appetite during the study. Most cases of inappetence were transient and occurred during the first month of treatment; however, some horses experienced sporadic inappetence throughout the study. Two horses required a temporary reduction in dose due to inappetence during the first month of the study. Both horses returned to their original dose within 30 days. Weight loss occurred in more than half of the horses in this study; however, weight loss that was considered abnormal was only reported in 11 horses. Lethargy was reported in 9.8% of horses during the study, and was not reported in any horses at the baseline evaluation. Behavioral changes were noted in 6 horses including aggression, kicking, agitation, nervous behavior and increased activity. One horse required a temporary reduction in dose due to energetic behavior during the first month of the study. Eight horses died or were euthanized during the study due to worsening of pre-existing conditions (laminitis, dental disease, septic tenosynovitis), or colic (strangulating lipomas, large colon volvulus). One mare was inadvertently enrolled in the study while pregnant and experienced dystocia resulting in the death of the foal. Post-Approval Experience (2019): The following adverse events are based on post approval adverse drug experience reporting for PRASCEND. Not all adverse events are reported. It is not always possible to reliably estimate the adverse event frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure using these data. The following adverse events in horses are categorized in order of decreasing reporting frequency by body system and in decreasing order of reporting frequency within each body system: General: anorexia, lethargy, weight Behavioral: aggression (to other horses and humans), hyperactivity (anxiety, agitation), other behavioral changes (stud-like behavior, spooky, unpredictable, confused) Clinical pathology: anemia, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia The above adverse events were reported in some horses at starting dose levels, while in the others following a dose increase. Death (including euthanasia) has been reported. Adverse events have been reported in dogs following ingestion of tablets prepared for administration to horses.

Clinical Pharmacology: Pergolide mesylate is a synthetic ergot derivative and is a potent dopamine receptor agonist. As with other dopamine agonists, pergolide inhibits the release of prolactin which suggests that it may interfere with lactation. In horses with PPID, pergolide is believed to exert its therapeutic effect by stimulating dopamine receptors, and has been shown to decrease the plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), and other pro-opiomelanocortin peptides.1 Pharmacokinetic information in the horse is based on a study using single oral doses of 10 mcg/kg in six healthy mares between 3 and 17 years of age.2 Pergolide was rapidly absorbed; the mean maximum concentration (Cmax) was 4.05\u00b12.02 ng/mL with the median time to maximum concentration (Tmax) being 0.415 hours. The area under the curve (AUC) was 14.08\u00b17.46 hr\u00b7ng/mL. The mean half life (T1/2) was 5.86\u00b13.42 hours; the mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was 1204 mL/kg/hr; and the mean apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was 3082\u00b11354 mL/kg.Original Article Surgical colic caused by brous bands and adhesions in absence of previous abdominal surgery: 9 cases (2012 -2019) G.

Study design Retrospective case series. Methods Records of horses that underwent exploratory laparotomy at the University of Turin VTH between 2012 and 2019 were reviewed. Clinical and surgical features of cases diagnosed with adhesions or brous bands as the primary cause of colic were retrieved, excluding those that had a history of previous abdominal surgery, either for gastrointestinal or urogenital problems. Results Nine out of 293 horses which underwent exploratory laparotomy between 2012 and 2019 met the inclusion criteria for the study. In three cases the adhesion involved the omentum (and the caecal apex, mesojejunum or mesocolon). In one case a brous band 3 -4 cm long running across the mesojejunum parallel to the small intestine strangled a loop of small intestine. In the remaining cases the adhesion involved the left colon. Of these, two were geldings and the adhesion involved the internal inguinal ring region. Both had funiculitis after castration. The others were mares,and in one of them the adhesion was at the level of a small hernia in the left lateral abdominal wall. Main limitations Small number of cases. Conclusions This is the rst case series of surgical colic caused by adhesions in a virgin abdomen. In horses, abdominal adhesions in the absence of previous abdominal trauma may be a cause of colic. Parturition, colon displacement and castration may be predisposing factors for the formation of intra-abdominal adhesions. Clinical relevance \u0081De novo adhesion formation in horses is associated not only with laparotomy surgery, but also with other predisposing factors such as previous castration or complications related to parturition. \u0081Intestinal adhesions are often asymptomatic and likely therefore to be underdiagnosed. In some cases, they may be the primary cause of colic when they cause intestinal incarceration or traction on the mesentery. \u0081The presence of intestinal adhesions in horses that have not undergone previous exploratory laparotomy must be included in the differential diagnosis of patients hospitalised for an acute abdomen, especially if they are subjects at higher risk such as broodmares or geldings. Article An online survey of equestrian headcollar use and safety D. J. Marlin*, J. M. Williams*and K. J. Pickles\u00a7 David Marlin of Equine Science, Hartpury University, Hartpury, Gloucestershire; and\u00a7School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, UK *Corresponding Background Headcollars (halters, US) are one of the most commonly used pieces of equestrian 'tack '. Despite this, there appears to be minimal information on their use or, more importantly, risk factors for injury of horses/handlers. Objective To explore headcollar use and safety in equestrians. Study design Quantitative cross-sectional survey. Methods An online survey (19 questions) exploring headcollar use and safety was disseminated through equestrian social media. Frequency analysis and multivariable modelling identi ed how headcollar type was linked to use and injury risk. Results Most respondents (88%; n =4786) used headcollars multiple times daily but for short time periods (66%, n =3388, <30 min). A horse being injured as a result of wearing a headcollar was reported by 1615 (31%) respondents with 15% of incidents also injuring a person. Fractures (horses) occurred in 134 incidents, and 167 equine fatalities were reported. Across all headcollar types, the odds of injury risk increased by 1.7 times (con dence intervals (CI): 1.07 -2.41, P <0.02) using a headcollar when mucking out. During travelling, headcollar use reduced the odds of risk of injury by 0.7 times (CI: 0.43 -0.98, P <0.04). The odds of injury risk reduced when using leather (Odds ratio (OR):0.8, CI: 0.66 safety headcollars compared to standard headcollars of the same material. Thematic analysis identi ed three key themes: (1) need for increased education: t, safety features and basic horse handling, (2) 'safer 'leather headcollars and (3) increased safety focus required. Main limitations Data were self-reported and may be subject to memory recall errors; online surveys are subject to self-selection bias ( Fig 1 ). Conclusions Increased user knowledge of risk factors for headcollar injury, combined with standardised guidance on how to correctly t and use headcollars, would be bene cial to reduce injury risk. Clinical relevance \u0081This preliminary study has identi ed an incidence rate for headcollar injury of 31 incidents per 100 people surveyed. Injuries ranged from cuts and bruises to fractures and fatalities. \u0081One third of respondents reported that their horse was injured as a result of wearing a headcollar; 70% of injuries occurred when the horse was tied up and 20% occurred in the eld. \u0081Increased education of horse-owners on how to correctly t and use headcollars may reduce injuries in horses.

Dyson*, C. Martin, A. Bondi\u00a7and A. D. Ellis\u00b6 The Cottage, Market Weston;Writtle University College, Chelmsford;\u00a7Firbeck House, (RHpE) was developed to facilitate identi cation of musculoskeletal pain. Objectives To determine the in fluence of rider skill on ridden horse performance and behaviour, the latter using the RHpE. It was hypothesised that gait quality at trot and canter would improve with a more skilled rider compared with a less-skilled rider, but the RHpE scores would be similar. Study design Repeated measures investigation. Methods Forty horses, in regular work and presumed by their riders to be non-lame, were ridden by their normal rider (N) and a skilled professional rider (P), performing a dressage-type test over 8.5 min. Twenty horses were ridden rst by rider P and 20 were ridden rst by rider N. The presence of lameness or gait abnormalities in canter was recorded. Standardised video recordings were acquired. All videos were anonymised and presented in random order to the assessors. Rider skill and horse gait quality were graded (F/C19ed/C19eration Equestre Internationale scale, 1 -10), and the RHpE was applied to each horse using the video recordings. Results Rider P had a higher median skill score (6/10) compared with the N riders (4.5/10) (P <0.001). There was a correlation between rider skill scores and gait quality scores (P <0.001). The presence of lameness or gait abnormalities in canter,when ridden by riders N and P, varied among horses. The median RHpE score for all horses was 9/24 (range 3 -14). There was no difference in mean or median RHpE scores between the N riders and rider P. There was some variance in the frequency of occurrence of speci c behaviours between the N riders and rider P. Main limitations The identity of rider P could not be concealed. Conclusions There was no direct relationship between rider skill level and the RHpE score, but riders did alter the manifestations of some behaviours. Clinical relevance \u0081Different riders in fluence the presence or absence of mild lameness or gait abnormalities in canter in an unpredictable way. \u0081A more skilled rider may keep some horses better balanced, effectively concealing low-grade lameness, although he/she may accentuate lameness in others by asking for increased hindlimb impulsion. The same effect may not be seen with more severe lameness, or when horses are required to perform more biomechanically demanding movements. \u0081Although a skilled rider may improve the gait quality of a horse and reduce the degree of lameness, the RHpE score may not improve, although the manifestations of different behaviours may change. \u00a92020 Article The Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram S. Dyson The Cottage, Market Weston, Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE) comprises 24 behaviours, the majority of which are at least 10 times more likely to be seen in lame horses compared with non-lame horses. The observation of 8/24 behaviours is likely to re flect the presence of musculoskeletal pain, although some lame horses score <8/24 behaviours. A marked reduction in RHpE scores after resolution of lameness using diagnostic anaesthesia proves a causal relationship between pain and RHpE scores. Horses should be assessed for approximately 10 min in walk, trot (including 10 m diameter circles), canter and transitions. The validity of the RHpE has been veri ed for use in horses which perform dressage-type movements, and which have been trained to work with the front of the head in a vertical position. It has not, as yet, been used in horses while jumping, racehorses, western performance or endurance horses. The RHpE provides a valuable tool for riders, trainers, veterinarians and other equine professionals to recognise the presence of musculoskeletal pain, even if overt lameness cannot be recognised. Riders with a higher skill- level may improve gait quality, but cannot obscure behavioural signs of pain, although speci c behaviours may change. Tight saddle tree points, the rider sitting on the caudal third of the saddle and rider weight may in fluence RHpE scores. Accurate application of the RHpE requires training and practice. The RHpE is a powerful tool for the assessment of ridden horses and the identi cation of likely musculoskeletal pain. Such pain merits further investigation and treatment, to improve equine welfare and performance. The RHpE provides an additional means of evaluating the response to diagnostic anaesthesia. It provides a mechanism for client education and a diplomatic way of communicating with clients about equine discomfort related to saddle- t, rider size, their position in the saddle and ability to ride in balance. This commissioned article reviews the development of the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram (RHpE) and its validation. It describes how and when to use the RHpE and discusses the current evidence about factors other than musculoskeletal pain which may in fluence RHpE scores. What is the Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram? An ethogram is a catalogue of behaviours, each with strict denitions (Grier 1984). The RHpE comprises 24 behaviours, the majority of which are at least 10 times more likely to be seen in a lame horse compared with a non-lame horse (Dyson et al . 2018a). The presence of eight or more of these behaviours is likely to re flect the presence of musculoskeletal pain. Different horses react to musculoskeletal pain in avariety of ways, therefore the spectrum of behaviours demonstrated does not indicate the speci c source(s) of pain, although pilot observations using principal component analysis suggest that clusters of behaviours may occur together (Dyson and Ellis 2022). Why was the RHpE developed? There is a high frequency of occurrence of lameness in the ridden sports horse population, which is apparently unrecognised by owners (Greve and Dyson 2014; Dyson and Greve 2016). Abnormalities of canter, for example close spatial and temporal placement of the hindlimbs or the lack of a suspension phase (Barstow and Dyson 2015; Boado et al . 2020; Greve and Dyson 2020), are frequently overlooked. There appears to be an ethos in the horse world for blaming ridden horse performance problems on the horse 's behaviour, the rider 's inadequacies, or faults in training, rather than considering that a problem may re flect musculoskeletal pain. From a welfare perspective, there was a clear need to provide a new tool to facilitate owner recognition of the presence of underlying discomfort. This problem is not unique to the horse and there is an increasing recognition in other species, such as the dog and cat, that alterations in behaviour are often a manifestation of pain (Mills et al . 2020). The majority of veterinarians have received little training in the recognition of low-grade lameness, the ways in which ridden horses adapt to musculoskeletal pain (Greve and Dyson 2020), and the in fluence that discomfort can have on ridden horse performance. Some owners who do recognise that their horse may show signs of an underlying pain- related problem have faced frustration, because many veterinarians have shown a lack of ability to recognise ridden horse performance problems, or have received inadequate training for assessment of ridden horse problems. The potentially unnecessary expense of whole- body skeletal scintigraphy, which frequently provides misleading results (Quiney et al . 2018), the conclusion that a problem is solely behavioural, or the advice to 'ride him through it ', creates distrust in the profession 's ability to provide answers. The use of objective gait analysis in ridden horses remains in its infancy and measurement of gait asymmetry in hand does not necessarily translate to ridden horse performance. Moreover, a horse with either bilateral or multilimb lameness may show no obvious asymmetry (Buchner et al . 1995; Braganc /C223aet al . In addition, a subjectively non-lame horse, selected based on a comprehensive lameness examination, may exhibit gait asymmetry above the objective threshold dened for lameness (Greve and Dyson 2016). Thus, a tool 10.1111/eve.13468which helps the recognition of pain in ridden horses would be a valuable addition to the veterinarian 's diagnostic armamentarium. How was the RHpE developed? Preliminary investigation of ridden horse behaviour evaluated facial expressions (Mullard et al . 2017; Dyson et al . 2017, 2018c), because facial expressions had been proven to be important in pain recognition in the horse (Dalla Costa et al . 2014, 2016; Gleerup et al . 2015; Van Loon and Van Dierendonck 2015) and other species (Cheung and Choi 2008; Langford et al . 2010; Ahola 2012; Descovich et . 2017). It was demonstrated that lame and non-lame horses could be differentiated by evaluation of facial expressions alone (Dyson et al . 2017). By examination of video recordings of ridden non-lame and lame horses an ethogram comprising 117 behaviours encompassing facial expressions, head position and movement, tail movements, body posture and responses to a rider 's cues was developed (Dyson et al . 2018a). The ethogram was applied by an experienced assessor to video recordings of nine horses on two occasions and excellent repeatability was observed. By application of the 117 behaviours ethogram to lame and non-lame ridden horses, 24 behaviours were identi ed which were seen more often in lame horses, the majority of which were at least 10 times more likely to be seen in horses with musculoskeletal pain compared with non-lame horses. These 24 behaviours make up the RHpE (Table 1 ,Figs 1 -6). The display of 8/24 behaviours was highly likely to re flect the presence of musculoskeletal pain, although some lame horses scored <8/24 behaviours. Most non-lame horses scored 0 -4 (median 2), whereas the median score for lame horses was 9 (range 4 /C014). Resolution of lameness by diagnostic anaesthesia resulted in signi cant reductions in the RHpE scores, consistently to <8/ 24, when the ethogram was applied by an experienced assessor (Dyson et al . 2018b; Dyson and Van Dijk 2020), or by untrained assessors of various professional backgrounds (Dyson and Van Dijk 2020). The latter study identi ed features of the ethogram which untrained assessors found more difcult to identify, for which training would be bene cial (for example, an intense stare [ Figs 1a ,3a,4b,5b], the bit being pulled through to one side [ Figs 1b ,3a]). In addition, a threshold of 6, 7, 8 or 9 behaviours for differentiation between non-lame and lame horses was tested, and 8/24 behaviours had the highest combined sensitivity (0.86) and speci city (0.80) compared with 6 (sensitivity 0.95, speci city 0.65), 7 (sensitivity 0.92, speci city 0.72) and 9 (sensitivity 0.81, speci city 0.80). The substantial reduction in RHpE scores after resolution of pain by diagnostic anaesthesia validated a causal relationship between pain and alterations in behaviour. How has the RHpE been validated? All the initial development and testing of the RHpE used video recordings. However, comparison between video assessment and real-time application of the RHpE showed excellent agreement for a trained assessor (Dyson et al . 2020b). The ability of a cross-section of equine veterinarians of variable age, sex and experience to apply the RHpE in real-time, after preliminary training, was tested bythe evaluation of 20 horse-rider combinations performing a purpose-designed dressage test of 8.5 min 'duration (Dyson et al . 2020b). The volunteer riders considered that their horses were capable of working comfortably, 'on the bit 'at trot and canter for 30 min. The gait of the horses was assessed independently by another experienced equine clinician, who determined the presence of lameness and/or abnormalities of canter. By application of the RHpE alone, the trained veterinarians were able to differentiate horses with low-grade lameness (the most frequent lameness grade was 2/8 [Dyson 2011]) and abnormalities of canter and non-lame horses, with good agreement with an experienced assessor. The RHpE was further tested by use in the eld. Data from the 20 horses described in Dyson et al . (2020b) were combined with data from the evaluation of a convenience sample of a further 40 horses in regular work and presumedTABLE 1: The Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram, adapted from Dyson et al . 2018a 1.

The horses comprised Riding School horses, those used for General Purposes (including unaf liated competition), Show Jumping, Eventing and Dressage, and performed the same purpose-designed dressage test. The RHpE was applied retrospectively to video recordings acquired in a standardised fashion. Overall, 73% of horses were lame (grade 2/8) on one or more limbs and 47% had gait abnormalities in canter. Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram scores ranged from 3 -16/24 (median 9). The effect of breed, sex, horse age, work-discipline, epaxial muscle hypertonicity or pain (assessed by an equine physiotherapist), an ill- tting saddle (evaluated by a Society of Master Saddlers Quali ed Saddle Fitter), rider skill score (determined by a British Horse Society Instructor), and the presence of lameness or gait abnormalities in canter (assessed by an experienced equine clinician) on the RHpE score was assessed using Poisson regression. Two variables were retained in the nal multivariable analysis, lameness (P =0.008) and rider skill score as a continuous variable (P <0.001). A RHpE score 8/24 was again a good indicator of the presence of musculoskeletal pain.In an additional study comprising a convenience sample of sports and leisure horses, gait in hand and when ridden were evaluated independently, by two veterinarians, and compared (Dyson et al . 2022a). Movement of the saddle during ridden exercise and rider position, balance and size relative to the saddle were documented by a British Horse Society Instructor. Ridden Horse Pain Ethogram scores were determined by a skilled assessor based on evaluation of video recordings. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis was used to determine factors which in fluenced the RHpE scores. Of 148 horses, 28% were lame in hand, whereas 62% were lame ridden. Sixty percent of horses showed gait abnormalities in canter. The median RHpE score was 8/24 (interquartile range 5, 9; range 0, 15). There was a signi cant positive association between lameness and the RHpE score. Riding School horses had higher RHpE scores compared with General Purpose horses. Saddles with tight tree points and riders seated at the back of the saddle rather than the middle were signi cantly associated with higher RHpE scores.

These data provide strong evidence that the display of 8/24 behaviours of the RHpE is likely to re flect the presence of musculoskeletal pain, although some lame horses score <8/24. The validity of the RHpE has been veri ed for use in horses which perform dressage-type movements and which have been trained to work with the front of the head in a vertical position. It hasnot, as yet, been used in horses while jumping, racehorses, western performance horses or endurance horses. The data also illustrate the importance of evaluating horses ridden, to include transitions between and within gaits, trot, canter, 10 m diameter circles in rising trot, and more collected work for horses working at a more advanced level. The results of application of the RHpE by 23 assessors have been documented, including skilled assessors (Dyson et al . 2018a,b; 2022a; Dyson and Ellis 2022; Dyson and Pollard 2020), equine veterinarians after preliminary training (Dyson et al . 2020b), an equine physiotherapist after on-line training1 and additional repeatability assessment (Dyson et al . 2020c) a) b) Fig 5: a) On 3 tracks: the right hindlimb is following the left forelimb; the left hindlimb is to the left of the left forelimb.

How to use the RHpE What you need to know before using the RHpE The assessor needs to be fully aware of the de nitions of each of the 24 behaviours ( Table 1 ,Figs 1 -6), and the use of a check sheet ( Supplementary Item 1 ) is strongly advised. Certain factors need to be assessed before the RHpE is applied. Some arena surfaces are very deep, and all horses appear to disturb the footing with their hind feet, making it difcult to determine accurately if the horse has a bilateral hindlimb toe drag. If the bit is too wide, then the bit will appear that it is being pulled through to one or both sides of the horse 's mouth. Some horses have a small iris in one or both eyes, so the sclera can be seen at rest, so repeated exposure of the sclera cannot be counted as a pain behaviour in one or both eyes of these horses. If the muzzle is pink ( Fig 6b ) it may make it more challenging to determine if the mouth is open. Timing, work pattern, duration and intensity After a short period of warm-up following the rider 's usual protocol, the horse should be worked in walk, trot and canter on both reins around the periphery of the arena, and should be observed from both sides, the front and the rear ( Fig 1 -6). In a rectangular arena it is best to watch the horse from two different corners, on the left and right reins, respectively. It is important to view the horse from behind as well as from both sides and from the front on both reins. Ideally the horse should also be observed performing 10 m diameter circles in rising trot, to the left and right, as gures of eight. Some horses are completely comfortable being ridden in working paces and may only show discomfort when working in collection in speci c movements. It is therefore important to observe the horse performing its full repertoire of movements. The horse should be observed for a minimum of 5 min and up to 10 min. Some of the behaviours are de ned as being time dependent (for example, ears behind vertical for 5 s) and their duration should be timed using a stopwatch. An assessor has to be aware of how a rider is applying cues to the horse. For example, tail swishing may coincide with application of a spur aid ( Fig 1a ), rather than occurring spontaneously, and therefore should be disregarded unless repeated under other circumstances. It must be borne in mind that several of the denitions state 'repeated ', for example repeated incorrect strike off into canter, repeated exposure of the sclera; a single occurrence of such a behaviour would not ful l the criteria of the ethogram. Training As with any clinical skill, training and practice are essential for accurate interpretation of the RHpE and improvements in performance with training have been demonstrated (Mullard et al . 2017; Dyson et al . 2020b). An on-line training course is available1, although the effectiveness of this training course has not been scienti cally validated. Factors that can potentially in fluence the RHpE A RHpE score 8/24 is likely to re flect the presence of musculoskeletal pain, but to date no relationship betweenthe RHpE score and the source(s) of pain has been determined. Rider size may also in fluence the RHpE score. In a cross-over design study, four riders of varying size rode six horses in randomised order, performing a standardised dressage-type test (Dyson et al . 2018d, 2020a). There was a signi cant positive correlation between rider weight and the RHpE score, although the majority of scores were <8/24. Saddle t for both the horse and the rider are potential influential factors on RHpE scores (Dyson et al . 2018d, 2020a). In a few small studies an ill- tting saddle, considered by a Society of Master Saddlers Quali ed Saddle Fitter to have the potential to adversely affect performance, did not have a statistical in fluence on RHpE scores (Dyson and Pollard 2020; Dyson et al . 2020b, 2020c). However, in a much larger scale study, saddles with tight tree points compared with correctly- tted saddles and riders seated at the back of the saddle rather than the middle were associated with signi cantly higher RHpE scores (Dyson et al . 2022a). This is consistent with previous clinical observations that there have been dramatic improvements in RHpE scores and gait in some horses after change from a saddle with excessively tight tree points to a better tting saddle (Dyson et al . 2020b). However, if an underlying lameness is also present, abnormal behaviour will persist. Rider skill has the potential to in fluence the quality of a horse 's gait. When the performance of 40 horses was assessed, each ridden by two different riders, a professional rider and the horse 's usual rider, there was a signi cant correlation between rider skill scores and gait quality scores (Dyson et al . 2020c). The presence of lameness or gait abnormalities in canter, when ridden by each rider, varied among horses. However, there was no signi cant effect on the total RHpE scores when horses were ridden by their usual riders compared with the professional rider. Nonetheless, some individual behaviours did change. Thus, a more skilled rider may make a horse move better compared with a less skilled rider but will generally be unable to conceal behavioural signs of musculoskeletal pain, although the speci c behaviours exhibited may change. There is considerable controversy about the use of potentially restrictive nosebands (Fenner et al . 2016; Doherty et al . 2017; Uldahl and Clayton 2019) and the use of a bit as opposed to a bitless bridle (Cook and Kibler 2019; Mellor 2020). In a study of 148 ridden horses, those wearing crank cavesson nosebands compared with cavesson nosebands had signi cantly higher RHpE scores, but there was no effect of other noseband types (Dyson et al . 2022a). There was no difference in mouth opening, as de ned by the RHpE (Figs 1b ,4d), in horses with a noseband with the potential to restrict mouth opening, compared with a correctly- tted cavesson noseband, or no noseband. In lame horses, diagnostic anaesthesia resulting in resolution of lameness was associated with substantial reductions in RHpE scores, despite the presence of a bit and potentially restrictive nosebands (Dyson et al . 2018b; Dyson and Van Dijk 2020). However, the proportional reduction in the frequency in occurrence of mouth opening with separation of the teeth for10 s, was less than for some other behaviours (Dyson and Van Dijk 2020). Mouth opening with separation of the teeth for 10 s was commonly observed in horses warming up for the dressage phase of 5-star three-day events, the majority of which wore potentially restrictive nosebands (Dyson and Ellis 2022). \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd377 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / jul y 2022 We expect to observe substantial reduction in RHpE scores after abolition of pain using diagnostic anaesthesia, assuming that the saddle ts adequately (Dyson et al . 2018b; Dyson and Van Dijk 2020). However, in some horses the behaviour 'Front of head 30in front of vertical for 10 s ' may change to 'Front of head 10behind vertical for10 s '(Dyson and Van Dijk 2020). Factors in fluencing head and neck position in ridden horses are discussed elsewhere (Dyson et al . 2020d). A bilateral hindlimb toe drag may persist or develop after diagnostic anaesthesia of the hindlimbs. A crooked tail may persist despite improvement in gait (Dyson and Van Dijk 2020; Hibbs et al . 2021). Crooked tail carriage was abolished in only 12% (20/164) horses in which hindlimb gait abnormalities were improved by diagnostic anaesthesia (Hibbs et al . 2021). Other factors to consider when assessing ridden horses There are a number of other factors which need to be considered when assessing ridden horses which were not assessed during the development of the RHpE because of variation in horse tness, environmental conditions, the accuracy of audio recordings of horses and observations which cannot be quanti ed but can be communicated via the rider. These are subjective observations, but have been repeatable (Dyson et al . 2018b; Dyson and Van Dijk 2020), although the underlying cause may be multifactorial. The change in observations after resolution of underlying musculoskeletal pain using diagnostic anaesthesia lends credence to cause and effect. Sweating or a respiratory rate which are disproportionate to the work intensity, horse tness and environmental temperature are likely indicators of musculoskeletal pain. There may be an increase in respiratory noise in movements or gaits which the horse nds biomechanically more demanding. Repeated teeth grinding usually re flects discomfort. There are aspects of behaviour and movement which require the assessor to communicate with the rider, for example horse tension and rideability (the horse 's acceptance of, and responsiveness to, the rider 's cues), the range of motion of the thoracolumbosacral region and the impulses generated through the rider 's back, and the way in which the rider 's pelvis is moved during canter (Dyson 2016a, 2017). Rein tension may be altered, with either lack of rein tension ( Fig 6b ), excessive rein tension (the horse 'hanging 'on the rider 's hands) or asymmetrical rein tension (the horse 'leaning 'on one side of the bit, which is re flected by bit position in some horses [ Fig 3a ]). In association with hindlimb lameness the saddle may consistently slip to one side (Greve and Dyson 2013; 2014) (Fig 6a,b ). Finally, snorting or nose blowing are often observed after improvement in lameness by diagnostic anaesthesia (Dyson et al . 2018b), presumably re flecting improved comfort and a positive emotional state (Stomp et al . 2018, 2020). It must also be recognised that oral, ocular or visceral pain (for example equine gastric ulcer syndrome) can contribute to pain in ridden horses and result in alterations in behaviour (Kj\u00e6rulff and Lindegaard 2022). However, it must also be borne in mind that gastric ulceration may develop secondary to chronic musculoskeletal pain and resolution of the ulcers may not improve ridden horse behaviour (Dyson et al . 2022b).When to use the RHpE There are multiple potential uses for the RHpE. Many equine clinicians have faced the situation when an owner fails to recognise or refuses to acknowledge that their horse has a combination of problems, resulting in chronic musculoskeletal pain, for which there is a guarded prognosis for pain-free ridden exercise. The RHpE provides an additional means of communicating with, and educating, the owner. The RHpE also provides a diplomatic means of illustrating to an owner that there may be an unacceptable imbalance between horse and rider size, and can be used to demonstrate the effect of the rider 's position in the saddle. The RHpE enables owners, veterinarians and other paraprofessionals to recognise the presence of subclinical problems, which merit further investigation by a veterinarian skilled at the investigation of ridden horse problems. Early recognition of musculoskeletal pain and accurate diagnosis will facilitate effective long-term management and improve both performance and equine welfare. At a pre-purchase examination the aim is to be a detective, to determine the risks involved with purchase of a horse for a speci c purpose, for a speci c rider. Any tool which gives additional information is of potential value. The RHpE has been routinely applied at pre-purchase examinations for several years (S. Dyson, unpublished data). There are circumstances when horses have been coping at their current work level, with their regular rider, and appear to move symmetrically, but do not move with normal fluidity, do not have normal range of motion of the thoracolumbosacral region and have restricted gaits. If the RHpE score is 8/24 this provides additional information that there is likely to be underlying musculoskeletal pain. Purchasers are advised accordingly of the potential risks. Horses purchased despite these discussions have been observed to subsequently deteriorate and require long-term management to maintain adequate comfort (S. Dyson, unpublished data). The RHpE can be used to assess a horse 's response to the t of a saddle for both the horse and the rider. An association between both tight saddle tree points and the rider sitting on the caudal one-third of the saddle and the RHpE score has been documented (Dyson et al . 2022a). Skilled saddle- tters have long-recognised a relationship between saddle- t and equine behaviour (Schleese 2014). When investigating poor performance in ridden horses the use of diagnostic anaesthesia is crucial for identifying the source(s) of pain (Dyson 2016b). The response to diagnostic anaesthesia can be evaluated by the presence or absence of lameness, the quality of the horse 's gaits and the horse 's behaviour. If there is not substantial reduction in the RHpE score it implies that there is residual pain, requiring further investigation. When differentiating trigeminal-mediated head shaking behaviour with head tossing behaviour in ridden horses, secondary to musculoskeletal pain, the RHpE can be used to support the likely presence of musculoskeletal pain (Thomson et al . 2020). The RHpE score has provided evidence that idiopathic hopping-type forelimb lameness in ridden horses (Dyson and Rasotto 2016) is likely to be pain-induced (Dyson 2020). This is despite no response to systemically administered analgesic medication, and no change or deterioration in lameness following diagnostic anaesthesia, possibly because the lameness is associated with neuropathic pain (Dyson 2020). \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd378 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / jul y 2022 The power of the RHpE has been demonstrated by its application to horses during warm-up for the dressage phase at 5-star three-day events (Dyson 2019; Dyson and Ellis 2022). There was a signi cant positive correlation between dressage penalty scores and the RHpE score. Fifty-nine percent of horses with a RHpE score 7 failed to complete cross-country, compared with 33% with a score <7 (Dyson and Ellis 2022). Horses that failed to complete the cross-country phase had signi cantly higher RHpE scores compared with those that completed. There was a signi cant relationship between total RHpE score and nal horse placings, with higher scores being associated with lower placings. Horses with lameness or gait abnormalities in canter had signi cantly higher RHpE scores compared with other horses. It was concluded that the RHpE should facilitate earlier identi cation of horses competing at 5-star three-day events which may bene t from diagnosis and treatment, resulting in improvement in both equine performance and welfare, and potentially also the safety of both the horse and the rider. Conclusions The RHpE is a powerful tool for the assessment of ridden horses and for the identi cation of likely musculoskeletal pain that merits further investigation and treatment, to improve equine welfare and performance. It provides an additional means of evaluating the response to diagnostic anaesthesia. It provides a mechanism for client education and a diplomatic way of communicating with clients about equine discomfort related to rider size, their position in the saddle and their ability to ride in balance.

Part 2: Serological diagnostic testing methods and diagnostic test result interpretation F. M. Whitlock* and J. R. Newton British Horseracing Authority, London, author email: fleurwhitlock1@gmail.com Keywords: horse; diagnostics; infectious disease; laboratory Summary This article is the second in a review series about infectious disease diagnostics and summarises serological testing techniques, diagnostic test validation and result interpretation. It highlights the requirement for results to be interpreted with testing limitations in mind and in conjunction with the case 's clinical presentation. With these foundations, the treating clinician should always be well placed to deal with equine infectious diseases. Introduction A good understanding of laboratory-based sample analysis techniques and their validation is necessary for optimal diagnostic test result interpretation. Part 1 in this series discussed the importance of agent detection testing in infectious disease outbreaks, how this is achieved and the different testing methods available for agent detection (Whitlock and Newton 2022). This second section will summarise serological testing techniques, test validation and results 'interpretation. A more extensive guide to international infectious disease outbreak handling and eradication can be found in the HBLB International Codes of Practice (https://codes.hblb.org.uk/). Additional information on laboratory diagnostics for equine infectious diseases endemic to North America can be found in the AAEP Infectious Disease Guidelines (https://aaep.org/ guidelines/infectious-disease-control/using-guidelines). Immunological response to infection diagnostic testing methods Serology is used to analyse samples for the presence of pathogen-speci c antibodies. Their presence demonstrates an immune response (at some point) to the speci c pathogen or to vaccination against the speci c pathogen (if vaccine is not a marker vaccine that can be readily differentiated from infection). Although this is not an exhaustive list, the most commonly used serological testing methods for equine infectious diseases present in the UK will be discussed and are summarised in Table 1 . Enzyme-linked complexes by an enzyme -substrate reaction. Viral antigen is bound to the plate, the sample serum is added and if the sample contains the target antibody (primary antibody conjugate) to the test, it will bindto the viral antigen with a resultant colour change in a direct ELISA ( Fig 1 ). Indirect, sandwich and competitive ELISAs utilise secondary antibodies labelled with an enzyme, and if any primary antibody is present, complexes will form with a resultant colour change. An example of when an ELISA may be used is when testing to determine whether a sample contains Streptococcus equi (S.equi )-speci c antibodies. Currently, there are two different ELISAs available and a clinician is advised to familiarise themselves with the merits of each of these, to assist in choice of assay and result interpretation. In short, an ELISA based on the SeM protein was initially developed to identify horses that may be at risk of sequelae following S.equi infection, such as metastatic abscessation, or from developing purpura haemorrhagica following receipt of an SeM-containing vaccine (Sweeney et al . 2005). Genetically, S.equi is very similar to Streptococcus zooepidemicus (S.zooepidemicus ) and it was found that this test had the propensity to produce false- positive results due to this cross-reactivity (Kelly et al . 2006). Another assay was developed utilising proteins that were more speci ct o S.equi , to avoid the issues of cross-reactivity with S.zoopidemicus (Robinson et al . 2013). As previously discussed in Part 1 of this series, infectious disease diagnostic testing must be utilised and interpreted in light of the clinical scenario, whilst also having an awareness of the accuracy and limitations of each available diagnostic test for a disease. Again, S.equi serological testing is a good example for this. The most optimal application of the ELISA test has been reported to be following a recent con rmed strangles outbreak, to determine a horse 's exposure status, with those exposed being at risk of being persistently infected. This then enables more targeted agent detection diagnostics of those cases with serological evidence of being exposed (Newton et al . 2000). Clinicians should have an awareness of the limitations of utilising the ELISA as a screening test when previous potential exposure status to S.equi is unknown. This is asS.equi carriers may not maintain detectable antibodies, despite being chronically infected (Bowen et al . 2020). It is commonplace that infectious disease diagnostics may require various sample types, multiple sampling time points and a series of different diagnostic tests, in order to obtain a correct diagnosis.

EVA is noti able in stallions in the UK and positive results if unexpected and not otherwise explained by vaccination are required to be noti ed to Defra. S. equi There are two different ELISA tests commercially available. Each ELISA tests for antibodies produced to speci c bacterial proteins. Cross reaction can occur if the target S.equi bacterial protein chosen for the test is similar to S.zooepidemicus proteins (resulting in false positives). The A/C ELISA tests for antibodies to two different S.equi surface proteins, with detection of antibodies against either or both proteins interpreted as a positive result (Robinson et al . 2013). The SeM ELISA tests for SeM-speci c antibody. EIA Screening test and if positive, AGID performed as a con rmatory test.

IFAT is often performed as a con rmatory test. AGID EIA Also known as Coggins test. A more speci c test compared to the EIA ELISA. The required test for some importing countries. HI EIV Equine in fluenza strains occurs. Adenovirus None. SRH EIV A more quantitative way for testing serological samples for an immune response to equine in fluenza, mainly utilised in research but can help in epidemiological investigations of EI outbreaks (Barquero et al . 2007). CFT EHV-1/-4 EHV-1 and EHV-4 are commonly both tested for, with cross-reactivity of antibodies between the two; therefore, no distinction can be made regarding the infective strain from CFT results. Recent vaccination against EHV-1/-4 using inactivated vaccine will stimulate CFT antibodies, although antibodies after infection or vaccination are short-lived, declining after several weeks and will rise again if the animal is re-infected. ERV-A/-B ERV-A and ERV-B are tested for, with cross-reactivity of antibodies between the two; therefore, no distinction can be made regarding the infective strain from CFT results.

ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. \u00a92021 EVJ y 2022 Disadvantages of ELISA \u0081Commonly requires two serum samples, taken 10-14 days apart, to assist interpretation and demonstrate a rising titre to a particular infection \u0081If a case is vaccinated with a nonmarker vaccine, no discrimination can be made between infected and vaccinated \u0081Some ELISAs, particularly those designed to be performed stable side, only give a positive or negative result, with no result quanti a speci c antigen at its centre, and serum samples and positive controls will be added in wells around the periphery of the agar (Gershwin 2008). If a sample contains antibodies, a precipitation line will form ( Fig 2 ). An example of this is the Coggins test for equine infectious anaemia (EIA). An ELISA is usually run initially for EIA, unless there are export requirements for a Coggins test. This ELISA has high sensitivity, but low speci city, so if a sample is positive for EIA on the ELISA, it will be run on a Coggins test for con rmation, as the Coggins test provides a better speci city (Scicluna et al . 2013). Haemagglutination inhibition viruses (e.g. equine in fluenza virus) bind (haemagglutinate) red blood cells together, and this characteristic is utilised in the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Sample serum is added in quanti ed serial dilutions to wells on a plate, and a known titre of virus is then added, followed by red blood cells. If there are no speci c antibodies present in the sample serum to the added virus, the virus will bind to the red blood cells, agglutinating them. If there are speci c antibodies to the test virus present, they will bind to the virus and as a result, there will be no unbound virus to agglutinate red blood cells ( Fig 3 ). The plate will be read to determine the highest dilution of serum where haemagglutination by nonbound virus starts to occur again, to de ne the samples antibody titre. Advantages of HI \u0081Quick and easy to perform \u0081Readily quanti able for clear detection of a rising titre, when testing paired serum samplesDisadvantages of HI \u0081Only detects antibodies to viruses that induce haemagglutination \u0081Will only detect antibodies to the particular viral subtype being tested for, or those strains which cross react with that subtype Single radial haemolysis Single radial haemolysis (SRH) is generally used in equine influenza research studies as it provides a continuous quantitative result when compared to HI 's dilution titre. SRH involves virus being incubated with red blood cells. Complement is added, and the mixture is set in agar gel. Sample serum is then added to wells cut out in the gel. If the serum sample contains speci c antibodies, antigen -antibody complexes form and complement xation occurs. This results in red blood cell lysis, and a zone of haemolysis will be seen on the agar gel ( Fig 4 ). The size of the zone of haemolysis around the well is measured to provide a quanti ed result. If there are no antibodies in the sample serum, there are no antigen - antibodies to x complement and no haemolysis zone is seen. Advantages of SRH \u0081Provides a quantitative result \u0081Poor differentiation of response to different strains of H3N8 EI virus, so therefore remains relevant despite viral evolution Disadvantages of SRH \u0081Specialist test requiring trained personnel to perform and read the test results \u0081Does not differentiate between antibody from natural infection and that from vaccination (not DIVA) \u0081Poor differentiation of response to different viral strains, so therefore does not provide information on viral strain typing Complement xation test When performing a complement xation test (CFT), the test virus is added to serial doubling dilutions of sample serum. Complement is then added, followed by antibody-coated red blood cells, which are the indicator for unbound complement in the absence of target anti-viral antibody. If the sample serum contains speci c complement activating antibody, these will bind to the viral antigens and the formed antigen -antibody complex will x the complement. There will be no free complement to cause red blood cell lysis. If there is no antibody present in the sample serum, there will be no formation of antigen -antibody complexes and therefore no complement xed. The complement will remain free, with the indicator stage involving the complement reacting with antibody-coated red blood cells, resulting in haemolysis ( Fig 5 ). Some sample serum can demonstrate anti- complementary activity, interrupting interpretation of the test (false positives) which is often caused by samples containing high serum protein levels. Therefore, each sample serum is also tested for its anti-complementary activity to allow for this possibility and aid result interpretation. To detect whether this phenomenon is present in test sera, an additional well is included and the viral antigen is left out. This is to see C+ C+ C+ C+C+ C+AG AG2 Agar gel immunodiffusion method. AG is equine infectious anaemia antigen, C +is positive control sera. a) test sera 1, 2 and 3 are all positive. b) test sera 1, 2 and 3 are all negative. \u00a92021 EVJ Ltd383 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / jul y 2022 whether the serum itself still xes complement and prevents red cell lysis, mimicking what would happen if there were viral-speci c antibodies present in the sera. If the serum demonstrates anti-complimentary activity, this must be considered when interpreting test results as they may be falsely elevated. CFT is used to test sample for the presence of equine herpes virus-1/-4 (EHV-1/-4) antibodies and this phenomenon of anti-complementary activity can be found in donkeys and occasionally in very sick horses (T.A. Hammond, personal communication). Advantages of CFT \u0081A useful test for EHV-1/-4 as CF antibodies are not long lasting, even after vaccinationDisadvantages of CFT \u0081Anti-complimentary activity can interfere with the test, resulting in false-positive results \u0081Nonspeci c due to cross-reactivity between EHV-1 and EHV-4 Indirect fluorescence antibody test Indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) involves sample serum being added to virus infected cells. If antibody is present in the sample, it binds with a speci c antigen on the tissue. Fluorochrome-labelled secondary antibody conjugate is added, which binds to the already present antigen - antibody complex and releases fluorescence, seen on microscopy ( Fig. 6 ). If there are no antibodies in the sample serum, there will be no fluorescence. Advantages of IFAT \u0081Commonly used as a con rmatory test, for example samples being tested for Dourine that are CF positive will be con rmed by IFAT Disadvantages of IFAT \u0081Test requires a longer time compared to other tests, for example CF and ELISA \u0081More expensive Virus neutralisation test When virus is mixed with susceptible cells, it will infect them and when visualised under a microscope, a cytopathic Scenario a) b)Red blood cells and virus Red blood cells, virus and antibodiesHaemagglutination inhibitionSample is seronegativeHaemagglutinationResult Interaction Sample is BB Fig 3: Haemagglutination inhibition assay; a) the covered red wells indicate haemagglutination (lattice of agglutinated cells), so there are no antibodies to the virus at those sample serum dilutions to neutralise the virus. b) red dot wells indicate no haemagglutination, so the test is positive at the speci ed dilution (the highest last dilution at which haemagglutination is prevented).

When performing a viral neutralisation (VN) test (may also be referred to as a serum neutralisation or SN test), the speci c test virus is added to serial dilutions of sample serum. The diluted serum -antigen mix is then added to the wells of plates containing preformed monolayers of a susceptible cell line. If antibodies are present in the sample serum, they will bind to and neutralise the virus. With no virus available, the cells will show no viral cytopathic effect as a result. The plate will be read to determine the highest dilution of serum at which cytopathic effect occurs, to de ne the sample serum 's antibody titre. Very occasionally, the sample serum added may cause a cytotoxic effect to the cells which appears similar to cell cytopathic effect, interfering with the reading of the test. For equine viral arteritis, this phenomenon may be correlated to the animal recently receiving an inactivated equine herpes vaccination, which is based on virus grown in the same cell culture type as that used in the VN test (Newton et al . 2004). The main utilisation of the VN test is for prebreeding and pre-export equine viral arteritis (EVA) testing. An ELISA is usually initially run for EVA and this ELISA has a high sensitivity. If a sample is positive for EVA on the ELISA, a VN test will be performed for con rmation, as the VN test is a more speci c test when compared to the EVA ELISA. If an animal is known to be seropositive or vaccinated against EVA, the VN test is used directly.Advantages of VN \u0081High sensitivity and very high speci city Disadvantages of VN \u0081Intensive for laboratory staff, requiring viral cell culture facilities \u0081Requires highly skilled laboratory staff \u0081Slow diagnostic test, can take up to 3 days \u0081High level of interlaboratory variation \u0081Occasional interference from some sera causing cell cytotoxicity Interpretations of doubling dilution assays such as CFT, HI and VN serological testing methods The antibody titre of a sample is obtained by testing doubling dilutions of the sample serum and reporting the highest dilution at which antibody was still detected. Result authorisation is usually performed by a veterinary surgeon, assisting the laboratory. Positive and negative phrasing in result interpretation is used with caution as a case could have a 'negative 'serology result but still have the infection. The most common reason for this phenomenon is whether serological sampling is conducted in the acute phase of the disease prior to an immune response being detectable. A titre does not need to be zero for a result to be interpreted as 'no evidence of infection ', and each test titre result will have its own levels for suspicion of infection. Test interpretation is easiest when acute and convalescent samples are taken (paired samples), usually 14 days apart, with adequate history included in the submission to aid the laboratory. In double dilution assays such as CFT and HI, seroconversion is considered con rmed if there is a fourfold or greater rise in titre between the acute and convalescent samples. If a case is seropositive or seroconversion is con rmed, agent detection methods may be advised to investigate the infectious status of the case and/or contacts. Although the rst serum sample from a case may have been tested at the time of acquisition, it will, ideally, need Serum sample No antibody present a) b)Antibody present Compliment fixed to antigen-antibody complexesCompliment free to fix to red blood cellsInteraction Result Haemolysis occurs Sample is seronegative Sample is seropositiveNo haemolysis as no free complement.

AntigenAntibody in sampleFluorochrome labelled secondary antibody \u00a92021 EVJ VETERINARY / AE / jul y 2022 to be retested alongside the second serum sample, to provide a valid paired test result. This is due to the possibility of there being a between-assay (interassay) variation, which can occur with all serological assays. Therefore, only paired samples run on the same test run can be reliably compared. The result obtained when the rst sample was originally run will be compared to its rerun result as each assay will have an interassay variation value that is deemed to be acceptable. Occasionally, when the rst run and rerun results are compared, they may fall out of this allowable boundary and the test may need repeating to con rm them. Laboratories should have internal quality controls implemented to monitor and help prevent such scenarios. Diagnostic test accuracy and result interpretation When a new test is developed, irrespective of the laboratory accreditation, it should undergo stringent analysis to ensure the assay is suitable, optimal and standardised. Setting criteria for a good test involves establishing the following: intentional diagnostic use, standardisation, diagnostic sensitivity and speci city, analytical sensitivity and speci city and reliability (OIE 2013). Intended use Tests are developed around their intended use and these include the following: con rmation of a disease in a clinical case, checking freedom from infection, use in disease eradication programmes and to establish immune response from vaccination. Standardisation and optimisation Optimisation of a diagnostic test involves evaluating the assay 's parameters and establishing them at a level to optimise the test for its intended purpose. This process is achieved through assay validation (Saunders et al . 2015). When assays are developed, samples should be taken from the subject population to verify the test. For example, when designing an ELISA for Streptococcus equi (S.equi ), samples were taken from known infected horses and known seronegative horses (Robinson et al . 2013). New tests are also compared to previous tests and if available, the gold standard test for validation. Table 2 demonstrates the results obtained from this comparison.Diagnostic sensitivity and speci city As a clinician, it is fundamental to be aware of a diagnostic test 's limitations when interpreting results. The ultimate test would correctly identify all cases with disease as infected and all disease-free animals as uninfected 100% of the time, but this is invariably an unrealisable expectation in reality. When setting cut-offs (the value to determine whether a result is classed as positive or negative), a compromise is made and determined by the tests intended use, with certain tests classifying those with disease better than others and vice versa (Gilbert et al . 2001). Quantifying the diagnostic accuracy of a test is done by calculating a test 's diagnostic sensitivity and speci city (Dohoo et al . 2010; Wong et al . 2011; Table 2 ). A test with a sensitivity of 90% will correctly detect 90% of cases with the disease as positive (TP), but 10% with the disease will be falsely classi ed as negative (FN). The N in sensitivity can be used to remember that a test with a high sensitivity will create a low number of false negatives. A test with a speci city of 90% will correctly detect 90% of cases without the disease as negative (TN), but 10% without the disease will be falsely classi ed as positive (FP). The P in speci city can be used to remember that a test with a high speci city will create a low number of false positives. A screening test should ideally have a high sensitivity, but with this choice will come a compromise of lower speci city. Any positive results obtained from a screening test should then be clari ed using a con rmatory test, which will have higher speci city, but lower sensitivity (Bourgeois and Oaks 2014). This is the case with EIA and EVA testing, with ELISA (high sensitivity but lower speci city) being the screening test for both and Coggins and VN testing (higher speci city), respectively, being the con rmatory tests. If test results are quantitative, a cut-off value for a positive test result is usually needed and the sensitivity and speci city of a test can be calculated for the different cut-off options. A test 's selected cut-off value is often determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with the most common criteria utilising a ROC curve. The ROC curve is a graph in which the true-positive rate (sensitivity) is plotted against the false-positive rate (1-speci city) for different values of cut-off points for a parameter. Each point on the ROC curve represents a sensitivity and speci city that corresponds to a particular decision threshold. The cut-off point is usually set at the point on the curve where the sensitivity and speci city of the test are each at their optimum in order to correctly TABLE 2: Diagnostic testing de nitions and their calculations New test result True status of infection/diseasePositive Negative Total Diseased TP FN All diseased Nondiseased All non-diseased +TN) TP +FN+FP+TN Sensitivity = TP/(TP +FN) Proportion of all diseased animals that test positive.

The prevalence of the disease being tested for in the population (Smith 2019) and the potential costs of misdiagnosis are other factors taken into account when setting a cut-off value. A screening assay needs a high diagnostic sensitivity. A con rmatory assay needs a high diagnostic speci city. Analytical sensitivity, speci city and reliability Analytical sensitivity is an indication of the minimum detectable amount of the analyte for the test and can be a measure of the cross-reactivity with materials of no interest (Duart et al . 2014). Analytical speci city is an indication of the ability of a test to detect the pathogen in question over others, that is avoiding cross-reactivity from closely related pathogens. Reliability is a measure of the ability of a test to produce the same results when run multiple times. These factors should be established for each diagnostic test developed prior to widespread use. Conclusion In conclusion, infectious disease diagnostic testing choice and interpretation can appear to be complex, but there are a multitude of bene ts from having a basic understanding of testing methods and their interpretation. Cases and outbreaks commonly require both agent detection and serological testing. Obtaining samples for agent detection at the correct time (when agent is present at site sampled, i.e. early on in course of disease) and just prior to instigating treatment enhances the chances of an accurate diagnosis. It is vital to utilise the test in conjunction with the speci c case history (including vaccination status and reason for testing) and clinical signs. Overinterpreting test result 's exact numbers without relating them to the clinical scenario is an easy mistake to make. If a test result is unexpected, this should be acknowledged in partnership with the testing laboratory, as all diagnostic testing has the potential for incorrect results. Infectious diseases come with a plethora of politics and vets can feel pressurised in establishing or refuting disease diagnoses. Having a clear understanding of laboratory testing options and carrying out sampling in a thorough but ef cient and timely manner will help to remove the stigma of infectious disease, and improve equine welfare and general content all round.

J. Gillingham and T. S. Mair Bell Equine Veterinary (septic arthritis, bursitis and tenosynovitis) typically involves surgical lavage of the infected synovial cavity(ies). The two most used are through-and-through needle lavage and endoscopic lavage. Endoscopic lavage is considered to have several advantages, and anecdotally, there appears to be a general shift towards favouring this technique. However, there are only a limited number of published studies directly comparing the outcomes of the two treatment techniques. The available published literature suggests that the outcomes (short-term survival, return to work) are comparable. Further studies are required to expand the available veterinary literature and to assess such factors as the costs associated with the different treatment methods. A variation in diagnostic values used for diagnosing synovial sepsis is apparent in the current literature and further clari cation of inclusion/diagnostic criteria would be useful for clinicians. Introduction Synovial sepsis is a common reason for horses to be referred and treated in equine hospitals. A variety of de nitions for synovial sepsis can be found in the veterinary literature and terms such as synovial infection and synovial contamination are also used (Crosby et al., 2019; Hackett, 2015; Wright et al., 2003). In a clinical setting, the results of a thorough clinical examination combined with diagnostic tests (such as synovial fluid analysis and diagnostic imaging) direct the clinician to a diagnosis of synovial sepsis. The causes include traumatic injury, wounds (Milner et al., 2014), foreign body penetration (e.g. organic material such as blackthorn [Ashton, 2018]), iatrogenic causes (Lapointe et al., 1992) and haematogenous spread, the latter more commonly seen in neonates (Crosby et al., 2019; Lindegaard et al., 2021). Synovial sepsis is a serious, potentially life-threatening and performance-limiting condition (Richardson & Stewart, 2019). Rapid diagnosis and aggressive treatment are important to eliminate the infection and minimise damage to the affected synovial structure. High volume lavage, with a sterile balanced electrolyte solution, is the mainstay of therapy (Richardson & Stewart, 2019), along with antibiotic therapy and pain relief. The two most used surgical lavage techniques are through-and-through et al., 2003). Arthroscopic lavage is commonly advocated as being more effective and has advantages over through-and-through needle lavage because it allows more accurate and targeted fluid delivery,higher flow rates through arthroscopic cannulas, the ability to remove brin clots, accurate debridement of unstable bone or cartilage and thorough evaluation of the joint surfaces (Baxter, 2008; Richardson & Stewart, 2019). However, endoscopic examination is not always possible because of limited nances, availability of equipment and other constraints (Richardson & Stewart, 2019). In addition, a recent ex vivo experimental study comparing arthroscopic lavage and needle lavage on the recovery of coloured microspheres from the tarsocrural joint of cadaver horses, suggested that lavage with 14 gauge needles was more effective at removing the microspheres than arthroscopic lavage (Loftin et al., 2016). The aim of this critically appraised topic was to study the available literature and compare the outcome of the two surgical techniques in naturally occurring synovial sepsis in adult horses. PICO question In adult horses ( >1 year of age) does arthroscopic/ tenoscopic/bursoscopic lavage improve the outcomes compared with needle lavage of infected synovial cavities? Search strategy Inclusion criteria were as follows: papers relevant to the PICO question with results of outcome (short-term survival). Exclusion criteria were as follows: papers that did not contain original data (i.e. expert opinion) and papers that were not related to the PICO question. CAB abstracts and PubMed searched using: (horse */ Equine *), (Septic *and lavag *) from year 2000. Additional relevant literature has been included from a Google Scholar search and from scanning the references in included articles. Papers were included based on suitability to answer the PICO question from the title and abstract. Results Eight studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria, and a summary of the articles and their ndings are presented in Table 1 . Discussion The articles are all retrospective cases studies. Therefore, the strength of evidence is moderate based on the study \u00a92021 EVJ and implementation. The choice of treatment modality in these retrospective studies was not controlled in any way and therefore likely to have been subject to selection bias. This could be improved by running randomised controlled trials. However, the reported survival rates in the studies were comparable in horses treated with needle lavage (77% -84%) and those treated with arthroscopic lavage (56% -90%). There are not enough data to compare treatments in speci c synovial structures (e.g. bursae or tendon sheaths vs. joints). It is important to note that the studies often measured different outcomes. The headings in Table 1 summarise this, and a key is used to further clarify the terms used. It is therefore challenging to directly compare these studies based on the outcome.Arthroscopic/bursoscopic/tenoscopic lavage The technique of using endoscopy for the treatment of synovial sepsis has anecdotally become increasingly popular. The clear advantages of the procedure include full visualisation of the synovial cavity allowing identi cation of soft tissue, cartilage and osseous damage, removal of foreign material and debridement if required (Wright et al., 2003). Furthermore, this treatment allows a large volume of fluid to be flushed through the synovial cavity. The procedure is usually performed under general anaesthesia; therefore, the risks associated with anaesthesia are increased, and it likely has a higher nancial implication for the owner. The technique requires appropriate surgical skills as well as the facilities and endoscopic equipment to be available to the practising clinician (Ludwig & Harreveld, 2018). By comparingTABLE 1: Studies on synovial sepsis including treatment technique used, outcome and diagnostic criteria ReferenceStudy population and sample size Study design Treatment usedSurvival to dischargeReturn to soundness/ exerciseDiagnostic inclusion criteria (Troillet et al., 2020)University of Leipzig, Germany 42 horses Septic arthritis and tenosynovitisRetrospective (Nov 2008 (Isgren et 2020)7 hospitals 95 horses Septic 2000)University of Utrecht, Netherlands 27 horses Septic arthritisRetrospective (May 1996 1999)Through-and-through horses Septic 1986 -July 2003)Tenoscopy (20) (Wright et al., 2003)1 UK referral hospital 121 horses Septic arthritis, bursitis (Jan TP, Total protein.

Through-and-through lavage Through-and-through needle lavage is anecdotally a more cost-effective approach to treatment. Most cases will require general anaesthesia, although some can be carried out under standing sedation. The clinician does not need any specialised equipment or facilities, and only a basic level of training is required (Crosby et al., 2019). The advantages of this procedure may be favourable in certain cases, such as foals with acute sepsis and no osseous abnormalities (Watts, 2017), and nancially restricted cases where other treatment options are not accessible. However, in many cases a lower volume of fluid is flushed through the synovial cavity, and the inability to directly visualise and assess the synovial cavity makes determining the prognosis more dif cult. Diagnostics Laboratory diagnostic results are used in conjunction with clinical judgement when diagnosing synovial sepsis. Additional techniques that assist the diagnosis include: con rming direct communication of a wound with a synovial cavity by distention with sterile saline (Findley et al., 2014; Isgren et al., 2020), positive bacteriological culture and/or visualisation of intracellular bacteria on cytological smears (Isgren et al., 2020), positive contrast radiography, the gross appearance of the synovial fluid including an increase in turbidity (Duggan & Mair, 2019) and endoscopic/arthroscopic ndings compatible with sepsis (Wereszka et al., 2007). Braake (2002) included cases that were diagnosed by clinical inspection to have synovial sepsis, and retrospective analysis of the cases showed the synovial cell count to range from 12-3339109/L and the percentage of PMNs to be 85% -99%. Troillet et al., (2020) also showed the synovial cell count to range from 21.9 to 220.3 73% -96% and TP 29.3 Wright et al., (2003) showed the TNCC to range from <5t o >1009109/L, and 75% had >80% of PMN. As shown in Table 1, a range of diagnostic inclusion values have been reported, including synovial TNCC ranging from 109109/L to 209109/L; in two studies, the percentage of PMNs in synovial fluid was >80%, and one study used a value of >90% PMN; TP in synovial fluid ranged from 20 -40 g/L. Application to clinical practice The comparison between outcomes, including survival to discharge and return to exercise, was highly variable in the studied literature. Yet, it should be recognised that many different synovial structures were included in these studies, and the prognosis for successful treatment is likely to vary depending on the speci c structure involved. The three studies directly comparing the two surgical treatment techniques showed no signi cant difference in the outcome (Duggan & Mair, 2019; Troillet et al., 2020; Wereszka et al., 2007); however, the results should be interpreted with caution since the studies were not controlled and only included small numbers of patients. The authors suspect that there has been a generational shift towards favouring endoscopic lavage as a treatment technique for synovial sepsis, and the apparent advantages of endoscopic lavage are favoured by many clinicians. Further large-scale prospective, multi-centre studies examining the outcomes of treatments of septic synovitis inspeci c synovial structures would be required to further inform the veterinary literature. A range of synovial fluid analysis inclusion criteria are demonstrated in the above studies, and it would be important to use standardised diagnostic values for synovial sepsis in future studies. It is important to also be aware that the synovial fluid analysis values can vary, depending on the nature and duration of the underlying injury causing sepsis; for example, the synovial fluid TNCC can be signi cantly higher if the injury is caused by Prunus spinosa (blackthorn) (Ashton, 2018). It is beyond the scope of this article, however, it would be valuable in future studies to evaluate the nancial implications of the different treatment methods, to further assess the effects of speci cs y n o v i a l fluid analysis results on the prognosis and to document the long- term outcome of synovial sepsis affecting different synovial cavities.
