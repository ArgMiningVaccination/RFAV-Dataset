Patient Victory Story \"Health in Balance is my favorite place to put my health back into balance:) I have worked with Dr Lisa, Dr Gary and most recently Dr Jordan for several years now and have sincerely valued the care and attention I've received for not only chiropractic care, but also a variety of health issues attributed to nutritional deficiencies, food allergies and hormonal imbalances. Coming here has changed the way I approach my healthcare and for that I am most grateful. The staff is fabulous and professional, and the therapy team is top notch. I always look forward to my visits and highly recommend Health in Balance for all your health care needs!\" - Shawna Moznett Giving Back At Health in Balance, we highly value giving back to the community!
