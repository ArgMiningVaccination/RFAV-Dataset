Most commonly, people will lie on their mat on the floor, but the mat can be placed on other surfaces (such as your desk chair) for use throughout the day.

Advertisement Who should use an acupressure mat? \"Acupressure mats tend to work best for people who are suffering from mild to moderate muscle or nerve pain and discomfort, excess stress, insomnia, and other similar disorders,\" says Bacharach. But they may not be for everyone. \"If you aren't sure if an acupressure mat is appropriate for you, it's always best to consult your health care provider.\" Acupressure mats are not advised for people who are pregnant or nursing, have a skin infection or an open wound, or have an existing heart condition. FAQ Are acupressure mats any good? Research and anecdotal evidence suggest that acupressure mats can offer a variety of health benefits, including reduced pain and stress levels and better sleep. However, not everyone will experience the same benefits. Which acupressure mat brand is better, Spoonk or Nayoy? Spoonk and Nayoy both offer highly rated acupressure mats. However, Spoonk is made with eco-friendly and nontoxic materials, making it the preferred option for many consumers. What is the best time to use an acupressure mat? These mats can be used any time of day, but Bacharach specifically emphasizes their impact before bedtime\u2014especially if you are seeking those sleep-related benefits. \"As acupressure mats are designed to relieve pain, tension, and stress, they should be used close to bedtime in order to lead to optimal sleeping conditions,\" she advises.
