Learn about our approach to holistic cancer treatment at NorthShore.", "sitename": "northshore.org", "date": "2014-05-13", "cleaned_text": "Patients dealing with cancer often look for ways to expand and enhance their conventional treatment. Complementary therapies can positively impact a range of quality of life issues, including increased energy, strength, appetite, pain relief, better digestive functioning, and restful sleep. Integrative Oncology is the combination of conventional cancer care and complementary therapies. We know the importance of incorporating these two fields safely, and thus Kellogg Cancer Center now offers on-site clinicians who will discuss integrative methods and give guidance on appropriate use. Patients at NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Centers now have access to Integrative Oncology Nurse Practitioners Maggie Keller and Sara Reynolds who work in conjunction with your oncology physician and the Integrative Medicine department. They work to empower patients to incorporate evidence-based lifestyle modifications, mind/body practices, and integrative oncology therapies into their conventional cancer treatment plan. Maggie and Sara welcome all Kellogg patients who may be: curious about integrative medicine, needing help with symptom management, seeking medical cannabis, requesting referrals to body work providers and therapists, wanting help with supplements and reviewing potential interactions or contraindications with their cancer treatments, or looking for guidance with their nutrition, diet or exercise. All Kellogg patients at any point on their cancer trajectory are eligible. Maggie and Sara completed the University of Michigan Integrative Oncology Scholars Program and have extensive experience as oncology nurse practitioners. Traditional Chinese Medicine and Cancer Treatment NorthShore also offers dedicated Integrative Medicine practitioners in Traditional Chinese Medicine and acupuncture, massage therapy, nutrition, herbal supplements and Integrative Medicine consultations. A growing number of patients are choosing to integrate acupuncture therapy and Chinese herbal medicine into their conventional cancer care. These therapies can help offset the side effects of radiation and chemotherapy as well as the anxiety of a cancer diagnosis. Acupuncture Acupuncture has been shown to relieve pain and neuropathies, alleviate nausea and constipation, boost immunity and appetite, and help promote a sense of calm and well-being. Patients routinely report looking forward to their integrative treatments for the emotional and physical benefits. Laser acupuncture is also available for patients with cancer, particularly those dealing with lymphedema or other contra-indicators for needles. The low-level laser is a safe and effective, needle-less form of treatment and offers similar benefits to traditional acupuncture. NorthShore is the first center in the community to provide low-level laser acupuncture therapy to patients, adhering to the highest safety standards set forth by our rigorous hospital review process. Our practitioners have received special training through Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for treating oncology patients and work closely with the rest of your oncology team to ensure a treatment plan that works best for you. Massage Therapy and Cancer Treatment Massage promotes relaxation and stress reduction. It is recognized as beneficial for cancer patients both physically and emotionally. Patients find a myriad of benefits from massage, including reduced pain, headache relief, decreased fatigue, anxiety and depression, insomnia relief, and more positive body awareness. Through gentle comforting touch, many of the body's functions move toward more optimal functioning. FAQs Q: Who will benefit from Integrative Oncology services? A: Every Kellogg patient has the potential to benefit from Integrative Oncology services.
