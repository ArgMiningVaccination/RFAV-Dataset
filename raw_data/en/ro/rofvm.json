While the number of new cases of COVID-19 and the number of Mississippians whose COVID-19-driven symptoms require hospitalizations are declining, it is still vital that Medical Center personnel are inoculated against the flu as early as possible. We are now in the typical timeframe when influenza is ramping up and the best way we can ensure a healthy workforce all through the flu season is for each of us to receive our vaccination soon. In keeping with our longstanding policy, receiving an annual flu vaccination is required for all faculty, staff, and students unless an accommodation or exemption is requested and approved. The deadline to receive a flu vaccination, either by a UMMC or non-UMMC provider, is Dec. 31, 2021. The Medical Center's Mandatory Influenza Vaccination Policy can be found [here](https://documents.umc.edu/policy/A-SEH-GEN-GEN-PO-00001/). Failure to adhere to the policy could result in corrective action up to and including termination or dismissal. Distribution of flu shots will be handled somewhat differently this year than previous years. In addition to these phases, flu vaccinations are available from 7:30 a.m. - 4:15 p.m. each weekday at Student and Employee Health. To make a flu vaccination appointment at the SEH clinic, call 4-1185 or email [flu@umc.edu](mailto:flu@umc.edu). - Phase I of the distribution plan, occurring through Sept. and Oct., will be \"Flu on Wheels,\" a mobile approach where SEH staff and volunteers will visit departments and units to provide the vaccination. SEH will be reaching out to larger departments/units to schedule a date and time to vaccinate employees and/or students in those areas. If you would like to request Flu on Wheels visit your area, email [flu@umc.edu](mailto:flu@umc.edu). - Phase II is a mini flu blitz that will be held on Tuesday, Nov. 2 at locations established around the main Jackson campus. - Phase III, scheduled to occur in Nov. and Dec., will consist of vaccination stations set up in locations on campus. The number and locations of those vaccination tables have not yet been determined. You are allowed to obtain your flu vaccination through a non-UMMC provider. If you get your flu shot somewhere other than UMMC, you must submit a copy of the Vaccine Administration Record to be compliant with the policy. Instructions on how to submit this record, which must be done before Dec. 31, 2021, can be found [here](https://intranet.umc.edu/Administration/UMMC_Mandatory_Flu_Vaccine.html). Information about how to submit a request for medical or religious accommodation to not receive a flu vaccination can be found [here](https://intranet.umc.edu/Administration/UMMC_Mandatory_Flu_Vaccine.html). The deadline to submit a request for an accommodation is Oct. 30, 2021. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine around the same time as other vaccines. You no longer have to wait 14 days between different types of vaccinations. The CDC provides more information about \"Coadministration of COVID-19 vaccines with other vaccines\" about one-third of the way down the webpage found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fclinical-considerations.html). For questions, contact Student and Employee Health at 4-1185 or [flu@umc.edu](mailto:flu@umc.edu). Thank you. "}
