At twenty-seven, she was strong and healthy, and hadn't seen a doctor since giving birth to her son, Xuan, two years before. But her mother, Sulin, told her not to take chances and marched her to their local hospital, in Pingding, a small city in the province of Shanxi. A doctor conducted a swift examination and wrote a prescription. \"Doesn't she need a scan?\" Sulin asked. \"No need!\" the doctor responded. \"The medication will be enough.\" Zhixia dutifully took the pills, but after a few months the lump was still there, so Sulin accompanied her to a hospital in Yangquan, a nearby industrial city of 1.5 million people. The doctors said that she needed immediate surgery. As is typical with dire diagnoses in China, they did not tell Zhixia that she had breast [cancer](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/15/what-cancer-takes-away), informing only her mother. Sulin, in turn, assured her daughter that the growth was benign. After the operation, a biopsy revealed that the cancer had spread. The doctors put Zhixia on a course of chemotherapy, and she was hospitalized for several weeks. A year later, the cancer returned, and the doctor who had prescribed the chemo remarked casually that if they had followed it up with radiation the outcome might have been better. Sulin wanted to know why they hadn't done that, but she felt too intimidated to say anything. In the next three years, Zhixia had four more long stays in the hospital, emerging frailer each time. The cost of her treatments, a hundred thousand yuan (almost fifteen thousand dollars), plunged the family into financial crisis. The cancer progressed to her lymph nodes, her lungs, her bones. Her body became so ravaged that she was almost unrecognizable. When her son was taken to visit, he had to be prompted to call her Mother. Shanxi is in the heart of China's coal country, and has disproportionately high rates of esophageal and lung cancer. Zhixia was only five months old when her father, a farmer, died of esophageal cancer. (Sulin remarried, but her second husband succumbed to lung cancer.) Still, Zhixia grew up to be a sunny, optimistic woman. Moonfaced, with high cheekbones, she liked to say that she met her father whenever she looked in the mirror. She quit school after seventh grade and worked various jobs to help support the family. When she was twenty-five, she met her husband, a coal miner named Zhang Wei. Three years into Zhixia's illness, in the spring of 2017, Wei felt a pain in his back so severe that he couldn't lift up their son. He didn't go to a doctor: caring for Zhixia left little time, and he figured that he'd hurt himself while swimming. Two weeks later, the pain was so bad that he couldn't get out of bed. When he finally went to a doctor, he was informed that he had a blood disorder. The doctor, who suspected late-stage leukemia, told him to check in to the hospital right away. Wei said that he needed to keep working, to pay for his wife's treatment. Wei died on a brisk fall day, three months later. What pained Zhixia the most was knowing that he had been alone at the end. His mother was too distraught to enter his hospital room, his father had been at work in the coal mines, Zhixia had been receiving another round of chemo, and her own mother was busy caring for Xuan. In the days after, Zhixia told her mother, \"Please don't let me die.\" By then, she knew that she had cancer: her father-in-law, who was illiterate, had inadvertently let her see one of her medical reports. Zhixia's doctors told Sulin to begin thinking about funeral arrangements. In desperation, she started asking around about other medical facilities, and a neighbor told her about a man named Li Youquan, who had opened a small private hospital on the outskirts of Yangquan. Its name was Yangquan You'ai Hospital\u2014you'ai means \"friendship and love\"\u2014and it had a unit devoted to [hospice care](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/11/the-work-of-a-hospice-nurse), a concept still unfamiliar in China. Few cultures relish talking about death, but in China the subject remains taboo. Mentioning it is considered so unlucky that dying people are often reluctant to discuss arrangements with their families or even to make wills. (Last year, \" [The Farewell](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/22/the-farewell-mixes-mourning-and-revelry),\" an American film about a Chinese family that uses a wedding as an excuse to gather around a terminally ill grandmother without arousing her suspicions, was a breakout hit in the West, but it was largely ignored in China, where such stories are commonplace.) As a result, fewer than a hundred and fifty institutions specialize in end-of-life care, in a country where nearly twenty per cent of the population\u2014a quarter of a billion people\u2014is sixty or older. The U.S., with some seventy million people over sixty, has more than fifty-five hundred such institutions. In China, the family has traditionally provided care for the vulnerable: \"Raise a child against old age; stockpile grain against famine,\" one proverb counsels. Confucian expectations of filial piety remain strong, but for most Chinese they have become increasingly difficult to fulfill. Dizzying economic expansion has made China's population ever more mobile, and the one-child policy, in force from 1979 to 2015, means that many adults have no siblings with whom to share the burden of caring for relatives. Hundreds of millions of workers who have moved to the country's booming cities cannot do much more for aging parents back in remote villages than wire whatever money they can spare. Rural areas also lack adequate public-health services. Close to half the population lives in the countryside, but about eighty per cent of China's medical facilities are concentrated in cities. Health-care costs have risen sharply in recent years, and Chinese patients must navigate a byzantine system of government coverage. Most people have basic insurance, but anything beyond routine care usually requires steep out-of-pocket payments. The early stages of the coronavirus pandemic brought to light some of the dysfunctions of China's medical system, including underinvestment in primary-care clinics and overreliance on huge, rigidly bureaucratic urban hospitals. But, if the coronavirus exposed the country's health-care challenges in their most acute form, the quieter crisis in end-of-life care reveals a chronic underlying condition, whose symptoms are at once brutally economic and deeply cultural. Prosperity and medical advances have transformed the way Chinese people live, but they have done little to address the question of how they should die. Li Youquan named the Friendship and Love Hospital for an earlier iteration, which was founded, like most of China's first hospitals, by Western missionaries. American representatives of the Church of the Brethren arrived in the area in 1910, and their hospital trained generations of doctors and nurses. It closed not long before the Communists came to power, in 1949, and expelled foreign missionaries. But, as Li told me when I visited him last summer, almost everything in China runs in cycles: \"Sooner or later, what was banned will be reborn.\" Li is a sturdily built man in his early fifties, with alert eyes set in a frank, expressive face, and he comes from a family of farmers. His route to providing palliative care was a circuitous one. In the late eighties, he attended a vocational school that specialized in traditional Chinese medicine. After graduating, he left traditional medicine behind and did an internship at the largest hospital in Yangquan, where he encountered an ultrasound machine for the first time, and was amazed. \"In Eastern medicine, there is so much interpretation and guesswork,\" he said. \"But with ultrasound you could actually see inside a patient's body.\" After scraping together enough money to buy a machine, he started operating a clinic out of his house, near the village where he was born. Charging a couple of dollars per scan, he found that there was good money to be made detecting tumors and pregnancies. At the time, in the early nineties, [Deng Xiaoping](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/deng-xiaoping)'s market reforms had been opening state-run services to private enterprise. The Communists had established near-universal health care, which, though often rudimentary, increased the average life expectancy from thirty-five, in 1949, to sixty-nine, in 1990. Under the economic reforms, however, hospitals were allowed to ramp up what they charged for their services, and government health-care spending shrank. The process was anything but linear\u2014during a crackdown on unlicensed operators, Li's clinic was closed and his machine confiscated\u2014but the burden of cost continued to shift toward patients, and the gap between standards of care in the cities and those in the hinterlands widened. Li spent the next decade working at state clinics, until, in 2005, he saw another chance to launch an entrepreneurial venture. In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, the government embarked on the country's most ambitious health-care reforms in more than a generation, in part to address the rural-urban divide. Li built the Friendship and Love Hospital on a plot of undeveloped land next to his home. Initially, there were only twenty beds. \"I knew I wanted to offer something that other, bigger hospitals didn't,\" Li told me. \"But I hadn't really figured out what that was.\" Still, the business thrived, and, five years later, in 2010, he decided to hold a celebration for the centennial of his hospital's missionary namesake. It had occurred to him that publicizing the institution's American roots might attract investment and expertise from the U.S. The thought prompted him to send e-mails to various organizations associated with missionary work. One of these e-mails reached Li Ruoxia, a recent graduate of a Lutheran seminary in Dubuque, Iowa. She was struck by the coincidences: she, too, was from the Yangquan area; she had written a master's thesis on the heritage of Christian communities in Shanxi; and her husband, an American anthropologist, had written his doctoral thesis on the rituals of aging and filial piety in rural China. Ruoxia had been volunteering at a nursing home in Iowa\u2014she later worked at a hospice\u2014and, as she corresponded with Li Youquan, she started to think about the lack of such services back home. \"To die seems so private, but the process is embedded in a larger system,\" she told me. In China, death was met first with denial and then with stoicism. \"But in a hospice death is accepted, so its trauma is slightly eased,\" she said. In 2012, she and her husband moved to Yangquan, so that she could introduce hospice care to Li's hospital. At Friendship and Love, Ruoxia began hiring a team to act as social workers, both for the hospital's resident patients and for discharged patients facing their final days at home. She led workshops on family support and bereavement counselling, and handed out translations of American writing on the subjects. Sometimes she asked team members to write letters to themselves or their loved ones to practice communicating difficult emotions. Her recruits were women from the countryside, most of whom had first come to the hospital to care for dying relatives. Few of them had finished high school, but they could do simple health-aide tasks and instruct patients and families on the importance of hygiene. Just as important, the women understood the people they helped. They spoke the same dialect, shared the same outlook, knew the local customs, and had an intuitive sense of how best to broach the subject of dying. One of the first team members was Liu Meiying, a cancer survivor in her early sixties. After receiving her diagnosis, more than twenty years ago, she'd quit her job at a factory and joined a fledgling patient-support group in Yangquan. The group, known as the South Mountain Anti-Cancer Club, offered support that was rare at the time, arranging outings and gatherings where members could talk about treatment options and the day-to-day impact of their illness. \"Back then, no one had ever heard of the word 'hospice,' \" Meiying said. \"But, with our regular visits to our dying members, that's what we were trying to do, in our clumsy way.\" Ruoxia's hospice unit was unusual enough to seem suspect to conservatively minded people. Early on, when the hospital registered with Shanxi's Civil Affairs Bureau, the officials were particularly concerned about what the unit would be called, and Ruoxia had to come up with a name that was suitably euphemistic. She knew that phrases like \"hospice care\" and \"palliative care\" wouldn't do, but even \"comfort care\" was judged to hint too aggressively at a failure of treatment. Eventually, the government settled on Elder Navigation Center. \"The bureaucrats don't even know sometimes why they are so resistant to try new things,\" Ruoxia told me with a bitter laugh. \"Usually, they just know it's safer.\" By the time Zhixia arrived at Friendship and Love, last April, cancerous growths were compressing her spine to the point where she could no longer feel the lower half of her body. She experienced severe nausea\u2014even spoonfuls of porridge were hard to keep down\u2014and had lost so much weight that her emaciated frame seemed lost in the hospital's striped pajamas. Pain from ulcers in her mouth kept her from sleeping. Sometimes, early in the morning, she became delirious, and thought that she heard ghosts on the other side of the wall. Still, she had no thought of giving up. \"Why aren't they treating the source of my illness?\" she fumed to her mother when her doctors focussed on her bedsores. \"They should be trying to fix that first!\" After Zhixia's experiences in other hospitals, the work of Ruoxia's team seemed strange to her. She was perplexed that the social workers talked so much about her feelings rather than about her disease. But their unusual methods were not always unwelcome. Instead of examining her, Ruoxia offered to wash her hair, and, when Ruoxia mentioned her young daughter, Zhixia took out her phone to show off pictures of her son. When Ruoxia arrived bearing nutritional shakes and cartons of yogurt, Zhixia suggested, with a weak smile, that perhaps her mother could eat them: \"Her belly is my belly, her heart my heart.\" One morning, a few days into Zhixia's stay, Meiying got a text message from her: \"Auntie. Urgent! I need to talk to you!\" When Meiying saw the time stamp on the message\u20144 A.M.\u2014she feared the worst and rushed over to the hospital. \"Are you feeling O.K.?\" she asked breathlessly when she got there. But Zhixia seemed better than usual and greeted her with a bright smile. Sulin was in the room, too, fussing over her daughter. As soon as Sulin left, to get some breakfast in the cafeteria, Zhixia lowered her voice and said, \"Can you help me with a task, big sister?\" She told Meiying about something that she'd just read on her phone. Constantly thinking about how she might rescue her family from the financial hole into which her illness had sunk them, she'd come across a government-assistance scheme that claimed to help those in dire need. She wanted Meiying to help her apply. \"My mom is strong, but I don't think she realizes how impossible our money situation will be,\" Zhixia confided. Meiying nodded and promised to do her best. She was happy to help, and felt satisfaction that Zhixia was opening up more and more to her and the other aides. On the way out, Meiying ran into Sulin, her eyes puffy and red-rimmed. She hadn't gone to breakfast after all but was just waiting there in the corridor, unable to leave her daughter. When Sulin moved to go back in, Meiying put a hand gently on her shoulder and told her that it would do her good to get some breakfast. \"I'll stay with Zhixia for as long as you need,\" she said. Early one morning last June, I accompanied Meiying on a visit to a patient everyone called Brother Zhang, who suffered from advanced cirrhosis of the liver. Brother Zhang lived in a remote part of the countryside where his family had farmed corn for generations. As we drove north out of Yangquan, the industrial cityscape gave way to squat, sagging houses of weathered brick. Brown-gold cliffs composed of Shanxi's distinctive sandy loess soil punctuated fields of millet and sorghum. An hour later, we got out of the car and walked the last mile, up a hilly dirt path and then on broken stone steps enmeshed in roots. Brother Zhang's house was what is known in the region as a yaodong, or cave home\u2014a courtyard arrangement of vaulted rooms carved into the loess hillside. Zhang, a lean stalk of a man with a hawkish, wind-parched face, came out to greet us. Though his gait was sometimes unsteady, he moved about the premises quickly, showing me his well, a giant millstone, a barn where he'd once kept donkeys, and herbs and peppers hanging to dry under the lintel of a doorway. \"It means something when city folk visit them,\" Meiying murmured. Zhang boasted that he could still haul a respectable amount of corn on his back. I believed him; he had the wiry strength of a frail person made strong by circumstance. Zhang lived alone. His wife had left him years ago, and his two sons rarely visited: the older son was a coal miner, with a family of his own; the younger, in his late twenties, suffered from mental illness and usually stayed with relatives. Zhang took us inside the single room that served as his living quarters. The bare stone walls arched overhead, like those of a wine cellar. A bulky old TV set was pushed up against his bed, on which all his earthly possessions were piled. Meiying noticed a pack of cigarettes and playfully chided him, but Zhang said, with a grin, that, at this point, smoking was probably keeping him alive rather than killing him. When I asked Zhang about his health, he had trouble explaining the details of his condition, something that Meiying told me is common among the people she sees. Until he was in his mid-fifties, he had never stepped inside a hospital, and rarely thought about his body as anything more than a machine from which he needed to extract as much work as possible. But one day, five years ago, he had coughed up enough blood to soak an entire handkerchief. When he visited the First People's Hospital, in Yangquan, he was told that an operation was required, to biopsy a tumor on his spleen. He could not afford it, and, besides, there would be no one to care for him while he recovered. Seeking a second opinion, he ventured to Taiyuan, the provincial capital, but the verdict was the same. In the past three years, Zhang has twice stayed at Friendship and Love to receive intravenous infusions. The second time, he checked himself out early, against his doctor's orders. It was harvest season, and Zhang had no one else to reap his corn. I noticed a pair of faded calendars, years out of date, hanging above Zhang's bed. One featured the face of President [Xi Jinping](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/06/born-red). The other showed that of Jesus. Some Christians had given him the calendar a few years ago, he said, promising that Jesus could save him. Zhang started attending their meetings. \"But Jesus did not cure me,\" he said scornfully, adding that the Christians were no help at all with obtaining medication or I.V. infusions, or with harvesting the crops in his absence. \"If neither Jesus nor his followers could do those basic chores, what are they good for?\" Our visit unfolded almost like a social call, but Meiying slipped in questions about the things she'd come to check up on. Zhang admitted that he still had trouble keeping food down. She asked after his younger son, who had recently been threatening suicide. Meiying had done what she could to help, getting in touch with the son on WeChat and telling him not to do anything rash. She advised Zhang to focus on taking care of himself, but his son's problems and other family disputes agitated him. Every so often, he picked up his cigarettes and then, with a glance at Meiying, put them down. The senselessness of suicide, as he desperately clung to life, baffled him. \"Life might be short and brutal, but the point is to survive,\" he said. At the end of our visit, he gave Meiying a bag of plums that he had picked from his own trees. After we left, Meiying observed that Brother Zhang's case was not unusual. As people moved where the work was, the only people left in the villages were the very old, the very young, and the disabled. Shi Lizhen, the head nurse of the geriatric department at the first hospital Zhang visited, told me that when she started working, more than thirty years ago, elderly patients typically had six or seven children, two or three of whom could devote themselves entirely to their parents' care. Those days were gone, and the hospital's resources were so scarce that they couldn't take inpatients who didn't have around-the-clock caregivers. Some patients hired health aides, but many were too embarrassed to ask their children to help with the cost. Shi, who is fifty-seven, mentioned that her daughter lives in Beijing, seven hundred miles away, and is a mother herself. \"When I look at my patients now, immobile in bed, I think about myself and what my future will look like,\" she said. One day during my stay in Yangquan, Li Youquan and I drove two hours to Taiyuan, to visit Shanxi Tumor Hospital, the province's largest hospital and one of the first in China to specialize in cancer care. In its vast atrium, amid a sea of red banners bearing socialist slogans, there was a no-smoking sign and a poster warning of the link between smoking and cancer. Nearby, a man sat staring at his phone, a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth. In China, the messages on posters are sometimes a better guide to what is not happening than to what is. Other signs referred to anti-corruption policies and stipulated grave penalties for bribery and profiteering in health-care settings. But, in a dimly lit stairwell, there were phone numbers and notes scribbled on a concrete wall, advertising the services of people who could falsify almost any kind of medical paperwork\u2014patient records, diagnoses, prescriptions, bills. Shi Lizhen had told me that, in addition to outright corruption, there were many gray areas. Doctors at public hospitals receive paltry remuneration for patient consultations but much more when they order major procedures. As a result, surgeries are suspiciously common. For hospitals, drug sales are an important revenue stream, so overprescription is rife. Shi sometimes encounters patients who are fully recovered but are still being prescribed medication. She discreetly suggests that they ignore their prescriptions, but they usually tell her that they are afraid of offending the doctors. \"So we reach a compromise,\" she said. \"The patient buys the medicine, so that the doctor gets paid, but they'll just take it home instead of using it.\" In Taiyuan, Li and I went to the Shanxi hospital's residential compound to visit his friend Song Jianguo, the former head of the hospital's respiratory department. Song, who was in his early sixties, had just retired, after having received a diagnosis of Stage IV stomach cancer. Greeting us at the door of his apartment in pajamas and slippers, he explained that he had just finished a round of chemotherapy. He had sharp cheekbones and exuded a placid, scholarly air. In his left nostril was a thin nasogastric tube. When I apologized for bringing up end-of-life care, Song laughed dryly. \"It's a subject we should talk about more openly in this country,\" he said, pointing out that, even in a hospital of this scale, there was no consistent palliative care. Again, distorted incentives were part of the problem: doctors earned far less for prescribing pain medication than for ordering chemotherapy or surgery. There were cultural factors, too. Many patients in severe pain were wary of opioids, which they associated with addiction, and China's newfound wealth inspired unrealistic expectations. \"There's this very optimistic idea that, if we spend enough, diseases will be cured at the rate that new skyscrapers are built and bullet-train tracks are laid,\" Song said. \"But that's not how the human body works.\" Richer patients couldn't accept that money wouldn't guarantee survival, and those who couldn't afford treatments, he said, \"sometimes jump from their window to spare their family the burden of caretaking and the expense.\" Song took a shallow, labored breath. He worried that a deepening distrust of doctors was undermining end-of-life discussions: \"It's impossible when the patient or the patient's family is thinking at every turn, Oh, is the doctor saying there's nothing we can do because that's really the case or because he doesn't think he'll earn enough to be worth his effort?\" Song adjusted his nasal tube. \"Everyone should know what's coming. When that day comes, we have to know the difference between giving up and letting go.\" One day in May, at Friendship and Love, Zhixia was visited by one of the aides, a woman in her fifties named Cuihe, a former kitchen worker in a restaurant who had come to work in the hospital after her mother had been a patient there. After chatting for a bit, Cuihe read aloud from a book about Mother Teresa. When Cuihe mentioned that she and the others had been reading it in a training workshop, Zhixia said, \"I didn't like school, so I don't know very much.\" Cuihe smiled and said that she hadn't had much schooling, either. After reading a chapter about faith, Cuihe asked Zhixia what she thought the passage was about. \"I guess it's about the relationship between a parent and a child, about love and our attitudes to love,\" she said, and then added, \"It's about death, too. I think I will die soon.\" Cuihe asked if she was afraid of death. In Zhixia's five years as a cancer patient, no one had ever asked her that. \"When the pain overwhelms me, I'm not afraid,\" Zhixia said. \"I just want it to stop so badly that, if death can take away the pain, I almost prefer it.\" She let out a ragged breath and tried to sit up. \"What do you think death is?\" Cuihe asked softly. Zhixia thought for a moment and, with Cuihe's help, sipped water through a straw. \"I don't know,\" she responded. \"Lately, I've been thinking about time passing, and what time is like after death. When I'm suffering, every second feels like a year.\" Zhixia tried to smile, but parting her chapped lips made them bleed. Later, Meiying, who was Zhixia's favorite aide, asked if Zhixia had told her son about her illness. \"He knows nothing,\" Zhixia replied. She said that she'd been taking as many pictures with him as she could, and had organized her and her husband's medical records so that when her son was old enough he could read them. As Zhixia spoke, she started to cry, but muffled her sobs so as not to disturb her mother, who had nodded off in a chair next to her bed. She told Meiying that she'd thought about writing a letter to her son, but worried that she wouldn't be able to express what she felt. \"It's O.K. to keep it simple,\" Meiying said, and suggested that it might be even better to talk to the boy directly. \"The way you speak to him is what he will remember years from now.\" The oldest hospice in China, Songtang Care Hospital, opened in Beijing in 1987. Its founder, Li Songtang, now in his seventies, likes to recount how he came to realize that the dying had needs beyond the merely medical. During the Cultural Revolution, he was sent, as a seventeen-year-old, to Inner Mongolia, to work as one of the \"barefoot doctors,\" whom the Communists dispatched to provide basic care in underdeveloped communities. There he met an exiled professor from Beijing, who was terminally ill with stomach cancer. In the last days of his life, the man became obsessed with clearing his name of the political crimes of which he'd been accused. Li, desperate to give him peace of mind, eventually came up with a lie, saying that he had persuaded authorities to expunge the charges. Li told me that he has never forgotten the way the dying professor grabbed his arm in gratitude. The Party's exoneration, Li realized, was \"his only medicine and salvation.\" \"Dying is not the scary part,\" Li told me, as we sat in a conference room at the hospital. \"It's the uncertainty, the anxiety, of feeling utterly out of control.\" His facility houses about three hundred patients, and, throughout the years, hospital personnel have visited from all over the country to observe how it functions. The staff's daily check-ins with patients are focussed less on medical requirements than on soothing anxieties and fostering a sense of connection. When Li showed me around, we came across a late-stage-Alzheimer's patient making her way down a corridor, clutching the railing affixed to a wall. She had to work a substitute factory shift, she explained urgently, because her daughter was out sick. \"Your daughter is very lucky to have such an able mother,\" Li gently replied. Li noted that, despite Songtang's success, not many places have replicated its model. \"Hospice care is not economically prudent,\" he said. \"People who derive the most benefit from it don't live long enough to advocate for it. And the sense of cultural taboo about death deters the living from promoting it.\" The facility has had to move a dozen times because of complaints from its neighbors; once, protesters who blamed the hospice for bringing a curse on the neighborhood smashed its windows. An avid collector of antiques, Li proudly pointed out how the hospital building incorporated many pieces of Qing-dynasty architecture. He started salvaging these in the nineties, when Beijing's construction boom indiscriminately razed pagodas and temples. \"Chinese society is caught between the old and the new paradigms,\" Li reflected. \"It hasn't decided what it wants to discard and what it wants to import.\" As he spoke, he took long drags from a cigarette. Smoking was a habit he'd picked up in his teens, to cope with the stresses of being a barefoot doctor, but he told me that he wasn't worried about cancer. \"We all carry cancer within us,\" he said. \"It's relentless checkups at predatory hospitals that actually kill you.\" I toured a number of other upscale facilities in Beijing and began to wonder how my mother, back in New York, would fare in such places. For almost a decade, she has suffered from A.L.S., the fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive, and eventually total, paralysis. In Beijing, a publicist led me around a facility called Golden Heights\u2014its interior a riot of floral chintz and gilding\u2014and told me that its clientele included the business \u00e9lite and retired TV stars. There was a gym, a calligraphy room, Ping-Pong tables, a grand piano, and a \"nostalgia room\" filled with old calendars, enamel basins, and a black-and-white TV from the eighties. A brochure detailed some of the costs: a deposit of a hundred thousand yuan (fifteen thousand dollars) and a room charge that started at ten thousand yuan a month. Standard health aides could be hired for twenty thousand yuan a month, but employing people capable of caring for someone with late-stage A.L.S. would cost much more. My mother and I had had conversations, while she could still speak, about what was to come. Back in China, she'd been a doctor herself, a pulmonologist in an Army hospital, and she told me that the most unbearable way to die is to be deprived of the ability to breathe. As was customary at the time, she had often told white lies to terminal patients about their true diagnoses and had seen them brought again and again to the E.R. to receive oxygen, only to suffer through their last days in half gasps. So now, at Golden Heights, I raised the subject of do-not-resuscitate orders, explaining to my guide that my mother would prefer comfort care to extraordinary measures. She assured me that if my mother were in crisis she would be taken to the E.R. \"But what if she signs a document specifying that she does not want to be resuscitated?\" I asked. With an expression of serene forbearance, the woman began shaking her head before I could finish the question. \"It's our job to save her life,\" she insisted, adding, by way of explanation, \"Our goal at Golden Heights is to be humane, which means that we will do everything we can to save her.\" Under Xi Jinping, the Communist Party has tried to restore the centrality of Confucian thought to national life, including the importance of filial piety. In 2013 it issued the Elderly Rights Law, which threatened legal consequences for children who did not visit their parents. The legislation was met with widespread derision. It was government policy, after all, that had encouraged migration to urban centers, generating unprecedented prosperity but also depriving the elderly of a social safety net. Not for nothing does Confucianism see the faults of a child as reflecting the failures of the parents. Li Ruoxia, the leader of the hospice unit at Friendship and Love, believes that, these days, an obsession with filial piety usually does more harm than good. \"The consideration here isn't necessarily the well-being of the parent but the reputation of the child,\" she told me. \"It's the performance of filial piety.\" It isn't unusual for more money to be spent on elaborate funerals than on making patients comfortable in their final days, and several doctors told me that people often ask them to keep their ailing parents alive for the sake of their retirement checks. Ruoxia's recruits often found themselves in the middle of fraught situations. One man told Meiying about a safe where he kept his life savings. \"That made his children and grandchildren very nervous,\" she recalled. \"I told them that if they were gentler with the old man he might not feel like they were just waiting for him to die so they could have his money.\" The unit's slogan is \"Start the conversation!\" because, Ruoxia explained, \"in Chinese families, there's sometimes this expectation that, if you really care about someone, you can intuit what they want without them asking.\" Recently, though, the unit has experienced communication failures of its own. Its members conceived of themselves as a kind of family. \"Once I am trusted, I become the go-to person for a family member,\" Meiying said. \"I can't abandon them when I've worked so hard to allow them to let me in.\" Ruoxia, however, believed that they should be observing clearer boundaries between the professional and the personal. \"If their commitment to their job is completely contingent on their feelings about me, how do we, as an organization, grow into something bigger?\" she said. Tensions escalated when Cuihe\u2014who was the designated nutritionist, on account of her restaurant experience\u2014suggested that, instead of preparing patients' meals in the hospital kitchen, it would be easier if she cooked them at home. Ruoxia asked Cuihe to sign a liability waiver making clear that the food's preparation had not been subject to hospital inspection. Cuihe was deeply insulted. \"Does she think I'm trying to poison the patients?\" she said, relating the story to me months afterward. For Ruoxia, the piece of paper was just a matter of protocol. For Cuihe, it was a sign of personal distrust. The way that care work distorts boundaries was all too familiar to me. After my mother's diagnosis, I moved her from Connecticut, where she lived alone, to New York, where I worked and lived. I found a two-bedroom apartment in an accessible building and hired home aides to care for her when I was at work. I planned her daily schedule, her meals, her physical therapy, and vacations to places she had always wanted to visit but could not afford. My therapist told me, \"It's like you two are so enmeshed that you share a psychic world.\" I tried to explain that, though the situation might seem unhealthy, I was fulfilling an important duty. In Chinese, , the character for xiao, the Confucian concept of filial piety, is made up of part of the character for \"old\" above the character for \"child,\" as if the latter were carrying the former. In previous generations, to care for one's parents in their old age was not a choice but a given. My actions were predicated on a Chinese conception that individuals live in the service of the larger, unified entity: the family. Still, my mother often strenuously protested against my efforts. It was all so much fuss and so expensive, and I think that she didn't want to believe that her decline would come so quickly\u2014preparation made real an eventuality she was still half hoping might not arrive. When I overrode her, I thought of myself not as defying her wishes but as guiding her toward her true desires. To do what she asked rather than what I thought she wanted would have been the real dereliction of duty. It took a long time for me to see that, as her body was gradually robbed of mobility, my wholesale renovation of her life might be depriving her of something that she was just beginning to value at life's end: her autonomy. I thought of this again when I was at the luxurious Beijing nursing home that could cater to residents' every desire except the desire to one day end their suffering. A paternalistic system of government robs people of the ability to make meaningful choices, infantilizing them to the point where they no longer feel responsible even for the choices that they do make. Sophia Zhang, a gerontologist at Peking University, told me that Chinese doctors are uniquely positioned to see how decades of volatile and violent politics have left their marks on individuals. \"People who were very poor in their youth can finally eat to their hearts' content,\" she said. \"To them, three meals of fatty pork and unlimited liquor and no need to do backbreaking labor is the good life. They feel betrayed when I say that they need to curb those appetites.\" The idea of dying with dignity is premised on the idea that there is a difference between the quality of life and its length. \"That's a profound shift for a generation of people entering their old age, for many of whom life has been just about collective survival,\" Zhang told me. The ability to take stock of one's life and make choices about its final stage requires the kind of power and responsibility that most Chinese have never had. At the beginning of May, Zhixia asked to go home. When I visited her the next month, with Meiying and Cuihe, both of them told me that none of the doctors had expected her to survive more than a week after being discharged. \"It says something about the body's desperation to live,\" Meiying observed quietly. Zhixia's room was a shrine to her son, its walls plastered with gold-and-red achievement certificates; a table and a dresser were crowded with framed photographs of a boy with Zhixia's wide, high cheeks. When we came in, Zhixia was propped up on cushions, swiping on her phone. Her feet were swollen, and her hip bones protruded sharply from underneath a thick cotton blanket. Sulin, her mother, eagerly reported that, in the past two days, Zhixia had eaten a little more soup than usual. When Meiying asked about her bedsores, Sulin lifted her daughter on her side to reveal a lesion on her back the shade of a darkening banana. I followed Sulin into the kitchen, where she was preparing scallion pancakes for us and porridge for Zhixia. While we waited for the water to boil, I asked her about her plans for the future. \"Zhixia specified that she wants to be cremated rather than buried,\" she said. \"She doesn't want to be bitten by the bugs underground.\" Her eyes reddened as she spoke, and I gently clarified that I meant her own future: What about her old age? Sulin paused and looked up from the stone floor. She told me that, for the past five years, she had not thought about anything but her daughter. Outside, an old man wandered into the courtyard and squatted down to drink from a faucet. It was Zhixia's father-in-law. \"He's half deaf, and his wife passed away not long ago,\" Sulin told me. \"This house is his, or Zhixia and I wouldn't have a place to live. But, if I wasn't here, he wouldn't have a cook. We are a misshapen family\u2014two white-haired parents raising an orphan.\" She smiled dryly as she said this, but then gave a heaving sob. \"I know I've already sewn her funeral clothes, but I don't actually believe she'll die,\" she said. \"I just can't believe it.\" Zhixia hung on for seventeen more days. She died on a July morning, with her mother and son by her side. By then, she couldn't recognize them, or speak, swallow, or close her eyes. But the June day when I saw her had been a \"good day,\" according to Sulin. Sunlight was streaming through an open window, and it was possible to imagine a string of summer days stretching on forever. Zhixia wanted only to talk about a math test her son had recently aced, the cucumbers and the tomatoes that had ripened in the yard outside, and a romance novel that she was reading on her phone. Sulin tried to usher us into the kitchen to eat the pancakes while they were still hot, but Zhixia's eyes suddenly flickered wide open. \"No, please, don't let me be alone,\" she said. Everyone stopped, but it was Meiying who climbed onto the bed, bending down close to Zhixia's face. \"You are not alone,\" she said, stroking Zhixia's arm with fingertips so light that they seemed barely to graze skin.
