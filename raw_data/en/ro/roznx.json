Lai NBER Working Paper No. 26772 February 2020 JEL No. I12,I18,I26 ABSTRACT Since Wakefield et al. (1998), the public was exposed to mixed information surrounding the claim that measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism. A persistent trend to delay the vaccination during 1998-2011 in the US was driven by children of college-educated mothers, suggesting that these mothers held biases against the vaccine influenced by the early unfounded claim. Consistent with confirmatory bias, exposures to negative information about the vaccine strengthened their biases more than exposures to positive information attenuated them. Positive online information, however, had strong impacts on vaccination decisions, suggesting that online dissemination of vaccine-safety information may help tackle the sticky misinformation.

Lai Lehigh University kwl409@lehigh.edu1 Introduction 17 Mass media health information, especially in the form of information campaigns which of- 18 tentimes convey a homogeneous message, has been documented to be successful in e ecting 19 desirable changes in health behavior.1Less is known about the e ects, however, when the 20 media presents mixed or even con icting health information to the public. A case in point is 21 the media coverage on the safety of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Psychologists 22 have documented in the laboratory that, when presented with ambiguous or mixed evidence, 23 people tend to select and interpret information in a way that con rms their existing posi- 24 tions, a tendency termed con rmatory bias (e.g., Oskamp, 1965; Darley and Gross, 1983). In 25 this paper, we utilize the controversy over the link between the MMR vaccine and autism as 26 a natural experiment to investigate how health decisions respond to mixed information and 27 whether there is evidence that they are a ected by con rmatory bias. 28 The MMR-autism controversy was initiated by Wake eld et al. (1998). Based on a self- 29 selected sample of 12 children, the study claimed to have found a connection between the 30 measles virus and the in ammatory bowel disease found in autistic children. The connection 31 was somehow promoted as an evidence linking the MMR vaccine to the risk of developing 32 autism. A substantial body of subsequent studies based on more rigorous research protocols 33 and larger samples consistently reached an opposite conclusion (e.g., Taylor et al., 1999; 34 Madsen et al., 2002). In 2004, based on a systematic review of research studies, the Institute 35 of Medicine (IOM) issued its nal report concluding that no convincing evidence exists for the 36 casual MMR-autism link.2In the same year, Wake eld et al. (1998) was partially retracted, 37 followed by a complete retraction in 2010 in which the journal's editor noted that \\it was 38 utterly clear, without any ambiguity at all, that the statements in the paper were utterly 39 false.\" While by 2004 the issue was beyond debate in the scienti c community, the public was 40 still presented with con icting messages, ranging from celebrities' anti-vaccination speeches 41 to emotional stories from parents of autistic children to assurances of vaccine safety from 42 authorities. 43 Figure 1 presents, for the period 1998 to 2011, the annual proportion of children between 44 1Wake eld et al. (2010) surveyed evidence on the outcomes of mass media health campaigns and concluded that they could result in positive changes or prevent negative changes in health behavior. For example, they documented that campaigns aimed at reducing tobacco use and preventing cardiovascular diseases could produce measurable health bene ts. See also Jacobsen and Jacobsen (2011) who documented the e ectiveness of awareness campaigns in promoting earlier detection of diseases. 2The IOM was the predecessor of the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. At the request of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, the Immunization Safety Review Committee was formed by the IOM to examine the safety of vaccines. The committee issued in total eight reports. The rst report on the MMR-vaccine link appeared in 2001. While ruling out the link at the population level, this rst report recommended further research to investigate rare individual cases. The 2004 report reached the conclusion that the existing body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal e ect between the MMR vaccine and autism and that the potential biological mechanisms for vaccine-induced autism proposed so far are sheer theoretical. 10.060.070.080.090.10 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011NonUptake Rate YearMMR Vaccine NonUptake Rate in the U.S. Figure 1: MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rate in the US, 1998{2011 19 and 35 months of age whose immunization records indicated delay in the MMR immuniza- 45 tion. The percentage, which represents our outcome variable, the MMR vaccine non-uptake 46 rate, increased after Wake eld et al. (1998) was published. It went back down as studies 47 disapproving the MMR-autism link were accumulating. Interestingly, the rate climbed back 48 up drastically after 2004, the year when the IOM issued its nal report and when the public 49 began to receive increasingly more mixed information about the safety of the vaccine. 50 Prior studies using UK data indicated that more educated parents held stronger biases 51 against the vaccine. The increase in the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the UK in response 52 to Wake eld et al. (1998), from 1997 up to 2005, was found to be driven by children of more 53 educated parents (e.g., Wright and Polack, 2006; Anderberg et al., 2011). A contemporaneous 54 study by Chang (2018), which covered the period from 1995 to 2006, documented a similar 55 educational gap in the US. Using 1998 as the base year, we evaluate annual changes in the 56 MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the US till 2011, dividing the sample by the college-education 57 status of the mother. As the starting point of our principal investigation, we nd that the 58 educational gap in the US was persistent and became even wider after the periods covered 59 by these other studies. The nding suggests that the biases held by the more educated 60 US mothers against the vaccine did not subside|in fact strengthened|after consensus was 61 reached in the scienti c community that the vaccine does not cause autism. 62 We estimate the di erential time trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate of the college- 63 educated group. Interpreting the di erential trend as measuring the strength of the educated 64 mothers' biases, we investigate how exposures to information with di erent positions about 65 the safety of the vaccine in uence the biases. Our identi cation strategy exploits state-year 66 variations in a set of active and passive exposures to broadly de ned media information. 67 We measure active exposures by the search intensity indexes of related topics obtained from 68 Google Trends. For passive exposures, we manually review and classify relevant newspaper 69 coverage retrieved from LexisNexis Academic and collect reported incidences of autism and 70 MMR from the O\u000ece of Special Education Programs and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly 71 2Report. We classify all information exposures in our sample into positive, ones that encourage 72 immunization, and negative, ones that discourage immunization. 73 Our main nding is the substantial asymmetry in the responses to positive and negative 74 information about the MMR vaccine. A one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to neg- 75 ative information strengthened the biases of the college-educated mothers by more than 35%; 76 by contrast, a one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to positive information attenu- 77 ated the biases by no more than 10%. The college-educated group responded more strongly to 78 information consistent with their biases against the vaccine (e.g., news reports of unexplained 79 increase in autism cases) than to information that is in opposition to the biases (e.g., reports 80 citing the conclusion reached by the IOM). The nding provides population-level evidence of 81 con rmatory bias at work in the rising trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate in the US.382 Our study contributes to the literature on education gradients that are observed in a 83 variety of health outcomes (e.g., Currie and Moretti, 2003; Lleras-Muney, 2005; de Walque, 84 2007; Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010). The study that is closest to ours in this literature is 85 Chang (2018). We both documented an extended educational gap in the US in the responses 86 to the MMR-autism controversy, partially corroborating the previous UK ndings.4Chang 87 (2018) also studied the impacts of the media, focusing on newspapers, radio, and television. 88 She found that the educational gap increased with greater media attention to the controversy. 89 We di er in a number of ways. Some of the less crucial di erences are the longer periods we 90 cover and our di erent media data, which include traditional newspaper coverage as well as 91 online searches. With online information becoming an indispensable source of information for 92 many people, our inclusion of this type of media provides a fuller picture of the information 93 that may in uence vaccination decisions. 94 The primary di erence between the two studies, however, lies in the di erent questions 95 addressed. While Chang (2018) did not distinguish between positive and negative media 96 coverage, our principal inquiry concerns the di erent impacts of information with alterna- 97 tive positions about the MMR vaccine. A common explanation for health-related education 98 gradients is that education allows more e ective absorptions of medical information, which 99 are re ected in health behavior (Grossman, 1972). Our ndings point to a downside associ- 100 ated with this better ability to absorb information: the initially absorbed information may 101 3Using a randomized controlled trial, Nyhan et al. (2014) obtained a complementary nding in which they showed that the e ectiveness of pro-vaccine messages may vary depending on parents' existing attitudes. 4Covering the period 1993{2004, Wright and Polack (2006) found that the MMR non-uptake rate increased signi cantly in almost all areas of England since 2000, where the non-uptake rate increased more slowly in areas with higher proportion of population with lower education. Anderberg et al. (2011) covered the period 1997{2005 and similarly documented an educational gradient since 1999. They, however, found that the UK educational gap vanished by the end of the period covered, whereas both Chang (2018) and our study found that in the US the gap persisted well into 2005 and beyond. A US study preceding our studies is Smith et al. (2008). They found a decline in MMR immunization in 1999 and 2000 and a limited in uence of newspaper coverage of the controversy during that period of time. 3hinder subsequent absorptions of more up-to-date and accurate information in the presence 102 of cognitive biases. Our nding on the asymmetric responses to information suggests that 103 the persistent decline in the MMR immunization of the more educated group, even after the 104 vaccine has been proved safe, may be a consequence of this e ect. While Chang (2018) left 105 the educational gap as a puzzle and discuss possible explanations, we provide a theoretical 106 model and empirical evidence pointing to asymmetric responses to information, as would be 107 driven by con rmatory bias, as a plausible culprit.5108 This brings us to another contribution of our study. While laboratory evidence documents 109 the existence of con rmatory bias, few studies have examined such biases in a real-world 110 setting. To the best of our knowledge, our study presents the rst naturally occurring evidence 111 consistent with the presence of con rmatory bias in health decisions.6112 Our study also contributes a policy suggestion for what may be an e ective channel to 113 counter the misinformation surrounding the MMR vaccine and for correct information to take 114 root. We nd that among the di erent types of information considered online information 115 has the strongest impact on vaccination decisions, and this is true not only for negative 116 information but also for positive information. The nding suggests that online dissemination 117 of vaccine-safety information may be an e ective way to tackle the adverse consequences of 118 the previously circulated misinformation that lingered under the documented biases. 119 The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a more detailed account of the 120 MMR-autism controversy, bringing to view the prevalence of mixed information during the 121 period. Section 3 describes the data and the sample. Section 4 examines the di erential trend 122 of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rates between children of college-educated and non-college- 123 educated mothers. The trend analysis establishes the biases held by the more educated group 124 against the vaccine. Section 5 analyzes, both theoretically and empirically, the asymmetric 125 responses to mixed information about the MMR vaccine. Section 6 concludes with discussion 126 5Our ndings should not, however, be interpreted as suggesting that education contributes or leads to con rmatory bias. Psychologists consider con rmatory bias as a fundamental trait of human reasoning, and cognitive psychological studies provide no clear evidence that education levels are associated with higher or lower degree of the bias (e.g., Griggs and Ransdell, 1986; Jackson and Griggs, 1988; Calikli and Bener, 2015). This common human bias may or may not manifest in observed decisions. Education, by potentially creating di erential absorptions of information among the more and the less educated, provides a medium through which the bias can be registered in naturally occurring data, in a sense not too dissimilar to psychological studies using controlled laboratory tasks to detect the bias in experimental data. The interpretation of our ndings in this regard should be limited to that the documented asymmetric responses to positive and negative information by the college-educated group relative to the non-college-educated group provide evidence that di erent education levels allow con rmatory bias to exert di erent in uences on them. 6Since we do not observe actual information exposures at the individual level, our empirical method has relied on the assumption of homogeneous information exposures within states. The results we obtain are therefore \\intent-to-treat\" estimates, and our nding supporting the presence of con rmatory bias in vaccination decisions is a population-level evidence. Given that individual data on information exposures are unlikely to be available short of a controlled environment, this is probably the farthest one can go for studies relying on naturally occurring data. Andrews et al. (2018) presented evidence on con rmatory bias in the Associated Press Top 25 College Football Poll in which expert pollsters are tasked with assessing team quality. 4Table 1: Major Events Surrounding the MMR-Autism Controversy, 1988{2011 Year Event Classi cation 1998 (a) Wake eld et al.

We classify an event according to the perspective that it conveys to 131 the public about the safety of the vaccine, whether it is positive (encouraging vaccination) or 132 negative (discouraging vaccination). 133 5The classi ed events in Table 1 reveal that mixed information was prevalent during the 134 controversy. Those who sent positive information to the public included health authorities, 135 mainstream scientists, and the O\u000ece of Special Masters of the US Court of Federal Claims, 136 commonly referred to as the \\Vaccine Court.\"7They all refuted the claim that childhood 137 vaccines cause autism, by either conducting new and reviewing existing research, publishing 138 books, or delivering ruling decisions [events (c), (d), (e), (k), (o), (r), (s), and (t)]. The 139 outbreaks of mumps and measles in 2006 and 2008 among unvaccinated persons (Omer et al., 140 2009) also should have reminded the public of the importance of adhering to the childhood 141 vaccine schedule [events (h) and (n)]. In fact, these outbreaks caused health organizations to 142 actively advocate the bene ts of the MMR vaccine. 143 Despite the assurance from the mainstream entities, ever since the publication and the 144 media coverage of Wake eld et al. (1998), the conception that the MMR vaccine and autism 145 are related took root among certain group of parents. Through articles and books, activists 146 and celebrities promoted their views or personal experiences that the vaccine-autism link was 147 real [events (f), (g), (i), (l), (p), and (q)]. The skepticism even fueled some conspiracy theory; a 148 2005 Rolling Stone article, which purported that health agencies colluded with pharmaceutical 149 companies to cover up the risk of vaccines, almost threw the government into a trust crisis. 150 The compensation made by the Vaccine Court for Hannah Poling, who su ered from a rare 151 pre-existing disease with resulting developmental disorders that were ruled as worsened by 152 vaccines, was perceived by some parents as tacit acknowledgement by the government that 153 vaccines cause autism [event (j)]. Perhaps because there were no readily available explanations 154 for the drastic increase in autism cases during the period, the purported link to the MMR 155 vaccine was appealing to many parents and received wide publicity (Dannetun et al., 2005). 156 To appreciate the scope of con icting information prevailed during the controversy, it is 157 useful to review two other claims about the risks of childhood vaccines. One of the claims con- 158 cerns thimerosal, a preservative that has ceased to be used in childhood vaccines since 2001.8159 It has been suggested that the mercury-based preservative is linked to autism. Although the 160 connection has been disputed by scientists (Stehr-Green et al., 2003; Verstraeten et al., 2003; 161 Price et al., 2010), and thimerosal was never used in the MMR vaccine, the MMR-autism 162 and the thimerosal-autism links were frequently referred to together. Some even mistakenly 163 reported that the MMR vaccine contains thimerosal. 164 The other claim concerns the immunization schedule. It has been suggested that the 165 commonly followed schedule, which administers a large number of vaccines early in a child's 166 7The Vaccine Court administers the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault compensation program established under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, for persons allegedly injured by compulsory childhood vaccines. The court provides individuals with an alternative to the often costly and lengthy civil court proceedings. 8Baker (2008) discusses the interplay of concerns over vaccine preservatives, mercury poisoning, and autism that created the controversy over childhood vaccines. 6life, overwhelms and weakens the child's immune system. This, however, was also disputed by 167 scientists (O\u000et et al., 2002). Since most information refers to the vaccine-autism link without 168 di erentiating the di erent hypothesized causes, these claims, though not directly related to 169 the MMR vaccine, may also a ect its non-uptake rate. 170 3 Data and Sample 171 We proceed to describe our data, which consist of immunization records and a set of self- 172 constructed measures of information exposures. 173 3.1 Immunization Records 174 Our outcome variable, the MMR non-uptake rate, is obtained from the immunization records 175 of the National Immunization Surveys (NIS). The NIS are a group of phone surveys used to 176 monitor vaccination coverage among children and teens in the US. Sponsored and conducted 177 annually by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the surveys 178 randomly select phone numbers and enroll one or more age-eligible child or teen from the 179 selected households. During the phone interviews, parents or guardians are asked a series of 180 questions regarding their children's vaccinations. Demographics data are also collected. With 181 the consent of parents, a questionnaire is further mailed to each child's vaccination provider(s) 182 to collect information regarding the child's vaccination history. 183 We obtain immunization records of children between 19 and 35 months of age.9To ensure 184 reliability of the self-reported vaccination status, we restrict our sample to those with valid 185 provider information.10In addition to the child's current vaccination status, the immuniza- 186 tion records contain the following individual characteristics that we use in our analysis: the 187 demographics of the child and the mother at the time of the survey, the socioeconomic status 188 of the household, the type of the child's health care facility, and a state identi er. 189 The sample covers the period 1988 to 2011, with observations of 271,487 children. Table 2 190 presents the summary statistics of the whole sample and of the sub-samples of children with 191 college-educated and non-college-educated mothers. Children of college-educated mothers 192 have a lower average MMR non-uptake rate.11The group is also more likely to be Caucasians, 193 9The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends children to receive two doses of MMR vaccine, the rst between 12 and 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years of age. We allow for temporary delays by using 19 months as the cuto ; children who meant to be on the immunization schedule would have received the rst dose of the vaccine by the time they reached 19 months of age. 10The NIS began to include cell phone numbers in their surveys enrollments in 2011. For consistency with other years, we restrict our 2011 sample to landline data. 11Our focus on mothers' education is shaped by data availability, in which the immunization records contain only the education level of the mothers. Nevertheless, with mothers typically playing a major role in child- 7Table 2: Summary Statistics: MMR Non-Uptake Rate and Samples are obtained from the immunization records of the National Immunization Survey, covering the period 1988 to 2011. The sampled children are divided according to whether the child's mother has received college education. Standard deviations are in parentheses. be married, and have a higher household income. 194 3.2 Information Exposures 195 Using the state identi ers in the immunization records, we link the children in our sample 196 to a set of state-level measures of information exposures. These self-constructed measures, 197 caregiving, this data limitation does not pose a strong restriction for our purpose. 8which quantify the intensity of exposures to immunization-related information in each state 198 and year, include 1) the prevalence rates of relevant diseases, 2) the counts of relevant coverage 199 in local newspapers, and 3) the intensities of relevant online searches. We classify information 200 exposures into positive and negative: the former refer to those that would encourage vacci- 201 nations, potentially lowering the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate; the latter are expected to 202 have the opposite e ect. We also distinguish between passive and active exposures. Disease 203 prevalence and newspaper coverage are considered passive exposures, while online searches 204 represent active exposures. 205 We describe in details the constructions of each of these variables, the summary statistics 206 of which are reported in Table 3. Our identi cation strategy exploits the variations in these 207 variables over time in each state to assess their impacts on the MMR vaccine non-uptake 208 rate. The underlying presumption is that the vaccination decisions of mothers in years with 209 more frequent onsets of the diseases, more relevant newspaper coverage, and/or more intense 210 online searches of related topics are more strongly a ected. Table A.1 in the Appendix reports 211 the between- and within-state variations in each variable. There are considerable variations 212 within states over time, which serve our identi cation well. 213 Prevalence Rates of Relevant Diseases. We use autism and the three diseases pre- 214 ventable by the MMR vaccine as the relevant diseases for constructing measure of one set 215 of passive information exposures. We obtain data on autism from the O\u000ece of Special Edu- 216 cation Programs, which maintains state counts of children with 13 types of disabilities who 217 receive free public education under the Individual with Disability Education Act. The data 218 on measles, mumps, and rubella are obtained from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Re- 219 ports, which are compiled based on reports by state and territorial health departments to 220 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as part of the National Noti able Diseases 221 Surveillance System. 222 For each state-year, we calculate the rate of autism out of the 13 disability counts to capture 223 the prevalence of the disease. We expect that a higher prevalence of autism contributes to a 224 stronger concern over the MMR vaccine; it is considered a negative passive exposure. For the 225 prevalence of MMR, we calculate the rate of the three diseases relative to the number of state 226 residents in each state-year. Philipson (1996) documented that a higher prevalence of measles 227 induced a higher demand for measles vaccine. We similarly expect that a higher prevalence 228 of the three diseases would result in a lower MMR vaccine non-uptake rate; the prevalence of 229 MMR is considered a positive passive exposure. 230 Newspaper Coverage. We search for and identify relevant newspaper coverage in the 231 LexisNexis Academic database, which contains records of 295 US newspapers and was used 232 in previous studies on media coverage of vaccines (e.g., Smith et al., 2008; Clarke, 2008). 233 We search for news articles from 1998 to 2011 that contain the following ve sets of key- 234 9T able 3: Summary Statistics: Measures of Information Exposures Data Source Mean (SD) Classi cation A.

Standard deviations (SD) are in parentheses.10020406080100120140160180 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011News Count YearNewspaper Coverage on MMRAutism and VaccineAutism Links News Covering VaccineAutism Link News Covering MMRAutism Link News Covering Both MMRAutism and VaccineAutism LinksFigure 2: Coverage \\thimerosal\" and \\autism\"; and 5) \\mercury\" and \\autism.\" We manually review each article 236 to ensure that it covers the MMR-autism link or a more general vaccine-autism link. We 237 screen out articles that focus solely on the link between autism and a speci c vaccine other 238 than the MMR (e.g., the u and the Hib vaccine). Since these excluded articles are at best 239 indirectly related to the MMR vaccine, they presumably have little impact on the non-uptake 240 rate of the MMR vaccine. A total of 1,232 counts of news articles are identi ed as a result. 241 Figure 2 presents the annual counts of identi ed coverage on the MMR-autism and vaccine- 242 autism links.12Two patterns are apparent from the gure. First, most coverage on the MMR- 243 autism link also covers the general vaccine-autism link. Second, although most coverage on 244 the vaccine-autism link does not cover the MMR-autism link, there is an increasing trend that 245 it does. It is plausible that coverage on the other hypothesized risks of childhood vaccines| 246 the thimerosal preservative and the intense immunization schedule|may a ect the MMR 247 vaccine non-uptake rate as well.13This observation justi es the inclusion of all 1,232 counts 248 of coverage, some of which are obtained with keywords such as thimerosal and mercury, in 249 evaluating the impacts of newspaper coverage on the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate. 250 We use four attributes to characterize the contents of the identi ed newspaper coverage. 251 For each coverage, we determine whether it has one or more of the following attributes and 252 assign count to the applicable attribute(s): 1) an overarching position supporting immuniza- 253 tion; 2) citing health authorities and/or scienti c evidence to support immunization; 3) citing 254 anecdotal evidence against immunization; and 4) reporting increasing cases of autism and/or 255 describing hardship in taking care of an autistic child. We aggregate the attribute counts by 256 12A news coverage is considered to be on the MMR-autism link if it mentions the MMR vaccine or the study by Wake eld et al. (1998). If it covers other childhood vaccines, with or without mentioning the MMR vaccine, it is considered to be on the vaccine-autism link. 13The spillover may also work in the opposite direction, in which the MMR-autism controversy may a ect the non-uptake rates of other childhood vaccines. As will be shown below, we nd evidence for this direction of spillover. Chang (2018) also obtained a parallel nding. 11the release year of the news and the location of the news outlet.14We then construct four 257 variables by calculating the percentage of each of the four attributes in each state-year. The 258 geographical and time variations in the variables are exploited for identi cation. We consider 259 the percentages of news with attributes 1) and 2) as positive passive exposures and those with 260 attributes 3) and 4) as negative passive exposures. 261 Online Searches. We use the search indices from Google Trends to capture the intensity 262 of online searches of immunization-related information. Launched in 2004, Google Trends 263 compiles an index for a term after its search volume reaches a certain threshold. The quali ed 264 search volumes, which exclude repeated queries from the same user in close temporal proximity, 265 are normalized by the total searches on all topics of the region and time that the data points 266 lie. The index ranges from 0 to 100 with a higher value indicating more intensive searches. 267 For each state-year, we obtain the available indices for the following terms or phrases: 268 \\autism,\" autism.\"15For missing values prior to 2004 or due to low search volumes, we use indices 270 predicted based on time-varying state characteristics.16The indices for \\measles,\" \\mumps,\" 271 and \\rubella\" are averaged to create a summary index for the diseases that the MMR vaccine 272 seeks to prevent.17Online searches for the three infectious diseases are considered as positive 273 14While some national newspapers, such as The New York Times, have nationwide readership, the reader- ship may vary across states in a way that correlates with our outcome variable, the MMR non-uptake rate. In our main analysis, we therefore assign geographic areas to the news articles based on the immediate locations of the news outlets, counting, e.g., articles from The New York Times for New York only. We supplement this by performing robustness checks, excluding articles from the top national news outlets, which potentially o ers a cleaner state-level variation in news exposures. 15\\MMR autism controversy\" is a rather speci c phrase. The phrase in this exact form may not be searched as often as other relevant terms. Accordingly, unlike the other terms, for \\MMR autism controversy\" we obtain the index for the search topic instead of the search term. Search topics from Google Trends include all search terms that are related to the topic. In our analysis below, we also perform robustness check by excluding \\MMR autism controversy\" from the construction of measures of online information exposures. 16We rst estimate a linear regression model with the available data in and after 2004, regressing the search indices on a wide range of time-varying state characteristics. We then use the estimated coe\u000ecients to predict the values of the search indices prior to 2004 based on the state characteristics in those earlier years. The state characteristics (data sources) include proportions of uninsured children under 18 among all uninsured people (Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement), percentages of immigrants among state residents (Yearbook of Immigration Statistics), percentages of households with internet access (Current Population Reports on Computer and Internet Use in the United States), percentages of high school graduates (Current Population Reports on Educational Attainment in the United States), and levels of GDP (US Bureau of Economic Analysis). Since the extent of information seeking is likely to be a ected by news coverage (Niederdeppe et al., 2008), the state characteristics also include passive information exposures to capture the search interests of each keyword. The passive exposures that are included are counts of newspaper articles on the MMR-autism and the vaccine-autism links, autism prevalence rates, and reported cases of measles, mumps, and rubella at the state and year levels. We also make allowance for exible time e ects, including a linear, quadratic, and cubic time trends in the estimation. For the years with available data, the predicted indices are highly correlated with the actual data, which suggests that the imputed values provide reliable substitutes for the missing data. The correlations range from 0.5163 to 0.8146, with a mean value of 0.6817. In our analysis below, we also perform robustness check by omitting altogether the data before 2004. 17The search volume for \\measles\" is substantially higher than those for \\mumps\" and \\rubella\" during the period covered. This is perhaps not surprising given that the MMR-autism controversy was initiated on 12active exposures, while those for \\autism,\" \\MMR autism controversy,\" and \\ vaccine and 274 autism\" represent negative active exposures. 275 4 Biases of College-Educated Mothers 276 As the rst step of our analysis, we demonstrate that, relative to non-college-educated mothers, 277 the college-educated held biases against the MMR vaccine. We divide our sampled children 278 into two groups according to whether the child's mother is college educated (with a bachelor 279 degree or above) or not and estimate the following equation separately for each group: 280 yist \u0010Xist \u0000\u0015st \u0000 s \u0000\u0011t \u0000\"ist; (1) where the outcome of interest, yist, is an indicator of delayed MMR immunization of child i 281 living in state sin yeart,Xistis a vector of individual characteristics, \u0015stis a vector of time- 282 varying state characteristics, sis the state xed e ects capturing time-invariant heterogeneity 283 across states, \u0011tis the year xed e ects, and \"istis the idiosyncratic error term. 284 The year xed e ects, \u0011t, are the key variable of interest. They represent the annual 285 changes in the estimated MMR vaccine non-uptake rates relative to those in 1998. The vector 286 of individual characteristics, Xist, the summary statistics of which are reported in Table 2, 287 includes the child's gender, rst-born status, age, race, and medical facility type (private, 288 public, or mixed). It also includes the mother's martial status and age at the time of the 289 survey, family income, and an indicator if the child has relocated from a di erent state.18The 290 vector of time-varying state characteristics, \u0015st, which is also used in estimating the missing 291 values of the Google Trends indices, includes proportions of uninsured children under 18, 292 percentages of immigrants, and state population. 293 Figure 3(a) plots the estimated coe\u000ecients of the year xed e ects for the two groups of 294 children. Figure 3(b) plots the group-di erences in those coe\u000ecients. The di erences indicate 295 a widening education gradient over time. The MMR vaccine non-uptake rates of both groups 296 increased after the publication of Wake eld et al. (1998). While these initial increases were 297 brief, lasting till 2001, the increase was more substantial for the college-educated group. By 298 contrast, in the following years in which the non-uptake rates of both groups declined, a more 299 substantial decrease was observed for the non-college-educated group. 300 Interestingly, the subsequent assurance of vaccine safety by the medical community in 301 the connection between the measles virus and autism. While our main analysis uses a summary index covering the three terms, we perform robustness check by excluding \\mumps\" and \\rubella\" from the construction of measures of online information exposures. 18Since dummy variables for mother and child age categories at the time of the survey are included in the regressions, the mother's age at child's birth is implicitly accounted for. 130.020.010.000.010.020.030.040.05 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011Change in NonUptake Rate YearChanges in MMR Vaccine NonUptake Rate to CollegeEducated NonCollegeEducated Group(a) Changes in MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates 0.020.010.000.010.020.030.040.05 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011Differential Change in NonUptake Rate YearDifferential Changes in MMR Vaccine NonUptake Rate Between CollegeEducated and NonCollegeEducated Groups Relative to 1988 (b) Di erential Changes in MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates Figure 3: Annual Changes in MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates Relative to 1998 2004 was met with an unfavorable response: the non-uptake rates climbed back up again in 302 2005. While the non-college-educated group showed no distinctly clear trend afterwards, the 303 upward trend perpetuated for the college-educated group. The drastic increases for this group 304 after 2006, which was not covered by Chang (2018), further deepened the di erence between 305 the two education groups. The college-educated group contributed to most of the post-2004 306 increases in the overall MMR vaccine non-uptake rate as shown in Figure 1. 307 The di erences in the annual changes of the non-uptake rates between the two groups 308 suggest that, relative to the non-college-educated, the college-educated mothers held biases 309 against the MMR vaccine. To evaluate the magnitude of the biases, we estimate the following 310 equation using the full \u0000\"ist:(2) Equation (2) extends on (1) by including two additional interaction terms, college \u0002lnpt \u00011998q 312 andcollege \u0002post 2004, wherecollege is a dummy variable taking the value of one if the child's 313 mother is college-educated and post 2004is another dummy variable taking the value of one for 314 years after 2004. 315 14Table 4: Di erential Trends of the MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates (1) Division{Year State{ln(year) Note: The outcome variable is an indicator for delayed MMR immunization. college is a dummy variable for children with college-educated mother. The time trend, lnpt \u00011998q, starts at time zero, which is year 1998. post 2004 is a dummy variable for years after 2004. Columns (1){(4) report estimation results from four di erent speci cations of area-speci c year xed e ects: none, region-speci c year e ects, division-speci c year e ects, and state-speci c log- linear year e ects. Regions and divisions are assigned based on the common practice of the Census. Standard errors clustered at the survey strata level are in parentheses. *** indicates signi cance at the 1% level, ** at the 5% level, and * at the 10% level. The termcollege \u0002lnpt \u00011998q is the key variable of interest in equation (2). It is the 316 di erential time trend of the non-uptake rate of the college-educated group, in which a log time 317 trend is adopted to re ect the decreasing rate at which the di erences between the two groups 318 increased over time, as is shown in Figure 3(b).19We use this di erential trend to capture the 319 biases of the college-educated group formed since 1998; its estimated coe\u000ecient is interpreted 320 as the strength of the biases. The other interaction term, college \u0002post 2004, identi es any 321 deviation from the di erential trends following the release of conclusive information in 2004 322 assuring the safety of the MMR vaccine. 323 Table 4 reports the estimated coe\u000ecients of the two interaction terms under four di erent 324 speci cations of area-speci c year e ects.20The positive and signi cant coe\u000ecients of the time 325 trend interaction, college \u0002lnpt \u00011998q, suggest that the strength of the biases of the college- 326 educated mothers increased over time: relative to the non-college-educated, these mothers 327 were on average more and more reluctant over time to subject their children to the MMR 328 vaccine. This nding, which is robust to the di erent area-speci c year e ects, corroborates 329 the rudimentary analysis based on Figure 3 above. The coe\u000ecients of college \u0002post 2004are, on 330 the contrary, small and insigni cant: the assurance of vaccine safety by the IOM, the partial 331 retraction of Wake eld et al. (1998), and the other events happened in or after 2004, did not 332 result in any meaningful deviation from the increasing trend of the MMR non-uptake rate of 333 the college-educated group. 334 We also estimate equation (2) using the non-uptake rates of other childhood vaccines and 335 obtain similar ndings for hepatitis and pertussis immunizations. The result, which is reported 336 in Table A.2 in the Appendix, suggests a spillover e ect of the MMR vaccine controversy to 337 19The time trend starts at time zero (year t \u00101998q. The functional form is not critical to our results, which are robust to alternative speci cations such as linear or quadratic time trend. 20The regressions are weighted using the survey weights to obtain representative results. Standard errors are clustered at the survey strata level. 15other childhood vaccines. 338 5 Asymmetric Responses to Mixed Information 339 The di erential trend of the MMR non-uptake rate of the college-educated group not only did 340 not subside but in fact strengthened after the release of conclusive evidence in 2004 proving the 341 safety of the vaccine. This raises the question of why such biases could sustain in the presence 342 of information that is at odds with the biases. It is conceivable that mothers with di erent 343 education levels were exposed to di erent information. However, meaningful responses were 344 observed from both groups in 2004, suggesting that di erential availability of information is 345 unlikely to be the major explanation for the perpetuating di erential trend. 346 An alternative explanation would be that the two groups of mothers responded to in- 347 formation di erently. Psychologists have long documented people's tendency to interpret 348 information in ways that are partial to their existing beliefs. A consequence of this con rma- 349 tory bias is that those who are susceptible to it respond to new information di erently from 350 those who are immune or less susceptible, and how the responses are di erent depends on the 351 orientation of the information, whether it is in line or at odds with existing beliefs.21In this 352 section, we investigate how the documented di erential trend of the MMR non-uptake rate 353 interacts with di erent information about vaccine safety. 354 In Section 5.1, we utilize a stylized model of vaccination decisions to articulate the linkage 355 between bias in information interpretation and asymmetric responses to positive and negative 356 information. In Section 5.2, we examine empirically how college-educated mothers' vaccination 357 decisions responded to positive and negative information asymmetrically in a way that is 358 consistent with the implications of con rmatory bias. Having established the presence of 359 these asymmetric responses to information, we further investigate from a policy vantage which 360 type of information exposures has better potential to counter the adverse consequences of 361 misinformation. Section 5.3 reports results from various robustness checks. 362 5.1 A Stylized Model of Vaccination Decisions 363 We model the initial uncertainty about the safety of the MMR vaccine by two equally likely 364 states of the world, S, which represents that the vaccine is safe, and H, which represents that 365 it is harmful. Parents make vaccination decisions for their child, fully internalizing the child's 366 interests in deciding whether to obtain the vaccine, y, or not,n. For expositional convenience, 367 we assume that there is only one child in each household and hereafter refer to \\parent\" and 368 21Nickerson (1998) provides an informative review of this arguably most common bias in human reasoning and its manifestations in a variety of individual and social phenomena. 16\\household\" interchangeably.22369 A child receives immunization bene t, z, from taking the vaccine regardless of whether it 370 is safe or harmful. On the other hand, taking the vaccine imposes a health cost, a, if and 371 only if it is harmful. The utility from taking the vaccine is therefore upS;y q \u0010zif it is safe 372 andupH;y q \u0010z \u0001aif it is harmful. A child who is not vaccinated does not receive the 373 immunization bene t and also is not exposed to any health risk. The utility from not taking 374 the vaccine is therefore zero, i.e., upS;nq \u0010upH;nq \u0010 0. We assume that a \u00a5z \u00a50, which 375 means that the immunization bene t does not justify taking the vaccine if it turns out to be 376 harmful. Health bene t and cost of vaccinations typically depend on a number of individual 377 factors such as living conditions and the child's intrinsic proneness to diseases. We further 378 assume that zanda, while satisfying the parameter restriction above, are heterogeneous across 379 households. Each household is identi ed by its bene t-to-cost ratio,z aP r0; 1s.23380 Households receive information about the safety of the vaccine, modeled as noisy infor- 381 mative signals about the state. To capture the historical development of the MMR-autism 382 controversy, marked by the publication of Wake eld et al. (1998) and the subsequent studies 383 drawing opposite conclusion, we assume that there are two instances of signal transmission. 384 The two signals partition the time frame of our analysis into three periods: before the rst 385 signal (t \u00100), in-between the two signals ( t \u00101), and after the second signal (t \u00102). 386 We consider two groups of households, a biased (b) and an unbiased (u) groups. In each of 387 t \u00100;1;2, a unit mass of each group of households makes vaccination decisions in that period 388 based on all previously and currently available information. We assume that the households 389 in each group, represented by their bene t-to-cost ratio,z a, are uniformly distributed on r0;1s. 390 Each of the two signals, which is independently distributed, has binary realizations, sand 391 h, with distribution Pr ps|S q \u0010Prph|H q P p1 2;1q. Realized signal sis interpreted as a positive 392 news and realized signal ha negative news regarding the safety of the vaccine.24Misper- 393 ception of signal informativeness lies at the core of our model, which generates asymmetric 394 responses to positive and negative news as a Bayesian outcome. The unbiased parents always 395 objectively perceive that Prps|S q \u0010Prph|H q \u0010p P p1 2;1q. For the biased parents, there are 396 three possibilities: 1) if their existing beliefs are that SandHare equally likely, they are 397 objective like the unbiased parents, 2) if their existing beliefs are that Sis more likely, they 398 22The one-child assumption is innocuous. It is very likely that a household will have the same vaccination decisions for all its children, and the parent's altruistic preferences can then be de ned over the average of the children's welfare. 23We use the weak inequality a \u00a5z \u00a50 instead of the strict inequality a \u00a1z \u00a10 for the parameter restriction out of technical consideration. It allows us to have the closed unit interval as the domain for the bene t-to-cost ratio. 24If we consider, e.g., the publication of Wake eld et al. (1998) and its subsequent retraction as the two signals, they are clearly not independent. Given that our objective is not on modeling the information sources but the responses to information, assuming the independence provides us with a parsimonious environment to focus on the issue of interests. 17misperceive that the signal is more informative than it objectively is when signal sis received, 399 i.e., Prps|S q \u0010Prph|H q \u0010p1\u00a1p, and less informative than it objectively is when his re- 400 ceived, i.e., Prps|S q \u0010Prph|H q \u0010p2 p, and 3) if their existing beliefs are that His more 401 likely, the opposite holds where they misperceive that Prps|S q \u0010Prph|H q \u0010p1\u00a1pwhenh 402 that q q pwhensis received. The biased misperception in ates or de ates the informativeness of the signals when their existing beliefs 404 assign non-uniform probabilities to the two states.25405 Parents choose yif and only if the expected utility from choosing yis no less than that 406 from choosing n, and this reduces to the condition that the bene t-to-cost ratio is no less 407 than the probability assessment that the vaccine is harmful. In period t \u00100, this condition 408 for taking the vaccine under the prior isz a\u00a51 2. De ning the proportion of parents in a group 409 who choose nas the group's vaccine non-uptake rate, N, we obtain the following baseline case 410 against which the impacts of the signals are evaluated: 411 Observation 1. In periodt \u00100, the vaccine non-uptake rate of the biased group, N0 b, and 412 that of the unbiased group, N0 u, coincide at1 2.26413 Upon receiving a signal, parents update their beliefs. The publication of Wake eld et al. 414 (1998) is tantamount to the realization of an hsignal int \u00101. Parents making decisions in 415 this period update beliefs from the uniform prior to Pr pH |hq \u0010p. The threshold for choosing 416 ybecomesz a\u00a5p. Given that those households withz a pchoosen, we obtain the following 417 comparison: 418 Observation 2. After exposure to a signal hindicating that the vaccine is harmful, the vaccine 419 non-update rates of both biased and unbiased groups increase from Nb 0 \u0010Nu 0 \u00101 2in we interpret the size of the di erential trend of the vaccine 422 non-uptake rate as the strength of the college-educated group's biases against the vaccine. 423 The model counterpart of this is a di erence-in-di erence, Dt \u0010 t \u0001Nu t\u00011 q, 424 which we use to evaluate the impact of a signal on the biased group relative to that on the 425 unbiased group. Given that Nb 0 \u0010Nu 0 \u00101 2andNb D1 phq \u0010 0. 426 The initial negative news in period t \u00101 has the same impact on the biased group as on 427 the unbiased group, because the biased parents making decisions in this period perceive the 428 informativeness of the hsignal as objectively as the unbiased parents. This is no longer the 429 case, however, in period t \u00102. The biased parents making decisions in this last period of the 430 25We use this rather ad hoc yet convenient approach to model the e ect of con rmatory bias. See Rabin and Schrag (1999) for the pioneering theoretical work on con rmatory bias in economics. 26An non-uptake rate of 50% is certainly not an accurate re ection of reality. Our focus, however, is on thequalitative changes in the non-uptake rates in response to new information, not their absolute levels. 18model, having been exposed to all previously available information, hold non-uniform beliefs 431 about the two states, and their misperception kicks in. 432 During the subsequent stage of the MMR-autism controversy, parents were exposed to both positive and negative information about the vaccine. For the signal in period t \u00102, we accordingly consider both sandhand examine their impacts separately.27Consider rst the case where the second signal is s. Having been exposed to the previous hsignal, the parents' existing beliefs are that the vaccine is more likely to be harmful than safe. When receiving the second ssignal, the biased group discounts the signal informativeness and updates beliefs according to \u0001p2 q \u0000 the other hand, with one hand onessignals objectively perceived, the unbiased group's updated beliefs in period t \u00102 coincide Consider next the case where the second signal is h. The biased parents in ate the informa- tiveness of the signal. The updated beliefs of the two groups of parents are, respectively, PrpH ifz a\u00a5PrpH |h;second signal; PrpH |h;second signal; bias statusq choosen, we have 434 the following pro le of vaccine non-uptake rates in period t \u00102:Nb 2 p2 implies that Nu 2 ph;s q Nb 2 ph;sq p, while 437 the informativeness-in ating condition, p1\u00a1p, implies that p Nu 2 ph;h q Nb 2 ph;h q. Also 438 recall from Observation 2 that Nb 1 phq \u0010Nu 1 phq \u0010p. These q \u00a10 439 andD2 ph;s q \u00a10, which give us the following main result of our theoretical analysis: 440 Proposition 1. Under the misperception of signal informativeness by the biased parents in 441 periodt \u00102, exposure to hsignal raises the vaccine non-uptake rate of the biased group more 442 than that of the unbiased group, while exposure to ssignal lowers the non-uptake rate of the 443 biased group less than that of the unbiased group. 444 27One can consider a model with three or more signals, evaluating, e.g., the e ect of a third hsignal after a rst hsignal and a second ssignal. To keep the analysis simple while bringing out the gist of the matter, we separately evaluate the e ects of a second sand a second hsignals. 19Since the impact of the hsignal on the vaccine non-uptake rate is an upward impact, 445 D2 ph;h q \u00a10 means that it raises the non-uptake rate of the biased group more than that 446 of the unbiased group. On the other hand, since the impact of the ssignal is a downward 447 impact,D2 ph;sq \u00a1 0 means that the impact on the non-uptake rate of the biased group is 448 less negative, i.e., smaller in magnitude, relative to that of the unbiased group. There are 449 asymmetric responses to positive and negative news in that, relative to the responses of the 450 unbiased group, the biased group responds more strongly to the negative news than to the 451 positive news. 452 5.2 The E ects of Information Exposures 453 We proceed to the empirical analogue of the theoretical analysis, investigating the e ects 454 of positive and negative information exposures described in Section 3.2. To promote the 455 comparability of di erent types of exposures measured in di erent ranges of values, we use 456 z-scores in our estimations.28We average the z-scores of all exposures of the same classi ed 457 views to construct composite measures of positive and negative exposures for each state-year. 458 Figure 4 illustrates the geographical variations in these composite measures in 1998, 2004, and 459 2011, in which the states are colored according to the quartiles of the composite exposures in 460 the given year. The gure shows su\u000ecient variations within states over time in the relative 461 levels of both positive and negative composite information exposures. 462 We augment equation (2) to include two additional interaction terms, 464 are composite measures of positive and negative information exposures in state sand yeart. 465 Recall that the estimated coe\u000ecient of college \u0002lnpt \u00011998q is interpreted as the strength 466 of the biases held by the college-educated group; the coe\u000ecients of the new interaction terms 467 therefore measure changes in the bias strength when the value of posinfo storneginfo st 468 increases by one. 469 Table 5 reports the estimation results, which provide evidence of asymmetric responses 470 to the positive and negative information exposures. In all four speci cations of area-speci c 471 college \u0002lnpt \u00011998q \u0002neginfo stare positive and signi cant, 472 whereas those of college \u0002lnpt \u00011998q \u0002posinfo stare negative, insigni cant, and minimal in 473 magnitudes. In relation to the coe\u000ecients of college \u0002lnpt \u00011998q reported in Table 4, these 474 coe\u000ecients imply the following: a one-standard-deviation increase in exposures to negative 475 information leads to at least 35.07% (0:0047 0:0134) increase in the strength of the college-educated 476 28Dafny and Dranove (2008) use the same standardization to study the e ects of di erent quality measures reported in HMO report cards on the enrollment choices of Medicare plans. The z-scores are variables with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, obtained by dividing the di erence between original variable value and the sample mean by the sample standard deviation. 20Figure 4: Geographical Variations in Composite Information Exposures in 1998, 2004, and 2011 Table 5: Changes in Di erential Trends of the MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates in Response to Information Exposures (1) (2) (3) Division{Year State{ln(year) Note: The outcome variable is an indicator for delayed MMR immunization. college is a dummy variable for children with college-educated mother.

Exposures to negative information strengthened the biases of the 479 21college-educated group more than exposures to positive information attenuated them. 480 Con rmatory bias and the implied asymmetric responses to information contribute to 481 the persistence of misinformation. The e ects of misinformation linger when people am- 482 plify incoming information that con rms their erroneous beliefs but discount information 483 that contradicts them. This could have alarming implications on many levels. In the case 484 of vaccinations, since immunizations create positive externality in building herd immunity, 485 withholding vaccinations is not simply a matter of personal choice but has immense societal 486 consequences.29487 Given the scope of the potential impacts, a study on misinformation cannot be complete 488 without shedding some light on how to counter or mitigate the adverse consequences of mis- 489 information and the associated biases. We extend on the above ndings and investigate from 490 a policy vantage which type of information exposures, traditional newspaper coverage or on- 491 line information, may provide a more e ective channel to tackle the biases against the MMR 492 vaccine.30We re-estimate equation (2) with separate sets of interaction terms for the positive 493 and negative exposures of each type of exposures considered. 494 Table 6 reports the estimation results. Online searches are found to have stronger impact 495 on the biases of college-educated mothers than does newspaper coverage. Importantly, both 496 positive and negative exposures of online searches have a signi cant e ect, although the e ect 497 of negative exposures remains dominant, about 2.29{2.45 times of that of positive exposures. 498 By contrast, for newspaper coverage, the e ects of both positive and negative exposures are 499 insigni cant and minimal in magnitude. The e ect of the prevalence of measles, mumps, and 500 rubella as positive exposures and that of autism as negative exposure are both insigni cant. 501 Echoing Smith et al. (2008), this additional nding indicates that traditional newspaper 502 coverage had limited impacts on immunization decisions. Negative coverage did not exacer- 503 bate the college-educated mothers' biases against the MMR vaccine, but neither did positive 504 coverage o er much help in reducing the biases. This is in contrast to online searches.31While 505 negative online searches signi cantly strengthened the biases, our nding suggests that on- 506 line searches are a \\double-edged sword\": unlike the ndings based on composite measures, 507 positive exposures to online searches alone did signi cantly attenuate the biases. The policy 508 29Another contemporary issue that has been impacted by misinformation is global warming. Despite the con rmation by science that global warming is a real concern, some people including political elites still erroneously believe the otherwise (e.g., McCright and Dunlap, 2011). Any resulting delay in implementing mitigating actions could have adverse consequences not only at a societal level but also on a global scale. 30Lewandowsky et al. (2012) review the cognitive factors that contribute to the stickiness of misinformation and recommend debiasing strategies based on cognitive psychological theory. 31During the period covered in our study, newspaper readerships declined at an annual rate capped at 6%. The volumes of Google searches, on the other hand, increased quickly, though at a decreasing rate. In 2011, e.g., the growth rate was around 11%. Despite this contrast between online and traditional media exposures, our use of z-scores allows us to capture the relative levels of information exposures across states in a given year. Figures A.1 and A.2 in the Appendix present the geographical variations in the information exposures to newspaper coverage and online searches. 22Table 6: Changes in Di erential Time Trends of the MMR Vaccine Non-Uptake Rates in Response to Information Exposures by Information Types (1) (2) (3) (4) Division{Year State{ln(year) Note: The outcome variable is an indicator for delayed MMR immunization. college is a dummy variable for children with college-educated mother.

The two major ones concern the data on informa- 513 tion exposures. For the rst set of robustness checks, we consider separately four alternative 514 constructions of measures of information exposures: 1) given that the search volume for 515 \\measles\" is substantially higher than \\mumps\" and \\rubella,\" we exclude the search indices 516 for the latter two from the measure of positive active exposures; 2) since the speci c phrase 517 \\MMR autism controversy\" has a relatively lower search volume, we exclude its search index 518 23from the measure of negative active exposures; 3) since national newspapers have readership 519 that spans across states, in an attempt to obtain a cleaner state-level variation in news ex- 520 posures, we exclude top four news outlets from our data on news coverage; and 4) we take 521 a further step to exclude the top ten news outlets. The estimation results under these alter- 522 native constructions are reported, respectively, in Columns (1), (2), (3), (4) of Table A.3 in 523 the Appendix. Our second robustness check concerns the missing data from Google Trends. 524 Since Google Trends was not launched until 2004, the data prior to 2004 are imputed based on 525 state characteristics. While the strong correlations between the imputed and the actual values 526 after 2004 suggest that the imputation should provide reliable substitutes for the missing data 527 before 2004, it is conceivable that some measurement errors are introduced. Table A.4 in the 528 Appendix reports estimation results from using only observations in 2004 and onwards. Our 529 main ndings in Section 5.2 survive the above two sets of robustness checks. 530 We further examine the robustness of our ndings with respect to three sample restric- 531 tions. First, to address the potential confound from exposures to information in a di erent 532 state, we exclude those who have relocated across states. Second, we restrict our full sample, 533 which includes children of all races, to non-Hispanic white and black children, thus excluding 534 Hispanic and Asian Americans. Mothers whose native language is not English may be less 535 likely to be exposed to the vaccine information we consider; to the extent that reading uency 536 in English is correlated with education levels, our ndings may be driven by variations in 537 information availability across the two groups of mothers rather than their di erent responses 538 to information. The sample restriction to non-Hispanic white and black children, whom we 539 consider to be the major English-speaking population in the sample, is an attempt to ad- 540 dress this potential confound. Finally, to focus more narrowly on the most relevant news, we 541 use articles that cover only the MMR-autism link to construct the measure of information 542 exposures for newspaper coverage. Our ndings are robust to all three sample restrictions.32543 6 Conclusion and Discussion 544 The study by Wake eld et al. (1998), which linked the measles virus to the in ammatory 545 bowel disease found in autistic children, initiated the infamous MMR-autism controversy and 546 fueled an ongoing anti-vaccine movement that continued through today. Consistent with the 547 ndings from prior studies, we nd that the persistent trend to delay the MMR immunization 548 since 1998 to 2011 in the US was driven by children of college-educated mothers. A di erential 549 trend of the MMR vaccine non-uptake rate of the college-educated group relative to the non- 550 college-educated group was observed. More importantly, the di erential trend perpetuated 551 even after scienti c consensus had been reached that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. 552 32The detailed estimation results from these three robustness checks are available upon requests. 24We examine the interactions between this di erential trend and exposures to information 553 about the safety of the MMR vaccine. The primary contribution of our study is the documen- 554 tation of an asymmetric response to positive and negative information. Interpreting the size of 555 the di erential trend as the strength of the college-educated mothers' biases against the MMR 556 vaccine, we nd that exposures to negative information about the vaccine strengthened their 557 biases more than exposures to positive information attenuated them. This nding provides 558 non-experimental evidence consistent with the implications of con rmatory bias documented 559 by psychologists. In the presence of such common bias in human reasoning, misinformation, 560 once planted, is hard to eradicate. On the policy front, we obtain further nding suggesting 561 that disseminating correct information online may present the best chance to counter the 562 sticky misinformation and erroneous beliefs about the MMR vaccine. 563 We conclude by discussing two potential issues in our empirical methods. Our policy 564 implication hinges on the nding that the isolated impacts of online information exposures, 565 both positive and negative, are signi cant. Yet it is plausible that simultaneity bias exists for 566 online searches, which results in an overestimation of the impacts. Parents who are uncertain 567 about the safety of the MMR vaccine may actively search for information online. As a result, 568 there may be a positive correlation between vaccination decisions and the intensity of online 569 searches, leading to the overestimation. 570 We formally test the endogeneity of positive and negative online exposures by using the 571 Hausman test to compare the estimates from an ordinary least squares (OLS) and an in- 572 strumental variable (IV) models. We use two plausible instrumental variables for the two 573 potentially endogenous variables of positive and negative online exposures. They are 1) the 574 percentage of households with internet access, and 2) the average time spent on computer for 575 leisure among individuals living in households with children under 18 years old.33Both instru- 576 ments have a stronger relationship with developments of the internet industry and changes 577 in lifestyles rather than strengths of opinions against the MMR vaccine. Comparing the es- 578 timates from the OLS and the IV models using the Hausman test, we fail to reject the null 579 hypothesis that the positive and negative online information exposures are exogenous.34580 In assessing the impacts of di erent types of information on the MMR vaccine non-uptake 581 rate, we categorize information in terms of its forms of transmission, whether it is through 582 traditional newspapers or the internet. It is equally valid to consider a taxonomy based on, 583 33The rst variable is obtained from the Current Population Reports on Educational Attainment, and the second variable is estimated using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Both variables are state-year level variables. The internet-access variables are also used in imputing the missing Google Trends indices for years prior to 2004, while the earliest year that the ATUS was available was 2003. Due to these restrictions, for this test of endogeneity we only consider observations in and after 2004. 34The IV models are estimated using two-stage least squares estimators. In all four speci cations of area- speci c year e ects that we adopt throughout the estimations in the paper, the power of the IV for both endogenous variables exceeds the conventional minimum of F \u001010, with a minimum value of 17.106 and a maximum value of 159.981. The p-values from the Hausman test range from 0.357 to 0.989. 25e.g., the sources of information, whether news about vaccine safety comes o\u000ecially from the 584 government or informally from social networks. To the extent that di erent sources of infor- 585 mation may be di erentially associated with di erent media formats, our ndings in terms 586 of the latter may in part be driven by responses to the former. Without pretending to of- 587 fer a complete answer to this potential confound, we nevertheless note that, for information 588 obtained through social networks, the vast development of social media platforms like Face- 589 book and Twitter has turned a substantial volume of social networking activities online. Our 590 measure of online information as a type of information may capture the information obtained 591 through social networks reasonably well, preserving the validity of our ndings in spite of the 592 potential confound. Examining more generally the interactions between media and sources of 593 vaccine information on vaccination outcomes would be a natural step for future research. 594 26References 595 [1] Anderberg, D., A.
