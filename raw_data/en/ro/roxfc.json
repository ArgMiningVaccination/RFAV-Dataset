The three Guianas comp rise, from west to eas t, the countries of Guyana (area: Cayenne). Evidently the contac t between Europeans and the present-day Guianas occurred in 1500 when the Spanish navigator Vincente Yanez Pinzon, after discovering the Amazon River, sa iled northwest and entered the Oyapock River, which is now the eastern boundary of French Guiana. As early as 1503 French colonists attempted to settle the island upon which Cayenne is built. Within the boundaries of today's Guianas, the land was originally occupied by Amerindians of Carib and Arawak language-families, and from the late 1500's onw ards was almost interchangeably settled by Spanish, British, Dutch, and French traders, adventurers, agriculturists and colonists. Gradually the land was sorted into areas controlled exclusively by either British, Dutch or French interests. The former British domains became independent on May 26, 1966 as the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, and the former Dutch domains became independent on November 25, 1975 as the Repub lic of Surinam. French Guiana became an Overseas Department of France in 1946 and is an integral part of France. Many of the species of tropical medicinal pl ants utilized at present in the Guianas were introduced in historical eras, and under circumstances, wh ich seem the distance of a universe away from the conditions that of ten prevail today. For a long time the New World itself was only a vague vision. The earliest European acquaintance with tropical vegetation had actually been th e result of Alexander the Great's invasion of northern India in 326 B.C., at which time the banyan tree ( Ficus bengalensis ) was first observed by the Western eyes of the conqueror's Greek forces (Stearn, 1976, 1988; Desmond, 1992). Information about the wondrous banyan fig tree with its dangling aerial roots flowed back to Greece and was recorded by the classical Greek scholar Theophrastus. The impressive Indian vegetation was soon largely forgotten by Europe; indeed, the literature was later sometimes suppressed fo r being of pagan (non- Christian) origin. The first travelers came to South America primarily in search of gold, spices, and new souls for the Church, for in the 16 th century, the divine sche me of the universe was the redemption of sinners in a disobedient world prior to the second coming of Christ. Thus the discoverers, after praying to th e Madonna of the Navigators for protection, sailed to bring news of \"The Redeemer\" to the \"misguided\" peoples of America. It required many years to acknowledge th e existence of Sout h America and fit it into the already esta blished \"triple-world\" cosmography of Asia, Africa and the Guianas (Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana) ii essentially Mediterranean-oriented concept of the globe. A four-part world was gradually accepted in the 16 th century, comprising the four great land masses of Asia (formerly one - half the world), Europe (formerly one-quarter of the world), Afri ca (formerly perceived to be one-quarter of the world), and America as a fourth continent often signified by the River Plate (now Argentina). As the existence of South America b ecame recognized, the pace of scientific explorations and discoveries quic kened, leading to works such as Plantae Surinamenses (1775) by Carl Linnaeus's Swedish pupil Jac ob Alm (based on Surinam collections made by Carl Gustav Dalberg in 1754-1755 under a subvention from Gustav III, King of Sweden), and the Histoire des Plantes de la Guiane Francoise by 1775. indige nous to the Guianas in the 1700's lived in relative ecological harmony with their forest ed surroundings and had a rather thorough knowledge of the use of plants. In contrast, the first Europeans in the area often felt themselves imprisoned in an impenetrable a nd meaningless green blanket, as they eked out a living from the forest. The perceived role of man in the forest was early studied an d influenced by the famous French naturalist, Count Geor ge-Louis Leclerc de Buffon (1707-1788), who produced in 44 encyclopedic Histoire Naturelle (published in Paris, 1749- 1804). Buffon was the intendant (supervisor) of the Jardin du Roi in Paris from 1739- 1788; during his tenure the South American expedition of C.-M. de la Condamine discovered, among many other th ings, a species of rubber, Hevea guianensis , in French Guiana. Buffon was deeply interested \"in the changes which men had made in their natural environment, particularly the tran sformation which had accompanied the growth and expansion of civilization and the migrati on and dispersion of human beings and their domesticated plants and animals throughout th e habitable parts of the earth\" (Glacken, 1960). In the days of Buffon (long before th e 'greenhouse effect\" was understood), many people believed that Nature is of divine or igin and must be improved and arranged by Man, who is also of divine origin. This led to several erroneous th eories, including the idea that humanity must aid Nature by changi ng it through deforestati on so that more of the sun's heat could warm the earth's surface, and compensate for the heat lost due to the cooling of the earth. Thus, Buffon's studies of the physical effects of man's intervention in the world environment led him to consider the climatic changes that occurred as a result of land-clearing, agri culture and drainage, as bei ng in a beneficial context. Buffon's viewpoint, as expressed by Gl acken (1960), was that, for 3,000 years, \"Flowers, fruits, grains, useful species of an imals have been transported, propagated, and increased without number; useless species of animals have been eliminated. Mining has advanced. Torrents have been restrained and the rivers directed and controlled. The sea has been conquered. Land has been restored an d made fertile.\" He believed, for example, that France would be much colder than it is, if its forests had not been cut. Unfortunately, for partial proof of this theory he chose to indicate \"the deforesta tion, scarcely a century earlier, of a district around Cayenne (there are many references to French Guiana throughout the Histoire Naturelle ), which caused considerable differences airMedicinal Plants of the Guianas (Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana) iii temperature, even at night, between the cold, wet, dense forest into which the sun seldom penetrated and the clearings ; rains even began later a nd stopped earlier in them (clearings) than in the fore st\" (Glacken, 1960). A similar th eory pertained regarding the St. Lawrence valley in North America (also with French settlements): \"The theory was the forests held the cold; once the land wa s cleared and brought into cultivation, the climate would then become like that of France\" (Dickason, 1984). An article on forest conservation wa s published by Count Buffon in 1739, as he also believed that deforestation could be reconciled with conservation under certain locally mitigating circumstances. Essentially, he felt that \"large areas inimical to man had to be cleared to make the earth habitable, but once societies were established on them, the forests were resources which had to be treated with care and foresight.\" The pressing need for environmental cons ervation in the three Guianas has been addressed by numerous researchers including Lindeman & Mori (1989); and for Guyana by Sullivan (1990), Pearce (1990, 1992) and Clar k et al. (2001); for Surinam by Boxman et al. (1987) and Mittermeie r et al. (1990); and as well for French Guiana by the publications of Clavel, Prof izi & Sallee (1978), de Granvi lle (1975), Sastre (1980) and Wencelius (1984). The judicious exploitation of indigenous medicinal plant resources following careful inventorying of species and ha bitats in the Guianas will hopefully assist the economic development of the region. Much conservation work in the Guianas is currently sponsored by the Biological Dive rsity of the Guianas Program of the Smithsonian Institution, and by the Amazon Conservation Team headed by ethnobotanist Mark Plotkin. As the Europe of earlier times became in trigued by the human inhabitants of the New World, the Amerindians we re gradually incorporated to an extent into European culture. The famous natural historian Alexande r von Humboldt, for example, noted in the early 1900's that \"when we speak in Europe of a native of Guiana, we figure to ourselves a man whose head and waist are decorated w ith the fine feathers of the macaw, the toucan and the hummingbird. Our painters a nd sculptors have long since regarded these ornaments as the characteristic ma rks of an American\" (Honour, 1975). Inevitably, New World plants were destined to play a much more important role in European like than would American tribal peoples and wildlife. Useful plants of New World origin sent to Europe from 1493 onw ards included maize (Indian corn), tobacco, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, vanilla, cotton, c hocolate, red peppers and pineapples. Other plants, such as annatto, perfor med several different functions. The annatto plant, Bixa orellana , which is sometimes used for medicinal purposes in the Guianas, produces a seed from whic h a food-coloring paste is derived. Formerly the plant was intensively cultivated on planta tions in French Guiana as a source of red fabric dye from the seeds. In the year 1752, for example, exports of Bixa from French Guiana amounted to 260,541 pounds, whic h outweighed the colony's combined production that year of sugar, cotton, coff ee, cacao and timber. All of that produce was the result of labor from 90 French fam ilies, 125 Amerindian slaves and 1,500 black slaves (Rodway, 1912). In 1772, a half-Scots so ldier in of a liberally Bixa -painted Indian from cayenne, and asked him why he was painted red. The Indian replied, in French, that he painted himself red because the substance keeps his skin soft, prevents exce ss perspiration, is a good mosquito repellant, and it is a beautiful color. He then asked Stedman why he was painted white! Apparently, Stedman was following the current European fa shion of powdering one's hair with flour, which had sifted down onto his shoulders (Van Lier, 1972; see also Collis, 1965 and Price & Price, 1990). True to the spirit of the famous Netherlands Golden Age of seaborne mercantilism, trading and investment (K oningsberger, 1967; Schama, 1987), Surinam itself was administered as a business ente rprise. In the year 1684 the society of shareholders, each owning one-third of the Su rinam trade, consisted of the Dutch West India Company; the City of Amsterdam; a nd the private possession of the family Van Aerssen van Sommelsdijk (Heniger, 1987). A number of the Society of Suriname directors were also directors of the Dutch East India Company, and commissioners of the Amsterdam Hortus Medicus, or botanical garden. Consequently a strong interrelationship of plant exchanges developed between Surinam, the Dutch East Indies, and the Amsterdam garden (Wijnands, 1987; Stearn, 1988A). Cornelius van Sommelsdijk, the Gove rnor of Surinam residing in Paramaribo, received from the Amsterdam garden various pl ants such as mulberry trees, peach trees, pomegranates and rhubarb, to be propagated on the plantations. In return, Surinam plants soon arrived in Holland, such as Canna indica in 1687 and the tree-cactus Cereus hexagonus in 1689. The introduction of Surinam pl ants to the Netherlands has been accorded extensive study by Brinkman (1980) , and the Dutch transatlantic trade in medicinal plant materials from areas includ ing Surinam has been researched by Rutten (2000). Also, the Dutch botanist Nahuys in Utrecht exchanged seeds and plants with Andre Thouin, head gardener at the Jardin du Ro i in Paris, in the late Eighteenth Century (Spary, 2000). The wild Caladium bicolor (Araceae), which has medicinal uses in the Guianas, was sent from Surinam to the Amsterda m botanical garden in 1704; at least 1,500 cultivars (cultivated varieties) of this deco rative plant have subsequently been developed. In Surinam, coffee was first planted in 1711 and exported in 1721; cacao was first planted in 1700 and first exported to Holland in 1706; and cotton was first cultivated on a large scale in 1763 (Van Lier, 1972). A ship's captain introduced pineapple plants ( Ananas comosus ) from Surinam to the Amsterdam and Leiden botanical gardens in 1680, and mass plantings under glass began on Nether lands estates in 1700 (Wijnands, 1983). Pineapples are today occasionally used for medicine in the Guianas, and a beautiful rendering of the plant is found in the 1705 book by Maria Sibylla Merian, a famous Dutch artist who traveled to Surinam to st udy tropical insects. Her sumptuous volume is entitled Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium ; several of the illustrations (plates) have been designated as the \"typ e\" for Surinam plant French Guiana) v Certain pineapple plants wh ich differed from the ordinary by having leaves with a desirable smooth (not spiny) margin were sent from Cayenne, French Guiana to France in 1820 and grown at Versailles. This 'Smooth Ca yenne' cultivar later became the basis of the formidable Hawaiian pineapple industr y, for in 1886 Captain John Kidwell planted 1,000 crowns of 'Smooth Cayenne' in Hawaii to establish large-scale cultivation of the fruit. The first plant collector in French Guia na was Pierre Barrere (1690-1755), who as early as the years 1722-1725 botanized along the coastal area in his capacity as \"medecin-botaniste du roi\" in Cayenne (V ermeulen, 1985). He was later followed by J.B.C.F. Aublet (1720-1778) who collected plants from by Jean-Baptiste Patris, another \"medecin-botaniste\" from 1764- 1786 (Chaia, 1970). Empress Josephine of France, wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, assemb led a large collection of plants from around the world in her garden at Malmaison, a chat eau about seven miles west of Paris (David, 1966; Lamb, 1001; Mauguin, 1933). Plants were sent to her from French Guiana by Joseph Martin, director of a national spice plantation at La Gabrielle, 20 km south of Cayenne (Ly-Tio-Fane, 1991). During th e Napoleonic Wars in 1803, two British privateers captured a French ship laden with 140 tubs of living plants which had been gathered during six years of work in French Guiana by Mr. Martin. Martin was aboard the ship, accompanyi ng the plants that were intended for Josephine's garden and the Paris Natura l History Museum. In England, even the influence of Sir Joseph Banks, who wanted to send the plants forward to Josephine, was not successful and three barges dragged the plan ts up the Thames River, to be planted at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The plants did not survive and the unfortunate prisoner Mr. Martin was repatriated to France, never to see the fruits of hi s labor again (Stearn & Williams, 1957). Martin is commemorated by the plant named Bignonia martini A.P. De Candolle (Bignoniaceae) and several other species. In the Indian Ocean, the French King's Garden on Mauritius provided Cayenne with seedlings of two precious spices, clove and nutmeg, in hopes of breaking the Dutch monopoly of the spice trade in the late 1770's (Duval, 1982; Ly-Tio-Fane, 1982). As noted by Howard (1953), \"with seeds or plants , new plantations coul d be established in other areas of the world and new supplies of sp ices obtained for the markets of Europe.\" In 1791, French Guiana supplied nutmeg plants to the St. Vincent Botanic Garden in the West Indies, and it is believed that all the nutmegs so important in the economy of St. Vincent, and Trinidad, are progeny of those originally introduced from French Guiana (Howard, 1954). One of the first British adventurers to exert influence in the Guianas was Sir Walter Raleigh, Captain of the Guard to Queen Elizabeth I. Led on by samples of marcasite of dubious origin, he went searching fo r the site of lost gold mines said to be in a fabled new empire, which supposedly had fu rnished the golden walls of the Peruvian Inca's Palace of the Sun. The mines were t hought to be at the golden city of Manoa, called by the Spanish \"El Dorado\", beside a certain Lake Parima (Lacey, 1973). RaleighMedicinal Plants of the Guianas (Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana) vi twice visited the Orinoco River region of th e then Spanish Guiana (now Venezuela), in 1595 Winton, 1975). On the 1617 trip he traveled under the auspices of King James I, a monarch who was \u00a3700,000 in debt and had been promised the gold mines in return for supporting Raleigh. After he reached the Oyapock River (French Guiana), Raleigh went ashore at Cayenne for a feast of ro asted mullet and armadillo. Today, it is realized (Hills, 1961) that the legendary Lake Parima sought by Raleigh is actually Lake Amuku, a \"wet weathe r lake\" in the norther n savannas, north of the Kanuku Mountains in Guyana. The lake is intermittently formed by annual inundation of the Rupununi savannas by the adjacent rivers, and is thus a \"disappearing\" lake which exists only at intervals. Raleigh was often c ited as the first person to record in European literature (in 1595) the existence of curare, a paralytic, plant-derived poison used in fishing and hunting by the Amerindians. Cura re causes death by asphyxi ation, the loss of control of muscles essen tial in respiration. The distinction of the first mention of curare in European writings is now accorded to Pi eter Martyr d'Anglera around the year 1500 (McIntyre, 1947; Thomas, 1963). Curare is of two kinds, based either on Strychnos (Loganiaceae) or on plants of Moldenke, 1938; Schultes & Raffauf, 1990). kind known as tube-curare is prepared from several genera (e.g., Chondodendron ) of the moonseed family (Menis extracts of the dextrorotatory form of tubocur arine, a chemical from the bark and leaves, is used in modern medicine as a muscle relaxant for shock treatment of mental illness, and as an adjunct to anaesthesia in heart surgery. The paralyzing effects of curare samples obtained in Peru in 1742 by the French scientist and explorer C.-M. de la Conda mine (1701-1774) were first demonstrated by him in Cayenne, French Guiana, and later in Leiden, Holland (Earles, Surinam plants, Johann C.D. von Schreber in 1783 was the first person to describe precisely which plant species enter into the composition of curare; later, Richard and Robert Schomburgk identified certain plant components of the curare prepared by the Macusi people of Guyana. Ironically, it was not until the explorations of the Schomburgk brothers in the 1830's that th e legendary city of Manoa so diligently sought by Raleigh was finally proved to be non-existent. Numerous medicinal plants are actually multiple-purpose plants which can be employed in several ways at the same time, without invoking the statement by the Puritan divine and clergyman Cotton Mather (1663- 1728), who entreated: \"That which is not useful is vicious.\" In ad dition to being sources of medicine and drugs (herbal preparations), some are also ornamentals and variously used as well for food (fruits, storage roots, stems, leaves), fiber, oil, sh ade providers, fencing material or as living fences, timber, veneer wood, and fuel wood or firewood. The coconut palm ( Cocos nucifera ) is but one good example of a multiple-use medicinal plant of the Guianas. In the old colonial days, some planted tr ees in Georgetown, Guyana were utilized for fire and disease preventi on. The trees lining the streets and avenues were useful in preventing fire from spreading from one house to another. Unlike so me trees of northern climates, certain tropical broa dleaf trees do not ignite unle ss the heat first dries themMedicinal Plants of the Guianas (Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana) vii thoroughly. As for disease preven tion, the planted trees were important agents in draining pools of stagnant water with their roots; stagnant water was the breeding place for mosquitoes transmitting yellow fever, malaria and elephantiasis. In addition to indigenous medicinal plants , the Guianas are home to myriads of medicinal plants introduced from the tropical zones of Central and South America, the West Indies, Africa, Asia, Australia and th e Pacific Islands. Biologically, these plants may be climatically adapted to a seasonali ty whereby in dry seasons the leaves are dropped and flowers are produced; other plants may appear to be continually evergreen (Bernhardt, 1987; Kingdon-Ward, 19 56; Lewis, 1989). This phenomenon is due to their evolutionary adaptation in a particular region, often foreign, where the climatic combination of temperature, rainfall and humid ity may be either some what different than, or the same as, in the Guianas. The answer (a t least partial) to the seeming compatibility or incompatibility of introduced plants in a new region may be sought in the study of homologous habitats or environments in diffe rent regions of the world, as demonstrated by the writings of V.M. Meher-H omji (1964, 1964A, 1965, 1971, 1971A; cf. also Bharucha & Meher-Homji, 1965, and Uichanco, 1969). General information on the diversity and potential of tropical medicinal plants, and the chemical basis of their activity, is contained in the works of Blackwell (1990), Seidl et al. (1995), Kaufman et al. (1999), and Downum et al. (1993). Examples of ethnobotanical studies of medici nal plants utilized by variou s Amerindian tribes in the Guianas include Plotkin (1986, 1994) on the Ti rio and Wayana of Surinam; Tiwari (1999) on the Patamona, the least acculturate d Indians of Guyana; and Grenand et al. (1987) on the Palikur and Wayapi of Fr ench Guiana. Dr. D.G.L. Kingston and collaborators (Kingston et al ., 1999; Yang et al., 1999) have been undertaking laboratory analyses of the potential me dicinal plants of Surinam. LITERATURE CITED Anonymous. 1962.
