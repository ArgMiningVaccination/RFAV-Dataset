Freshen your routine with natural essential oils. Not only do many have great health benefits, but they'll also make you smell amazing. Adding essential oils to your routine can be beneficial in many ways, from nourishing your skin to helping you decompress after a long day. Here are some essential oils you'll want to add not just to your beauty regimen but your entire family's skin care routine as well. If used correctly and safely (consult with a physician, especially if you have sensitive skin), essential oils have many therapeutic benefits. I first learned about these essential oils at a party where a neighbor was selling them. The pleasing scents alone convinced me to invest in not just an entire [starter kit full of oils](https://www.amazon.com/Keychain-Frankincense-Peppermint-Fractionated-Reference/dp/B00TRSJEN0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Young+Living&qid=1565115198&s=beauty&sr=1-2-spons&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=bestnaturaloilsaromatherapy-08122019-20&linkId=bfcea9fe0972f9e7ffb64e76e766fa4b&language=en_US) but an [aromatherapy lamp](https://www.amazon.com/Young-Living-Essential-Ultrasonic-Diffuser/dp/B00TKRQ4OA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Young+Living&qid=1565114287&s=beauty&sr=1-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=bestnaturaloilsaromatherapy-08122019-20&linkId=05b0499145c35c9daeeb482a24e620b2&language=en_US) as well. I soon got hooked on relaxing blends like [Stress Away](https://www.amazon.com/Stress-Away-Young-Living-Essential/dp/B00J4F7W12/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=BPP65YGV7EFA&keywords=young+living+stress+away+essential+oil&qid=1565115247&s=gateway&sprefix=Young+Living+stress,aps,141&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=bestnaturaloilsaromatherapy-08122019-20&linkId=008deffe2417f300e55d7c193b9eab0b&language=en_US). Young Living also sells dietary oils, safe for consumption. These aren't inexpensive\u2014a 15 ml bottle of lavender oil retails for $32\u2014but the brand often offers special deals. Young Living has made a commitment to selling only 100% pure, natural, uncut oils, which it grows on farms around the world. With a full array of proprietary blends such as [Breathe, Cheer and Console,](https://www.amazon.com/doTERRA-Emotional-Aromatherapy-System-Touch/dp/B01M68K644/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=doterra+breathe+cheer+and+exhale&qid=1565117211&s=gateway&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&smid=A30F56XD2WKR4&linkCode=ll1&tag=bestnaturaloilsaromatherapy-08122019-20&linkId=1d1257f7ecde7a9aa52ff1e0eb243944&language=en_US) this brand has many fans. To ensure purity, the company created its own standard, \"CTPG (Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade).\" With a 10 ml lavender roll-on retailing for $20, many will consider these oils a treat, but the company does have a commitment to giving back. The doTERRA Healing Hands Foundation offers tools to raise self-reliance, increase access to health care and fight human trafficking in the communities where it sources the oils.

If you're hitting the mall to beat the heat and get started on holiday shopping early, the myrrh oil blend will get you the spirit. Prices are affordable, with a one-fluid-ounce bottle of lavender oil going for about $11. I suggest this [sampler pack](https://www.amazon.com/Foods-Variety-Moisturizing-Oils-Sampler/dp/B00TIS57MG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&hvadid=312003160299&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11354820919812719316&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1022194&hvtargid=pla-570407626233&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=bestnaturaloilsaromatherapy-08122019-20&linkId=f4c0b3c86c203ad9e6883b4a560830ee&language=en_US) of avocado, jojoba and sweet almond oils\u2014all three you can use on your face as well as your hair and lashes.

The company relies on organic growers and distillers as much as possible, according to the company. It also opts for third-party testing to make sure the oils are pure. Plants are cultivated in the locations where they grow naturally, supporting local farmers. Prices are on the moderate side\u2014a 5 ml bottle of lavender oil is $7\u2014making this brand a good option to try if you're on a budget. With blends like [\"KidSafe\" Germ Destroyer Essential Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Plant-Therapy-Essential-Undiluted-Therapeutic/dp/B005V22SEI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=35F2R11TO4KZ9&keywords=plant+therapy+essential+oils&qid=1565117079&s=gateway&sprefix=Plant+Therapy,aps,168&sr=8-1-spons&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=bestnaturaloilsaromatherapy-08122019-20&linkId=1196e2f9c4908411e0a52f27d2aabf24&language=en_US)\u2014and a variety of CBD products, Plant Therapy will give you plenty of ideas for using essential oils throughout the day.
