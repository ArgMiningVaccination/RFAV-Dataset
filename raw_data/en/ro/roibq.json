The use of natural products (compounds that are derived from natural sources such as plants, animals or micro-organisms) in disease prevention, relief, and treatment has been enormous. Thus, natural products are being regarded as an important source for the development of potential new drugs. Inflammation is the body's first response to injury. Short term inflammation protects the body; however, chronic inflammation is linked to long term pain and damage (such as in arthritis), tissue fibrosis, and cancers. Mechanistically, natural products are known to regulate major pathophysiological processes, including inflammation, fibrosis, hypoxia and oxidative stress, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and metabolism involved in common human diseases. The purpose of this Special Issue of Nutrients is to collect original research articles and reviews on molecular mechanisms of therapeutic effects of natural products in a wide range of human diseases. These may include, but are not limited to, cancers (breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, etc.), inflammatory and fibrotic diseases (such as uterine fibroids, kidney fibrosis, inflammatory pulmonary liver fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, pancreas fibrosis, hypertrophic/keloid scars, scleroderma and systemic sclerosis, and arthritis, etc.).
