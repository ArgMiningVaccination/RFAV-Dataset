Thank you all for your partnership and readership over the last two years! Please continue to read the Hub and other communications channels - such as the Week Ahead newsletter - for COVID-19 updates.

UPDATED: Changes to Policies and Guidelines at BMC COVID-19 case rates continue to decline after the latest surge, and we have seen an uptick in both COVID-19 primary vaccination series and booster doses around Boston. BMC continues to track COVID-19 data, including our staff and patient COVID positivity rates, wastewater data, and the community's total new cases. We use these data to determine safe and appropriate times to modify our current policies in line with escalation plans. Please see below for modifications to existing guidance and policies, which are designed to keep our employees and patients safe while staying in compliance with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), OSHA, and Department of Public Health guidance. Moving forward, any new updates will be shared on the Hub. NEW: Masks No Longer Required in Administrative and Non-Clinical Areas as of March 3 Based on guidance by the CDC, we will no longer require masks in administrative and non-clinical buildings beginning on Thursday, March 3. In addition to all areas in clinical buildings, masks are still required in the following locations: - Cafeterias, unless eating at least six feet away from others - All stairwells and elevators throughout BMCHS buildings when not alone - All work spaces and conference rooms in clinical buildings, including team rooms, charting rooms, and spaces contiguous with clinical spaces. In BU/BMC shared spaces, please continue to follow BU's masking guidance until their mask requirement is lifted on March 7. Anyone can still choose to wear a mask in any area, and masks will continue to be made available to all staff. All staff and LIPs must also continue to follow all [PPE guidance](https://hub.bmc.org/doc/bmccovidppegrid) for patient care - this guidance has not changed. NEW: Visitor Policy Updates Effective as of March 4 BMC will be allowing two visitors at a time for all COVID-negative patients beginning on Friday, March 4. This includes patients in Med/Surg, Pediatrics, Mother Baby, and Ambulatory areas. Moving to two visitors will align BMC with Massachusetts Department of Public Health guidelines, while allowing for distancing in double rooms. Patients in the Emergency Department can generally have one visitor. More than two visitors may be allowed in ICU single rooms and in end-of-life situations, with the permission of the care team. All patients and visitors must continue to wear masks. UPDATED: Employee COVID-19 Testing Moving to 801 Mass Ave. The employee COVID-19 testing site at the Power Plant will close on Monday, March 7. Beginning on this date, employees will be able to get both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 testing at the Crosstown ILI Testing Facility located at 801 Massachusetts Ave. - Testing for employees with symptoms of COVID-19 is available by appointment or walk-in. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, please do not report to work.

REMINDER: COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Workplace Requirement Boston Medical Center is following CDC guidance and requiring all employees and LIPs receive a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This requirement is based on clinical evidence and our collective responsibility to keep our patients and colleagues safe. In order to meet the compliance requirement and maintain employment at BMC, you must receive the COVID-19 booster or an approved exemption by March 28, 2022. Full compliance includes ensuring that your booster vaccination status is recorded in the [Employee Health Portal](https://s2.bl-1.com/h/dp1rk5Bd?url=https://sts.bmc.org/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx?loginToRp=https://webchartnow.com/bmcprod/webchart.cgi).

If you have questions about the booster or want to request an exemption for medical reasons, please email [COVIDVAX@bmc.org](mailto:COVIDVAX@bmc.org). REMINDER: ReCOVer Long COVID-19 Clinic Accepting Patients BMC is accepting referrals to our multi-disciplinary long COVID clinic, designed to care for patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and are still having symptoms at least four weeks after the initial infection. BMC and community health center providers can refer patients to the clinic directly through Epic. Patients can also self-refer by calling the Infectious Diseases Department at 617-414-4290. Currently, the Long COVID Clinic includes infectious disease, pulmonary, behavioral health, cardiology, physical and occupational therapy, and neurology providers. Each patient's care will be directed by the subspecialty that treats their main symptom, or by the Infectious Diseases team if their main symptom does not fit another subspecialty (e.g., fatigue). NEW: BU Undergraduate Shadowing Has Resumed BU undergraduate students are now able to resume shadowing at BMC. All students must meet all requirements, including flu and COVID-19 vaccinations and using proper PPE. In addition, these students must confirm with their preceptors that there is sufficient space in clinic to accommodate an extra person.
