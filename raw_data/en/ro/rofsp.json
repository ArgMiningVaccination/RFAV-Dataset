You can do this by fasting for a day (or four), \"eating\" only clear liquids that include chicken broth. Or you can try the Heavenly Bodies Clinic's legendary Chinese Medicine Detox Soup Recipe. It will fill you up, nourish you, satisfy the five flavors, and get your ready for the next season. Chinese Medicine Detox Soup Recipe - \u00bd C dried barley (sweet, salty) - \u00bd C fox nuts* (bitter) - 6 large green onions (use white and green part although cleansing property is in white only) (pungent) - 1-2 cans of tomatoes (or fresh tomatoes if preferred, or omit if you hate tomatoes) (sweet, sour) - 1 head of bok choy (pungent) - 1 green pepper (pungeant) - 1 celery bunch (salty) - \u00bd C fresh parsley (pungent) - Combine barley and fox nuts in a pan, bring to a boil in 3C water, then simmer, covered, until soft (about 30 minutes). - Chop vegetables (make the pieces quite small) and put in a large pot. - When barley and fox nuts are soft, add them, and their cooking water, to the vegetables.
