[[1]](#cite_note-Gurley_1998-1) E. sinica, known in ( [](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%BA%BB) [](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%BB%83); pinyin: m\u00e1 hu\u00e1ng), has been used in [traditional Chinese medicine](/index.php/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) for 5,000 years for the treatment of [asthma](/index.php/Asthma) and [hay fever](/index.php/Hay_fever), as well as for the [common cold](/index.php/Common_cold). [[2]](#cite_note-Abourashed_2003-2) Several additional species belonging to the [genus](/index.php?title=Genus_(biology)&action=edit&redlink=1) [Ephedra](/index.php/Ephedra_(genus)) have traditionally been used for a variety of medicinal purposes, and are a possible candidate for the [Soma](/index.php/Soma) plant of [Indo-Iranian](/index.php?title=Indo-Iranian&action=edit&redlink=1) religion.

In recent years, the safety of ephedra-containing [dietary supplements](/index.php/Dietary_supplement) has been questioned by the [United States](/index.php/United_States) [Food and Drug Administration](/index.php/Food_and_Drug_Administration) (FDA), the [National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine](/index.php/National_Center_for_Complementary_and_Alternative_Medicine), and the medical community as a result of a high rate of serious side effects and ephedra-related deaths.

[[9]](#cite_note-fdaban-9) A suit by an ephedra manufacturer was upheld by a [Federal District Court](/index.php?title=United_States_district_court&action=edit&redlink=1) judge in [Utah](/index.php?title=Utah&action=edit&redlink=1) on [April 14](/index.php?title=April_14&action=edit&redlink=1) [2005](/index.php?title=2005&action=edit&redlink=1). and on [August 17](/index.php?title=August_17&action=edit&redlink=1) [2006](/index.php?title=2006&action=edit&redlink=1) the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit](/index.php?title=U.S._Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Tenth_Circuit&action=edit&redlink=1) upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra. [[11]](#cite_note-fdaappeal-11) As of June 2007, the sale of ephedra-containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States due to their health risks. Ephedra biochemistry The [alkaloids](/index.php/Alkaloid) [ephedrine](/index.php/Ephedrine) and [pseudoephedrine](/index.php/Pseudoephedrine) are the active constituents of the plant. Pseudoephedrine is used in [over-the-counter](/index.php/Over-the-counter_drug) [decongestants](/index.php/Decongestants). Derivatives of ephedrine are used to treat [low blood pressure](/index.php/Hypotension), but alternatives with reduced cardiovascular risk have replaced it for treating [asthma](/index.php/Asthma). Ephedrine is also considered a [performance-enhancing drug](/index.php?title=Performance-enhancing_drug&action=edit&redlink=1) and is prohibited in most competitive sports. Some species in the Ephedra genus have no alkaloid content and are therefore essentially inert; however, the most commonly used species, E. sinica, has a total alkaloid content of 1-3% by dry weight. Ephedrine constitutes 40-90% of the alkaloid content, with the remainder consisting of pseudoephedrine and the demethylated forms of each compound. [[12]](#cite_note-12) Effects and uses Ephedra is both a [stimulant](/index.php/Stimulant) and a [thermogenic](/index.php/Thermogenic); its biological effects are due to its ephedrine and pseudoephedrine content. [[13]](#cite_note-13) These compounds stimulate the brain, increase [heart rate](/index.php/Heart_rate), constrict blood vessels (increasing [blood pressure](/index.php/Blood_pressure)), and expand bronchial tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an increase in metabolism, evidenced by an increase in body heat. In traditional [Chinese herbology](/index.php/Chinese_herbology), E. sinica is included in many herbal formulas that treat cold and flu such as ma huang tang (ephedra decoction) or ma xing shi gan tang (ephedra, apricot kernel, gypsum, and licorice decoction). Ephedra is used therapeutically as a [diaphoretic](/index.php/Diaphoretic) to help expel exterior pathogens and regulate the proper functioning of the lungs. [[14]](#cite_note-14) Ephedra is widely used by athletes, [[15]](#cite_note-15) despite a lack of evidence that it enhances athletic performance. [[16]](#cite_note-16) [[17]](#cite_note-17) Ephedra may also be used as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of [methamphetamine](/index.php/Methamphetamine). [[18]](#cite_note-18) Ephedra has also been used for weight loss, sometimes in combination with [aspirin](/index.php/Aspirin) and [caffeine](/index.php/Caffeine). Some studies have shown that ephedra, when taken in a regulated and supervised environment, is effective for short-term weight loss, although it is unclear whether such weight loss is maintained. [[19]](#cite_note-19) However, several reports have documented the large number of [adverse events](/index.php/Adverse_event) attributable to unregulated ephedra supplements. [[20]](#cite_note-20) effects](/index.php/Side_effects) of ephedra may include severe dizziness, trembling, [headache](/index.php/Headache), [insomnia](/index.php/Insomnia), profuse are no formal requirements for [standardization](/index.php?title=Standardization&action=edit&redlink=1) or [quality control](/index.php/Quality_control) of dietary supplements in the United States, and the dosage of effective ingredients in supplements may vary widely from brand to brand or batch to batch. [[22]](#cite_note-salon-22) [[23]](#cite_note-23) [[24]](#cite_note-24) Studies of ephedra supplements have found significant discrepancies between the labeled dose and the actual amount of ephedra in the product. Significant variation in ephedrine alkaloid levels, by as much as 10-fold, was seen even from lot to lot within the same brand. [[25]](#cite_note-25) [[26]](#cite_note-26) Safety and regulatory actions in the United States Escalating concerns regarding the safety of ephedra supplements led the FDA to ban the sale of ephedra-containing supplements in the United States in 2004. This ban was challenged by supplement manufacturers and initially overturned, but ultimately upheld. Initial concerns and supplement industry response In 1997, in response to mounting concern over serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ruling that would ban the sale of products containing 8 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and require stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements. The FDA also proposed that ephedra labels should be required to disclose the health risks of ephedra, such as [heart attack](/index.php/Myocardial_infarction), [stroke](/index.php/Stroke), or death. [[27]](#cite_note-27) In response to the proposed ruling, the supplement industry created a [public relations](/index.php?title=Public_relations&action=edit&redlink=1) group (the Ephedra Education Council) to oppose the changes and commissioned a scientific review by a private consulting firm, which reported that ephedra was safe. [[28]](#cite_note-consumerreports-28) The Ephedra Education Council also attempted to block publication of a study confirming wide discrepancies between the labeled potency of supplements and the actual amount of ephedra in the product. [[22]](#cite_note-salon-22) During this time, [Metabolife](/index.php/Metabolife), makers of the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had received over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product; these reports were not provided to the FDA. [[28]](#cite_note-consumerreports-28) [[29]](#cite_note-29) Senators [Orrin Hatch](/index.php?title=Orrin_Hatch&action=edit&redlink=1) and [Tom Harkin](/index.php?title=Tom_Harkin&action=edit&redlink=1), authors of the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act, questioned the scientific basis for the FDA's proposed labeling changes and suggested that the number of problems reported were insufficient to warrant regulatory action. At the time, Hatch's son was working for a firm hired to [lobby](/index.php?title=Lobbying&action=edit&redlink=1) Congress and the FDA on behalf of ephedra manufacturers. [[30]](#cite_note-latimes-30) In addition to the activities of the Ephedra Education Council, Metabolife spent more than $4 million between 1998 and 2000 lobbying against state regulation of ephedra in Texas. [[31]](#cite_note-sciencewolfe-31) [Business Week](/index.php?title=Business_Week&action=edit&redlink=1) reported that efforts to regulate ephedra and other potentially harmful supplements had been \"beaten down by deep-pocketed industry lobbying.\" [[32]](#cite_note-bw-32) Ultimately, in 2000, the FDA withdrew the proposed labeling changes and restrictions. [[33]](#cite_note-33) Additional evidence A review of ephedra-related adverse reactions, published in the [New England Journal of Medicine](/index.php/New_England_Journal_of_Medicine) in 2000, found a number of cases of [sudden cardiac death](/index.php/Sudden_cardiac_death) or severe disability resulting from ephedra use, many of which occurred in young adults using ephedra in the labeled dosages. [[4]](#cite_note-Haller_2000-4) Subsequently, in response to pressure from the [consumer advocacy](/index.php?title=Consumer_advocacy&action=edit&redlink=1) group [Public Citizen](/index.php?title=Public_Citizen&action=edit&redlink=1), [[32]](#cite_note-bw-32) Metabolife was compelled by the [Department of Justice](/index.php?title=United_States_Department_of_Justice&action=edit&redlink=1) in 2002 to turn over reports of over 15,000 ephedra-related adverse events, ranging from [insomnia](/index.php/Insomnia) to death, which the company had previously withheld from the FDA. [[34]](#cite_note-npr2002-34) [[28]](#cite_note-consumerreports-28) Use of ephedra was considered to have possibly contributed to the death of [Minnesota Vikings](/index.php?title=Minnesota_Vikings&action=edit&redlink=1) [offensive lineman](/index.php?title=Offensive_lineman&action=edit&redlink=1) [Korey Bechler](/index.php?title=Steve_Bechler&action=edit&redlink=1), a [pitcher](/index.php?title=Pitcher_(baseball)&action=edit&redlink=1) for the [Baltimore role\" in Bechler's sudden death. [[36]](#cite_note-36) Following Bechler's death, the FDA re-opened its efforts to regulate ephedra use. According to Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the [Center for Science in the Public Interest](/index.php/Center_for_Science_in_the_Public_Interest), \"All of a sudden [after Bechler's death] Congress dropped objections to an ephedra ban and started demanding the FDA act.\" [[28]](#cite_note-consumerreports-28) Senator Orrin Hatch, who in 1999 had helped block the FDA's attempts to regulate ephedra, said in March 2003 that \"...it has been obvious to even the most casual observer that problems exist,\" and called FDA action to regulate ephedra \"long overdue.\" [[30]](#cite_note-latimes-30) Given Hatch's prior defense of ephedra, [Time](/index.php?title=Time_(magazine)&action=edit&redlink=1) magazine described his statement as \"a dazzling display of hypocrisy.\" [[37]](#cite_note-37) Ephedra banned In response to renewed calls for the regulation of ephedra, the FDA commissioned a large [meta-analysis](/index.php/Meta-analysis) of ephedra's safety and efficacy by the [RAND Corporation](/index.php?title=RAND_Corporation&action=edit&redlink=1). This study found that while ephedra promoted modest short-term weight loss, there was no evidence that it was effective for long-term weight loss or performance enhancement. The use of ephedra in this study was associated with significant gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and [autonomic](/index.php/Autonomic_nervous_system) side effects. [[38]](#cite_note-rand-38) Almost simultaneously, a study in [Annals of Internal Medicine](/index.php/Annals_of_Internal_Medicine) found that ephedra was 100 to 700 times more likely to cause a significant adverse reaction compared to other commonly used supplements such as [kava](/index.php/Kava) or [Ginkgo biloba](/index.php/Ginkgo_biloba). [[5]](#cite_note-Bent_2003-5) issued a [press release](/index.php?title=Press_release&action=edit&redlink=1) recommending that consumers stop buying and using ephedra, and indicating its intention to ban the sale of ephedra-containing supplements. [[39]](#cite_note-39) Subsequently, on [April 12](/index.php?title=April_12&action=edit&redlink=1) [2004](/index.php?title=2004&action=edit&redlink=1), the FDA issued a final rule banning the sale of ephedra-containing dietary supplements. [Tommy Thompson](/index.php?title=Tommy_Thompson&action=edit&redlink=1), the [Secretary of Health and Human Services](/index.php/Secretary_of_Health_and_Human_Services), stated that \"...These products pose unacceptable health risks, and any consumers who are still using them should stop immediately.\" [[9]](#cite_note-fdaban-9) Legal challenges Nutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in [Park City, Utah](/index.php?title=Park_City,_Utah&action=edit&redlink=1), challenged the legality of the FDA's ban of ephedra as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that they did not intend to start marketing ephedra, but were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah [Federal District Court](/index.php?title=Federal_District_Court&action=edit&redlink=1) ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be [unethical](/index.php/Medical_ethics). Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States. [[40]](#cite_note-nytimes-40) The ruling was appealed to the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit](/index.php?title=U.S._Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Tenth_Circuit&action=edit&redlink=1) in [Denver, Colorado](/index.php?title=Denver,_Colorado&action=edit&redlink=1). On [August 17](/index.php?title=August_17&action=edit&redlink=1) [2006](/index.php?title=2006&action=edit&redlink=1), the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra, finding that the 133,000-page administrative record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra posed an unreasonable risk to consumers. [[11]](#cite_note-fdaappeal-11) Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a [writ of certiorari](/index.php?title=Writ_of_certiorari&action=edit&redlink=1) seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra; however, on [May 14](/index.php?title=May_14&action=edit&redlink=1) [2007](/index.php?title=2007&action=edit&redlink=1) the [United States Supreme Court](/index.php?title=United_States_Supreme_Court&action=edit&redlink=1) declined to hear this petition. The sale of ephedra-containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States due to their health risks. [[7]](#cite_note-fdamain-7) Use in sports Ephedrine is listed as a [banned substance](/index.php/Doping_(sport)) by both Olympic Agency](/index.php/World_Anti-Doping_Agency). [[41]](#cite_note-41) [National Football League](/index.php?title=National_Football_League&action=edit&redlink=1) banned players from using ephedra as a dietary supplement in 2001 after the death of [Minnesota Vikings](/index.php?title=Minnesota_Vikings&action=edit&redlink=1) [offensive tackle](/index.php?title=Offensive_tackle&action=edit&redlink=1) [Korey Stringer](/index.php?title=Korey_Stringer&action=edit&redlink=1); ephedra was found in Stringer's locker and was believed to have contributed to his death. [[35]](#cite_note-stringer-35) [[42]](#cite_note-sauerbrun-42) The substance is also banned by the [National Basketball Association](/index.php?title=National_Basketball_Association&action=edit&redlink=1). [[40]](#cite_note-nytimes-40) Nonetheless, ephedra remains widely used by athletes; a 2006 survey of collegiate hockey players found that nearly half had used ephedra in the belief it would enhance athletic performance. [[43]](#cite_note-43) Prominent cases of ephedra use In the 1994 [FIFA World Cup](/index.php?title=Football_World_Cup&action=edit&redlink=1), the [Noriyuki Haga](/index.php?title=Noriyuki_Haga&action=edit&redlink=1) tested positive for it in 2000, being disqualified from two races and banned from two more as a result. [[45]](#cite_note-45) NFL [punter](/index.php?title=Punter_(football_position)&action=edit&redlink=1) [Todd Sauerbrun](/index.php?title=Todd_Sauerbrun&action=edit&redlink=1) of the [Denver Broncos](/index.php?title=Denver_Broncos&action=edit&redlink=1) was suspended for the first month of the 2006 season after testing positive for ephedra.
