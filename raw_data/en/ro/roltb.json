Go to eviama.com for the service menu and blog, or call 215.545.3344. Penny, tell us about our topic for today. Penny Jill, so nice to be speaking with you again, we are going to talk about something we all love and understand to be very special - Roses. The Damascena rose is used widely in Dr. Hauschka products for face and body, and I have lots to share with you about that. But almost everyone has favorable feelings and associations with roses. The fragrance is delicate and powerful at the same time. We actually feel a lift when we see a rose garden or a stand-out rose bush. Growers may spend a lifetime developing hybrids and creating gardens that feature the many varieties of roses. And I think everyone loves to see roses in bloom, as they are now in many parts of the northern hemisphere. What's the rose report in your neck of the woods, Jill? Jill N. There are roses in my yard. When my mother died, a friend gave me a rose bush which we planted in the front yard...and l do think of my mother whenever I see it, and especially when it's blooming, which it is right now. Let me ask you Penny, do you have a favorite color of rose? Penny Oh that's a tough one. My grandmother loved deep red roses but l favor the ones that are tinged pink. Jill N. Me too! I love the pinks and even the white ones... Penny This is what is so special about roses. They always hold some special meaning for us. We have a common reverence for roses. It is universal. Let's talk more about what makes roses special for health and skincare. Did you know that the rose is incredibly complex and multifaceted? There are over 400 constituents in the damask rose. Imagine! That will pique the interest of listeners who are chemists and scientists out there. The rose is rich in flavonoids, polyphenols, antioxidants, tannins, precious lipids (oils) and waxes. Okay - the first item on our list of amazing rose components: Flavonoids are bioactive compounds that help regulate cellular activity and fight off free radicals that cause oxidative stress on your body. To put it in plain language - flavonoids help to make body function more efficient, while protecting it against everyday toxins and stressors. Flavonoids are also powerful anti-inflammatory agent. Importantly, flavonoids strengthen capillaries, and belong to our second category - Anti-oxidants. Antioxidants and polyphenols are prevalent in roses, and this is important because they counter the activity of free radicals that actually do damage to cells, so we want to prevent that. Jill N. Let me ask, for our listeners, please explain what are free radicals and what do they do? Penny To simplify, free radicals are unstable molecules; too many free radicals in the body cause oxidative stress, cellular damage and premature aging. It's the same process as metal rusting, that's a common metaphor. Free radicals come from the environment, as in tobacco smoke or pollution, but free radicals also occur as part of normal biological processes in the body as well. For example, exercise generates free radicals. The good news is if we eat plenty of plants then we are in effect continually restocking our body's supply of antioxidants - this mitigates and repairs damage caused by free radicals. Think dark colored berries, bright green leaves and the whole rainbow of plant foods. The bad news is, the foods that we love, including highly processed foods like doughnuts and other refined sweets, processed meats and deep fried foods are lacking antioxidants so contribute nothing positive to the balance of cellular damage vs. repair. Not only are these foods devoid of beneficial compounds, in and of themselves they create more free radical cellular injury. So this weekend when you are barbecuing and grilling, be sure to eat lots of greens! Jill N. Oh no! I am sorry I asked! Penny Well, better to be informed, right? That's why we need to know roses have specialized help for us in our skincare to combat oxidative stress. Just remember, all things in moderation, with lots of colorful plants in your diet! Our conversation two weeks ago shed light on consuming the foods high in antioxidants to help counter damage from the sun and protect the integrity of all our cells. That's why using skincare that has a variety of antioxidants built in is significant to our conversation today. This morning we are talking about roses, their benefits for our skin, and how the complex constituents of roses can serve us to have more supple, dewy, resilient skin. We just reviewed antioxidants, polyphenols and flavonoids that are present in roses. Quickly, I want to talk about two more important beneficial components of the rose. Roses are rich in tannins which are astringent - so think toning and firming. They are also anti inflammatory, so think, good for reducing redness or discomfort at the surface of the skin. Lastly, the rose is rich in lipids - think that buttery, waxy feel of a rose petal, and how protective it is of that petal - and how it keeps the rose petal moist inside even in the bright sun - which of course, roses thrive in. Jill N. This is like Roses 101 for body and soul! Somehow, l feel you have a lot more information for us, but we are set to take a break now. For those of you just joining us, we are here with Penny Ordway, founder of eviama life in Philadelphia, the region's first green, holistic spa. The website is eviama.com and eviama's phone is 215.545.3344. Facebook, twitter and Instagram @eviamalifespa. BREAK Jill N. Listeners, we are back with Penny Ordway, a remarkable woman who has been sharing her knowledge with us throughout this spring. Penny is the founder of eviama life spa in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, where the focus is on organic, sustainable skincare, effective therapeutic massage and bodywork, and mind-body healing with Reiki, Maya Spiritual Healing, and so much more. Call 215 545 3344, or check out the website at eviama.com. We are talking about how roses benefit our skin. Who knew? Penny Yes, you may have heard of a grandmother or great grandmother using rose water to cleanse and enliven her face. This is very old beauty wisdom. In the Middle East, there is a tradition of drinking rose petal tea and adding rosewater to pudding. Years ago at the Frog/Commissary restaurant group in Philadelphia, I remember Master Baker Orr made the most amazing rosewater cheesecake. Even wild animals like white-tail deer, elk and moose eat rose flowers, and bears and birds eat the rose hips, or fruit - on the East coast here in the US when you go to the beach, you may see these red bulbous fruit on the beach rose bushes! Even the animals know what is good for them. In Ayurvedic health tradition, pulverized dried rose petals are used in preparations for the skin. So the fact that Dr. Hauschka has chosen rose for its main ally in producing formulas for health and beauty that support and protect the skin is no surprise. I want to emphasize the mission of Dr. Hauschka is to heal the earth and to heal humankind, and remember, the company started producing medicines about 90 years ago. This plays out in the story of the cultivation of the damask rose. Dr. Hauschka's mission is evident in the way they support cultivation and procure organic and biodynamic rose products. Their foundation supports long term, sustainable growing projects in Romania, Ethiopia, Turkey, Afghanistan and Iran. The people who do the farming are treated fairly and paid fairly. At the site of cultivation, roses go from harvest directly to steam distillation, so great care is taken in the process to keep the transformative properties of the rose at peak power. When Dr. Hauschka receives this precious essential oil from all over the world, it is carefully blended together - which creates a synergy unmatched in the world of medicine and personal care products when combined with their unique rhythmical processing. Jill N. This sounds really significant to me. So much thought goes into this! Penny That's why I always have something wonderful to say about Dr. Hauschka. Let me tell you about the many gifts the Damascena rose provides. That is the rose found in Dr Hauschka formulas, and we'll talk about those products too, if time allows. There is of course, steam distilled rose damascena flower oil or rose essential oil; some may know it as Attar of Rose, and it is considered more precious than gold. Its aroma is uplifting, nurturing and it has all the benefits for the skin we have talked about here. It is also a natural preservative, used widely in Dr. Hauschka. To make that essential oil, the flowers are placed in pure water, heated and the essential oil is drawn out. What remains is the water or distillate itself, a wonderful by-product with water soluble components. This is rose water or hydrosol, very hydrating and soothing as you would expect. The rose damascena also provides the rose flower wax, a waxy by product that lends the feeling like that of a rose petal, soft, supple, protective, providing a barrier for your skin. You can see why this waxy substance would be important in making a formula for dry or mature skin. That needs extra protection. Then there are two more substances, the latter of which comes from the rose garden at the site in Germany where Dr. Hauschka is produced. There is Damascena flower extract which is made placing dry rose blossoms in warm organic sunflower oil, capturing the rose oily extract that goes through the rhythmical process unique to Hauschka, where it is exposed to light, warmth and motion during the day and at night, stillness, cool and dark. There's more to this magical rhythmical process, as I have said before, but the oily rose extract that is derived is full of life. Hauschka has something called the Mother Substance, which is from the original process Dr. Rudolf Hauschka developed in May of 1929, when roses were plentiful and in full bloom. He made a watery rose extraction that he applied to medicines he made then, and this thread continues to this day - and is tied to the damascena rose which became the basis for the Hauschka skincare used all over the world now. This Mother Substance is the basis for the Sensitive Care Conditioner and Night Conditioner which are 30 day treatments. These 30 ampules look like water, but they are meant to restore rhythm and balanced function to your skin, gently, powerfully. These are recommended to be used seasonally or in times of change or upheaval - moving house, starting college, marriage, career change, birth of a child, etc. Jill N. Telling us about the origins of rose use in Dr. Hauschka, all the way back to 1929, that gives me the idea that these products are so well thought out, so well developed - it's never been about marketing. It's always been about what healing properties the line has for us. Penny You are right. The thinking and the faith that nature, in its rhythmic cycles, had power and significance to provide so many answers for our needs. And how things are grown and harvested and processed really matter if we are to benefit from the life force so abundant in nature. So to get the benefits of the damascena rose, look to these daily formulas: Soothing Day Lotion is a new product, which has a light fluid texture, easily absorbed; always use during the day after applying Facial Toner. It features the rose, rose hip, and borage. You might like this formula if your skin shows redness or irritation, enlarged capillaries, dehydration and want a light formula. Rose Day Cream Light is perfect for normal skin that wants a little more richness, needs a bit more moisture support, but it also serves skin experiencing enlarged capillaries, redness and discomfort. It is nurturing, with rose water, rose wax and oily extract, Mother Substance, rose hip and anthyllis. Rose Day Cream is Dr. Hauschka's world wide favorite, the number one seller, with essentially 35 roses in each tube. KThis is the richest, buttery-est formula that provides an excellent cocooning barrier, very rich in plant waxes and butters, the rose wax and essential oil, rose flower water, the Mother Substance, St John'swort and shea butter. All this adds up to a rich, moist, dewy look for your skin. People who suffer with rosacea find this product extremely helpful. I have used this product for more than 20 years. It still serves my mature, dry skin and feels especially protective on cold wintery days. I feel radiant each time I apply it. Jill N. That sounds like a product l would love to try. . . Does it have SPF? Penny Ah, no, there is a saying in natural skincare that if you have sunscreen and moisturizer in one product, it's doing neither function well. Best to apply sunscreen on top of your day cream. But! Wait! There's something that works nicely to boost the efficacy of Rose Day Cream - and most moisturizers, actually - it's... Firming Mask which is a multi-tasker. You can use it as a weekly mask treatment to add resilience and elasticity, but for daily use, once you have applied Facial Toner, you can apply a thin layer under your moisturizer . It is lightweight, easily absorbed, and firming mask provides that pick me up, an instant glow - really helpful when you see a change in the radiance of your skin or need to enhance moisture. This magic formula has rose water and wax, the oily extract of the damask rose, as well as marshmallow, mango butter, and I would say can be especially helpful when applied around eyes, mouth, neck and decollete. Other face care containing gifts of the Rose? The LipCare Stick, Daily Hydrating Eye Cream, original Regenerating Day Cream and RDC Complexion, as well as the Regenerating Day Cream Intensive which will help aging skin that is drier and needs extra support. Jill N. Okay. I like this! What about these rose rich formulas for the body? I want more! Penny Right on time, Jill...The next items are for body care. It seems that here in the States, we do not have the same fondness for baths and bath culture that is so prevalent in Europe - baths are seen as therapeutic for body mind and spirit on the continent, and of course, with any Dr. Hauschka Bath essence, that is pretty much a guarantee. But if you do subscribe to bath culture, and want to immerse yourself in the benefits of rose, you must try the Dr. H Rose Nurturing Bath Essence. The aroma, the silky feel of the water, it feels luxurious and calming. You may also use a few drops of the Rose Bath Essence in the water you wash your face with; this too feels sublime and can give your skin and your mood a lift, a gentle nudge to remember how dear life is, and how beautiful your skin can feel. (As an aside, for rosacea diagnosed skin - do all you can with the rose - wash with Rose Bath, use Sensitive Cars Conditioner in place of toner for 30 days, apply a thin layer of Firming Mask or Soothing Mask, and apply Rose Day Cream or Rose Day Cream Light.) The Rose Nurturing Body Cream is a rich creamy formula with the rose essential oil and the oily extract. It is soothing to the skin, protective, and the fragrance is so subtle you can use it over limbs and torso, and gift yourself an all day aromatherapy treatment while you moisturize your skin with the heavenly scent of the damask rose. One of my favorite oils to use in massage is the Dr.H Rose Nurturing Body Oil. This contains that oily extract of Damascena rose - it is soothing, toning, and imparts a sense of well being. It does feel nurturing - something every Mom, every essential worker has needed and deserved throughout this pandemic cycle, and in our recovery from it. In ancient Sufi wisdom, rose was seen as an ally in medicine - particularly for nervous tension and to ease digestion. As we said at the start, the connection to roses runs deep in so many cultures. Jewish culture just celebrated Shavuot, a festival of roses. Rose petals are used in the complex spice blends known as Ras El Hanout from North Africa and Baharat from Israel. Recipes may combine cardamom, dates and rose petals, and the impulse to create with rose ingredients seems endless and universal where roses proliferate. There is a fabulous quote from the poetry of Rumi: \"Come out here where the roses have opened. Let the soul and world meet.\" I think that is what happens when a company like Hauschka brings us such healing, nurturing, nutritive formulas made with a true ally from nature, the rose. It's possible to connect and lift up the soul with an act as simple as applying rose rich moisturizer made with reverence, and overall plant wisdom an. It is the embodiment of spirit and nature meeting us on the physical plane. A very beneficial meeting for us. Jill N. We are so out of time!
