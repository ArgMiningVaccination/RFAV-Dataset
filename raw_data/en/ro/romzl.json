People of all kinds join us on their spiritual path to share in a mutually respectful healing environment. Most contemporary healing is done in conversation or energetically in silence with your therapist. During Gong Meditation and Sound Healing Ceremonies we add the healing power of sound to create shifts in consciousness that invite creative solutions to everyday challenges. Sound has been used for healing for thousands of years, and for good reason. Sound intentionally used for healing creates energy, frequency, and vibrations that invite effects to help you: - SHAKE off stress - Have FUN - Open your VOICE & HEART to LOVE - Explore ENERGY - Improve your vibe - Let go & RELAX - HEAL old stories - RESET your course - Experience connection Along with sound healing, some of the following elements - movement, meditation, storytelling, breath work, journaling, paired and group sharing, ritual, true voice process, relaxation, shamanic journeying and gratitude - can come together to help you shift any area of your life. You'll find that no matter what kind of person you see yourself as... ... you'll be meditating sooner than you know it... ... because each process is designed to bring you \"out of your head\" and into your senses... ... where you'll find yourself learning, healing, relaxing deeply and having fun in an interesting, supportive environment. Join us in community to experience sound healing for yourself.
