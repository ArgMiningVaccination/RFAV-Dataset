FAUCI: One of the things that's clear from the data [is] that even though vaccines - because of the high degree of transmissibility of this virus - don't protect overly well, as it were, against infection, they protect quite well against severe disease leading to [hospitalization and death](https://www.foxnews.com/health/covid-deaths-counties-lower-internet). And I believe that's the reason, Neil, why at my age, being vaccinated and boosted, even though it didn't protect me against infection, I feel confident that it made a major role in protecting me from progressing to severe disease. And that's very likely why I had a relatively mild course. So my message to people who seem confused because people who are [vaccinated get infected](https://www.foxnews.com/health/mental-health-issues-may-lead-higher-risk-covid-19-breakthrough-cases-study-finds) - the answer is if you weren't vaccinated, the likelihood [is] you would have had [a] more severe course than you did have when you were vaccinated.
