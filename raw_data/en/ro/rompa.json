Previously, it has also been linked with better disease-specific survival in patients with ovarian, cervical, and endometrial cancer. Therefore, the CD103 molecule appeared to us as an attractive biomarker for non-invasive immune PET imaging of T cell infiltration. We developed zirconium-89 (89Zr) and gallium-68 (68Ga) radiolabeled Fab fragment (Fab) clone that specifically recognize human CD103 in vitro and in vivo. We tested tracers in nude mice (BALB/cOlaHsd-Foxn1nu) with established CD103 expressing CHO or CHO wild-type xenografts. In vivo, both 89Zr- and 68Ga-anti-human CD103 tracers showed high target-to-background ratios, high target site selectivity and a high sensitivity in human CD103 positive xenografts. We developed two novel human CD103 immuno-PET tracers for future non-invasive assessment of cancer reactive T cell infiltration. Consequently, both 89Zr and 68Ga-anti-CD103 Fab fragment-based PET tracer could be successfully used in clinical settings for stratification patients who could benefit from immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. KEYWORDS CD103, immune checkpoint inhibition, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, biomarker, Fab fragment, PET, Zirconium-89, Gallium-68 230 INTRODUCTION Following William B. Coleys discovery about immune system ability to reject human tumors, cancer immunology has developed immensely for the last century.1 Notably in the past decade, cancer immunotherapy has certainly revolutionized the field of immunology, oncology and patient care. The mode of action behind this form of treatment relies on generating or augmenting adaptive immune responses against antigens preferentially or selectively expressed in cancer cells.2 This is best exemplified by monoclonal antibodies therapies that block the immune checkpoint programmed death-1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) and their exquisite responses of patients with a high mutation burden.3-5 Nevertheless, on average only ~15-20% of patients respond to immune checkpoint therapies. In order to increase success rate and availability of immunotherapy to more patients, approximately 2000 (combination) immunotherapy trials have now been initiated across different malignancies. However, monoclonal antibody treatment is very costly, reaching an annual price of $100,000 in the US only,6 and brings several side effects, from mild symptoms such as dry mouth and rash, through autoimmunological diseases such as hypophysitis, hypothyroidism or arthralgia, to immune-related hepatitis and pneumonitis.7,21 Considering the cost, side effects and variety of treatment options, early response biomarkers that can guide treatment decision making are urgently needed.9-14 One of the indications of successful immunotherapy across tumor types is an increase in the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).5,12,15-17 TILs capacity in tumor lesions is correlated with greater immunological response, therefore, it represents an attractive biomarker for monitoring immunotherapy. However, not every T cell within a tumor is involved in the anti-cancer immune response.18-23 In recent years, we and others have refined the definition of cancer-reactive TILs. Across different T-lymphocytes phenotypes, tissue-resident memory-like cells have emerged as a subset with a prognostic value across different malignancies. These noncirculating memory T cells (TRM-like cells) are linked to an integrated immune response and a favorable outcome of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in patients.18-37 Primary cell surface markers of CD8+ TRM-like cells is the E subunit of the E7 integrin complex. Commonly known as CD103 molecule, this integrin mediates retention of lymphocytes in peripheral tissues by binding to E-cadherin expressed on epithelial cells.19,23,38,39 Recent work has shown that in melanoma, lung and esophageal cancer patients, the number of CD103+ TILs was significantly increased during immunotherapy in responding lesions in comparison to lesions of treatment-naive patients and non-responders.26-28,40-42 Thus, CD103 is an interesting biomarker for assessment of cancer reactive T cell infiltration. The current standard for determination of CD103+ cell infiltration is immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) on tissue biopsies. However, the biopsy-based technique approach has various disadvantages. Among those shortcomings are tumor heterogeneity within and between lesions, poor accessibility of lesions, and sampling errors. In order to obtain accurate information about CD103+ TRM load in all tumor lesions, noninvasive whole-body imaging techniques can be applied. The most fitting for clinical setting is positron emission tomography (PET), a diagnostic tool for functional/molecular imaging. PET offers high sensitivity, fast imaging time and requires small amounts of used molecular probe in comparison to other imaging techniques.43 Moreover, PET allows for repetitive and non-invasive clinical assessment.44-52 The possibility of imaging signal quantification is 231 ideally suited for determining whole-body TRM load using radiolabeled antibody fragments (Fabs). For monoclonal antibodies, zirconium-89 (89Zr; t1/2 = 78.4 hours) is a suitable isotope for radiolabeling, as its physical half-life matches the time mAbs require for optimal target-to-background signals. In case of antibodies fragments, radioisotopes with shorter half-life time could also be applicable, since Fabs are smaller in size, and thus having shorter biodistribution time.53,54 An alternative radioisotope that was successfully used in the past for antibody-based tracers labeling is gallium-68 (68Ga; t1/2 = 67.7 minutes).55,108 a first-in-human PET imaging study with 89Zr-labeled atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) showed dependency of tracer uptake in response to atezolizumab treatment.58 Non-invasive PET imaging of T cells has also been described in mouse models and clinical trials using markers such as CD3, CD8 and PD-1.58-5861 Hence, the concept of visualizing T cells is feasible and can be advantageous in the near future. Imaging CD103 may have advantages over these currently pursued strategies such as a peripherally restricted biodistribution and increased specificity for cancer-reactive TILs. Here, we generated 89Zr- and 68Ga-labeled Fab clones that specifically recognize human CD103 for non-invasive immune imaging of T cell infiltration in human cancers as potential biomarker for effective anti-cancer immune responses. 232 RESULTS Generation of human CD103 specific Fab fragment Previously we developed mAb candidates that target hCD103 and upon examination we selected the most promising one (citation to mAb paper). Clone 01A has shown strong binding to the CD103+ CD8+ T cell subpopulation in tumor digests, non-overlapping binding epitopes and differential CD103 blocking properties. Therefore, from this clone we generated Fab fragment. Production included synthetic vectors encoding for the DNA sequences of the VH and VL domains of this candidate, cloning into human IgG1-Fab-K vector and human kappa light chain vector, followed by transfection of HEK293 cells, and Fab fragment purification. Fab fragment targeting hCD103 was tested for binding to CD103+ CD8+ T cell subpopulation in tumor digests and remained its affinity (data not shown). CD103 Fab N-suc-Df conjugation Radiolabeling of hCD103.Fab01A was possible using the chelator TFP-N-Suc-Df-Fe, which was achieved as shown below (Figure 1A). Conjugation was performed as previously described using 1:4 molar excess of TFP-N-Suc-Df-Fe, followed by Fe3+ transchelation using EDTA. Final protein-to-chelator ratio was established, by quantification of area under the peak (at 430 nm UV length) corresponding to hCD103.Fab01 retention time. Fe3+ removal was assessed to be 89.1% and protein-to-chelator ratio 1:2.6 (Figure radiolabeling reaction scheme. Left panel chromatograms of unpurified reaction mixtures (Fab and TFP-N-Suc-desferal-Fe chelator) and right panel - purified Fab by vivaspin SE-UPLC chromatograms of hCD103.Fab01A conjugated TFP-N-Suc-desferal-Fe using at (protein) and 430 nm (Fe3+). 89Zr- and 68Ga-hCD103.Fab01A radiolabeling and in vitro stability Zirconium-89 labeling to hCD103.Fab01-N-suc-Df was performed using standard protocol and radiochemical purity (RCP) was assessed using TCA assay. Previous work has shown that the optimal ratio between activity and amount of protein was the 300 MBq 89Zr/mg hCD103-N-suc-Df (cite mAb article). Standardly 1h of labeling was sufficient to obtain RCP > 95%, however, if the desired purity was not reached, reaction was left to proceed longer. Gallium-68 labeling to hCD103.Fab01-N-suc-Df was done according to the publication of Oroujeni M. et al (2018). Protocol was modified and optimized in the following way. Due to the fragile nature of Fab fragment labeling temperature remained 25 \u00b0C. Recommended sodium acetate buffer did not yield in radiolabeled product (data not shown), therefore it has been switched to HEPES buffer, which yielded in conversion over 90%. Conversion was measured by iTLC, where radiolabeled Fab fragment retained on the start, and unlabeled 68Ga was complexed by citric acid and run to the front of iTLC (Supplementary Figure 1B). Ratio between activity and amount of hCD103.Fab01-N-suc-Df was also investigated and determined to be the best at 1300 MBq 68Ga/mg hCD103-N-suc-Df (Supplementary Figure 1C). Repeated labeling gave optimal timepoint of 15 min. reaction time 234 (Supplementary Figure 1A). If purification was needed (RCP <90%), miniPD-10 desalting column was used. Due to protein retention on the column new concentration was determined by UPLC (Supplementary Figure 1D). Table 1.

After the radiolabeling, in vitro stability test of hCD103.Fab01-N-suc-Df labeled with gallium-68 and zirconium-89 at RT was performed in PBS, serum and in the presence of 1000-fold molar excess of EDTA. As determined by iTLC, the results of the in vitro stability test demonstrated that 89Zr- and 68Ga-hCD103.Fab01-N-suc-Df are stable in PBS, serum and under EDTA challenge for 4 hours in case of 68Ga-labeled product (mean = 99%, 100%, 96% respectively) (Figure 2A) and up to 24 hours for 89Zr (mean = 97%, 100%, 94% respectively) (Figure 2B).

Effect of chelation on binding affinity was examined using cell based ELISA and it has shown slight decrease in binding of hCD103.Fab01 vs N-suc-Df-hCD103.Fab01 conjugate (EC50: 68Ga- and 89Zr-hCD103.Fab01A, 235 exhibited specific binding to CHO.CD103 cells. Some unspecific binding to CHO.K1 cells was observed in higher concentrations of tested tracer, therefore, we conducted blocking studies. Test with CHO.CD103 and CHO.CD103 preincubated with commercially available hCD103 mAb proved that both tracers bind specifically to CD103 molecule. Figure 3. Specificity of developed tracer.

Blocking assay with 68Ga-hCD103.Fab01 (D) and cells cells blocked with commercially available anti-CD103 mAb. was measured using a 68Ga-hCD103.Fab tracer Fab01A PET imaging in male nude mice (BALB/cOlaHsd-Foxn1nu) were subcutaneously CHO.CD103 or CHO.K1 in the shoulder/neck area. Xenografts were allowed to grow to at least 200 mm3. Both CHO.K1 and CD103 transfected CHO.K1 cell line grew steadily in vivo (Supplementary Figure 2A) and maintained CD103 expression ex vivo, as shown by immunohistochemical staining (Supplementary Figure 2B). For microPET imaging, xenograft-bearing mice (n at least 3 per group) were injected intravenously via the penile vein with 89Zr- hCD103.Fab01A (8.6 \u00b1 g, 2.8 \u00b1 0.2 MBq) 68Ga-hCD103.Fab01A (7.1 1.0 MBq). For 89Zr- hCD103.Fab01A, microPET scans were made 3, 6 and 24 hours post injection. Timepoints were determined based on previous research with mAb (mAb paper citation), where 24 hours was the earliest MicroPET scan time. Due to smaller size of Fab fragment in comparison to monoclonal antibody, and therefore shorter biodistribution time, 3 and 6 hours were also examined. For 68Ga-hCD103.Fab01A, MicroPET scans was only made 3 hours post injection due to the short half-life time of the 68Ga. PET scans of CHO.CD103 tumor bearing mice with 68Ga-hCD103.Fab01 has shown a tumor uptake when compared with control group (CHO.K1 tumor bearing mice), which was further proven by SUVmean quantification (SUVmean (tumor to heart ratio) mean: 0.83 = 2.4; Figure 4A). vivo biodistribution analysis after 3 hours showed higher 68Ga-hCD103.Fab01 specific tumor uptake for CHO.CD103 in comparison with CHO.K1 (mean: 5.4 vs 3.7 %ID/g; p = 0.0571; d 1.2; Figure 4C). Tumor-to-blood ratio of 68Ga-hCD103.Fab01A in CHO.CD103 was higher than in the control group, but not significant (mean: 0.9 vs 0.8, p=0.4857; d = 1.2; Figure 4C). PET scans of CHO.CD103 tumor bearing mice with 89Zr-hCD103.Fab01 has already shown uptake in CD103+ tumor 3 hours post injection, however it was not significant (mean: for tumor 0.40 SUVmean, for blood 0.20 SUVmean; p=0.2004; d = 2.0). Highest signal to noise ratio was achieved 6 hour post injection (mean: for tumor 0.38 SUVmean, for blood 0.17 SUVmean; p=0.0267; d = 3.7) and continued 24 hour post injection (mean: for tumor 0.25 SUVmean, for blood 0.10 SUVmean; p=0.0407; d = 3.2) (Figure 4B). In control group 89Zr- hCD103.Fab01 has shown no specific uptake in CHO.K1 xenografts even after 24h (mean: for 0.09 SUVmean; ns). Ex vivo biodistribution analysis on 24 hours has shown significantly higher 89Zr-hCD103.Fab01 specific tumor uptake for CD103+ than in CD103- tumor (mean: 2.1 vs 0.9 Figure 4D). Tumor-to-blood ratio of 89Zr-hCD103.Fab01 for CD103+ tumor was also significantly higher than for control group (mean: 11.7 vs. 4.6; p=0.0317; Figure 4D). To be able to compare those two tracers, an additional group was added - 89Zr-hCD103.Fab01 ex vivo biodistribution study 3 hours p.i. (n=3). Although remained activity and injected amount of protein was similar (2.8 \u00b1 0.2 vs 1.3 \u00b1 0.7 MBq d.c., and 8.6 \u00b1 0.4 vs 7.1 \u00b1 0.6 g), 89Zr- and 68Ga-hCD103.Fab01 demonstrated different uptake in CD103+ tumor (mean: 2.2 vs 5.4 %ID/g; p=0.0571; Figure 4E), which could be contributed to different radioisotopic properties of those tracers. 237 Both, the PET scan images and ex vivo biodistribution data has indicated renal clearance of 68Ga- and 89Zr-radiolabeled tracer, since higher uptake in kidney, urine and bladder was observed (Figure 4F-G). Correlation between high uptake in kidney and renal excretion was later proved by immunohistochemical staining that was negative for CD103 (Supplementary Figure 2B). 238 Figure 4.

In vitro, we leveraged a previously developed high- affinity anti-CD103 mAb clone to generate a Fab with high single-arm binding affinity. Next, we compared [68Ga]Ga- and [89Zr]Zr-labeled Fabs for anti-CD103 immuno-PET and demonstrated that this approach can be used to visualize CD103-postive cells with high target-to-background ratios, high target site selectivity and a high sensitivity in hCD103-positive xenografts. To date, PET imaging of T cells has been described in preclinical models targeting T cell surface markers CD3, CD4 and CD8, and uptake was correlated with response to immunotherapy (49,62,63). In clinical trials, anti-CD8 imaging agents are under investigation examining patients before, during and after treatment with checkpoint inhibitors (NCT04029181, NCT03802123). However, recent meta-analysis of tumors responding to immune checkpoint blockade have highlighted a stronger association between CD103+ TRM infiltration and outcome, than for CD3 or CD8 T cells. These analyses are further supported by on-treatment analysis of immune checkpoint blockade-treated tumors in both clinical and pre-clinical samples, demonstrating a significant expansion of CD103+ TRM cells, as well as a functional profile for these cells associated with anti-tumor effector functions. As such, CD103+ TRM cells represent an interesting biomarker for evaluating responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and potentially discriminate responding vs. non-responding patients, by comparing pre- and on-treatment densities of CD103+ TRM. Herein, the use of a non-invasive imaging modality such as PET offers significant advantages over classical biopsy-based approaches that are hampered by the requirement for accessible lesions and tumor heterogeneity. Recent preclinical studies have demonstrated that the use of mAbs for T-cell imaging can impair T-cell function, despite being administered at low doses (50,59). These functional effects of mAbs are likely due to their bivalent nature and interaction with specific Fc receptors. As a result of these interactions, full-length mAbs can trigger antigen crosslinking and cell- or complement-mediated effector functions. For mAbs used therapeutically in parallel to imaging, these considerations are mute. However, the requirement for parallel use of antibodies as therapeutic and imaging agents limits the potential for non-invasive imaging of clinically relevant immune subsets that do not directly represent a therapeutic target, such as CD103+ TRM cells. Here, we demonstrate that Fab derivation of a previously developed anti-CD103 imaging antibody could be used to side-step these issues while maintaining the previously described high target-to-background ratios, high target site selectivity and a high sensitivity of this mAb. While highly promising, care should be taken with regards to the generalization of our observations as the mAbs should possess sufficient single arm binding affinity to allow derivation as a Fab without compromising binding activity. Although not discussed extensively here, several of the previously developed anti-CD103 mAbs failed to exert sufficient binding affinity to allow use as Fabs as imaging agents (data not shown). The use of Fab fragments for PET imaging also opens up the possibility to use radioisotopes other than Zr-89, traditionally used for mAb-based PET imaging. Indeed, while Zr-89 (T1/2 = 78.4 h) is ideally suited for radiolabeling antibodies as its physical half-life matches the time mAbs require for optimal target-to-background signals, Fab 240 fragments could benefit from radiolabeling with Ga-68. With a shorter half-life time of 67.7 minutes, Ga-68 better matches the half-life of Fab fragments. As demonstrated here, 68Ga-labeled Fab fragments were able to accurately discriminate CD103+ from CD103- cells in vivo. Although an exact comparative study was difficult due to the differences in optimal scanning time-point and biodistribution, 89Zr-labeled Fabs appeared to be slightly superior in terms of tumor visualization and signal-to-noise ratio. Nevertheless, the success of the 68Ga-labeled Fab and the numerous advantages of 68Ga-labeling for imaging, make this approach worth considering further for clinical development. For instance, the short half-life and scanning time of 68Ga-Fabs allows for repeated imaging and assessment of immune cell kinetics in both short and long-term time-intervals. As little remains known of the exact dynamics of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in mobilizing immune cells across anatomical sites, this information is invaluable in furthering our basic understanding and refining treatment protocols. As such, we are planning the parallel development of Zr- and Ga-labeled Fabs for clinical translation. Finally, for further optimization radiolabeling with different radioisotopes, such as the 18F-radiolabeling using aluminium-[18F]fluoride with the RESCA chelator, may be beneficial. As previously demonstrated, RESCA allows for the straightforward radiolabeling of proteins in mild conditions and F-18 (T1/2 = 110 min) has a half-life that would be ideally suited to the biological half-life of Fabs. The CD103+ TRM imaging strategy proposed here will have applications beyond those described for cancer. CD103+ TRM cells are implicated in a number of auto-immune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. CD103+ TRM cells have also been shown to play a significant role in the rejection of transplanted organs, and strategies that deplete CD103+ cells have shown therapeutic success in preclinical models of these disease indications. Like proposed for cancer, CD103 imaging may help diagnose patients with diseases mediated by CD103+ TRM, which are frequently difficult to assess through biopsy-based methods. CD103 imaging may also help monitor therapy responses, discriminate responders from non-responders and help guide treatment decision making in these indications. Finally, CD103 is expressed on a series of leukemic cancers and may be used for diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression in response to therapy. We are currently examining the potential of CD103 imaging in relevant models of these indications. In conclusion, the highly sensitive Fab-based hCD103 immuno-PET tracers, 89Zr-hCD103.Fab01A and 68Ga-hCD103.Fab01A, described here should be developed further for the non-invasive assessment of cancer reactive T cell infiltration. Clinically, CD103 PET imaging has the potential to select patients more likely to benefit from immunotherapy and thereby spare patients unlikely to respond from unnecessary immune-related side-effects. 241 MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials and Equipment TFP-N-Suc-desferal-Fe (Df, ABX GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) was conjugated in 7 4-fold molar excess to lysine residues of hCD103-Fab to provide N-Suc-Df-hCD103.Fab01. The identity and purity of Df-Fab conjugates was determined by size exclusion ultra-performance liquid chromatography (SE-UPLC). The Waters ACQUITY SE-UPLC system was equipped with a dual wavelength absorbance detector, in-line radioactivity detector and UPLC column 300 x 7.8 mm, Phenomenex, Netherlands). The conjugate was aliquoted and frozen. 68Ga was obtained by fractionated elution of the < 9month old GMP 68Ge/68Ga generator (Eckert and Ziegler, Berlin, Germany) with 0.1 M HCl. The eluate with the highest radioactivity concentration was used for labeling. The labeling yield and radiochemical purity of labeled conjugates were measured using the instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) (ITLC-SG, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The strips were developed with 0.05 M citric acid for gallium-68 conjugates. Distribution of the radioactivity among the strips was measured on GE Amersham Typhoon Scanner using phosphorus plates and ImageQuant TL 1D software for data processing (both GE Healthcare Life Science, USA). If needed, radiolabeled bioconjugates were purified for further studies saline (PBS) PD10 miniTrap G-25 Sephadex resin size exclusion column (GE Healthcare Life Science, USA). 89Zr-labeling was performed as described earlier (Dijkers et al. 2009) using clinical grade 89Zr (solution in 1 M oxalic acid, BV Cyclotron VU, Amsterdam, Netherlands) in ratio of 89Zr per mg antibody equal to 300 MBq/mg.62 Radiochemical purity (RCP) was assessed by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation test for 89Zr-hCD103.Fab01. For quality control of the 68Ga and 89Zr tracers same UPLC system and column was used. The radioactivity was measured using dose calibrator (VDC-505, Comecer, Netherlands) and 2480 Wizard Detector Gamma Counter (Perkin Elmer, Netherlands). Recombinant molecules and antibodies The details of reagents and antibodies used for our study are provided in supplementary material, Supplementary Table 1. Primary material and cell lines Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were quarantined until screening for microbial contamination and mycoplasma was performed and proven to be negative. Cells were grown in DMEM/F-12, GlutaMAX Supplement + 5% FCS + 25 mM HEPES and incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. CD103/7 expressing clones 242 Generation of hCD103 Fab fragment Anti-hCD103 Fab candidates were produced by ImmunoPrecise. Synthetic vectors encoding for the DNA sequences of the VH and VL domains of candidates hCD103.01A, hCD103.05A, and hCD103.06A were synthesized and subsequently cloned into ImmunoPrecises human IgG1-Fab-K vector and human kappa light chain vector, respectively, followed by transfection of HEK293 cells. Fab fragments from harvested supernatants were purified by endotoxin-free purification using CaptureSelect IgG-CH1 affinity matrix. Fab concentrations were quantified using Spectrophotometry and Fab purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and HP-SEC. Endotoxin levels were determined by LAL assay. Cell based ELISA One day before the experiment, CD103/7 transfected CHO cells (30 000 cells/well) were seeded in 96 wells plates. Subsequently, serial dilutions of CD103 Fabs, CD103 Fabs-DFO conjugate and isotype controls were added to each well of a 96-well plate and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00baC. Wells were washed with PBS and incubated with Rabbit anti-Mouse/IgG-HRP (1:4000, Dako) for 1 h at 37\u00baC. Next wells were washed with PBS and TMB substrate (KPL) was added. The color reaction was stopped by adding 1M HCl solution and the absorbance was measured by a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific). Radiolabeling and In Vitro Stability Briefly, the [68Ga]GaCl3 (5-10 mL, 600-1000 MBq) was concentrated on a PS-H+ cartridge and eluted with a 200 L 5M NaCl solution. 80 MBq of [68Ga]GaCl3 (100-200 L) was added to into a reaction vial containing N-Suc-Df-hCD103.Fab01 solution (30 - 60g, 5 mg/mL) mixed with 100 L of HEPES buffer (1 M, pH 8). The reaction mixture was allowed to react for 15 min at room temperature while being thoroughly vortexed. If RCP did not reach 90%, purification was pre-conditioned (8ml of PBS) PD10 miniTrap G-25 Sephadex resin column by PBS fractioned elution (100 L). N-Suc-Df-hCD103.Fab01 was labeled with zirconium-89 according the following protocol: Zirconium-89 solution (250750 MBq/mg) was neutralized by adding 8.3 L of Na2CO3 (1 M) and incubated for 3 min at RT. Then, 66.7 L of HEPES buffer (1 M, pH 8) was added to the radionuclide solution. After addition of bioconjugate solution (10 g, 5 mg/mL), the resulting mixture was incubated 1h at room temperature while being thoroughly vortexed. In vitro stability of [68Ga]Ga-N-Suc-Df-hCD103.Fab01 was evaluated in PBS, serum and in the presence of 1000-fold molar excess of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). After purification, samples of freshly labeled conjugate (5.9 \u00b5g, 50 \u00b5L) were mixed with EDTA (64 \u00b5g, 2.5 mg/mL in PBS). For PBS and serum stability samples were mixed with equal volumes (100 \u00b5L). RCP of samples submitted for stability was quantified using iTLC strips. The strips were developed and measured as described previously. The experiment was performed in triplicate. 243 In Vitro Studies For cell studies, CHO.CD103 and CHO.K1 cell lines were used. The cell lines were cultured in DMEM-F12 with 2.5 mM HEPES buffer and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. For binding specificity test CHO.CD103 and CHO.K1 cells were transferred on the day of experiment to 4 ml plastic tubes (250 000 cells/tube in 100 \u00b5L of 2% FCS in PBS). A serial dilution of tracer was added to tubes to achieve 10 different concentrations (0 - 5000 ng/mL). After 1 hour incubation at 37 \u00b0C, cells were washed thrice with PBS + 2% FBS and bound 68Ga/89Zr-hCD103.Fab01 measured in Wizard Detector Gamma Counter. For blocking studies CHO.CD103 cells were transferred on the day of experiment to 4 ml plastic tubes (250 000 cells/tube in 100 \u00b5L of 2% FCS in PBS) and half of samples were blocked using CD103 antibody (10 \u00b5g/mL, mouse anti-human CD103, clone Ber-ACT8, BD Bioscience) for 1 hour before experiment. Afterwards, tracer, in 10 different concentrations (0 - 2500 ng/mL), was added to the samples, incubated for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C, and cells were washed thrice with PBS + 2% FBS. Bound 68Ga/89Zr-hCD103.Fab01 measured in Wizard Detector Gamma Counter. In Vivo Studies Animal experiments were planned and performed under approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Groningen in agreement with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. For hCD103 PET imaging male nude mice (BALB/cOlaHsd-Foxn1nu, Envigo, subcutaneously (5*106 and growth factor Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Breda, The Netherlands)). Xenografts were allowed to grow to at least 200 mm3. For microPET imaging, mice (at least n = 3 per group) were injected intravenously (iv) via the penile vein with 68Ga-hCD103.01A. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained by the administration of a mixture of isoflurane (2.5-3.5%), oxygen, and medical air. MicroPET scans were made 3 h post injection (pi) using a Focus 220 PET scanner (CTI Siemens), followed by ex vivo biodistribution analysis after the final scan. The PET data was reconstructed into a static image and in vivo quantification was performed using AMIDE (v1.0.4, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA). MicroPET data are presented as mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean). Region of interests (ROI) were drawn for tumor based upon ex vivo weight, assuming 1 g/ml tissue density. For blood pool measurements, a fixed-sized sphere was drawn in the center of the heart. After the final scan, mice were sacrificed and organs of interest collected for biodistribution studies. Organs and standards of the injected tracer were counted in a calibrated well type LKB-1282-Compu-gamma system (LKB WALLAC) and weighed. After decay correction, ex vivo tissue activity was expressed as the percentage of injected dose per gram tissue (%ID/g). MicroPET imaging with 89Zr-hCD103.Fab01 was done in similar manner, however, scans were made 3, 6 and 24 hours post injection (p.i.), followed by ex vivo biodistribution analysis after the final scan. Additional group of 89Zr-hCD103.Fab01 with CHO.CD103 tumor bearing mice (n=3) was used for ex vivo biodistribution 3 hours p.i. The PET data was 244 reconstructed into a static image and in vivo quantification was performed using AMIDE (v1.0.4, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA). Immunohistochemistry staining For CD103 IHC, previously deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated. Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed in 10 mM TRIS/EDTA (pH 9.0) at 100 C for 15 minutes, endogenous peroxidase was blocked by 10-minute incubation with 3% H2O2 in PBS and non-specific binding of antibodies was blocked using 1% human serum albumin + 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 minutes. Next slides were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse CD103 antibody (1:500, ab224202, Abcam) for 60 minutes at room temperature. Incubation with secondary antibody (EnVision System, Dako HRP; Dako) was performed for 30 minutes, followed by application of diaminobenzidine chromogen for 10 minutes. Hematoxylin counterstaining was applied routinely. Digital scans of slides were acquired by a NanoZoomer 2.0-HT multi slide scanner (Hamamatsu) and analyzed with NanoZoomer Digital Pathology viewer software. Statistics Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD unless stated otherwise. Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism version 8.4.2 (GraphPad Software) using the Mann-Whitney test (2 groups, nonparametric) or the Two-way ANOVA test followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test (2 groups).

Tracer labeling optimization with (A) different timepoint was assessed by instant thin-layer chromatography, where retardation factor of radiolabeled Fab fragment is 0.0 and complexed 68Ga is 1.0 (B). In the same manner was assessed amount of activity needed to achieve RCP >90% (C). D) Purity and characterization of radiolabeled Fab fragment was done with SE-UPLC chromatograms using UV detection at 280 nm (protein) and activity detector. Left panel shows chromatograms of unpurified reaction mixtures (Fab, 68GaCl and HEPES) and right panel - purified Fab by miniPD10 desalting column. 253 Supplementary Figure 2.
