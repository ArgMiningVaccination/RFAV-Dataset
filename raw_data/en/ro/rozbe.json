In these diseases, normal molecules or their genetic variants self-assemble to form oligomers and/or fibrils that deposit in the brain parenchyma and are associated with cognitive deficits or dementia. Among them, amyloid (A) is identified as the major constituent of such fibrils in Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1,2]. It has been widely accepted that A fibrils are relatively insoluble and resistant to proteolysis, which result in their marked accumulations as amyloid plaques mainly owing to a weak antigenicity or immunogenicity [3]. The dogma that the Central Nervous System (CNS) is an immune- privileged region with minimal immune surveillance supports the above-mentioned issue. Thus, no therapeutic intervention for the removal of deposited A fibrils remained unexplored despite of this quite important issue to be considered. In 1999, we witnessed a striking paradigm shift with respect to our understanding of the efficacy of A immunotherapy for AD [4]. Thereafter, significant efforts have been focused on the molecular mechanism responsible for immune-mediated A depletion in the brain, which provided fascinating insights into disease-relevant molecules such as toxic A oligoers (AOs) [5]. Several major hypotheses have been proposed including microglia- mediated phagocytosis, peripheral sink, neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated A transport across the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), catalytic modifications of A fibrils, intracerebral sequestration of A in a monomeric state, and antibody-mediated neutralization of A toxicity. However, molecular mechanisms underlying either the formation or clearance of AOs remain unclarified. In this review, we will focus on AO immunotherapy, with specific emphasis on the action of the anti-AO antibody to clarify the toxic action of AOs. Central degradation of AOs via microglia-mediated phagocytosis The importance of this mechanism was pointed out by A vaccine [4], which clears deposited fibrillar A via an in vivo immune-mediated system. Some circulating anti-A antibodies cross the BBB and activate Fc receptor (FcR)-mediated clearance of amyloid fibrils by microglia [6,7]. The direct in vivo evidence of this system was obtained by autopsy of cases who received clinical A immunization, which showed that senile plaques are actually removed via microglial phagocytosis [8,9]. Owing to intraneuronal accumulation of AOs [10-14], it is unlikely that microglia-mediated phagocytosis accounts for antibody-mediated degradation of AOs. In support of this idea, the microglial response to 72D9 immunotherapy targeting AOs remains unchanged compared with control IgG treatment despite the marked reduction of Gallyas- Braak-positive senile plaques in 3x-Tg AD mice [14]. These findings suggest that microglial phagocytosis is not a central mechanism of reducing AOs. Peripheral sink DeMattos et al. [15] reported that the interaction of the anti-A antibody with plasma A generates a concentration gradient across the BBB, which promotes the efflux of brain A into blood in passive immunotherapy. The same group confirmed that the measurement of brain A efflux appears to be a useful tool to estimate on-going brain amyloid burden at a risk of AD [16]. This 'peripheral sink' theory brought us the new therapeutic concept that CNS A clearance could be controlled by the modification of peripheral A clearance, which drives the equilibrium from the brain to blood A. Takamura et al. [13] reported that AO immunotherapy results in the significant attenuation of extracellular and intraneuronal accumulation of AOs, indicating that a similar scenario may take place. However, the physiological reliability of this issue has remained uncertain so far. Further study to clarify this issue is required. Neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated A transport across the BBB The in vivo relevance of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated A transport across BBB has been confirmed in APP transgenic mice [17]. Bard et al. [6] reported that endogenous immunoglobulins in the brain parenchyma represent ~0.1% of serum endogenous immunoglobulins. Several other groups A (2012) Molecular Mechanism Underlying A Immunotherapy: Implications for the Toxic Action of A Oligomers . J Gerontol Geriat Res Diseasethat ~0.023% to 0.11% of a peripheral dose enters into the brain [18- 20]. Thus, this mechanism may play an important role in the clearance of soluble AOs by the antibody that crossed the BBB. Considering the positive outcome of our in vivo immunotherapies [14], it is also reasonable to speculate that soluble AOs are metabolized into plasma possibly by antibody-assisted removal via the BBB [17], whereby the conversion to insoluble AOs and further development of amyloid plaques are effectively blocked [14]. Further study to clarify this issue is definitely required. Catalytic modifications of A assembly Solomon et al. [21] reported that the anti-A antibody is capable of dissolving already formed amyloid fibrils, which results in the marked decrease in the neurotoxicity of A. The same group also showed the similar catalytic activity of the antibody towards fibrillar A assembly [22-24]. Furthermore, they also showed that anti-aggregating antibodies against the EFRH residues located at positions 3-6 of the N-terminal A peptide prevent self-aggregation [25] or preformed aggregates in vitro and in vivo [27]. In humans, polyclonal IgM antibodies purified from human sera showed A hydrolytic activity, which prevents the formation of AOs and A fibrils [28]. Aging-induced synthesis of the catalytic antibodies to A is indicative of the protective role of the immune system that counters the pathology associated with A accumulation in the brain [28]. Intracerebral sequestration of A in monomeric state Yamada et al. [29] reported that monoclonal m266 with a high affinity for soluble A may sequester soluble monomeric A in the brain thereby preventing the formation of multimeric A and related neurotoxicity. This concept was firstly reported by Solomon et al. [22,23] who showed that a monoclonal anti-A antibody prevent samyloid fibril formation. However, monomeric A\u00df has normal physiological functions in the brain such as neuroprotection and modulation of LTP [30,31]. Although this strategy of targeting monomeric A is theoretically relevant, it may interfere with these physiological functions. Therefore, intracerebral sequestration of AOs in a nontoxic state should be considered. Antibody-mediated neutralization of AOs toxicity The possible mechanisms underlying the neurotoxic action of AOs have been postulated to involve neurotoxic ligands [32-41]. Regarding the above-mentioned action, in vitro experiments demonstrated that conformation-dependent antibodies successfully immunoneutralized the toxicity of AOs [14,42-47]. Presently, no evidence is available showing that antibody-AO interactions induce conformational changes that are not toxic. Immunotherapy using antibodies targeting AOs is also sufficient to normalize cognitive behavior [13,14,46-49] and synaptic deficits [47]. Our in vivo experiment using antibodies specific for AOs demonstrated that the direct sequestration of AOs not only protected Tg2576 mice from memory deficits and postsynaptic impairment [13], but also reversed memory loss in 3x- Tg AD mice [14]. One of the unifying features is that specific control of extracellular AOs results in a marked attenuation of intraneuronal accumulation of AOs [13,14]. It has been shown that some of the AOs are internalized by neuronal cells via transferrin-receptor- mediated endocytosis, causing neuronal death a and endocytosis), Takamura et al. [14] identified sortilin as a key molecule that regulates AO-dependent neurotoxicity. As shown in Figure 1, sortilin forms a death signaling receptor with p75NTR in response to AOs, inducing have Figure 1: Schematic representation of molecular interconnections responsible for the toxic action of A oligomers (AOs). In the presence of AOs, p75NTR-sortilin death receptors are formed on the neuronal membrane [14], [12] and subsequent [12]. In addition to the cleavage of Beclin1 [53-58], the resulting activated caspase-3 causes the cleavage of tau [61-63], followed by tau assembly [64,65] and phosphorylation [11,14,60]. Incomplete chaperone-mediated autophagy of tau [64] also induces the generation of amyloidogenic fragments that can self-assemble and phosphorylated by leakage Autop hagosom e Autolysos ome p p p p p p Beclin1 p p Casp ase-3 Lysosom al leakage (2012) Molecular Mechanism Underlying A Immunotherapy: Implications for the Toxic Action of A Oligomers . J Gerontol Geriat Res 2167-7182 JGGR, an open access journal Alzheimers Diseaseprovided evidence of a direct link between p75NTR signaling and A1- 42-induced toxicity in hippocampal neurons in and in basal forebrain neurons in vivo [52]. During such apoptotic processes, activated caspases also result in the production apoptosis- inducing activity by translocating from the cytosol to the mitochondria, accelerating apoptosis probably via the enhancement of the release of cytochrome C [55-57]. Indeed, the caspase-induced cleavage of Beclin1 was observed in the AD brain [58]. In contrast, a new mouse model expressing only AOs in neurons provides evidence of caspase-3 activation in the brain via lysosomal leakage and mitochondrial dysfunction [12]. Thus, the sortilin-mediated endocytosis of AOs may induce lysosomal leakage, followed by mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis [12] and of Beclin1 [55-58]. Because Beclin1 has multiple binding partners, the composition of proteins in the Beclin1 complex determines its function [59]. Thus, the decreased availability of Beclin1 may result in the destabilization of the complex and impair the formation and/or maturation of autophagosomes [59], followed by the accumulation of intraneuronal AOs [14]. Recently, the relevance of such a pathway has been proved in the AD brain [58]. Taken together, anti-AO antibodies can prevent the interaction between extracellular AOs and sortilin, and sortilin-p75NTR death signaling receptor formation [14] (Figure 2). Antibody-mediated neutralization of tau toxicity Our in vivo experiment demonstrated that 72D9-immunized 3x-Tg AD mice with improved cognition showed lower levels of AT8-positive tau and fewer NFT-bearing neurons than control IgG2b-treated controls [14].To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a direct link in vivo between endogenous AOs and NFT formation. In support of this finding, Jin et al. showed that natural exogenous A dimers isolated from the AD brain are sufficient to induce AD- type tau hyperphosphorylation followed by neuritic dystrophy [60]. Of note, A accumulation triggers caspase 3/7 activation, leading to tau cleavage, followed by hyperphosphorylation and NFT formation [61]. A similar scenario is also reported [62]. Furthermore, Dolan et al. [63] showed that impaired autophagy causes intraneuronal accumulation of caspase-cleaved tau, leading to neuronal degeneration in AD. From these points of view, AO-induced apoptosis (p75NTR- Beclin1-mediated cleavage may contribute to the accumulation of tau, leading to hyperphosporylation and NFT formation (Figure 1). Incomplete Chaperon-Mediated Autophagy (CMA) of tau generates an amyloidogenic fragment that promotes aggregation, which also induces lysosomal leakage [64]. Sortilin-mediated endocytosis of AOs may induce lysosomal leakage, promoting hyperphosphorylation of tau assembly (Figure 1). Therefore, the antibody can prevent tau toxicity via specific control of extracellular AOs through the inhibition of p75NTR-mediated apoptosis and/or mitochondrial apoptosis, and/ or hyperphosphorylation of tau assembly. Conclusion We herein summarize the current knowledge on the possible action of antibodies targeting AOs. As shown in Figure 2, the anti- AO antibody induces the dissociation of sortilin from p75NTR by neutralizing extracellular AOs, which attenuates several steps of a cascade responsible for neuronal death (Figure 1). Under these conditions, sortilin maintains physiological levels of lysosomal sorting pathways [65] (Figure 2). Recent studies in our laboratory revealed that the knockdown of sortilin results in a marked decrease in Beclin1, indicating that sortilin acts as a Beclin1 inducer. Of note, the majority of Beclin1 localizes to the Trans -Golgi Network (TGN), whereas Figure 2: Schematic representation of molecular interconnections responsible for the therapeutic action of anti-AO antibodies. Immunoneutralization of extracellular AOs by an antibody interrupts association between p75NTR and sortilin, inhibiting p75NTR-mediated apoptosis [14]. In contrast, physiological lysosomal sorting pathways [65], but also induces Beclin1 [14]. A hypothetical model shows that sortilin may govern the supply of Beclin1 via retrograde transport [67] from TGN to ER, which contributes to the physiological levels of autophagy. In the absence of p75NTR-mediated apoptotic signalling and endocytosis-mediated AOs, the formation of phosphorylated, truncated tau assemblies suppressed, and the assemblies can be disposed of via autolysosomes.sortilin p75NTR Vesicle Autop hagosom e p p Incompl ete CMA A (2012) Molecular Mechanism Underlying A Immunotherapy: Implications for the Toxic Action of A Oligomers . J Gerontol Geriat Res to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), leads to the speculation that Bcl2 redistributes of Beclin1 away from TGN to ER [66]. It is possible that sortilin up regulates this retrograde transport pathway and maintains physiological levels of autophagy. Furthermore, a marked attenuation of sortilin- mediated endocytosis of AOs results in the depletion of AOs, which accelerate the phosphorylation of tau assembly; this depletion rescues the autophagy system from excessive load for degradation. Because AO immunotherapy is promising for preemptive disease-modifiers, more research aiming at a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of AOs and/or antibodies targeting AOs is definitely required.
