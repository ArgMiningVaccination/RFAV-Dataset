REGARDING FEVER AFTER COVID-19 VACCINATION ............................................................ ... 97 Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 5 12/09/2023 This guidance is intended for vaccinators administering COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccinators should be trained and competent in immunisation practice. Vaccinators should have undergone training in the administration of COVID-19 vaccine(s), recognition and management of anaphylaxis, and basic life support and intramuscular injection technique. They should also be familiar with the anaphylaxis protocol outlined in the Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland (see useful links section). In some circumstances, advice in these guidelines may differ from that in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of the vaccines. When this occurs, the recommendations in these guidelines, which are based on current expert advice from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee should be followed. Introduction The objective of the vaccination programme for SARS-CoV-2 is to ensure equitable access to a safe and effective vaccine with the goals of limiting mortalit y and morbidity from COVID-19, protecting healthcare capacity and enabling social and economic activity. Purpose of the document This document has been prepared as a means of providin g clinical guidance to all clinicians implementing the COVID-19 vaccination programme. Indemnity for vaccinators Claims management in relation to claims and litigation initiated in connection with COVID-19 vaccination is to be delegated to the State Claims Agency by means of Government Order. Registered medical practitioners (including GPs), nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, dentists, dental hygienists, optometrists, radiographers and radiation therapists, paramedics, advanced paramedics, emergency medical technicians and relevant healthcare students (as per the Statutory Instruments for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines), in receipt of rele vant training with regard to administration of the vaccines, who are administering vaccines on the direction of, or on behalf of, the Health Service Executive (HSE) will be indemnified with regard to any adverse product liability- related events arising from their administration of the vaccine. Vaccinators working in GP surgeries and retail pharmacies however, will not be indemnified in respect of malpractice events occurring during the administration of the vaccine. Such malpractice events will be indemnified by their professional insurers.

Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 11 12/09/2023 Infection Prevention and Control for the administration of COVID-19 Vaccines Prior to preparation and administration of COVID-19 vaccines, hand hygiene should be performed as per the \"WHO five moments of hand hygiene\" with emphasis on: Before vaccine preparation Before drawing up and administering the vaccine Before and after each recipient contact Check Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) website for latest guidance on infection prevention and control (IPC) for healthcare workers: National Clinical Guideline No. 30 (2023) - Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a057e-infection-prevention-and-control-ipc/ . It is not necessary to use a skin disinfec tant prior to injection. If the skin at the injection site is visibly dirty, clean with soap and water. If an alcohol swab is used, delay injection for 30 seconds, to ensure the alcohol has evaporated. There is no need to routinely check temperature either at registration or before vaccination. Follow HPSC standard precautions (sharps management, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and healthcare waste management etc.) National Clinical Guideline No. 30 (2023) - Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a057e-infection-prevention-and-control-ipc/ . Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 12 12/09/2023 Vaccine details, storage and instructions for preparation and administration. Vaccines undergo rigorous checks and quality steps prior to final release from the manufacturer. SmPCs usually state: \"The vaccine should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discolouration prior to administration. Discard the vial if the suspension is discoloured or visible particles are observed.\" When a vaccinator is concerned regarding a vial the following steps should be followed: The vaccinator should contact another healthcare professional (HCP) who has experience in using this product and ask for a second opinion The affected vial should be returned to the fridge and kept there in Quarantine (between +2 C and +8C) The vial in quarantine should be placed in a clearly marked area in the fridge \"Quarantine - do not use\" The vaccinator and senior experienced HCP should check the other vials in this batch in their fridge by removing one vial at a time and ensuring that the duration out of the fridge is kept to a minimum If more vials are considered defective, they should calculate the impact of placing vials into quarantine and arrange for additional deliveries if required. The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPR A), manufacturer and HSE National Immunisation Office (NIO) should be emailed with details of the issue and with a photograph of vial identifying the defect (if possible). The NIO will follow up and contact other locations w here this batch has been delivered if necessary. Please ensure vaccines are stored between +2 oC and +8oC. Should vaccines be exposed to temperatures outside of these parameters please contact the NIO immediately.

Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 27 12/09/2023 Contraindications and precautions to COVID-19 vaccines 9.1 mRNA Vaccines Contraindications to mRNA vaccines Anaphylaxis (serious systemic allergic reaction requiring medical intervention) after an mRNA vaccine Anaphylaxis after polyethylene glycol (PEG, e.g., some bowel preparations for endoscopy, certain laxatives such as Movicol) Anaphylaxis after trometamol1, (contained in all presentations of Comirnaty\u00ae currently in use in Ireland) Those with a contraindication to one mRNA COVID-19 vaccine should not receive another authorised mRNA vaccine. Consideration may be given to non-mRNA vaccination for anyone aged 12 years and older following an individual benefit risk assessment, including pregnant women. This should be given after an interval of at least 4 weeks following a previous vaccination, and the person should be considered fully vaccinated. If there is a contraindication or precaution to an mRNA vaccine, or a person has chosen not to receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid\u00ae (a protein based vaccine) may be used as an alternate following an individual benefit risk assessment. Nuvaxovid is the preferred alternate and can be used for primary and booster vaccination. There is more limited experience of Nuvaxovid in those who are pregnant, and this should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. If there is a contraindication or precaution to an mRNA vaccine or Nuvaxovid, or a person has chosen not to receive these vaccines, VidPrevtyn Beta may be used as an alternate booster vaccine. VidPrevtyn Beta is licensed for booster vaccination only in those aged 18 years and older who have previously received an mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine. Precautions: Acute severe illness; defer until recovery. Routine physical examination and temperature measurement of persons who appear to be healthy are not necessary prior to vaccination. Previous history of myocarditis or pericarditis after any COVID-19 vaccine - seek specialist advice before vaccination (i.e., consult with a Cardiologist). There should be an interval of at least 4 weeks between mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)/smallpox vaccine and a subsequent COVID-19 vaccine because of the unknown risk of myocarditis. Children with a previous history of MIS-C - defer vaccination until clinical recovery or at least 3 months since diagnosis, whichever is the longer. Consider a non-mRNA vaccine (Nuvaxovid\u00ae) for those aged 12 years and older, including 1 Trometamol has been implicated in one report of contrast medium anaphylaxis relating to gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) used in MRI radiological studies. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 28 12/09/2023 pregnant women, with: o Anaphylaxis after multiple different drug classes, with no identified allergen (may indicate PEG allergy) o Anaphylaxis after a vaccine or a medicine known to contain PEG o Unexplained anaphylaxis (may indicate PEG allergy) If there is a precaution to a booster mRNA vaccine, consideration can be given to boosting with an EMA authorised non-mRNA vaccine following an individual benefit risk assessment. Patients with planned immunosuppressive therapy s hould ideally complete vaccination two weeks before treatment. The recommended minimum interval may be used. Specialists should consider the individual's risk and likelihood of diseas e exposure, and provide advice based on knowledge and understanding of the patient's immune status and likely immune response to vaccination. For more information please refer to the NIAC Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland Table 5a.3 Contraindications and precautions to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and see Frequently Asked Questions about COVID-19 vaccines for people with pre-existing allergic conditions www.rcpi.ie Of note: Refer to section 15 for details of vaccination of children aged 5-11 Refer to section 16 for details of vaccination of children aged 6 months-4 years 9.2 Protein sub-unit vaccines Nuvaxovid\u00ae Contraindications Anaphylaxis (serious systemic allergic reaction requiring medical intervention) following a previous dose of the vaccine or any of its constituents including polysorbate 80. Precautions Acute severe illness; defer until recovery. Previous history of myocarditis or pericarditis a fter any COVID-19 vaccine, seek specialist advice. There should be an interval of 4 weeks between mpox (formerly known as monkeypox)/smallpox vaccine and a subsequent Nuvaxovid vaccine because of the unknown risk of myocarditis. No interval is required between Nuvaxovid and subsequent mpox vaccines. Advice from a relevant specialist should be sought for a person with: a history of an immediate severe allergic reaction to multiple drug classes with no identified allergen, any other vaccine injected antibody preparation or medicine likely to contain polysorbate 80 or idiopathic anaphylaxis The risks should be weighed against the benefits of vaccination. There is more limited experience of Nuvaxovid in those who are pregnant, and this should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 29 12/09/2023 Please refer to the NIAC Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland for details. https://www.rcpi.ie/healthcare- leadership/niac/immunisation-guidelines-for-ireland Appropriate support should be available in case of anaphylaxis or fainting after vaccine administration. Precautions should also be in place to minimise risk of injury from fainting. 9.3 VidPrevtyn Beta Contraindications Anaphylaxis following a previous dose of the vaccine or any of its constituents including polysorbate 20 or octylphenol ethoxylate. Precautions Acute severe illness; defer until recovery. Advice from a relevant specialist should be sought for a person with: a history of an immediate severe allergic reaction to multiple drug classes with no identified allergen, any other vaccine injected antibody preparation or medicine likely to contain polysorbate or idiopathic anaphylaxis The risks should be weighed against the benefits of vaccination. Of note: Vidprevtyn Beta is not licensed as a booster for those who have previously received a protein subunit vaccine (i.e., Nuvaxovid). Vidprevtyn Beta is only licensed as a booster to prevent COVID-19 for those aged 18 y ears and older who have previously received an mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine. 9.4 Vaccination after COVID-19 (primary vaccination course) Unvaccinated Those who are unvaccinated and develop SARS-CoV-2 infection should complete a primary vaccination course, with the first dose at least four weeks after diagnosis or onset of symptoms, or four weeks from the first PCR positive specimen in those who are asymptomatic. Those with persisting symptoms following COVID-19 may be vaccinated, unless there is evidence of recent clinical deterioration. Partially vaccinated Those who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection after their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine should be given the subsequent dose at least four to eight weeks (age dependent) after diagnosis or onset of symptoms. If those who are immunocompromised have SARS-CoV-2 infection more than seven days after the second vaccine dose, a third dose of the primary series is not required. They should proceed to their first booster dose as per Table 1 of this document (or Table 5a.1 of the NIAC Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland). For those with infection within seven days of their second dose they should complete the extended primary series after an interval of 4-8 weeks. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 30 12/09/2023 Clinical considerations for COVID-19 vaccines 10.1 Pregnancy Pregnant women should be offered mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and should be up to date with COVID-19 vaccines in line with NIAC recommendations. For details of the recommended timing of booster vaccination in pregnancy please see Section 11. Pregnant women should be offered mRNA COVID-19 vaccines at any stage of pregnancy for: their primary vaccination course (if unvaccinated) the additional mRNA vaccine dose recommended for immunocompromised after the appropriate interval (if immunocompromised and pregnant) Continuing evidence regarding mRNA COVID-19 vaccina tion during pregnancy has demonstrated it to be safe and effective. The primary schedule may be given at any stage in pregnancy with an interval as recommended in Table 1. Pregnant women are at similar risk of COVID-19 infection to non-pregnant women of the same age. However, pregnant women with COVID-19 infection are more likely to be admitted to ICU or to die than similar aged non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Pregnant women from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds may be more likely to be admitted to hospital with COVID-19 disease than other pregnant women. COVID-19 in pregnancy may increase the risk of adver se pregnancy outcomes, such as miscarriage, stillbirth and preterm birth. The following factors may increase the risks of severe illness in pregnancy: Underlying conditions listed in Table 5a.2 of the NIAC Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland Age over 35 years Infection in the third trimester (28 weeks' or more) BMI of 30 or more. There is now a growing body of evidence on the safe ty and effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination - clearly indicating that the benefits of vaccination outweigh any known or potential risks of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. Long term follow-up is on-going. Vaccination is the best way to protect both mother and baby from serious harm and mRNA vaccines should be available to pregnant women at all stages of pregnancy. Emerging data indicates that the maternal COVID-19 antibodies can cross the placenta, which may offer neonatal protection. The NIAC has reviewed the evidence regarding safety and timing of COVID-19 primary and booster vaccines in pregnancy. Current data are very reassuring regarding the safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines given at any stage in pregnancy either as a primary series or as a booster. The EMA, UK Health Security Agency, and CDC Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 31 12/09/2023 have been monitoring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy2,3,4. These safety monitoring systems have not reported any safety concerns for people w ho receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine at any stage of pregnancy. Less data are available regarding non-mRNA vaccines. NIAC and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have developed materials to support healthcare workers and pregnant women in decision making about COVID-19 vaccination. Visit www.rcpi.ie. Please refer to Section 11 for details of booster vaccinations. Vaccination in pregnancy with Nuvaxovid\u00ae There is limited experience with use of the vacci ne in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, delivery or post-natal development. Administration may be considered when the benefits outweigh the potential risks to the mother or the fetus and when mRNA vaccines are contraindicated or declined. The pregnant woman and a relevant health professional should engage in shared decision-making in advance of vaccination. Counselling should balance the available data on vaccine safety, risks to pregnant women from COVID-19 infection, and a woman's individual risk for infection and severe disease. The two doses of the primary vaccination course should be given 4 weeks apart for those aged 30 years and older and 8 weeks apart for those aged 12-29 years (at any stage in pregnancy). VidPrevtyn Beta\u00ae is not recommended for vaccination in pregnancy as routine There is limited experience with the use of VidPrevtyn Beta in pregnant women, with no clinical data available to date. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/fetal development, parturition or postnatal development. In the context of the limited clinical data available the National Immunisation Advisory Committee do not recommend the routine use of VidPrevtyn Beta in pregnancy. Administration of VidPrevtyn Beta during pregnancy should only be considered on a case by case basis, in consultation with a relevant specialist when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and fetus. mRNA vaccines remain the recommended COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women as they have the most extensive safety and efficacy dat a. If there is a contraindication to mRNA vaccines, vaccination with Nuvaxovid may be considered. 2 European Medicines Agency.

COVID-19 Vaccines While Pregnant or Breastfeeding 2022 [Available from: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/v accines/recommendations/pregnancy.html accessed 21 Feb 2023. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 32 12/09/2023 10.2 Breastfeeding COVID-19 vaccines can be used during breastfeeding. There is no evidence that breastfeeding after COVID- 19 vaccination causes harm to the breastfed infants or interferes with ability to breastfeed. 10.3 Fertility There is no evidence that any COVID-19 vaccine affects fertility or the fetus. No unexpected pregnancy or infant outcomes have been observed related to COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. There is no biologically plausible reason why any of the COVID-19 vaccines would have any effect on fertility. There is no evidenc e that any of the COVID-19 vaccines have any effect on fertility. 10.4 Individuals with a bleeding disorder Individuals with a bleeding disorder or receiving anticoagulant therapy may develop haematomas in IM injection sites. Prior to vaccination, inform the recipient about this risk. For those with thrombocytopoenia (platelet count <50 x 10 9/L) consult the supervising consultant. People with mild bleeding disorders or on maintenance dose Emicizumab (Hemlibra\u00ae) do not require haemostatic cover for vaccination. Details of haemostatic cover for all others can be found in the Patient Information tab at http://www.stjames.ie/services/hope/nationalcoagulationcentre Those with inherited coagulopathies receiving factor replacement therapy should receive the treatment on the day of vaccination, prior to the IM vaccination. If there is uncertainty about the need for cover, contact the patient's Comprehensive Care Centre. 10.5 Individuals taking anticoagulants Those receiving long term anticoagulation with either warfarin or heparin are not considered to be at higher risk of bleeding complications following immunisation. There is no reason to expect that there is a greater risk of bleeding complications with the newer types of anticoagulants, such as antiplatelet agents, than with other anticoagulants. People on Warfarin\u00ae should follow their usual schedule for international normalised ratio (INR) testing and can be vaccinated if it is less than 4.0. If the INR is 4.0 or more, follow the advice of the clinic/practice managing Warfarin\u00ae and wait until the INR is less than 4.0 to be vaccinated. 10.6 Technique for IM injections in persons with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulants Use a 23 or 25 gauge needle to reduce the pressure gradient and cause less trauma to the tissue. The vaccine should be injected slowly ( 5 seconds) to reduce the risk of tissue damage. Firm pressure should be applied to the site for 5 to 10 minutes after injection. Stabilisation of the limb will reduce the risk of a haematoma. The site should not be rubbed or massaged. Instruct the patient/caregiver to monitor the injected limb and to report any concerns to their supervising consultant. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 33 12/09/2023 10.7 Co-administration of COVID-19 vaccines with other inactivated or live vaccines for those aged 12 years and over: COVID-19 and adult seasonal influenza vaccines should be co-administered where practicable, to maximise uptake. Vaccinees should be informed there may be a slight increase in short term mild adverse events after coadministration with a seasonal influenza vaccine. These include pain at the site of injection, fatigue, headache, and myalgia. There should be an interval of at least four weeks between mpox vaccine and a subsequent COVID-19 vaccine because of the unknown risk of myocarditis. No interval is required between a COVID-19 vaccine and a subsequent mpox vaccine. COVID-19 vaccines and other adult vaccines may be administered at the same time or at any interval. Co-administered vaccines should be given in different arms. 10.8 Immunosuppression due to disease or treatment Individuals with immunosuppression due to disease or treatment should be vaccinated if they have no contraindications. Patients with planned immunosuppressing therapy s hould ideally complete vaccination two weeks before treatment. The recommended minimum interval may be used. Specialists should consider the individual's risk and likelihood of disease exposure, and provide advice based on knowledge and understanding of the patient's immune status and likely immune response to vaccination. 10.9 Extended primary course for those with immunosuppression due to disease or treatment: mRNA vaccines Those with severe immunocompromise (see Table 5a.2 of the NIAC Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland) due to disease or treatment at the time of their primary COVID-19 vaccination may have suboptimal response to their vaccines. There is evidence that protection can be enhanced by an additional mRNA vaccine dose, representing an extension of the primary vaccination series. An additional mRNA vaccine dose should be given to those aged 12 years and older with immunocompromise associated with a suboptimal response to vaccines at the time of vaccination who have completed their primary course. Serological testing prior to giving an additional dose is not recommended. Recommended intervals for the extended 3 dose primary series for those with immunocompromise : Three doses, with a 4 week interval between dose one and two, and 8 weeks between dose two and three. i.e. An interval of 4 weeks between the first and second doses of an mRNA vaccine is now recommended (a minimum interval of 3 weeks may be used if there is urgency to achieve protection) This is then followed by the additional dose (or third dose of the extended primary vaccination series). The additional dose should be given 8 weeks after the second vaccine dose (a minimal interval of 4 weeks between the second and third dose may be used if there is urgency to achieve protection). See Table 5a.2 of the NIAC Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland for conditions that may be associated with a suboptimal response to vaccines (shaded in blue in the table) Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 34 12/09/2023 10.10 Vaccination with the additional dose after breakthrough infection If those who are immunocompromised have SARS-CoV-2 infection more than seven days after the second vaccine dose, a third dose of the primary series is not required. They should proceed to their first booster dose as per Table 1 (or Table 5a.1 of the NIAC Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland). For those with infection within seven days of their second dose they should complete the extended primary series after an interval of 4-8 weeks. If it is not possible to establish if an individual had breakthrough infection during that timeframe, they may be vaccinated. 10.11 Contraindication to mRNA vaccines A non-mRNA vaccine may be considered as an additional dose in those with a contraindication or precaution to an mRNA vaccine. For those aged 12 years and older Nuvaxovid\u00ae may be considered following an individual benefit-risk assessment. Please refer to section 10.1 for details of vaccination in pregnancy. 10.12 People being treated with chemotherapy for cancer Chemotherapy is not a contraindication to CO VID-19 vaccination. People taking chemotherapy should be vaccinated according to their priority group (provided there are no contraindications). 10.13 Heterologous vaccination The same vaccine should preferably be used for both doses of a primary vaccination course. NIAC advise that those who have partially completed a COVID-19 vaccine course with a vaccine authorised by the FDA, MHRA or recommended by WHO, should be offered an EMA authorised COVID-19 vaccine to complete the course, and then should be considered fully vaccinated. The minimum interval between the last vaccine dose and an EMA authorised COVID-19 vaccine is 4 weeks. 10.14 Recommendations for primary COVID-19 vaccination, first boosters and further boosters in Spring and Autumn 2023 For NIAC recommendations for primary COVID-19 vaccination, first boosters and further boosters in Spring and Autumn 2023, please see Table 1. Vaccination for children aged 5-11 years is discussed in a separate section within this guidance document (see Section 15) . Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 35 12/09/2023 Booster COVID-19 Vaccines Irrespective of the vaccine type used in the primary schedule, mRNA vaccines are the preferred vaccines as boosters. Nuvaxovid may be used as an alternate (following an individual benefit-risk assessment) if mRNA vaccines are contraindicated or not accepted. If there is a contraindication or precaution to an mRNA vaccine or Nuvaxovid, or a person had chosen not to receive these vaccines, Vidprevtyn Beta may be used as an alternate booster vaccine. VidPrevtyn Beta is indicated as a booster for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 for those aged 18 years and older who have previously received an mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine. Vidprevtyn Beta is not licensed as a booster for those who have previously received a protein subunit vaccine (i.e., Nuvaxovid). Booster doses of an mRNA vaccine are recommended as outlined below. For those aged 18 years and older: A first booster dose is recommended for all those aged 18 years and older as it has an important role in enhancing and extending protection gained from the primary schedule. Further booster doses should be given as per the recommendations in Table 1. For those aged 12-17 years: A first booster dose is available to all those aged 12-17 years and is recommended for those with immunocompromise. Further booster doses should be given as per the recommendations in Table 1. The following adapted vaccines are available in Ireland for booster vaccination of those aged 12 years and is the preferred booster vaccination for this age group. However, if Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron XBB.1.5 30 micrograms is not available, then Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 30 micrograms may be used for booster vaccination. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommends the preferential use of Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron XBB.1.5 30 micrograms for booster vaccination when it becomes available in Ireland. In the interim, Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 30 micrograms should continue to be used. In December 2022, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Emergency Task Force concluded that Comirnaty \u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccines may be used when necessary in primary vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adults. Recommended intervals for first boosters following primary course vaccination: At least 4 months after the last dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. In exceptional circumstances a 3 month interval may be used. If a booster dose was given in error before the minimum Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 36 12/09/2023 3 month interval, this is not considered a valid vaccine. However, revaccination is not recommended. Recommended intervals for further booster vaccination in Spring and Autumn 2023 for those aged 12 years and older: Please see Table 1 for those who are recommended to receive further booster vaccines in Spring and Autumn 2023. A 6 month interval from previous COVID-19 booster vaccine or infection is recommended for those aged 50 years and older receiving a further booster as part of the Spring or Autumn vaccination programme 2023. A 9 month interval from previous COVID-19 booster vaccine or infection is recommended for those aged under 50 years receiving a further booster as part of the Spring or Autumn vaccination programme 2023 (except in the case of those aged 12 years and older with immunocompromise associated with a suboptimal response to vaccination, for whom an interval of 6 months following any previous COVID-19 vaccine dose or infection is recommended). A minimum interval of 3 months is permissible in exceptional circumstances e.g. heightened epidemiologic risk or for operational reasons. Booster Vaccination after COVID-19 breakthrough infection Those who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection after completing their primary series (i.e., a breakthrough infection), should proceed to booster vaccination as recommended in Table 1 (or Table 5a.1 of the NIAC Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland). Safety of booster doses of mRNA vaccines First and second booster doses of mRNA vaccines have not shown any unexpected safety concerns. Myocarditis and pericarditis are very rare risks of mRNA vaccination, predominantly in males aged under 30 years after the second dose of the primary vaccination course and the risk appears to be comparatively lower following a first booster dose. Data on second booster doses is more limited but experience has not revealed any new safety concerns. As the adapted vaccines are adaptations of the original COVID-19 vaccine for which the safety profile is well established, it is expected that their safety profile will be similar. Limited clinical data on BA.1 adapted vaccines shows lo cal and systemic react ogenicity profiles similar to that of the original vaccines. Long-term follow up data is not available. In authorising the BA.4-5 bivalent vaccines, the EMA based their recommendations on safety of the bivalent BA.1 mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and long term data on previous mRNA vaccines. The safety of Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron XBB.1.5 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty\u00ae vaccines.

OF NOTE: For information about the adapted booster vaccines for children aged 5-11 years see Section 15 Va ccination of Children aged 5-1 1 years. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 38 12/09/2023 Please refer to section 5 for details of preparation, transport and storage of vaccine Vaccination in pregnancy The NIAC have reviewed the evidence regarding safety and timing of COVID-19 primary and booster vaccines in pregnancy. Current data are very reassuring regarding the safety of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines given at any stage of pregnancy either as a primary series or as a booster. Less data are available regarding non-mRNA vaccines. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines remain the preferred option for use in pregnancy. The NIAC now recommend: For pregnant adolescents and adults, a COVID-19 booster vaccine is recommended once in pregnancy. If a pregnant person has not had a previous COVID-19 booster, the first booster dose is recommended at least 4 months after their last COVID-19 vaccine dose or SARS-CoV-2 infection. For pregnant persons who have had a booster prior to pregnancy, they should receive a booster once in pregnancy at an interval of 6 months or more since their last booster dose or SARS-CoV-2 infection. Booster doses can be given at any stage in pregnancy but ideally should be given between 20-34 weeks. If it is more than 12 months since their previous COVID-19 vaccine or infection administration earlier in pregnancy should be considered. For those who are pregnant and are immunocompromised, a second booster dose within the same pregnancy may be considered if 6 months has elapsed since their last booster dose or SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is more limited experience of Nuvaxovid in those who are pregnant, and this should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Nuvaxovid\u00ae Booster doses of Nuvaxovid are recommended as per Table 1 (or Table 5a.1. of the NIAC Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland). Nuvaxo vid may be used for homologous and heterologous boosters (in those aged 12 years and older). If there is a contraindication or precaution other than my ocarditis or pericarditis to a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine, or a person has chosen not to receive an mRNA COVID-19 booster, consideration can be given to a heterologous booster of Nuvaxovid following an individual benefit-risk assessment. For information on recommended intervals for Nuvaxovid boosters see Table 1. In exceptional circumstances an interval of 3 mont hs may be used (e.g., in a person scheduled to commence chemotherapy). If pregnant women are receiving Nuvaxovid\u00ae as a booster dose, they should have a discussion with a healthcare professional (e.g. clinical lead vaccinator) on their individual risks and benefits of receiving the vaccine. Please refer to section 10.1 . Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 39 12/09/2023 Post Vaccination 12.1 Recording vaccination The individual should be given a record of vaccination and HSE advice leaflet for after vaccination. Vaccine administration should be recorded in the IT system. Record the \"USE BEFORE date and the batch number in the vaccination record (written on the vaccine box by the NCCS). 12.2 Observation period Cases of anaphylaxis have been reported fo llowing administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Please note that NIAC recommends a 15 minute observation period following administration of a homologous or heterologous booster COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Recommended observation period following vaccination (includes booster vaccination): All vaccine recipients (see exceptions below):15 minutes of observation Those with a history of mastocytosis: 30 minutes Those with immediate itching, swelling or urticarial reaction at the vaccination site: 30 minutes or longer as clinically indicated Vaccine recipients should be advised to seek urgent medical attention if they have symptoms suggestive of an allergic reaction such as difficulty breathing, feeling faint, rapid heartbeat or a skin rash. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 40 12/09/2023 Adverse Reactions 13.1 Adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccines Please refer to the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics for further details. The adverse events are listed below in Table 11 according to the following frequency: Very common ( 1/10), Common ( <1/1,000), Very rare (< 1/10,000). Table 11: Adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccines from clinical trials and post authorisation experience Type of Reaction Comirnaty\u00ae site pain, injection site swelling Local: Injection site tenderness, Injection site pain Local: injection site pain General: arthralgia, fatigue, fever, chills, headache, myalgia, diarrhea General: headache, or vomiting myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, General: myalgia, arthralgia, 1/10) Local: injection site erythema Local: Injection site redness, Injection site swelling Local: injection site swelling, injection site erythema General: nausea, vomiting, General: pyrexia chills, (>1/1,000 Local: injection site pruritus Local: injection site pruritus, injection site bruising, injection site warmth General: insomnia, extremity pain (refers to the vaccinated arm), hyperhidrosis, night sweats, decreased appetite, asthenia, malaise, lethargy, hypersensitivity 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 41 12/09/2023 Rare ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) General: acute peripheral facial paralysis Very rare (< 1/10,000) Myocarditis and pericarditis Not known (cannot be estimated from the available Data) Anaphylaxis, Facial swelling in those who have had dermatological fillers, Extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb, Erythema hypoaesthesia, Heavy menstrual bleeding** Myocarditis and pericarditis *Throughout the clinical trials, an increased incidence of hypertension following vaccination with Nuvaxovid (n=46, 1.0%) as compared to placebo (n=22, 0.6%) was observed in older adults during the 3 days following vaccination. **Most cases appeared to be non-serious and temporary in nature *** In participants 5 years of age and older, a higher freque ncy of lymphadenopathy was reported after a booster ( 2.8%) dose than after primary ( 0.9%) doses of the vaccine. Events of anaphylaxis have been reported after COVI D-19 vaccines. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine Very rare events of neuroinflammatory disorders have been reported following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines. A causal relationship has not been established A higher rate of pyrexia (after Comirnaty\u00ae) was seen after the second dose compared to the first dose. A higher rate of injection site reactions (redness, swelling, tenderness or pain), nausea or vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue and malaise, and pyrexia were seen after the second dose of Nuvaxovid\u00ae (Novavax). If required, symptomatic treatment with analgesic and/or anti-pyretic medicinal products (e.g. paracetamol containing products or ibuprofen) may be used. Note: Ibuprofen is not recommended for pregnant women. 13.2 Adverse events following Comirnaty\u00ae (Pfizer/BioNTech) and Spikevax\u00ae (Moderna) and very rare cases of Myocarditis and Pericarditis There has been an increase of very rare cases of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with both Comirnaty\u00ae and Spikevax. The cases occurred particularly in males aged under 30 years, and following the second dose of Spikevax. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 42 12/09/2023 Reporting rates for vaccine-associated myocarditis we re highest among males aged 12-29 years. In Israel, the estimated incidence 2 per 100,000 persons who had received at least one dose of Comirnaty\u00ae. The highest incidence of myocarditis was 10.7 per 100,000 in males aged 16-29 years. Most cases of myocarditis were mild or moderate in severity. Studies have shown that after the second dose of Comirnaty\u00ae there were about 2.6 extra cases of myocarditis per 100,000 males aged 12 - 29 years after se ven days and 5.7 extra cases of myocarditis per 100,000 males aged 16 - 24 years after 28 days. The rates for Spikevax were three to five times higher. The risk is lower following booster vaccination. The risk of vaccine associated myocarditis can be reduced by extending the interval between the first and se cond mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose in the primary schedule. Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. They should tell people receiving these vaccines to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis occur. These include: breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain. Healthcare professionals should consult applicable guidance and/or consult specialists (e.g. cardiologists) to diagnose and treat these conditions. 13.3 Adverse events following Nuvaxovid\u00ae (Novavax) and unknown frequency of cases of Myocarditis and Pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with Nuvaxovid\u00ae. These conditions can develop within a few days after va ccination and have primarily occurred within 14 days. The EMA concluded that the overall benefit risk remains favourable. Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis or pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general. The frequency of myocarditis and pericarditis after Nuvaxo vid\u00ae cannot be estimated from the available data. Myocarditis and pericarditis may present with chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations and fatigue. Most patients respond well to standard treatment, and the prognosis is good. However, it can occasionally progress to dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the si gns and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccine recipients should be advised to promptly seek m edical attention if they develop acute and persisting chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath in the days after vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult applicable guidance and/or consult a cardiologist for advice on Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 43 12/09/2023 management. 13.4 Reporting adverse reactions The HPRA is responsible for managing the national phar macovigilance system. The HPRA reports nationally occurring adverse reactions to the EMA. Adverse reaction reporting is an important part of the EMA intensive monitoring plan for COVID-19 vaccines, so that any changes in benefit risk balance can be promptly detected and acted upon. This enables the EMA to continue to safeguard public health safety. COVID-19 vaccines are subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals and members of the public are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to the HPRA following the instructions available on the HPRA website www.hpra.ie. As much information as is known should be provided, and w here possible, the vaccine batch number should be included. 13.5 Reporting of incidents during the vaccination session to HSE In the case of medication errors that directly involve the vaccine recipient, i.e. wrong medication/dose/route being administered or another medication error, the vaccinator must remain with the person and closely monitor them for any adverse reactions. The incident must be reported to the relevant line manager/person in charge as soon as possible. The incident and all actions taken must be recorded and the relevant National Incident Management Report Form (NIRF) completed as soon as is practicable after the event occurs and within one working day. (National Incident Report Form (NIRF 01 - V12)) (2021) available at: https://www.hse.ie/eng/about/qavd/incident-management/ The vaccine recipient and/or significant others should be informed of the incident. An incident report form must be completed by the vaccinator and forwarded to local or regional Risk Manager as per local policy. Any suspected adverse reactions associated with m edication errors should be reported to the HPRA as outlined above. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 44 12/09/2023 Guidance for vaccination of those who are contacts of a case of COVID-19 If a person is required to restrict their movements, they must not attend for vaccination until the period of restricted movements has been completed. See https://www.hpsc.ie/a- z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/contacttracingguidance/ Where vaccination is being carried out in Residential Care Facilities (residents and staff) the following advice applies: Primary vaccination: asymptomatic close contacts of cases of COVID-19 may receive COVID-19 vaccine. Asymptomatic individuals who have undergone testing for COVID-19 and who are residents in a long-term care facility should also proceed with vaccination while awaiting the results of their tests. Healthcare staff in LTCFs should follow all public health and occupational health guidance. www.hpsc.ie Vaccination is a low contact clinical activity. Hand hygiene, PPE and infection prevention and control guidance should be followed. See www.hpsc.ie for details. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 45 12/09/2023 Vaccination of children aged 5-11 years There are currently two COVID-19 vaccines available in age appropriate formulations for children aged 5-11 years in Ireland: Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms (0.2ml) o for primary course vaccination o may be used for booster vaccination if Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron XBB.1.5 for children aged 5-11 Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms o for booster vaccination only o Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron XBB.1.5 is the preferred vaccine for booster vaccination, however if this vaccine is unavailable then Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 for children aged 5-11 years may be used as an alternate for booster vaccination. Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 for children aged 5-11 years was first recommended for marketing authorisation by the European Medicines Agency on the 10th November 2022. It is an adapted vaccine which provides added protection against the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron (0.2ml) is licensed for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in children aged 5-11 years who have previously received at least a primary vaccination course against COVID-19. In December 2022, the EMA's Emergency Task Force concluded that Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 vaccines may be used in primary vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adults. Therefore, Comirnaty \u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms (0.2ml) for those aged 5-11 may be used for primary vaccination in previously unvaccinated children in this age group, and for an additional dose and booster vaccination. When used as a primary course, the dose and schedule of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 for this age group is 10 micrograms, two doses given 8 weeks apart (for immunocompromised children the two doses are recommended 4 weeks apart, see Table 1). A minimum interval of 3 weeks may be used if there is urgency to achieve protection. Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron XBB.1.5 for children aged 5-11 years was recommended for authorisation by the European Medicines Agency on 30th August 2023 . In its decision to recommend the authorisation, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) considered all the available data on Comirnaty\u00ae and its other adapted vaccines, including data on safety, efficacy and immunogenicity. In addition, the Committee assessed new laboratory data showing a strong response of the adapted vaccine against XBB.1.5 and related strains of the virus that causes COVID-19. Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms (0.2ml ) is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, in children aged 5 to 11 years. It should be used for booster vaccination only. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 46 12/09/2023 The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) recommends the preferential use of Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms (0.2ml) for booster vaccination of children aged 5-11 years when it becomes available in Ireland. In the interim, Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms (0.2ml) should continue to be used. 15.1 NIAC recommendation Following approval of the original Comirnaty\u00ae 10 micrograms (0.2ml) formulation for children aged 5-11 years by the EMA in November 2021, the NIAC has made the following recommendations: A primary course of COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for those aged 5 to 11 years: With underlying conditions Living with a younger child with complex medical needs Living with a person who is immunocompromised COVID-19 vaccination should be offered to all other children aged 5 to 11 years This is because of the favourable benefit risk profile of the vaccine, to protect them from severe disease and from the consequences that can foll ow infection e.g., multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), long COVID as we ll as psychosocial and developmental impacts. Children aged 5 to 11 years who are severely i mmunocompromised should be given a third dose of Comirnaty\u00ae 8 weeks after the second dose to complete the primary series (a minimal interval of 4 weeks between the second and third dose may be used if there is urgency to achieve protection). Before vaccination, parents or guardians should be informed of the known benefits, risks and uncertainties of COVID-19 vaccination. 15.2 Formulations for booster vaccination of those aged 5-11 years i) Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron XBB.1.5 10 micrograms (0.2ml) ii) Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms (0.2ml) Recommendations for booster vaccination of those aged 5-11 years A first mRNA COVID-19 booster vaccine is recommended for those aged 5 - 11 years with immunocompromise associated with a sub optimal response to vaccines at the time of their primary or additional vaccination (See Table 5a.2 areas shaded in blue). A first booster dose of Omicron should given to all those aged 5-11 years with immunocompromise associated with a suboptimal response to vaccines who have completed an extended primary vaccination course (three doses) after an interval of 4 months . In exceptional circumstances an interval of 3 mont hs may be used (e.g., in a person scheduled to commence chemotherapy). Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 47 12/09/2023 Children who have become immunocompromised since completing their primary vaccination course are expected to have mounted an adequate response to their primary vaccination. They do not require an additional dose (extended primary series). A first booster dose is recommended 4 months after completion of their primary course. Children aged 5-11 years with immunocom promise associated with a sub-optimal response to vaccination are recommended to receive further COVID-19 booster vaccines in both Spring and Autumn 2023 (see Table 1). Children aged 5-11 years with an underlying medical co ndition associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation, severe disease, or death are recommended to receive a booster vaccine in Autumn 2023 (see Table 1). For healthy children aged under 12 years COVID-19 booster vaccination is not recommended. Recommended intervals for Spring and Autumn booster vaccinations 2023: For those aged 5-11 years with immunocompromis e associated with a sub-optimal response to vaccination, an interval of 6 months is recommended following any previous COVID-19 vaccine dose or SARS-CoV-2 infection. For those aged 5-11 years with medical conditi ons associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation, severe disease or death, for whom a COVID-19 booster vaccine in Autumn 2023 is recommended, an interval of 9 months from previous COVID-19 vaccine dose or SARS-CoV-2 infection is recommended. Healthy children aged 5-11 years are not recommended a booster vaccine in either Spring or Autumn 2023. For more information on the recommended intervals for Spring and Autumn boosters for eligible children aged 5-11 years, please see Table 1. The decision to accept, defer or refuse vaccination for a child should be respected. 15.3 Vaccine storage for Comirnaty\u00ae formulations for those aged 5-11 years The following is applicable to both formulations (0.2ml) : The vaccine is delivered from the manufacturer to the HSE NCCS at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C and this storage condition is continued as the vaccine is stored in an ULT freezer at - 90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C. The vaccine is supplied to sites/clinics by the HSE NCCS at +2 to +8\u00b0C with a shelf life of up to 10 weeks. This new \"use before\" time and date is labelled by NCCS once vials are removed from ULT. The vaccine in each multi-dose vial requires dilution with 1.3ml of 0.9% sodium chloride. 0.9% sodium chloride is supplied separately to the vaccine and should be stored at room temperature. Undiluted vials of Comirnaty\u00ae (Pfizer/BioNTech) have a shelf life of 10 weeks when stored at +2 to +8\u00b0C (labelled \"use before\" time and date) and up to 12 hours at up to +30\u00b0C. After dilution, the vaccine must be kept at +2\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C and used within 12 hours after which the vial must be discarded.

The dose of the diluted Comirnaty\u00ae for children 5-11 years vaccine is 0.2ml. Dosage of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms (0.2ml) when for Two doses of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms/dose for children aged 5-11 years are required for primary vaccination. The dose of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 depends on the age at the time of vaccination i.e., an 11- year-old child who receives the first dose of 10 micrograms Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 and who is 12 years of age at the time of their second dose, should receive the 30 microgram dose of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 as a second dose. This is a different dose compared to the dose for those aged 12 years. This image shows the children's formulation (5-11 years) 15.5 Interval between doses (of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms (0.2ml) when used for primary vaccination of children aged 5-11 years) The recommended interval between doses is 8 weeks5 (for immunocompromised children the recommended interval between dose one and dose two is 4 weeks ). If the interval between doses is longer than the recommended interval, the second dose should be given as soon as possible. The course does not need to be restarted. If the second dose is given more than four days before the minimum interval, this is not considered a valid dose. A third dose should be given at least eight weeks after the second (invalid) dose. A minimum interval of 21 days may be used if there is urgency to achieve protection. For those who are immunocompromised a third dose should be given at least four weeks after the second (invalid) dose. An additional dose of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms (0.2ml) as part of an extended primary series should be given to thos e aged 5-11 years with immunocompromise, see Table 1. 5Note that the day the first dose of vaccine is given is day 0 Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 50 12/09/2023 Interval between 1st and 2nd Doses Action required Less than 17 days This is not considered a valid dose. A third dose should be given at least 8 weeks after the second (invalid) dose. A minimum interval of 21 days may be used if there is urgency to achieve protection. For those who are immunocompromised a third dose should be given at least 4 weeks after the second (invalid) dose. 17 days to 8 weeks (4 weeks for immunocompromised children) No further action needed. This is a valid dose. Longer than 8 weeks (Longer than 4 weeks for immunocompromised children) Give the second dose as soon as possible. The course does not need to be restarted. Prior to vaccination Check valid consent has been obtained Check for contraindications or precautions See later in this chapter and the NIAC Immunisation guidelines for COVID-19 available at https://www.rcpi.ie/healthcare-leadership/ niac/immunisation-guidelines-for-ireland Vaccinators who are vaccinating using a medicines protocol should check vaccine recipient's eligibility under the protocol Check the interval when administering a second dose Explain the procedure Answer questions Maintain privacy & dignity 15.6 Infection prevention and control Prior to preparation and administration of CO VID-19 vaccines, hand hygiene should be performed as per the \"WHO five moments of hand hygiene\" with emphasis on: Before vaccine preparation Before drawing up and administering the vaccine Before and after each recipient contact PPE should be worn as per HPSC guidance for healthcare staff. It is not necessary to use a skin disinfectant prior to injection. If the skin at the injection site is visibly dirty, clean with soap and water. If an alcohol swab is used, delay injection for 30 seconds, to ensure the alcohol has evaporated. Gloves are not routinely recommended for vaccine preparation and administration There is no need to routinely check temperature either at registration or before vaccination. Follow HPSC standard precautions (sharps management, healthcare waste management etc.) National Clinical Guideline No. 30 (2023) - Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a057e-infection-prevention-and-control-ipc/ .

Prior to dilution Perform hand hygiene Check you are using the correct formulation Verify that the vial has an orange plastic cap and the product name is: Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 XBB.1.5 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection. Preparation for dilution Prepare the equipment needed for dilution: A clean tray One multidose vial of Comirnaty\u00ae for 5-11 years. One plastic ampoule of Sodium Chloride 0.9% Solution for Injection This should not be kept in the fridge A needle and a syringe to dilute Needles and syringes will be supplied Two 70% alcohol swabs Check the use before date and time on the box containing the vials. Before dilution mix by inverting vaccine vial gently 10 times, do not shake. Inspect the liquid in the vial prior to dilution, the liquid is a white to off-white suspension and may contain opaque amorphous particles. Do not use if the liquid is discoloured or if other particles are observed. Dilution Take one ampoule of sodium chloride and check expiry date. Clean with 70% alcohol swab Open the ampoule by twisting the cap Connect the syringe tightly (No needle is required) Follow Aseptic technique Do not touch the key parts of the ampoule & syringe Withdraw 1.3 ml of Sodium Chloride 0.9% Solution for Injection Cross check with colleague Discard the ampoule and any remaining diluent in it Attach needle to the syringe Insert diluent into the vaccine vial Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 52 12/09/2023 You may feel some pressure in the vial as you add the diluent Do not remove the needle and syringe from the vial unt il you have equalised the vial pressure by slowly withdrawing 1.3 ml of air into the empty diluent syringe before removing the needle from the vial Gently invert the diluted solution 10 times, do not shake Inspect the vial The diluted vaccine should be an off-white suspension Do not use if vaccine is discoloured or contains particulate matter Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 53 12/09/2023 Labelling the diluted vial Label the diluted vial with the discard time and date (12 hours after time of dilution) using a 24-hour format. Do not use it after this time and date e.g., time of dilution was 08.00 20/09/2023. The discard time and date is 20.00 20//09/2023 After dilution, the vial contains 2.6 ml from which 10 doses of 0.2ml can be extracted The volume of each dose is smaller than the adult dose Diluted vaccines can be stored between +2\u00b0C and +30\u00b0C but must be used within 12 hours following dilution Bring the vial to your vaccination table/site. Vaccine Dose Preparation Check that the time of vaccine dilution was within the last 12 hours Perform hand hygiene Clean top of vial with a single use 70% alcohol swab and allow it to air dry fully Attach 23 gauge / 25 gauge in size and 25mm in length needle to 1ml syringe The needle size is the same as for those aged 12 years and older Withdraw 0.2 ml of diluted product Make sure correct dose is drawn up as smaller dose may not provide protection Before the needle is withdrawn ensure all air bubbles have been removed Do not change the needle between the vial and the patient unless the needle is contaminated or damaged. 15.8 Vaccine Administration of Comirnaty\u00ae for 5-11 years. Administer vaccine to patient intramuscularly, into the deltoid muscle Dispose the syringe and the needle into the sharps bin If more than ten 0.2ml doses can be safely and accura tely withdrawn from a diluted vial, they can be used as valid doses There is a maximum of 12 doses in each vial Do not leave the empty vials unattended Dispose the empty vials safely into a sharps bin Low dead space syringes should be used if available in order to maximise the number of doses that can be drawn from the vial There should be no pooling of vaccine solution from different vials. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 54 12/09/2023 15.9 Method of IM Vaccine Administration Intramuscular injection technique for children aged 5-11 is the same as for older children and adults Vaccine to be given Intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle The light triangle in figure indicates site for IM injection into the deltoid muscle The upper border of the triangle is approximately two finger-breadths below the acromion process and the apex is at the midpoint of the humerus The needle size for IM injection is the same as that for adults (23 gauge / 25 gauge in size and 25mm in length needle ) At the injection site spread the skin taut between the thumb and forefinger with the non- dominant hand Do not bunch up the skin as this leads to administering the vaccine into subcutaneous tissue inadvertently Further information is available at www.immunisation.ie 15.10 Positioning for vaccination For younger/smaller children: The child sits on the parent/carer's lap or stands in front of them as they sit The parent/carer embraces the child during the process, holding both the child's arms as they do so both of the child's legs are anchored between the parent/carer's thighs Source: Immunisation guidelines of the NIAC Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 55 12/09/2023 Alternative positioning Sit child facing to the side. One arm is tucked under the parent/carer's armpit (A cuddle position) Source: Australian Immunisation handbook For older/bigger children It may be appropriate to ask the parent/carer and the child the preferred sitting position for vaccine administration They may prefer to sit on the parent/carer's lap or to sit independently 15.11 Techniques for vaccinating children Be honest and calm. Take time to explain in simple terms what to expect. Explain that the child may feel a little pinch and it will go away very quickly. Use words like \"pressure\" or \"pinch\" rather than \"pain\" or \"shot\" Distraction techniques can help in reducing pain and anxiety during vaccination. Keep the distraction going after the vaccine is given Looking at toys, books, etc. Pointing out interesting things in the room Telling or reading stories Taking deep breaths to help \"blow out\" the pain Counting to five backwards What to do if the child does not want to be vaccinated Only one person should hold the child for vaccination at any time (to avoid risk of needle stick injury) If the child cannot be held/positioned by the parent/carer so that vaccination is possible, then the child should not be vaccinated Repeated attempts to vaccinate the child are unlikely to help Check with your clinical lead for advice It may be better to bring the child back another time With the parent if parent was not present. They may benefit from vaccination during quiet times Prevention and Management of Syncope in Vaccination Clinics Syncope is rare in younger children, it is more common in adolescents Syncope episodes mostly occur within 15 minutes of vaccine administration Reassurance about the procedure may help to prevent fainting Recipients should be seated (or lying down - if past history of fainting) when being administered their vaccines in case of an immediate faint There should be facilities in place in case of fainting So that the person can be placed in a recumbent position/lie down or sit with head between knees Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 56 12/09/2023 for several minutes if lying down is not possible It may be helpful to loosen any tight clothing and apply cool, damp cloths to the person's face and neck Further information is available on the www.immunisation.ie and at https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisa tion/hcpinfo/covid19vaccineinfo4hps/ 15.12 Contraindications and precautions to COVID-19 vaccination in 5-11 years for Comirnaty\u00ae (serious systemic allergic reaction r equiring medical intervention) following a previous dose of the vaccine or any of its constituents (including polyethylene glycol (PEG) and trometamol). Anaphylaxis after an mRNA vaccine Appropriate support should be available in case of anaphylaxis or fainting after vaccine administration. Precautions should be in place to minimise injury from fainting Precautions: Acute severe illness; defer until recovery Previous history of myocarditis or pericarditis afte r any COVID-19 vaccine - seek specialist advice (i.e. consult with a Cardiologist) Vaccination should be postponed in children with a previous history of MIS-C, until clinical recovery or until 90 days or more since diagnosis, whichever is the longer. There should be an interval of at least 4 weeks between mpox/smallpox vaccine and a subsequent COVID-19 vaccine because of the unknown risk of myocarditis. If vaccination is advised for a child with prior history of mastocytosis, observe for 30 minutes after vaccination. For full list of contraindications and precautions see Table 5a.3 of the NIAC Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland. The following are not contraindications or precautions to vaccination: Food allergy (non-anaphylactic) Family history of allergy, including anaphylaxis Previous local reaction to any vaccine Underlying asthma Hay fever Hereditary angioedema Contact dermatitis to PEG containing cosmetic product NSAID allergy Chronic spontaneous urticaria Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 57 12/09/2023 15.13 Post-vaccination Procedures Documentation post vaccination Record vaccine batch number in the record/IT system It will automatically link to the expiry date, so there is no need to record the expiry date Boxes delivered by NCCS will be labelled with a Use before date and time This use before date and time should be recorded in the patient record Give record card to vaccinee or parent/guardian Give post vaccination information sheet to vaccinee or parent/guardian Observation post-vaccination Vaccine recipients: 15 minutes of observation Those with a history of mastocytosis: 30 minutes of observation Those with immediate itching, swelling or urticarial reaction at the vaccination site: 30 minutes or longer as clinically indicated Advice following vaccination Give the parent/carer the after-care leaflet information Parent/carer should be advised that COVID-19 vaccines may cause a fever which usually resolves within 48 hours. This is a common, expected reaction and isolation and further investigation is not required unless COVID-19 is suspected If fever lasts for > 48 hours, or if other symptoms of COVID-19 are present, the person should self- isolate and seek medical advice Paracetamol or ibuprofen can be taken after vaccination if the child develops pain, fever or myalgia Advise the child's parent/carer that vaccinated children may still get infected and transmit the virus so they should continue to follow all current public health guidance to protect themselves and others Please refer to the NIAC immunisation guidelines available at https://www.rcpi.ie/healthcare- leadership/niac/immunisation-guidelines-for-ireland 15.14 - 10 micrograms (0.2ml) for those aged 5-11 years The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 is inferred from safety data for a booster dose of an Omicron BA.1 adapted vaccine, as well as for a booster dose of Comirnaty\u00ae Original. Common adverse events following administration of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 are listed below, a full list of adverse reactions may be found in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Local: Very common: injection site pain, swelling Common: injection site redness General: common: arthralgia, chills, diarrhoea, fatigue, headache, 10 micrograms (0.2ml) for The safety of Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron XBB.1.5 is inferred from safety data of the prior Comirnaty\u00ae vaccine. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 58 12/09/2023 Myocarditis and pericarditis Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions of the heart. Symptoms can vary but often include breathlessness, palpitations and chest pain. An EMA review listed Pericarditis and Myocarditis as a very rare side effect of Comirnaty \u00ae vaccine. The risk is highest in younger males and is more often observed after the second dose. Two European studies have estimated the risk of myocarditis after the second dose of the vaccine: One additional case for every 38,000 men aged 12 to 29 (within 7 days) One additional case for every 17,500 men aged 16-24 (within 28 days) Data are very limited on those 5 to 11 years of age. Myocarditis has also been associated with COVID-19 infection and these events can also occur in all age groups unrelated to vaccines or toCOVID-19. Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is similar to the typical course of these conditions and in most individuals, symptoms resolved with conservative management. The long-term follow- up of these cases is ongoing. Reporting of adverse events following immunisation Adverse Events Following Immunisation should be reported to the HPRA: https://www.hpra.ie/homepage/about-us/repor t-an-issue/human-adverse-reaction-form 15.15 Clinical considerations Vaccination after COVID-19 infection Unvaccinated Those who are unvaccinated and develop SARS-CoV-2 infection should complete a primary vaccination course, with the first dose at least four weeks after diagnosis or onset of symptoms, or four weeks from the first PCR positiv e specimen in those who are asymptomatic. Those with persisting symptoms following COVID-19 may be vaccinated, unless there is evidence of recent clinical deterioration. Partially vaccinated Those who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection after their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine should be given the subsequent dose at least eight weeks after diagnosis or onset of symptoms. If those who are immunocompromised have SARS-CoV-2 infection more than seven days after the second vaccine dose, a third dose of the primary series is not required. They should proceed to their first booster dose as per Table 1 (or Table 5a.1 of the NIAC Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland). For those with infection within seven days of their second dose they should complete the extended primary series after an interval of 4-8 weeks. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 59 12/09/2023 Booster vaccination Those children who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection after completing their primary series (i.e., a breakthrough infection), should proceed to booster vaccination if eligible as recommended in Table 1. Co-administration with other vaccines COVID-19 vaccine may be given at the same time or at any interval as other vaccines (live and non- live) including influenza vaccine and the vaccines administered in the school immunisations programme. The only exception to this is children who have received mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) vaccine. In this instance, there shoul d be at least a 4 week interval between mpox vaccine and a subsequent COVID- 19 vaccine. Children who are immunocompromised Children who are immunocompromised due to disease or treatment may be vaccinated if they have no contraindications. Data indicates that those with severe immunocompromise do not have adequate protection following a primary COVID-19 vaccine course. There is evidence that protection can be enhanced by an additional mRNA vaccine dose, representing an extension of the primary vaccination series. See Table 5a.2 of the NIAC guidelines for conditions that may be associated with a suboptimal response to vaccines. An additional dose of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms (0.2ml) should be given to those aged 5-11 years with immunocompromise associated with a suboptimal response to vaccines at the time of vaccination, who have completed their primary course. This is an extended primary vaccination course. Children who are severely immunocompromised at the time of vaccination can have the additional (3 rd dose) 8 weeks after the second dose (a minimal interval of 4 four weeks between the second and third dose may be used if there is urgency to achieve protection). Children with planned immunosuppressing therapy should ideally complete vaccination two weeks before treatment. The recommended minimum interval may be used. Specialists should consider the child's risk and likelihood of disease exposure, and provide advice based on knowledge and understanding of their immune status and likely immune response to vaccination. Booster vaccination of children who are immunocompromised A booster dose is recommended for children aged 5 - 11 years with immunocompromise associated with a sub optimal response to vaccines at the time of their primary vaccination. A booster dose is also recommended in ch ildren who have become immunocompromised following their primary vaccination course. A first booster dose of Comirnaty\u00ae Omicron (0.2ml) is unavailable) is recommended at least 4 months after the last vaccine dose. In exceptional circumstances, a 3 month interval may be used (see Table 1). Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 60 12/09/2023 In individuals who have had a laboratory-confirmed /antigen positive with symptoms breakthrough infection following their last dose of vaccine of the primary vaccination series, the first booster dose should be delayed for at least 4 months. In exceptional circumstances a 3 month interval may be used. Children aged 5-11 years with immunocom promise associated with a sub-optimal response to vaccination are recommended to receive further COVID-19 booster vaccines in both Spring and Autumn 2023. Children aged 5-11 years with an underlying medical condition associ ated with a higher risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation, severe disease, or death are recommended to receive a booster vaccine in Autumn 2023. For information on recommended intervals for Spring and Autumn boosters for eligible children aged 5-11 years, please see Table 1. Vaccination of those with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulants Individuals with a bleeding disorder or receivi ng anticoagulant therapy may develop haematomas in IM injection sites. Prior to vaccination, inform the parent or guardian about this risk. For those with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 x 109 /L consult the supervising consultant. People with mild bleeding disorders or on maintenance dose Emicizumab (Hemlibra) do not require haemostatic cover for vaccination. Those with inherited coagulopathies who require fa ctor replacement therapy should receive it on the day of vaccination, prior to the IM vaccination. If there is uncertainty about the need for replacement therapy, contact the child's supervising consultant. Those receiving long-term anticoagulation with either Warfarin or heparin are not considered to be at higher risk of bleeding complications following vaccination. There is no reason to expect that there is a greater risk of bleeding complications with the oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents, than with other anticoagulants. See Chapter 2 of the NIAC guidelines, sections 2.4.6 and 2.4.7 for further information, including technique for IM injection, in this patient group. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 61 12/09/2023 Vaccination of Children Aged 6 months to 4 years: Comirnaty\u00ae 3 MICROGRAMS/DOSE CONCENTRAT E FOR DISPERSION FOR INJECTION (INFANTS AND CHILDREN 6 MONTHS TO 4 YEARS) For children aged 6 months to 4 years, the recommended COVID-19 vaccine is Comirnaty\u00ae 3 micrograms. Comirnaty\u00ae 3 micrograms is licensed for active i mmunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus in children aged 6 months to 4 years. The dose of Comirnaty\u00ae for children aged 6 months to 4 years is 3 micrograms (0.2ml). The primary course for all children in this age group is three doses with an interval of 3 weeks between dose one and two, and an interval of 8 weeks between dose two and three. 16.1 NIAC Recommendation Following the approval of Comirnaty\u00ae by the EMA for children aged 6 months to 4 years in October 2022, NIAC has made the following recommendations: A primary course of COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for those aged 6 months-4 years with underlying conditions that place them at higher risk of severe COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination should be offered to all others aged 6 months-4 years because of: the protection provided against severe COVID-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and their late consequences the enhanced protection vaccination gives to those who have had COVID-19 infection the modest protection for reducing transmission to household contacts e.g. immunocompromised and those too young for vaccination. the safety profile of the vaccines similar vaccine immunogenicity to that in older children and adolescents. Before vaccination, parents/guardians should be informed of the known benefits, risks, and uncertainties of COVID-19 vaccination. Booster dose Currently, the recommendation for vaccination in this age group is a primary course of three doses of Comirnaty\u00ae 3 micrograms (see Table 1 of this document). There is currently no recommendation for additional doses or boosters in this age group, regardless of whether immunocompromise is present. The decision to accept, defer, or refuse vaccination for a child should be respected. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 62 12/09/2023 16.2 Vaccine storage From delivery by the manufacturer to the NCCS the vaccine is stored at -90\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C. The vaccine is supplied to sites/clinics by the NCCS at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C with a shelf life of up to 10 weeks. Vials should be stored in pharmaceutical fridge between +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C. The new \"use before \"date and time is on the \"HSE Scan me label\" which has been affixed by the NCCS once vials are removed from ULT freezer. Do not refreeze vials. The vaccine in each multi-dose vial requires 2.2ml of 0.9% sodium chloride. 0.9% sodium chloride is supplied separately to the vaccine and should be stored at room temperature. Undiluted vials of Comirnaty\u00ae 6 months to 4 years (Maroon Cap) have a shelf life of up to 10 weeks. Prior to use, the unopened vials can be stored for up to 12 hours at temperatures between +8 \u00b0C and +30 \u00b0C. After dilution, the vaccine must be kept at +2\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C and used within 12 hours, after which the vial must be discarded. Summary of Comirnaty\u00ae 3 micrograms/dose Title Description Name of vaccine Comirnaty\u00ae 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection injections Number of doses in each vial Post-dilution 10 doses If more than 10 doses can be accurately withdrawn from a diluted vial, it is a valid dose. No more than 12 doses are available. Dilution Yes, dilute with 0.9% sodium chloride (supplied separately). Latex The vial stopper does not contain latex. Preservatives No Dosage 0.2ml Number of doses required 3 Interval between doses The recommended interval is 3 weeks between dose one and two and an interval of 8 weeks between dose two and three. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 63 12/09/2023 16.3 Vaccine dose The vaccine for children aged 6 months to 4 years contains a lower dose of antigen (3 micrograms per dose) than for other age groups. The dose of the diluted vaccine is 0.2ml. Three doses of Comirnaty\u00ae 3 micrograms (0.2ml) are required for full protection in children aged 6 months to 4 years. The dose of Comirnaty\u00ae depends on the age at the time of the vaccination e.g., a 4 year old child should receive the first dose of Comirnaty\u00ae 3 micrograms (0.2ml) and if they have turned 5 years of age at the time of a subsequent dose, the dose given should be Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms. Therefore, if a child becomes five years of age before completion of the recommended course, the schedule should be completed with the age appropriate dose, Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 microgram as follows: If they have received one dose of Comirnaty\u00ae 3 microgr ams: leave an interval of 3 weeks, then give two doses of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms 8 weeks apart If they have received two doses of Comirnaty\u00ae 3 micrograms: leave an interval of 8 weeks, then give one dose of Comirnaty\u00ae Original/Omicron BA.4-5 10 micrograms Interval between doses The date of administration of the first dose is to be calculated as Day 0. If the interval between doses is longer than the reco mmended interval, the next dose should be given as soon as possible. The course does not need to be restarted. If the second dose is given more than four days before the minimum interval this is not considered a valid dose. A further dose should be given at least eight weeks after the invalid dose. If the third dose is given more than four days before the minimum interval this is not a valid dose. A minimum interval of 21 days may be used if there is urgency to achieve protection. A further dose should be given at least eight weeks after the invalid dose. Interval between 1 st and 2nd doses Action required Less than 17 days This is not considered a valid vaccine. Another dose should be given at least 8 weeks after the invalid vaccine. The third valid dose should then be given a further 8 weeks after the second valid dose. Between 17 to 21 days No further action needed (this is a valid vaccine). Longer than 3 weeks/21 days Give the second dose as soon as possible. The course does not need to be restarted. Interval between 2nd and 3rd doses Action required Less than 17 days This is not considered a valid vaccine. Another dose should be given at least 8 weeks after the invalid vaccine to complete the primary course. Between 17 to 56 days No further action needed (this is a valid Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 64 12/09/2023 vaccine). Longer than 8 weeks/56 days Give the third dose as soon as possible. The course does not need to be restarted. 16.4 Prior to vaccination Check valid consent has been obtained from a parent of legal guardian. Check for contraindications or precautions o See later in this chapter and the NIAC Imm unisation guidelines for COVID-19 available at https://rcpi.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/IO_15ead882-dd37-4d61-a213- b692c930564c/ Vaccinators who are vaccinating using a medicines protocol should check vaccine recipient's eligibility under the protocol Check the interval when administering a second or third dose Explain the procedure Answer questions Maintain privacy and dignity 16.5 Consumables needed Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles are recommended. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. For dilution- 3ml syringes should be used and needle (length and size) 25 mm ,23-25 gauge (21 gauge or narrower needle) For administration- 1ml syringes should be used and needle (length and size) 25 mm ,23-25 gauge Ampoules of Sodium Chloride 0.9% Solution for Injection will also be required. You will need 2.2ml of Sodium Chloride (0.9%) to dilute every vial 16.6 Infection prevention and control Prior to preparation and administration of COVID-19 vaccines, hand hygiene should be performed as per the \"WHO five moments of hand hygiene\" with emphasis on: o Before vaccine preparation o Before drawing up and administering the vaccine o Before and after each recipient contact PPE should be worn if necessary as per the current HPSC guidance for healthcare staff. It is not necessary to use a skin disi nfectant prior to injection. If the skin at the injection site is visibly dirty, clean with soap and water. If an alcohol swab is used, delay injection for 30 seconds, to ensure the alcohol has evaporated. Gloves are not routinely recommended for vaccine preparation and administration There is no need to routinely check temperature either at registration or before vaccination. Follow HPSC standard precautions (sharps management, healthcare waste management etc.) National Clinical Guideline No. 30 (2023) - Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/a057e-infection-prevention-and-control-ipc/ .

Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 65 12/09/2023 Vaccine Dilution and Preparation for Administration Figure 1: Image of the vial Prior to dilution Perform hand hygiene Check that you are using the correct formulation o Verify that the vial of Comirnaty\u00ae COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty\u00ae MICROGRAMS/DOSE CONCENTRATE FOR DISPERSION FOR INJECTION (INFANTS AND CHILDREN 6 MONTHS TO 4 YEARS) Figure 2: Mixing Prior to Dilution Preparation for dilution Prepare the equipment needed for dilution: A clean tray One Comirnaty\u00ae COVID-19 mRNA vaccine multidose vial One plastic ampoule of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection o This should not be kept in the fridge A needle and a syringe to dilute (using a 21 gauge or narrower needle) Two 70% alcohol swabs Check the use before date and time on the box containing the vials. Before dilution mix by inverting vaccine vial gently 10 times, do not shake. Inspect the liquid in the vial prior to dilution, the liquid is a white to off-white suspension and may contain opaque amorphous particles. Do not use if the liquid is discoloured or if other particles are observed. Dilution Dilution is undertaken using aseptic techniques Take one ampoule of sodium chloride and check expiry date Clean with 70% alcohol swab Open the ampoule by twisting the cap Connect the syringe tightly (No needle is required) Follow aseptic technique o Do not touch the key parts of the ampoule and syringe Withdraw 2.2ml of sodium chloride 0.9% solution for injection Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 66 12/09/2023 Figure 3: Dilution with 2.2 mL of sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) Figure 4: Pull back plunger to 2.2 mL to remove air from vial Figure 5: Invert the diluted solution o NB: The volume of diluent is different than for other age groups Cross check with a colleague Attach the needle to the syringe Insert diluent into the vaccine vial (Figure 3) You may feel some pressure in the vial as you add the diluent Do not remove the needle and syringe from the vial until you have equalised the vial pressure by slowly withdrawing 2.2ml of air into the empty diluent syringe before removing the needle from the vial (Figure 4) Gently invert the diluted solution 10 times. Do not shake. Inspect the vial The diluted vaccine should be an off-white suspension Do not use if vaccine is discoloured or contains particulate matter Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 67 12/09/2023 Labelling the diluted vial Label the diluted vial with the discard time and date (12 hours after time of dilution) using a 24-hour format. Do not use it after this date o E.g. time of dilution was 08:00 20/12/2022. The discard time and date is 20:00 20/12/2022. After dilution, the vial contains up to 12 doses of 0.2ml. o The volume of each dose is smaller than the adult dose. Be alert that this volume is the same volume as that given to 5 to 11 year olds, but the dose is different (3 micrograms per dose for 6 months to 4 year old and 10 micrograms per dose for 5 to 11 year olds). Diluted vaccines can be stored between +2\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C but must be used within 12 hours following dilution. Bring the vial to your vaccination table/site. Vaccine Dose Preparation Check that the time of vaccine dilution was within the last 12 hours. Perform hand hygiene Clean top of vial with a single use 70% alcohol swab and allow it to air dry fully Attach 25mm, 23-25 gauge needle to 1ml syringe Withdraw 0.2ml of diluted product. Make sure the correct dose is drawn up as a smaller dose may not provide protection Before the needle is withdrawn, ensure all air bubbles have been removed Do not change the needle between the vial and patient unless the needle is contaminated or damaged. Figure 6: Label the diluted vial with the discard time and date Figure 7: Withdraw 0.2ml of diluted product Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 68 12/09/2023 16.7 Vaccine Administration Administer the vaccine to the patient intramuscularly (via IM injection) o For infants aged 6 months to 11 months, the recommended injection site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh. o For children aged 1 year to 3 years of age, either the anterolateral aspect of the thigh or the deltoid muscle can be used as the injection site. o For children aged 3 years and older, the recommended injection site is the deltoid muscle. Dispose the syringe and the needle into the sharps bin If more than ten 0.2ml doses can be safely and accu rately withdrawn from a diluted vial, they can be used as valid doses. There is a maximum of 12 doses in each vial Do not leave the empty vials unattended Dispose of the empty vials safely into a sharps bin Low dead space syringes and needles should be used if available in order to maximise the number of doses that can be drawn from the vial There should be no pooling of vaccine solution from different vials Method of IM Vaccine Administration Intramuscular injection technique is to be used o For infants aged 6 months to 11 months, the recommended injection site is the vastus lateralis muscle (anterolateral aspect of the thigh). o For children aged 1 year to 3 years of age, either the deltoid muscle or the vastus lateralis muscle (anterolateral aspect of the thigh) can be used as the injection site. o For children aged 3 years and older, the recommended injection site is the deltoid muscle. IM injection into the deltoid muscle The light triangle in the below figure indicates the site for IM injection into the deltoid muscle. The upper border of the triangle is approximately two finger-breadths / 2.5cms below the acromion process and the apex is at the midpoint of the humerus. Figure 8: IM injection site into the deltoid muscle Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 69 12/09/2023 IM injection site is the Vastus lateralis muscle The vastus lateralis muscle is located on the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, from one of the patient's hand breadths below the greater trochanter to one hand's breath above the knee. The middle third of the muscle is the site for injections. The width of the injection site extends from the mid-line of the thigh anteriorly to the mid-line of the outer thigh. The injection site is the middle third of the Vastus lateralis, in the anterolateral thigh (shaded area) Figure 9: IM injection site into the middle third of the vastus lateralis At the injection site (whether using deltoid or vastus lateralis), spread the skin taut between the thumb and forefinger with the non-dominant hand. Do not bunch up the skin as this leads to administering the vaccine into subcutaneous tissue inadvertently. Further information is available at https://rcpi.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/IO_67b1011b- 87ed-4b8a-94ac-416bfe112caa/ Positioning for vaccination For infants: Sit the infant on parent/guardian's lap, facing to the side. One arm is tucked under the parent/guardian's armpit (cuddle position). The infant's other arm is held in the parent/guardian's arms. Both of the infant's legs are anchored between the parent/guardian's thighs Figure 10: Postioning of infants ( Source: Australian Immunisation handbook) Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 70 12/09/2023 For older children: The child sits on the parent/guardian's lap or stands in front of them while the parent/guardian is sitting The parent/guardian embraces the child during the process, holding both the child's arms as they do so both of the child's legs are anchored between the parent/guardian's thighs Some children may prefer to sit on the guardian/parent's lap or sit independently Alternatively, the positioning for infants may also be used Figure 11: Positioning for older children ( Source: Immunisation Guidelines of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee) Techniques for vaccinating children Be honest and calm. Take time to explain in simple terms what to expect. Explain that the child may feel a little pinch and it will go away very quickly. Use words like \"pressure\" or \"pinch\" rather than \"pain\" or \"shot\" Distraction techniques can help in reducing pain and anxiety during vaccination. If possible, keep the distraction going after the vaccine is given. o Looking at toys, books, etc. o Pointing out interesting things in the room o Telling or reading stories o Taking deep breaths to help \"blow out\" the pain o Counting from 5 backwards What to do if the child does not want to be vaccinated Only one person should hold the child for vaccination at any time (to minimise risk of needle stick injury) If the child cannot be held/positioned by the parent/carer so that vaccination is possible, then the child should not be vaccinated Repeated attempts to vaccinate the child are unlikely to help Check with your clinical lead for advice It may be better to bring the child back another time with a parent/guardian if they were not present They may benefit from vaccination during quiet times Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 71 12/09/2023 Prevention and Management of Syncope in Vaccination Clinics Syncope is rare in babies and young children; it is more common in adolescents Syncope episodes mostly occur within 15 minutes of vaccine administration Reassurance about the procedure may help to prevent fainting Recipients should be seated (or lying down, if past history of fainting) when being administered their vaccines in case of an immediate faint There should be facilities in place in case of fainting o So that the patient can be placed in a recumbent position/lie down or sit with head between knees for several minutes if lying down is not possible It may be helpful to loosen any tight clothing and apply cool, damp cloths to the person's face and neck Further information is available at www.immunisation.ie and at https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisa tion/hcpinfo/covid19vaccineinfo4hps/ 16.8 Contraindications and precautions to COVID-19 vaccination in children aged 6 months to 4 years Contraindications Anaphylaxis following a previous dose of the vaccine or any of its constituents (including polyethylene glycol (PEG) and trometamol). Appropriate support should be available in case of anaphylaxis or fainting after vaccine administration. Precautions should be in place to minimise injury from fainting. Precautions Acute severe illness; defer until recovery. Previous history of myocarditis or pericarditis after any COVID-19 vaccine - seek specialist advice. Vaccination should be postponed in children with a previous history of MIS-C, until clinical recovery or until 90 days or more since diagnosis, whichever is the longer. The following are not contraindications or precautions to vaccination: Food allergy (non-anaphylactic) Family history of allergy, including anaphylaxis Previous local reaction to any vaccine Underlying asthma Hay fever Hereditary angioedema Contact dermatitis to PEG containing cosmetic product NSAID allergy Chronic spontaneous urticaria 16.9 Post-vaccination Procedures Documentation post-vaccination Record vaccine batch number in the record/IT system o It will automatically link to the expiry date, so there is no need to record the expiry date Boxes delivered by NCCS will be labelled with a \"use before\" date and time This \"use before\" date and time should be recorded in the patient record Give the record card to the parent/guardian Observation post-vaccination Vaccine recipients: 15 minutes of observation Those with a history of mastocytosis: 30 minutes of observation Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 72 12/09/2023 Those with immediate itching, swelling or urticarial reaction at the vaccination site: 30 minutes or longer as clinically indicated Advice following vaccination Parent/guardian should be advised that COVID-19 vaccines may cause a fever which usually resolves within 48 hours. This is a common, expected reaction and isolation and further investigation is not required unless COVID-19 is suspected. If fever lasts for >48 hours, or if other symptoms of COVID-19 are present, the person should self- isolate and seek medical advice Paracetamol or ibuprofen can be taken after vaccination if the child develops pain, fever, or myalgia Advise the child's parent/guardian that vaccinated children may still get infected and transmit the virus so they should continue to follow all current public health guidance to protect themselves and others Please refer to the NIAC immunisation guidelines available at https://rcpi.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/IO_15ead882-dd37-4d61-a213-b692c930564c/ 16.10 Adverse Events In clinical trials for children in this age group, no new safety concerns were observed. However, the study size did not allow for detection of rare or very rare adverse events or to evaluate whether the characteristics of identified but rarer risks, such as myocarditis, differ compared with the older populations. In the US, over one million children aged 6 months-5 years have received at least one dose of either Comirnaty\u00ae or Spikevax. The CDC reviewed adverse events and the most commonly reported symptoms were irritability or crying, sleepiness, loss of appetite and fever. Almost all (98%) reports were for non-serious events. Of the serious events reported, two were likely attributable to the vaccination, one febrile convulsion and one anaphylaxis associated with a dosing error. No cases of myocarditis were reported. The most frequent adverse reactions in those that received any primary course dose included: in infants 6-23 months of age, irritability (> 60%), drowsiness (> 40%), decreased appetite (>30%), tenderness at the injection site (> 20%), injection site redness and fever (> 10%) in children 2-4 years of age, pain at injection site and fatigue (> 40%), injection site redness and fever (> 10%). A higher rate of pyrexia was seen after administration of the second dose. Reporting of adverse events following immunisation This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions to the HPRA. https://www.hpra.ie/homepage/about-us/report-an-issue/human-adverse-reaction-form 16.11 Clinical Considerations Vaccination after COVID-19 infection Unvaccinated Those who are unvaccinated and develop SARS-CoV-2 infection should complete a primary vaccination course, with the first dose at least fo ur weeks after diagnosis or onset of symptoms, or four weeks from the first PCR positive specimen in those who are asymptomatic. Those with persisting symptoms following COVID-19 may be vaccinated, unless there is evidence of recent clinical deterioration. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 73 12/09/2023 Partially vaccinated Those who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection after their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine should be given the subsequent dose at least four weeks after diagnosis or onset of symptoms. In those who have SARS-CoV-2 infection more than seven days after the second vaccine dose, a third dose of the primary series is not required. For those with infection within seven days of their second dose they should complete the primary series after an interval of 8 weeks. Efficacy In a study 1,254 children aged 6 months-4 years who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline received three doses of either Comirnaty\u00ae (n=873) or placebo (n=381). The median follow-up period following dose three was 1.3 months. An estimated vaccine efficacy (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection of 73% was observed. A total of 21 cases of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in the placebo group and 13 cases in the vaccinated group. Duration of immunity There is insufficient information to determine the duration of protection from the vaccine. Vaccine recipients may not have optimal protection until seven days after the third dose , and the vaccine may not protect all vaccinees. Vaccinated children should continue to follow current public health guidance to protect themselves and others. Co-administration with other vaccines In this age group, there must be at least a 2 week in terval between the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine and any other vaccines. No interaction studies in y oung children have been performed on co-administration of Comirnaty\u00ae with childhood vaccines. Priority should be given to other routine immunisations. Until there is more evidence it is prudent to separate COVID-19 vaccination in children aged 6 months-4 years from other vaccines for a period of 14 days. As a precaution, if the child has recently received the monkeypox vaccine (Imvanex or Jynneos), they need to wait 4 weeks before they get their COVID-19 vaccine because of the unknown risk of myocarditis. Children who are immunocompromised Children who are immunocompromised due to disease or treatment may be vaccinated if they have no contraindications. There are currently no indications for additional doses or booster doses for this age group. The primary course of 3 doses of Comirnaty\u00ae 3 micrograms (0.2ml) is currently the only recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 6 months to 4 years including those with immunocompromise. Children with planned immunosuppressing therapy should ideally complete vaccination two weeks before treatment. The recommended minimum interval may be used. Specialists should consider the child's risk and likelihood of disease exposure, and provide advice based on knowledge and understanding of their immune status and likely immune response to vaccination. Vaccination of those with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulants Individuals with a bleeding disorder or receiving anticoagulant therapy may develop haematomas in IM injection sites. Prior to vaccination, inform the parent/guardian about this risk. For those with thrombocytopoenia (platelet count <50 x10 9L), consult the supervising consultant. For children with mild bleeding disorders or on maintenance dose Emicizumab (Hemlibra) do not require haemostatic cover for vaccination. Clinical Guidance for COVID 19 Vaccination | HSE National Immunisation Office Version 50 74 12/09/2023 Those with inherited coagulopathies receiving factor replacement therapy should receive it on the day of vaccination, prior to IM vaccination. If there is uncertainty about the need for replacement therapy, contact the child's supervising consultant. Those receiving long-term anticoagulation with either wa rfarin or heparin are not considered to be at higher risk of bleeding complications following immunisation. There is no reason to expect that there is a greater risk of bleeding complications with the newer types of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents, than with other anticoagulants. Technique for IM injections in persons with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulants: Only one injection per muscle mass should be given at each visit. Use a 23 or 25 gauge needle to reduce the pressure gradient and cause less trauma to the tissue. The vaccine should be injected slowly ( 5 seconds) to reduce the risk of tissue damage. Firm pressure should be applied to the site for 5 to 10 minutes after injection. Stabilisation of the limb will reduce the risk of a haematoma. The site should not be rubbed or massaged. Instruct the parent/guardian to monitor the injected limb and to report any concerns to their supervising consultant.

The NCCS will update the expiry date and affix a \"HSE SCAN ME\" label detailing the new reduced shelf-life (= U SE BEFORE date and time). Do not re-freeze. Comirnaty formulations ( GREY , ORANGE and MAROON caps) have a number of specifications in common. All products are multidose vials and contain Trometamol. Additional information about the vaccination programme is available in the Clinical Guidance for COVID-19 Vaccination document available at www.immunisation.ie. All SmPCs are available at : https://www.medicines.ie/medicines/list/all/page-1/per-page-25?query=comirnaty Guidance for management of Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech) COVID19 Vaccine HSE National Immunisation Office. Version Sep 2023 2 2. Responsibilities The Responsible Person should ensure that Comirnaty COVI D- 19 vaccines are managed, as outlined in this Guidance document. 3. Scope The scope of this document is to provide a set of standardised procedures for the management of Comirnaty COVID- 19 vaccines at all vaccination sites 4. Purpose The purpose of this document is to outline the managem ent of Comirnaty vaccines and to provide supporting guidance in relation to: Receipt of vaccine Vaccine decommissioning Shelf-Life Storage & Transportation Presentation and preparation Consumables, Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) & Record Cards and Other Equipment Stock Control, Security & Monitoring of Wastage Health & Safety The documents provided may be used as templates to be adapted for local use or may be used as reference sources to check that existing local procedures are robust and comprehensive. 4.1 Receipt of vaccines Upon arrival at your site record the maximum, mi nimum and current temperature of the fridge/s, and reset after recording. Prior to receipt of vaccine delivery, ensure the temperature is between +2 oC and +8 oC. Sign for receipt of the vaccines. Vaccines will be at a temperature of +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C when delivered by NCCS. Check against the delivery docket (note: the expiry date on the docket may differ to printed expiry on carton and vial- the delivery docket carries the updated and correct expiry date) Scan or record the details of the HSE SCAN ME label and immediately place the vaccines (retained in original boxes to protect vials from light) in the fridge. For additional information please see the following document https://www.hse.ie/eng/health/immunisation/hcpinfo/vaccineordering/sopnio01.pdf 4.2 Vaccine Decommissioning All boxes have been re-labelled and decommissioned by NCCS. Comirnaty BA.4-5 formulations: In consequence of the extension of the shelf-life, affected batches will appear as expired. The labelled expiration date on the product and the stored data in the NMVS repository is not taking the extended shelf-life into account. Please refer to \"Dear Healthcare Professional\" letter enclosed in the delivery box. Guidance for management of Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech) COVID19 Vaccine HSE National Immunisation Office. Version Sep 2023 3 4.3 Shelf-Life 4.3.1 Expiry date : For Comirnaty BA.4-5 formulations and Comirnaty 3 microgram s/dose shelf life has been extended to 24 months while stored in ULT freezers (-90oC to -60oC) and as a consequence the printed expiry date on the box and vial label may have been exceeded when these vials are delivered. Note: The relevant expiry date will be printed on the deli very docket. The delivery box will also include a letter explaining this. This process is managed by NCCS and no action is required by the vaccinator. For Comirnaty XBB.1.5 formulations the shelf life is 18 months when stored in ULT freezers (-90 oC to -60oC). 4.3.2 USE BEFORE date and time The USE BEFORE date and time reflects the duration the unopened vial can be stored at +2\u00b0C to +8\u00b0C, which is up to 10 weeks . The USE BEFORE date and time must remain within the shelf-life and replaces t he expiry date. All boxes containing Comirnaty will be labelled by NCCS with USE BEFORE date and time label. The USE BEFORE date and time specified on the label indicates the time by wh ich the vial must be used irrespective of the expiry date on box or vial. Record the USE BEFORE date in the patient's record and on COVAX. 4.3.3 DISCARD date and time Discard date and time must be written on the vial once the vi al is initially punctured. This is calculated by adding 12 hours to the time of first puncture. The vaccine can be stored at temperature between +2 \u00b0C and +30\u00b0C during this period. From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of opening precludes the risks of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the respon sibility of the user. The Discard time cannot exceed the USE BEFORE date and time. If the time remaining between first puncture and USE BEFORE date and time is less than the allowed di scard time of 12 hours then the discard time must reflect the USE BEFORE date and time. All doses must be administered before the USE BEFORE date and time or else doses must be discarded. 4.4 Storage & Transportation During storage, minimise exposure to room light, and avoid ex posure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light. Vials can be handled in room light conditions. An appropriate container should be used for transportation to minimize the potential for vials to be jostled. If vials are inadvertently bumped, they should be righted, however th e risk to the product is minimal and vials, which are temporarily knocked ov er, may still be used. Unopened vials can be stored and transported for 10 weeks at +2 oC to +8 oC (within USE BEFORE date and time). Unopened vials can be stored for 12 hours pr ior to first puncture at room temperature (+8 oC to +30 oC) Vials can be stored for 12 hours after first puncture or dilution, at temperature (+2 oC to +30 oC) which includes Guidance of Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech) COVID19 Vaccine HSE National Immunisation Office. Version Sep 2023 4 to 6 hours transportation time. The following information is intended to guide healthcare professionals only in case of temporary temperature excursion: Stability data indicate that the unopened vial is stable for up to 10 weeks when stored at temperatures from -2 \u00b0C to 2 \u00b0C, within the 10-week storage period between +2 \u00b0C an d +8 \u00b0C and up to 24 hours at temperatures of +8 \u00b0C to +30 \u00b0C, including up to 12 hours following first puncture. 4.5 Presentation and Preparation All formulations are packed in original boxes of 10 vials.
