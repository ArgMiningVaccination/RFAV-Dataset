In fact, research suggests certain nutrients can help prevent conditions associated with aging and promote healthy aging. While nutrition can't stop the aging process, which the World Health Organization defines as the effects of the accumulation of molecular and cellular damage over time, some supplements may help a person maintain healthy functioning, sharpness and vitality as they get older. Read on to learn about some of the supplements experts recommend as part of a healthy aging diet.

Brightly colored fruits and vegetables, such as dark green kale and orange and red bell peppers, contain various types of antioxidants that are all beneficial in preventing inflammation, says Dolores Woods, a registered dietitian with UTHealth Houston School of Public Health. Some contain cancer-fighting compounds as well, according to 2022 research in the journal Molecules. Although there's a good amount of research supporting the effects of a varied and colorful diet on health and longevity, it's difficult to pinpoint how specific antioxidants might affect different diseases or health conditions, says Woods. \"Nutrition science is hard because there are so many factors in how diet affects health and aging. Everyone is different; genetics and environment play a role, and even large studies of certain supplements might not be inclusive [in terms of chosen study subjects],\" she explains. A 2022 research review in Frontiers in Pharmacology noted there's evidence to suggest that dietary polyphenols can be protective against chronic diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease, [diabetes](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/diabetes/diabetes-symptoms/) and cancer [[1]](#footnote_1). Similarly, a 2017 research review in Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity concluded that plant-based foods rich in antioxidants might help protect against heart disease, diabetes and oxidative stress [[2]](#footnote_2). Inflammation is at the root of many health conditions, so reducing it in the body is important, explains Woods. \"And as we get older, it becomes more common to be deficient in some of the vitamins that reduce inflammation, such as vitamins B and D,\" she says. Older adults might have trouble absorbing certain vitamins as well, adds Woods. She recommends a [daily multivitamin](https://www.forbes.com/health/womens-health/best-multivitamins-women/) containing calcium and vitamin D to help fill any nutritional gaps. As people age, metabolism slows and immunity diminishes, and they need more rest and heal more slowly, says Kuljit Kapur, D.O., a geriatric and long-term care physician in Naperville, Illinois. She agrees that incorporating supplements in the form of a multivitamin can help counter the effects of depressed immunity and vitamin absorption difficulty that are common among older people. 7 Best Anti-Aging Supplements, According to Experts Nutrition experts say the following nutrients are particularly important for healthy aging. B Vitamins B vitamins are necessary for proper brain function, research suggests. The dementia assessment Dr. Kapur uses with her patients includes an evaluation of their vitamin B12 levels, as older people can be deficient in the vitamin. In a 2020 data analysis of over 2,000 older adults in The American Journal of Nutrition, low vitamin B12 was associated with cognitive impairment [[3]](#footnote_3). Meanwhile, authors of another study in Cureus investigating whether vitamin B12 therapy can have potential benefits in treating existing cognitive impairment note that more research is needed [[4]](#footnote_4). Depression can be an issue among older adults as well, says Dr. Kapur, so they need to make sure to [get enough B vitamins](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/vitamin-b-deficiency/), as research suggests an association between low levels of vitamin B and depression. B vitamins also help the body process energy, and the body's red and white blood cells need B vitamins to function, explains Woods. People with low levels of vitamins B6 and B12 can develop anemia as well. \"Older adults are often low in vitamin B12, and as we age, it's harder for us to absorb it and even use it because it's not as bioavailable,\" she adds. B vitamins include: - B1 (thiamine) - B2 (riboflavin) - - B12 - Folic acid B vitamins are commonly found in meat, eggs, fish and leafy greens. A daily multivitamin is an easy way to make sure older people consume the recommended amount, says Woods. Vitamin D Many people are low in [vitamin D](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-vitamin-d-supplements/), but older adults are even more likely to be deficient in it for two reasons, according to Woods. First, older people tend to eat less, so they often don't consume as much food containing vitamin D as younger people. Second, they might spend less time outside and have less exposure to sunlight, which prompts the body to make its own vitamin D. What's more, an older person's skin doesn't make vitamin D as efficiently as a younger person's skin, and an older person's kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form than a younger person's kidneys. A [lack of this vitamin](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/vitamin-d-guide/) also lowers bone density, increasing one's risk for [osteoporosis](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/osteoporosis/). A multivitamin containing calcium is helpful because vitamin D is absorbed by the body more easily if it's consumed alongside calcium, says Woods. In a 2020 meta analysis in the journal Medicine, researchers found that a supplement containing both vitamin D and calcium helped prevent bone fractures in older adults and that vitamin D3 specifically appeared to help prevent falls [[5]](#footnote_5). Breakfast is a good time to take supplements, says Tracy Lockwood Beckerman, a registered dietitian in New York City. \"You can make it part of your daily morning routine, and you absorb fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A, D, E and K better with food,\" she says. Food sources of vitamin D include fatty fish, egg yolks, cheese and mushrooms, as well as fortified milks, orange juices and cereals. Calcium Calcium is a mineral necessary for strong bones and teeth, as well as proper muscle and nerve function. Women at least 51 years old need to consume 1,200 milligrams per day, which is 200 milligrams more than the recommended amount for women 50 years old and younger. [Postmenopausal women](https://www.forbes.com/health/womens-health/menopause/what-is-menopause/) absorb and retain less calcium than younger women, putting them at increased risk for developing fragile bones and osteoporosis, explains Woods. Meanwhile, men between the ages of 51 and 70 are advised to consume 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily, and those 71 and older need 1,200 milligrams per day. Supplements combining vitamin D and calcium might lower a person's risk for fractures, according to a 2020 review and meta analysis in JAMA Network Open [[6]](#footnote_6). Meanwhile, authors of a 2023 study in Nutrients found low levels of calcium to be associated with a higher risk of age-related macular degeneration (a disease that affects vision), but more research is needed on this particular association [[7]](#footnote_7). Study results are mixed regarding the effects of high calcium levels on risks for certain cancers. A 2017 study in JAMA in concluded that vitamin D and calcium supplementation didn't significantly decrease cancer risk in healthy postmenopausal women while an earlier study in JAMA Internal Medicine found vitamin D and calcium appeared to reduce premenopausal [breast cancer](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/breast-cancer/) risk [[8]](#footnote_8) [[9]](#footnote_9). High calcium levels may cause nausea, constipation and poor kidney function, as well as adverse interactions with antibiotics and other medications, so be sure to discuss calcium supplements with a health care provider before taking them. Woods recommends older adults supplement with a daily multivitamin containing both vitamin D and calcium because vitamin D is easier for the body to absorb when taken with calcium. She also notes that multivitamins typically contain the 1,000 milligrams of calcium recommended for most healthy adults, but the body can only absorb up to 500 milligrams of calcium at a time. Therefore, it's important to get the rest of one's daily calcium needs from food sources, such as milk, yogurt, cheese and canned sardines. Vegetables, such as collard greens, kale and broccoli rabe, as well as fortified cereals and [soy milk](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/soy-milk/), are good sources of calcium for people following a [vegetarian](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/vegetarian-diet/) or [plant-based diet](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/guide-to-plant-based-diet/). When evaluating calcium in supplement form, look for the word \"purified\" or the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) symbol on the label. Fatty Acids [Omega-3 fatty acids](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/omega-3-fatty-acids/) are a inflammation, says Ro Huntriss, a London-based consultant dietitian and chief nutrition officer for intermittent fasting app Simple. \"EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) are most associated with anti-inflammatory action and have been shown to improve health in a number of contexts, including heart health, [type 2 diabetes](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/diabetes/type-2-diabetes/), neurological disorders and eye disease, all of which are associated with aging,\" explains Huntriss. The National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements notes that more research is needed to support potential benefits of omega-3 fatty acids as it relates to certain health conditions, such as [rheumatoid arthritis](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis/), cancer and [Alzheimer's disease](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/dementia/early-signs-of-alzheimers/). Meanwhile, evidence suggests omega-3 fatty acid supplements can help improve cognitive function (attention and processing speed) in people with mild cognitive impairment. \"If someone isn't eating fish at least twice a week, I definitely think there's a place for a [fish oil supplement](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/fish-oil-supplements-benefits/), because the body doesn't make [omega-3s] on its own,\" says Woods. \"Omega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory, so having a good source of omega-3s [in one's diet can] help prevent some inflammation.\" Good food sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fatty fish, walnuts, canola oil and chia seeds, she adds. It's important to note that omega-3 fatty acids can also come with a number of adverse side effects, including halitosis (an oral health problem marked by bad breath), [increased blood sugar](https://www.forbes.com/health/conditions/diabetes/high-blood-sugar/) and excessive belching. People prescribed anticoagulation drugs due to increased bleeding risk should also exercise caution with omega-3 supplements. Curcumin Research regarding the anti-aging properties of curcumin, an active compound found in [turmeric](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/turmeric-health-benefits/), is promising, although more high-quality studies on human subjects are needed, says Woods. One 2020 research review in PharmaNutrition concluded that curcumin does have anti-inflammatory effects in the body, and a 2019 research review in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences concluded that curcumin appears to both reduce inflammation and suppress tumors [[10]](#footnote_10) [[11]](#footnote_11). Researchers continue to investigate whether curcumin might be protective against heart disease and whether curcumin supplementation could be used to help prevent and treat various brain diseases. \"The research isn't super-conclusive, but I like what I see about curcumin,\" says Woods. \"It's one of those things that has a very low bioavailability, so supplementing with it has a lower risk of toxicity, which is good.\" Since curcumin in food isn't easily absorbed and metabolized by the body, a supplement can be a better option, says Woods. However, older adults should still eat fresh foods containing curcumin, too. Sprinkling a little turmeric in [tea or coffee](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/coffee-vs-tea/) can be helpful. Lutein Known as the \" [eye vitamin](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-vitamins-for-eye-health/),\" lutein is one of two carotenoids thought to help filter light and protect the eye from sun damage. Oral supplements containing lutein can help prevent age-related macular degeneration, says Woods. Dietary lutein might help prevent [cataracts](https://www.forbes.com/health/healthy-aging/what-are-cataracts/), but research has yet to confirm whether supplements can have the same effect as food. \"Macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in older adults,\" says Woods. \"For older people, I recommend getting lutein from food but also by supplementing. It works hand in hand with another antioxidant [called] zeaxanthin. Both of those [nutrients] are usually found together [in the same supplement].\" A diet rich in fruits and vegetables should provide enough lutein for healthy adults, but there are no known side effects from supplementing for those who choose to do so. However, consuming lutein alongside beta carotene specifically might reduce the body's absorption of both vitamins, and when taken with vitamin E, lutein can reduce the amount of vitamin E the body can absorb. Food sources of lutein include egg yolks, spinach and kale. It's also important to consume lutein along with foods high in fat to facilitate better absorption. Collagen Research suggests that [collagen supplements](https://www.forbes.com/health/body/best-collagen-powders/) may help increase skin elasticity, hydration and dermal collagen density, says Huntriss. A small 2019 study of 60 healthy women between the ages of 40 and 50 in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology observed that the oral consumption of collagen peptides (very small pieces of protein derived from animal collagen) resulted in an improvement in skin elasticity and reduction in the appearance of pores [[12]](#footnote_12). Meanwhile, a small 2021 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial with 99 Japanese women between the ages of 35 and 50 concluded that oral collagen supplements helped increase skin hydration [[13]](#footnote_13). A 2019 research review in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology also found oral collagen supplements to be helpful in increasing skin density, hydration and elasticity [[14]](#footnote_14). In addition to maintaining younger looking skin, collagen peptides are thought to help reduce the effects of knee osteoarthritis, according to research. There are no known interactions between collagen supplements and medications, foods or other supplements. \"Collagen is the glue that holds us together,\" says Robert Iafelice, a registered dietitian and functional nutritionist in Mentor, Ohio. \"It's great for skin, bones, joints and muscles. The majority of people don't eat enough collagen foods, such as the skin of poultry and fish, organ meats and bone broth.\" Therefore, older adults can benefit from a daily supplement of 10 to 15 grams of collagen peptides, he says.

What to Look for When Buying Anti-Aging Supplements \"Unfortunately, there isn't a clear-cut prescription of supplements to help reduce the inevitable complex process of aging,\" says Beckerman. \"Rather than overload the body with one or two specific vitamins, minerals or antioxidants, a simple multivitamin may be the answer when it comes to protecting and maintaining your [overall] health.\" A daily multivitamin is a safe bet for most healthy older people, says Woods. However, getting too much of a particular vitamin or supplement ingredient could be toxic, she adds. \"Different micronutrients balance each other out, so if we take too much of one, it offsets homeostasis in the body,\" explains Woods. \"[For instance], fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, E and K, [can] accumulate in the liver and raise risk for toxicity. More is not necessarily better.\" On the other hand, getting too much of a water-soluble vitamin, such as vitamin C or any B vitamin, doesn't pose the same risk because excess is excreted easily by the body. \"If you take a ton of vitamin C, it's not really beneficial because your body excretes anything it doesn't need,\" says Woods. \"It's a waste of money.\" Look for third-party verification that a multivitamin can be trusted in terms of purity and that it contains what the label says, advises Woods. The USP Reference Standards seal ensures the supplement was analyzed for impurities. NSF International is another third-party testing organization that conducts independent evaluations of supplement ingredients and tests for impurities. Consumers can research specific supplements directly in NSF's [online database](https://info.nsf.org/Certified/dietary/). Lastly, check labels to see how much of each ingredient a supplement contains, says Woods. Supplements should provide up to 100% of the recommended daily requirement for your age group. It's also important to check with your health care provider before taking a new supplement to make sure it doesn't contain an ingredient you don't need or that might interfere with any medications or other supplements you already take.
