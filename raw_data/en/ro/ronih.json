While you can use essential oils for babies for aromatherapy and general purposes, you must be aware of some basic guidelines to prevent adversities. Essential oils are fragrant, concentrated oils extracted from various plant parts, such as leaves, flowers, seeds, barks, or fruits. Always use them under the guidance of a certified herbalist or aromatherapy professional to know the right dosage and methods for using them. Keep reading as we offer you an overview of essential oils for babies, their safety, the right age to use them, and some precautions to avoid any adverse effects. Are Essential Oils Safe For Babies? When used correctly, essential oils can be safe and offer several benefits to babies. However, it is better to use child-friendly, edible, plant-based oils, such as sweet almond oil, unscented coconut oil, and sesame oil, without any smell on a baby's delicate skin. This is because babies often end up licking or sucking their body parts. Also, any kind of smell can overstimulate a baby's senses and nervous system. If you are planning to use essential oils for your baby's wellness, it is good to consult a certified aromatherapist or essential oil practitioner. What Is The Right Age To Use Essential Oils For Babies? Young babies have thin, permeable skin that is sensitive to essential oils [ (2)](http://www.kansasaap.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-April-KAAP-EO-Handout.pdf). Therefore, using EOs for babies younger than three months is not advisable. When it comes to babies older than three months, the essential oil's type and intended use determine the right age for its use. Speak to an essential oil expert to learn if a specific essential oil is suitable for your baby's age [(1)](https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/explore-healing-practices/aromatherapy/are-essential-oils-safe#:~:text=Most%20essential%20oils%20are%20safe,eat%20or%20drink%20essential%20oils.)

You can use essential oil for your baby through the following methods. - Topical application: Blending an essential oil with a carrier oil, unscented cream, or lotion is a must before topical use [(23)](https://naha.org/explore-aromatherapy/about-aromatherapy/methods-of-application/). Cold-pressed sweet almond oil, sesame oil, jojoba oil, and coconut oil are a few natural oils you can safely use as carrier oils for babies. Avoid using olive oil or sunflower oil as they may damage the skin barrier in some babies [(24)](https://dermnppa.org/what-we-know-today-about-applying-oils-to-newborn-skin/). It is best to do a small patch test to check for allergic reaction before using any oil. - Diffusion: Diffusing essential oil using a vaporizer or diffuser lets your baby inhale essential oils. As diffuser types vary, check the guidelines on using essential oil blend in a diffuser before use. Correctly dilute EOs before diffusion to reduce the risk of adverse respiratory effects. Steam inhalation is not advised for children younger than seven years. - Sprays: You can prepare aromatherapy spray by mixing the essential oil with distilled water and solubol. A solubol, also known as a dispersant, is a type of emulsifier that keeps the EO diluted in water. You can spray diluted essential oil on curtains and carpets in and around your baby's room. However, avoid spraying essential oils on pillows to prevent accidental ingestion. You can consider any of the above methods, depending on the type of essential oil and purpose of use. Avoid oral use of EOs in babies as they can be toxic [ (2)](http://www.kansasaap.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-April-KAAP-EO-Handout.pdf). [ Read : How To Use Dabur Lal Tail? ] Things To Consider Before Using Essential Oils For Babies Here are some points to know before you begin using essential oils for babies. - The chemical constitution of all the essential oils varies. Therefore, different EOs perform different functions. - It is important to ensure the quality of essential oils. Opt for organic essential oils from a trusted and reputable brand to ensure purity. Old and adulterated essential oils are more likely to have adverse effects, such as skin irritation and allergic reaction. - Pure oils from reputable brands have specific information on the label \u2014 the plant's common and Latin name, plant part used to extract the oil (leaf, flower, seed, bark, fruit, or root), country of origin, and extraction method. - The mode of use for every essential oil is different. Some oils may be safe to apply on skin, and others may be safe to diffuse. - The dosage and duration of use of essential oils vary. Some oils may be safe to use in minimal amounts occasionally, while others could be safe for frequent use. [(2)](http://www.kansasaap.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2016-April-KAAP-EO-Handout.pdf). Safety Tips For Using Essential Oils For Babies Adhere to these safety tips for the safe use of EOs in babies and toddlers [ (23)](https://naha.org/explore-aromatherapy/about-aromatherapy/methods-of-application/). - Consult a certified aromatherapist or an essential oil expert before using EOs for babies. - Use essential oils sparingly as per the recommended dosage. Excess use could have adverse effects, such as irreversible skin damage. - Replace EOs with hydrosols for babies who can't use EOs. Hydrosols are water-based products with minimum plant compounds. Thus, they are relatively safe and gentle options for babies [(25)](https://naha.org/explore-aromatherapy/about-aromatherapy/what-are-hydrosols/). - Be aware of the right dilution ratio. The ratio varies depending on the type of oil and its concentration. It may also vary as per the carrier oil. Usually, three to six drops per ounce of carrier oil is a safe dilution ratio for babies and toddlers. Nevertheless, always check the dilution ratio recommended on the oil's packaging. [(30)](https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/ACH-News/General-News/Are-Essential-Oils-Safe-for-Children). - Do a patch test before using essential oil for babies and toddlers. If your baby has existing allergies or a family history of allergies and sensitivities, consult a pediatrician before using it. - Beware of cross-reactivity with EOs. For instance, dill oil may cause allergic reactions in individuals allergic to the carrot family (carrot, asafoetida, fennel, and celery). - Stay alert of possible drug interactions. If your baby is on medications or has a medical condition, use EOs as per expert guidance. - Discontinue EO use immediately if your baby or toddler shows signs of sensitivity, such as irritation. Apply a small amount of cream, vegetable oil, or full-fat milk to soothe the affected area. - Do not apply essential oil on and around damaged skin since it may cause unwanted skin reactions. - Avoid applying diluted or undiluted essential oil around the eyes, nose, and mouth to avoid accidental ingestion. - Do not take your baby or toddler out in the sun up to 24 hours after using essential oil to prevent the risk of sunburns due to photosensitivityi [X]A condition where the skin becomes highly sensitive to sunlight, increasing its risk of damage . - Avoid extended use of the same essential oil unless directed by the herbalist or aromatherapist. - Diffuse EOs in a well-ventilated area to avoid excessive inhalation of the oil. - Do not use an EO for diffusion for long (one hour or more). Diffuse for 15 to 30 minutes only. Prolonged exposure to EOs may cause nausea and lethargy [(26)](https://info.achs.edu/blog/aromatherapy-essential-oil-dangers-and-safety). - Avoid using diffusers if the baby has asthma or has a family history of the condition. - Keep the essential oils out of reach of babies, children, and pets. - Maintain the quality of essential oils by storing them in tightly closed, darkened glass containers away from heat and light. - Contact the nearest poison unit immediately if a toddler accidentally ingests an essential oil. You can make the child drink whole or two percent milk to mitigate risk. But do not induce vomiting. - Wash the eye with lots of cold water if essential oil accidentally gets into the baby's eyes. See a pediatrician or an ophthalmologist. - Avoid heating EOs directly as they are highly inflammable. Keep them away from candles and other heat sources, such as cooking stoves.
