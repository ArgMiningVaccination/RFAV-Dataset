Whether you're looking for pain relief, spinal maintenance care, sports performance, or family checkups - we are here for you! PRICE DOES MATTER With over 15 years experience in chiropractic, we realized something - people want chiropractic adjustments, but not everyone can afford them. That's why we've chosen to charge only $25 per visit for adults and $12.50 for children 12 and under. We believe everyone deserves accessible chiropractic care. No contracts, or barriers - just Chiropractic adjustments at fantastic prices! We accept debit, cash & checks and also offer Pre-paid packages for extra savings! | | Dr. Chris \"I decided I wanted to be a chiropractor only 3 weeks after my first adjustment in 1995. After 6 years in practice, I realized that so many people wanted chiropractic, but couldn't afford \"traditional\" prices. This is when the idea of a low fee office started taking shape. My desire changed to one of helping as many people I could with chiropractic care without barriers. This style practice has been a huge blessing, BUT, having a fantastic wife (Dr. Simone), 4 amazing children (Emily, Liam, Christian, & Jude), & a great church (Chestnut Ridge Baptist Church) is even more of a blessing.\" | | Dr. Simone \"I used to be a victim of severe migraines and allergies. MASSAGE THERAPY | | Allison Riggleman | | Katie Soussi | | My name is Allison Riggleman. I have four years experience as a Licensed Massage Therapist. I have been a Medical Assistant and a caregiver for the elderly for many years. I love helping to take care of people, and my passion is to help improve people's lives through massage. My husband and I love to hike and travel to take in new sights and experiences. I look forward to meeting new people through Chris Chiropractic Services. | | Katie has been doing massage since the year 2000. She has an integrative technique that incorporates Swedish massage and acupressure. She also adds all of the best of the various modalities she has learned in her two decades of doing bodywork. She has a kind demeanor and heartful approach to working with patients/clients. Low back pain, neck and shoulder tension, stress, headaches and prenatal discomfort are some areas that she can help you to find some relief. | | Kid-loving, Highly Skilled Chiropractors Every child should be checked for vertebral subluxations. These are subtle misalignments of the spine that disrupt normal function in the body. This malfunction can lead to pain, breathing difficulties, reflux, digestive issues, headaches, arm or shoulder issues, the common cold and flu, and much much more. This is why it's important for every member of the family to get checked by a chiropractor and another reason we only charge $10 for children 12 and under! It's just a healthy thing to do!
