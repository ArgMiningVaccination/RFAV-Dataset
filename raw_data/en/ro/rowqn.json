Yow Appendix: G Applicant Rebuttal to Draft Report THE SUNRISE REVIEW PROCESS A sunrise review is an evaluati on of a proposal to change the la ws regulating health professions in W ashington. The legislature's intent, as stat ed in the Sunrise Act, chapter 18.120 RCW, is to perm it all qu alified indiv iduals to pro vide hea lth services unless there is an overwhelm ing need for the state to protect the inte rests of the public by restric ting entry into the profession. The Sunrise Act, RCW 18.120.010, says a health car e profession should be regulated only when: Unregulated practice can clearly harm or enda nger the h ealth , safet y, or welfare of the public, and the potential for the harm is easily recognizable and not rem ote or dependent upon tenuous argum ent; The public needs, and can reasonably be exp ected to benefit from , an assurance of initial continuing prof essional ab ility; and The public cannot be effectively protected by other m eans in a m ore cost-beneficial manner. If the leg islature identifies a need an d finds it necessary to regulate a health profession not previously regulated by law, it should select the least restrictive alterna tive m ethod of regulation, consistent w ith the public interest. Five types of regulation m ay be considered as set f orth in RCW 18.120.010(3): 1. Stricter civil action s and crim inal pro secutions. T o be used when existing common law, statutory civil actions, and crim inal prohibitions are no t sufficient to eradicate existing harm. 2. Inspection requirem ents. A process enabling an appropriate state agency to enforce violations by injunctive relief in court, in cluding but not lim ited to, regulation of the business a ctivity prov iding the serv ice rath er than the em ployees of the business, when a service being perform ed for individuals invo lves a hazard to the public health, safety, or welfare. 3. Registration. A process by which the state m aintains an official roster of nam es and addresses of the practitioners in a given pr ofession. The roster contains the location, nature, and operation of the he alth care activity practices and, if required, a description of the service provided. A regi strant is subje ct to the Unif orm Disciplinary Act, chapter 18.120 RCW. 4. Certification. A voluntary process by wh ich the state grants recognition to an individual w ho has m et certain qualifications . Non-certified persons m ay perform the same tasks, but m ay not use \"certified\" in the title. A certified pe rson is subject to the Unifor m Disciplinary Act, chapter 18.130 RCW. 5. Licensure. A m ethod of regulation by which th e state grants perm ission to engage in a health care profession only to persons who m eet predeterm ined qualifications. Licensure protects the scope of practice and the title. A licens ee is sub ject to the Unifor m Disciplinary Act, chapter 18.130 RCW. Colon Hydrotherapist S Page 1 OVERVIE W OF PROCEE DINGS The Departm ent of Health (department) notified the a pplicant group, all professional associations, interested parties, and staff of the sunrise review. The applicant group, the International Association for Colon Hydrot herapy (association), com pleted the sunrise application. The application was shared with pe ople who were interested in the review . The applicant group provided written an swers to add itional ques tions. A review panel of Departm ent of Health staff and one public m ember was created. The departm ent requested inform ation from other states, including regulato ry standards, sunrise reviews, and other inform ation th at would be useful in evaluati ng the proposal. Staff conducted literature an d internet re search. Staff reviewed all inform ation received. The departm ent conducted a public hearing on August 29, 2007. The applicant group provided a PowerPoint presentation coveri ng the history, theory, concerns, contraindications , and m edical benefits of colon hydrotherapy. The applicant gr oup included inform ation about the association. The group showed a video dem onstrating what happens during a colon hydrotherapy session. They provided an outline of the association's Colon Hydrotherapy Manual , the lesson plans, and a syllabus for association-approved schools and in structors. Public testimony was taken. The testim ony generally focused on the procedure of colon hydrotherapy. Som e comments supported the sunrise proposal to regulate colon hydrotherapists in W ashingt on. Several people testified in support of the procedure but opposed to regulation that would es tablish colon hydrotherapists as a new health profession under th e departm ent's jurisdiction. A 10-day written comm ent period followed the public hearing. On December 21, 2007, the departm ent distributed a draft repo rt to par ticipants and in terested par ties for review. A rebutta l period was allowed for comm ent on the draft report. A recom mendation was m ade based upon all inform ation received. The proposed final draft was reviewed and approved by the Health System s Quality Assurance assistan t secretary an d the secretary of the Departm ent of Health. The f inal re port was tra nsmitted to the Legislat ure via the Of fice of Financial Manage ment. The f inal re port is the d epartm ent's recomm endati on to the legislature re garding the applic ant's proposal to certify colon hydrothe rapists as a new health profession in W ashington. The report reflects the departm ent's understand ing of current law. It is not, however, a decision that is legally binding or precedent setting. Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page 2 EXE CUTI VE SUMM ARY The House Health Care Comm ittee r equested the Departm ent of Health re view a draf t bill proposing to establish certification of colon hydr otherapists. The propos al would allow colon hydrotherapists to practice independe ntly, without referral or superv ision by another health care provider. C olon hydrotherapy would be the only procedure in this new provider's scope of practice. Sunrise review typi cally includes a range of activit ies under a profession's scope of practice. This review is unusual because the analysis is focused on a single procedure. Findings Colon hydrotherapists are not currently r ecognized or regulated under the Unifor m Disciplinary Act in W ashington. In Florida, the definition of \" massage\" in cludes colonic irrigation, and a licensed m assage therap ist m ay obtain a ce rtification to perform the procedure. No other state was identified as licensing colon hydrotherapists. Colon hydrotherapy is perform ed usi ng \"co lonic irrigation system s,\" which are prescriptive devices regulated by the fe deral Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA). No clinical studies were found that valid ate colon hydrotherapy as a practice that prom otes health. The applicant group, health providers, and trea tment recipients provi ded written and oral statem ents attributing a wide variety of health benefits to the procedure. There are num erous m edical contra indications for colon hydrotherapy. Colon hydrotherapy is associated with a sm all but real risk of serious injury or death. Colon hydrotherapy is the practice of medicine in W ashington. Colon hydrotherapy is a m edical procedure with in the scope of practice of allopathic, osteopathic, and naturopathic physicians. The procedure m ay be delegated to other licensed staff under lim ited circum stances. The proposal m eets the first sunrise criterion. However, this crit erion does not support regulation o f the profession because the practice of colon hydrotherapy is already regu lated in other professions in W ashington. The proposal does not m eet the second and third criteria. In addition, the W ashington State Court of Appeals recently ruled that co lon hydrotherap y is the practice of m edicine in Washington. Given this court decision, there is no legal basis for the sunrise review to consider argum ents that co lon hydrotherapy is not a m edical procedure. Recommen dation Based on the analysis of the sunr ise criteria, the departm ent reco mmends that the leg islature not adopt the proposed bill establishing certificati on for colon hydrotherapists. The proposal does not satisfy all three sunrise criteria. In addi tion, adoption of the proposal would set precedent for regulating a single m edical procedure. The depart ment does not believe this approach would be an efficient m eans of regulation. Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page 3 SUMMARY OF INFORMATION Sunrise review request The House Health Care and W ellnes s Comm ittee referred d raft bill (H-35 05.1/07) for a sunris e review. The draft bill would es tablish certification of colon hydrot herapists as a new profession. The proposal would establish education and traini ng standards for individuals who choose to be certified as colon hydrotherapists. Applicant informat ion The applicant group for this sunrise review is the International Association for Colon Hydrotherapy (association). This associati on offers training and certification for colon hydrotherapists. The association has adopted standard operating proce dures, regulations, and guidelines for colon hydrotherapy. 1 Current regulation Colon hydrotherapists are not currently regulate d in W ashington. The association proposal would change current law; colon hydrotherapist s would be regulated as a new profession with authority to practice completely independently. The proposal does not require referral or supervision by another health car e provider. Colon hydrotherapy w ould be the only procedure in this new provider's scope of practice. The draft bill describes the practice of colon hydrotherapy as, \"the rem oval of waste from the large intestine without the use of drugs by a client-adm inistere d application of filtered and temperature-regulated w ater into the large intest ine.\" Colon hydrotherapy is som etimes referred to as colonic irrigation. The departm ent identified only one state that issu es a credentia l spec ifically includ ing colon hydrotherapy practice. In Florid a, the definition of \" massage\" in cludes colonic irrigation. In that s tate, a licensed m assage therapist m ay perform colonic irrigation after proving com pletion of education and testing requirem ents. Sunrise criteria The departm ent is required to evaluate the pr oposal to regulate colon hydrotherapists according to the three sunrise criteria listed in RCW 18.120.010. Under these criteria, the proposal m ust demonstrate: Unregulated practice can clearly harm or enda nger the h ealth , safet y, or welfare of the public, and the potential for harm is easily recognizable and not rem ote or dependent upon tenuous argum ent; The public n eeds and can be reas onably expected to benefit fr om an assurance of initial and continuing professional ability; The public cannot be effectively protected by other m eans in a m ore cost beneficial manner. 1 See Appendix B. Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page 4 Sunrise reviews for health professionals typically include consideration of a range of activ ities to be includ ed as a scope o f practice. This propos al is unusual b ecause it req uires an alysis of one specific p rocedure rather than on a s cope of practice with a range of activities. As a result, this sunrise review focuses on pa tient saf ety issue s for the pra ctice of colo n hydrotherapy. It also includes an analysis of the pr actitioners already au thorized by law in Washington to perform the procedure. This review provides bac kground about the colon hydrotherapy procedure and the current legal status of colon hydrotherapy as a m edical practice. Background: Colon hydrotherapy practice The \"practice of colon hydrotherapy \" is defined in the applicant' s proposal as \"the removal of waste f rom the larg e inte stine withou t the us e of drugs by a client-adm inistered application of filtered and tem perature- regula ted w ater into th e large inte actual proc edure was describ ed in signif icant detail at the p ublic hearing and in written m aterials subm itted by the applicant group. The procedure is perform ed in a clinic-like sett ing, using a \"colonic irrigation system .\" While the pers on receiving the treatm ent may self-insert the nozzle, the practitioner provides the equipm ent and operates the device. A colonic irrigation system is a device regul ated by the Food and Dr ug Adm inistration (FDA).2 Under FDA regulations, these system s are consid ered to b e a class II m edical dev ice, which means the equipm ent must be obtained with a prescription.3 The device is described in federal regulations as: ...intended to instill water into the colon throug h a nozzle in serted into the rectum to cleanse (evacuate) the contents of th e lower colon... The device consists of a container for fluid connected to the nozzl e via tubing and includes a system which enables the pressure, temperature, o r flow of wa ter to be controlled.4 The FDA recognizes the use of a colonic irrigati on system for colon cleansing when m edically indicated, such as before radiol ogic or endoscopic exam inations.5 Benefits, ris ks, and effectivenes s The applicant group asserts colon hydrotherapy is safe and eff ective if perform ed by properly trained personnel using FDA-approve d equipm ent. In the public hearing, the applicant group identif ied th e following benef its: health m aintenance (d etoxification to correct im ) symptomatic relief of constipation, indi gestion, and functiona l bowel problem s assessm ent of bowel function removal of impacted feces and foreign m aterial rehydration, toning, and re training of the bowel improved bowel elim ination removal of toxins (that) m ay cau se chronic inflammatory dis ease 2 See 21 C.F.R.

Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page 5 improved sense of well-being, imm une response, and quality of life assis tance in bowel clean sing and elimination of stored toxins assis tance in resto ring th e integ rity of mucosal lining In addition, m any peopl e testified at the public hearing on the health benefits of the procedure. 6 However, the applicant group acknowledges that there are m any m edical conditions recognized by the FDA as contraindications for the procedure, including: uncontrolled hypertension or congestive heart failure aneurysm severe anemia gastrointestinal hem orrhage or perforation severe hem orrhoids renal insufficiency cirrho sis carcinom a Crohn's disease abdom inal hernia recen t colon surgery first and third trim ester of pregnancy Colon hydrotherapy can cause advers e effects and injury if not pr operly adm inistered. Som eone receiving frequent treatm ents can absorb too m uch water into the bloodstream .7 This can lead to electroly te imbalances in the blood, nausea, vomiti ng, h eart failu re, fluid in the lungs, abnorm al heart rhythm s, or com a.8 The risk of bowel perforation is rare, but com plications are serious when this occurs.9 Infection can resu lt when the eq uipm ent used is not properly cleaned or is not FDA-approved.10 Death and serious injury have fo llowed colon hydrotherapy treatm ent perform ed without phy sician involvem ent.11 The departm ent was not able to find any clin ical or eviden ce-based studies showing the effectiveness of colon hydrotherapy outside of the m edically indicated procedures. T he applicant group did not provide data regarding effectiven ess of this procedure. The departm ent contacted several gastroenterologists for infor mation. W hile recognizing the risk of harm is small, one practitioner indicated colon hydrotherapy has no scien tifically proven m erit. In rebuttal to th e depar tment's in itial d raft repor t, (including naturopathic physicia provided statem ents in support of 6 See K, Hopk ins RS, et al . An outbreak of am ebiasis s pread by colonic irri gation at a chiropractic clinic. N g Abbott 6 colon hydrotherapy as a treatm ent modality. In many cases, the practiti oners did not comment regarding certification of colon hydrotherapist s as a new category of health provider in Washington. Several practitioners expressed reservations about colon hydrotherapists practicing as independent practitioners gi ven the risks identified above. The \"Practice of Med icine\" under Washingto n Law as applied to co lon hydrotherapy In W ashington, the practice of m edicine is defined under RCW 18.71.011 as: A person is practicing m edicine if he does one or more of the following: (1) Offers or undertakes to diagnose, cure, advise, or prescribe for any hum an disease, ailment, injury, infirm ity, defor mity, pain, or other condition, physic al or m ental, real or im aginary, by any means or instrum entality; (2) Adm inisters or prescribes drugs or m edicinal preparations to be used by any other person; (3) Severs or penetrates th e tissues of hum an beings... This definition is the basis for deciding when an activity or procedure is, in fact, a m edical procedur e. To protec t the public, p rocedures tha t fall with in this def inition can only b e lawf ully perform ed by a licensed health car e provider. The procedure has to be within that practitioner's scope of practice. All invasive procedures, from surgery to a finger-stick blood-draw, are in this definition under current law. The State of Washington Court of Appeals recen tly ruled that colon hydro therapy is the practice of medicine in W ashington.12 The court determ ined the proced ure is within the broad definition of medical practice as defined in RCW 18.71.011. In reaching this decision, the court looked to the procedure used to perfor m colonic irrigation, considered the i nvasive nature of the procedure (insertion of the nozzle into the rectum ), and pot entia l patient saf ety issue s. Given the court' s decision, there is no legal basis fo r this sunrise review to cons ider argum ents by the applicant group and others that the procedure is not the pr actice of m edicine and no t a m edical procedure. Existing au thority to perform colon hydrotherapy Prior to addr essing th e three sunr ise review criteria, it is appropriate to first assess which of the health professions already licen sed are lawfully authorized to practice colon hydrotherapy as a medical procedure. Colon hydrotherapy is within the scope of practice of allopathic and osteop athic physicians. The scope of practice for physicians broadly includes any procedure that fits in the definition of medical practice, as discussed above. Since co lon hydrotherapy is the pr actice of m edicine in Washington, it follows that physicia ns regulated in our state include the procedure in their scope of practice. This m eans they are au thorized to perfor m the procedure. 12 Dept. of Heal th v. Y ow, 146 Wn. App. 1075 (W ash. Ct. App. 2008). See Appe ndix G. On Decem ber 29, 2008, the Court of Appeal s granted the Department's motion to publish the opinion. See al so Appendix F, Final Order from Adm inistrative Heari ng. Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page 7 Colon hydrotherapy is also within the scope of practice for naturopathic physicians. The procedure's reported benefits reas onably fit within desc ription of the natur opathy scope as the practice of \"diagnosis, prevention, and treatm ent by stim ulation or support, or both, of the natural processes of the hum an body.\"13 The procedure is also taught as part of the curriculum in naturopathy schools.14 All types of physicians m ay delegate m edical procedures, including colo n hydrotherapy, to other licensed persons in lim ited circum stances. The de legating physician is res ponsible to ensure the training, competence, and appropria te supervision of th e person perform ing the procedure. The procedure must be within the scope of prac tice of the person perform ing the task. In Washington, the professions with the training and practice s copes that al low penetration of the tissue include allopathic physic ian assistants, osteopathic physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and licensed practical nurses. Colon hydrotherapy, therefore, could be delegated to a practitioner holding one of these licen ses. Unde r curren t law, a person not licensed in one of the professions liste d above m ay not perform or delegate colon hydrotherapy in W ashington. FINDINGS Based on the inform ation presented in the applic ant report, responses to follow-up questions, public input through written subm issions, and public hearing testim ony: Colon hydrotherapists are not currently r ecognized or regulated under the Unifor m Disciplinary Act in W ashington. In Florida, the definition of \" massage\" in cludes colonic irrigation, and a licensed m assage therapist m ay obtain a ce rtification to practice the procedure. No other state was found to license colon hydrotherapists. Colon hydrotherapy is perform ed usi ng \"co lonic irrigation system s,\" which are prescriptive devices regulated by the FDA. No clinical studies were found that valid ate colon hydrotherapy as a practice that prom otes health. The applicant group, health providers, and trea tment recipients provi ded written and oral statem ents attributing a wide variety of health benefits to the procedure. There are num erous m edical contra indications for colon hydrotherapy. Colon hydrotherapy is associated with a sm all but real risk of serious injury or death. Colon hydrotherapy is the practice of medicine in W ashington. Colon hydrotherapy is a m edical procedure with in the scope of practice of allopathic, osteopathic, and naturopathic physicians. The procedure m ay be delegated to other licensed staff under lim ited circum stances. 13 See RC W 18.36A.040 14 Dean Neary with the Bastyr Cen ter for Natu ral Health indicated the procedure is part of their c urricul um and practiced in t heir teaching cli nic. E-mail communication, October 3, 2007. Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page 8 REVIEW OF SUNRI SE CRI TERIA First criterion: Unregulated practice can harm or endanger health a nd safety. The applicant group acknowledges there is a sma ll, but real risk of harm from colon hydrotherapy treatm ent. Harm may occur if treatm ent is provided wh en a contraindicating condition exists. Overuse carries th e risk of electrolyte im balance. Bowel perforation is a rare, but serious com plication. Im properly cleaned equipm ent can cause serious infection. Injuries and death following colon hydrotherapy have been docum ented. While the risk of harm may be s mall, it undersc ores the need to have colon hydrotherapy done by appropriately trained health professionals. Regula tion of the health professionals who adm inister the treatm ent is appropriate and necessary to protect patient health and safety. Colon hydrotherapy is already regulat ed in W ashington becau se it is the practice of m edicine. It is within the scope of practice of allopathic, osteopathic, and naturopathic physicians. These professionals m ay delegate the task to other pers onnel if the delegate is properly trained and has colon hydrotherapy within his or her scope of practice. The departm ent concludes that unregulated prac tice of the single procedure proposed for this profession can harm or endanger health and safe ty. However, this conclusion alone does not support the need to regulate col on hydrotherapists as an indepe ndent prof ession. Prof essionals already regulated in W ashington can provide this trea tment. The procedu re can a lso be delegated to other licensed prof essionals when there is appropr iate training and supervision. Second crit erion: Public needs an d will benef it from an a ssurance of professiona l ability The analys is of this criterion is similar to the firs t, becaus e it focuses only on the treatm ent of colon hydrotherapy. The public already benefits from an assurance of professional ability for the scope of practice proposed for this profession. The procedure is already regulated through the scope of practice of other heal th prof essionals. Allowing inde pendent practice for a medical procedure carrying a small, but re al, risk of harm would not bene fit the pu blic ne ed for patien t safety. The departm ent conclude s that the proposal doe s not satisfy the sec ond sunrise criterion. Third criterion: Public protection cannot be met by othe r means in a cost-e ffective manner The proposal would create a new credential that th e departm ent would regulate by establishing a colon hydrotherapy program . Program costs would be those typically asso ciated with setting up a new health profession program . These include st aff salary and benef activ xpen ses for enforcem ent actio ns. The scope of practice for the proposed professi on would include only one procedure. As discussed, the court has ruled that colon hydrothera py is the practice of medicine in Washington. The procedu re is within the scope of practice of other professions with established program s within the departm ent. There are other m ore co st effective m eans of pr oviding public protection, such as recognition of the pro cedure as within the scope of an established profession. Establishing a new profession includes incurring the adm inistrative costs associated w ith it. These costs can be avoided by assessing the scopes of practice already recognized by law. As a result, the departm ent conclude s the proposal does not satisf y the third sunrise criteria. Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page 9 Conclusion The proposal m eets the first sunrise criterion. However, this crit erion does not support regulation o f the profession because the practi ce of colon hydrotherapy is already regu lated within other licensed professions in Washington. The proposal does not m eet the second and third criter ia. RECOMMENDATION Based on the analysis of the sunr ise criteria, the departm ent reco mmends that the leg islature not adopt the proposed bill establishing certificati on for colon hydrotherapists. The proposal does not satisfy all three sunrise criteria. In addi tion, adopting the proposal would set precedent for regulation based on a single m edical procedure. The departm ent does not believe this is an efficient app roach to reg ulating the h ealth care d elivery system. REB UTTALS TO DRAFT REPO RT Applicant Group's Comments in Response to Draft Following is a summ ary of the comments m ade by the applicant group in their written response to the initial draft repo rt issued on Decem ber 21, 2007. The departm ent's response to each comment is provided. 1. Comment : The review of the \"Sunrise Review Proce ss\" should note that an added benefit of the process is giving the legislat ive body the opportunity to identif y bias in the Departm ent of Health th at is inconsiste nt with the direction of the legislature. Response: In the request for this sunrise review, th e legislature did not indicate a specific direction. T he departm ent made a good faith effort to objectively apply the sunrise criteria to the applicant's proposal. The an alysis required consideration of current law, and the recent Court of Appeals decision that colon hydrotherapy is the practice of m edicine. 2. Comment : The \"Overview of Proceedings\" sh ould reflec t the date of th e initial draf t report and rebuttal period. Response: The final report in cludes these ch anges. 3. Comment : The \"Summ ary of Information\" inc luded an e rror in c iting the case State v Pacific Health Center, Inc. as the rationale for colon hydrother apy as the practice of m edicine. Response: The departm ent realized this citation was in erro r and th e final report does not cite State v. Pacific Health Center, Inc. as the rationale for colon hydr otherapy as the practice of medicine. 4. Comment : Colon hydrotherapy should not be recogni zed in W ashington as a m edical practice. Th e sunris e rev iew hearing docum ented that colon h ydrotherapists do not prescribe and treat m edical conditions. They also do not insert any device into any orifice of the body. Response : The departm ent appreciates that the applicant group provi ded docum entation in their rebu co lon hydrotherapists do not practic e medicine. However, their Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page 10 docum entation is not suf ficient to ov errid e legal preceden t. The State of Washington Court of Appeals recently decided that colon hydr otherapy is con sidered a m edical p ractice.15 The court upheld the department's finding from the administrative case that adm inistering colon hydrotherapy is an invasive procedure. As such, it is the practice of m edicine.16 Diagnosis and treatm ent are only part of the definition of medical practice. Ac tivities tha t seve r or penetrate the tissue are also part of the definition. The fact that the colon hydrotherapy patient self-inserts the nozzle doe s not change the character of th e procedure, or elim inate the risks acknowledged by the applicant group. The practitioner provides th e \"colonic irrigation system ,\" the instrum entality, and the c linic-like s etting f or the procedu re. The applicant group asserts colon hydrotherapists are perform ing an activity that is not the practice of m edicine; however, they asked for cer tification of colon hydrot herapists as health care providers. 5. Comment : The departm ent's position that m edical procedures \"can only be perform ed by appropriately licensed health pr ofessionals acting within th e scope of his or her license\" shows bias, is inaccurate , and is not f actual. Response : The departm ent stands by this statem ent, and does not agree the statem ent shows bias. The departm ent believes the statem ent accu rately refle cts activitie s within th e scope of practice for the professions discussed in the repor t. This does not reflect bias, but rather an objective review of lawful scope of practice fo r the professions discussed. The final report provides ad dition al info rmation about why th e departm ent views colon h ydrotherapy as being within the scope of practi ce of allopathic, osteopathic, a nd naturopathic physicians. It has add itional inform ation about the dep artment's interpretation of delegation to other professions. 6. Comment : The departm ent is both inaccu rate and s howing bias by stating that allop athic, osteopathic, and naturopathic physicians \"m ay delegate colon hydrotherapy to other practitioners under lim ited circum stances. W hen delegated, colon hydrotherapy m ust be in the scope of practice and training of the licensee perform ing the task.\" Response: This statem ent reflects the long-standing view of the departm ent. In order to protect the public, delegation of medical procedures can be made only to appropriately licensed individuals with a scope of practice that includes the procedure. The departm ent's position is consistent with the approach of the Medical Quality Assurance Comm ission regarding delegation. 7. Comment : When discussing FDA regulations, the re port should change its reference to reflect that the FDA regulates \"colon hydrotherapy system s.\" The FDA r egulations do not discuss \"colon hydrotherapy.\" Response: The final report has been changed to more accurately reflect the langu age in FDA regulations. 15 Dept. of Heal th v. Y ow, 146 Wn. App. 1075 (W ash. Ct. App. 2008). See Appe ndix G. On Decem ber 29, 2008, the Cou rt of Appeals gran ted the Dep artment's motion to publish the opinion. 16 See Appendix F, Fi nal Order from Adm inistrative Heari ng. Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page 11 8. Comment : Under \"Safety and Effi cacy\" in the draft re port, the applican t group objects to the statem ent that \"Frequ ent treatm ents can result in the absorption of too m uch water. This can lead to electrolyte im balances in the blood, nausea, vom iting, hear t failure, fluid in the lungs, abnorm al heart rhythm s, or com a.\" The a pplicant group contends this statem ent is inaccu rate, as reflected o n an evidence-based article they p rovided. Response: The departm ent appreciates the app licant group providing th e published article: Effects of Colon Irrigation on Serum Electrolytes.17 The article discusses seventeen health patients receiving three colonic irrigation treatm ents over a one-week period. W hile of st exp ltered serum electrolytes\" during the research trial. There is no suggestion of the long term consequences if the treatm ents had continued beyond the one-week period. The article (Table 4) includes a list of references to articles where co mplications were associated with colonic therapies. The article the applicant group pr ovided to support the safety of the procedure does not support the applican t group's po sition. 9. Comment : Under \"Safety and Effi cacy,\" th e statem ent \"Death and serious injury have been associated w ith colon hydrotherapy treatm ent without physician involvem ent\" is m isleading. Response : The final report in cludes citation s to each statem ent about injury and risk from the colon hydrotherapy procedure. W ording in the final report has been ch anged to distinguish between the trea tment, and injury, and risk of harm. 10. Comme nt: Regarding the finding that colon hydrot herapy is the practice of m edicine, following the direction of a licen sed practitioner does not m ake an activity or procedu re the practice of m edicine. Response: The W ashington Court of Appeals has m ade its decision about whether or not colon hydrotherapy is the pract ice of m edicine. Following the direction of a licensed practitioner in m aking the procedure availabl e does not chang e the character of the procedure: it is still the practice of medicine. As a result, under W ashington law, it m ust be perform ed by a licensed provider or delegated to a provider with the procedure within his or her scope of practice. 11. Commen t: Regarding the Departm ent's analysis of the f irst sun rise cr iterion ( that unregulated practice can clearl y harm or endanger public heal th): The analysis includes statem ents that are inaccurate, m isleading, a nd support regulation of colon hydrotherapists as independent practitioners. The departm ent's an alysis reflects bias. No medical school or naturopathic school in W ashington trai ns or teach es about co lon hydrotherapy. Response: The applicant group's points are red undant with those m ade above. The departm ent's research confirm ed that colon hyd rotherapy is taught at Bastyr University as part of the curricu lum and practice in its teach ing clin ic (Bas tyr Center for Natural Health ). 17 Collins, J. G, and Mitt for publicatio n Febru ary 1, 1009. The department was not able to confirm that this article was from a peer-re viewe d journa l that could be seen as a reliable comment on standard of care . The applicants provi ded a c opy of the article n oting an internet ad dress. Howe ver, that address is curren tly in activ e. Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page 12 The applicant group does not agree with the depa rtment's analysis and conclusions, but this does not ind icate bias in analys is of the sunris e criteria. 12. Commen t: Regarding the departm ent's analysis of the second s unrise criterion (that the public needs and will benefit from an assurance of professional ability): The opposite is true from the departm ent's conclusion that the second sunrise criterion is no t met in the applicant group's proposal. Response: The departm ent stands by its analysis of this criterion. The procedure is already regulated through the scope of practice of professionals. Through proper delegation, the assurance of professional ability wou ld be in place without th e need to create a new profession with a single proce dure as the scope of practice. 13. Comme nt: Regarding the departm ent's analysis of the third sunrise criterion (that public protection cannot be m et by other means in a cost-effective m anner): Other professions do not have any required training for colon hydr otherapy in any schools and the only way the legislature can ensure indivi duals perform ing this valuable service are trained is by certification or regulation by law. Response: The departm ent stands by its analysis of the third sunrise criterion. The departm ent's analysis clearly i ndicates that colon hydrotherapy is already within the scope of practice of a num ber of health care providers in Washington. These professions already have established regulatory program s. Cr eating a new program with associated adm inistrative costs (for staff, rule-m aking, testing, and enfor cement actions) is not th e most cost effective method of re gulation. Regulation could be m et by other m eans (such as recognition of the procedure as within the scope of pr actice for established professions). 14. Comme nt: The testimony at the public hearing esta blished that colon hydrotherapy is not the practice of m edicine. There is no tr aining in any W ashingt on m edical school or naturopathic school on colon hydrotherapy. Response: Bastyr Center for Naturopathic Medici ne told the departm ent that colon hydrotherapy is in the curriculum and practice and is included in its teaching clinic. We acknowledge that use of a \"colonic irrigation syst em\" may not be taught in the curriculum at allopathic or osteopathic m edical schools. The analysis, as discussed above, indicates that the determ ining factor is the character of the procedure. The Court of Appeals decided that colon hydrotherapy is the practice of medicine in Washington. It is in the scope of practice for allopathic, osteopathic, and naturopathic phy sicians given the broad scope of practice for these professions. Public comments in response to draft 1. Comment: There are many benefits of the colon hydrotherapy procedure and it should be licen sed. Response: The Sunrise Review Process focuses on wh ether or not a particular profession should be recognized as hea lth care providers and not on specific procedures. The departm ent appreciates comments that the \"p rocedure\" should be \"l icensed,\" but licensing specific p rocedures is o utside th e focus of this sunrise review. Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page 13 2. Comment (fr om many physicians , including naturopathic physicians) : Colon hydrotherapy is not the p ractice of m edicine. The pro cedure s hould be available becau se it is a \"wellnes s\" procedure outside of the scope of m edicine. Allo pathic, o steopathic, and naturopathic physicians do not have tim e to do the pro cedure. They have to delegate it. Response: The departm ent appreciates this com ment. However, the departm ent can not ignore cou rt preceden t that has determ ined col on hydrotherap y is the p ractice of m edicine. 3. Comment: Colon hydrotherapy is a wellness p rocedure. It is a \"serv ice\" (cleansing service) and not a medical procedure. It should not be the practice of medicine. The departm ent should not take this service aw ay from people who need it. Response: The Court o f Appeals has set precedent, in publishing the Yo w decision, that colon hydrotherapy is the practi ce of m edicine. The departm ent cannot ignore this decision. 4. Comment: Colon hydrotherapists shoul d not be licensed as pract itioners who can practice independently. Response: This is consistent with the departm ent's recomm endation. The departm ent does not recommend creating a new health car e provider for colon hydrotherapists. 5. Comment: Colon hydrotherapy should continue to be totally unregulated in W ashington. The departm ent should not m ove for ward with the sunrise recomm endations. Response: Under W ashington law, we are required to perform a review and report back to the leg islatu re when req uested to perfor m a sunrise review.

I-ACT stands for the Intern ational Association for Col on H ydrotherapy . It was founded as a n on- profit associa tion in 1989. In the By -Laws of the Co rporation, there is establishe d the Board of I-ACT, which is responsible for setting training standards , establishing trai ning s yllabi, and certify ing (by exam ) that the m embers have ach ieved one of f our levels (Foundation Level - level 1, Intermediate Level - level 2, Advanced Level - level 3, and Instructor Level - level 4) of training com petence. Al so in the I- ACAT By -Laws, a separ ate and independent Board is established called the National Board for Colon Hydrotherapy (NBCHT). The responsib ility of this Board is to establish certification standards by working with the National Organization of Com petency Assurance (NOCA) and establish a N ational Exam ination that m ight be used by municipalities and states in the US, and also by other foreign countries. Question 1 of the appl icant report Please provide additional i nform ation about t he problem and why regulation is necessary . (a) What is the nature of the potential harm to th e public if colon hydrotherapists are not regulated, and the extent to which the re is a threat t o public health and safety? Colon H ydrotherapy is rela tively safe when pr acticed within the g uidelines as prom ulgated by I- ACT. Howe ver, when left unregulated, there coul d be severe and devastating har m to the public. As reported in The New England Jo urnal of Me dicine, Vol 307, #6, August 5, 1982 , \"at least 36 cases of a mebiasis occurre d in persons who had a col onic irrigation therapy at a chiropractic clinic in Western Colorado. Of 10 persons who required colect omy, six died.\" It was rep orted that the cause was im properly cleaned and m aintained colon h ydrot herapy equi pment that did not have pro per safety features and requirem ents for disinfectin g. In order to preclude the possibility of thi s even happening, I-ACT has established a polic y that all colon h ydrot herapist MUST use equipment that is currently registered with the F ood and Drug Administration (FDA). Thi s equipm ent must have appropriate backflow prevent ion, m ust use disposable tubing and disposable specul ums or rectal tubes. The equipm ent must be disinfected after each use following the FDA approved cleaning guidelin es for the manufacturer of that equipment. A recent check with the Center for Disease Cont rol and Prevention found that the re has been no reports of any such spread of disease in the past 25 years. Although there have been a few allegatio ns of injur y as a result of bowel perforation d uring a colon hydrotherapy session, there ha ve been no verified cases that t hat has ever happened. In one case of an all egation of inj ury, from Las Vegas, NV, the therapist was found to have done absolutely no harm to the client and the clie nt was ordered to pa y restitution. The only way to actively help to protect the safet y of the public is to establish standards for colon hydrotherapists that m ust be adhered with. The best example is the State of Florida. In Florida, they have licensed colon h ydrot herapists for 30 years, in that time there have been no reports of an y injuries or de aths as a re sult of colon hydrotherapy in that time fra me. The FDA reg ulates colon hydrotherapy manufactur ers, however, it is the responsibility of each state to regulate the profession in that state. Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page C-1 (b) What is t he extent to which consumers ne ed and will benefit from a method of regulation identify ing com petent pract itioners? Colon H ydrotherapy is rela tively safe pr acticed within the g uidelines as prom ulgated by I- ACT. Be est ablishing similar, or identical guidelines, the state: - will ensure that onl y traine d and qualified pr actitioner s are performing colon hydrotherapy - will guarantee that the equipment is registered with the FDA - will guarantee that onl y disposable tubi ng will be use d - will guarantee the cleanliness of the faci lity - will guarantee that the public has the safest facility possible (c) What is the extent of autonom y a pra ctitioner has, as indicated by : (i) the extent to which colon hydrotherapy calls for independent judgment and the extent of skill or experience required in maki ng the in dependent ju dgment; and (ii) the extent to which pra ctitioners are superv ised? Are there any supervision r equirem ents? Are colon h ydrotherapists being supervi sed and if so , by whom ? Are there any internship or c linical supervised experience require ments? Prior to each session, the colon hydrothe rapist reviews the current intake for m with the client. This i ntake form has a list of contra indications. If there are any contraindications, then the colon hydrotherapist will refer t he client back to their attending physician for approval to perform the colonic. The colon h ydrotherapist i s trained in h ow to take th e intake form , and what to l ook for during the pr e-session interview. There is no requirement for the col on hydrotherapist t o be supervis ed. The I-ACT training s yllabus requires that each colon hydrotherapist perform a minimum of 25 colo nics under the supe rvision of an I-ACT Certified Instructor. Question 3 of the appl icant report You indicate you are seeking certification rather than l icensure due to the anticip ated costs to manage a licensing progra m. What did you base this differential on? (We are unaware of decre ased cost s due to a profession being certified as co mpared t o licensed.) Perhaps we are mistaken, since we now understand th at certification is just as costly to manage as licensure, we would accept either certific ation or li censure which ever is dee med m ore appropriate. Question 4 of the appl icant report Your answer mentions that there have been allega tions of injury. Please provide additional information on inj uries. - What ty pes of injuries can occur? - How often d o they occur ? - Are there particular patient pop ulations at greater risk for injur y? - What are the contraindications for this therapy? - What are the warning signs of injury? Although this procedure is rela tively harmless and extrem ely safe when practiced according t o I- ACT Guidelines, there alw ays is the potential for the spread of disease if the equipment is not registered Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page C-2 with the FDA, and if the equipm ent in not cleaned and disinfected according t o the guidelines of the manufacturer. In addition, t here is an extrem ely rare possibilit y that an external or internal hem orrhoid can bleed, or that the rectu m may be punctur ed durin g the insertion of t he speculum or rectal nozzle. Although the possibilit y exists, there have been no ver ified reports of actual injury as a result of colon hydrotherap y. There are certain drugs that thin t he wall of the colon , and clients that are taking them should o nly do so at the d irection of th eir attending physician or health care provider. Our therapist are made a ware o f such drugs d uring their trai ning. The population that is at the greatest risk are paraplegics and quadriplegics. Following is a generic list of the contrai ndications for colon h ydrot herapy (the list is generic as each manufacturer of colon hy drotherapy equipm ent has a list of FDA recognized contraindic ations specific to that equipm ent}: Uncontrolled Hypertension or Congestiv e Heart Failure Aneury S evere Carcino Crohn' s Disease Abdom inal Hernia Recent Colon Surgery (less than three months) First and thir d trim ester of pregnancies Please provide a copy of the Florida law establishing licen sure for c olon hydrothe rapists in Florida. Our research indicates Florida issues an endorsement on a massage ther apist license f or colon hydrotherapy . We have not l ocated a law granting col on hydrotherap ists independ ent licensure. Our reference to Flori da licensing colon hydrotherapists is a general state ment that means a person may not perform colon h ydrot herapy in Flor ida without bei ng licensed b y the state of Florida. The state of Florida requires the individuals to be licensed in m assage t herapy and can then gain a certification to perform colonics. Without that license they cannot perform colonics in Florida. There is not a separate and independent license for colon hydrotherapy that is separat e from the massage license. The purpose of the Florida mass age law identifies the potential risk. \"480 .032 Purpose. --The Legislature recognizes that the practi ce of massage is potentiall y dangerous to the public i n that massage therapists must have a know ledge of anatom y and ph ysiolog y and an understandin g of the relati onship between the structur e and the fun ction of the ti ssues being treated and the total funct ion of t he body. Massag e is therapeutic, and regulations ar e necessary to protect the public from unqualified practitioners. It is therefore deem ed necess ary in the interest of public health, safety , and welfar e to regulate the practice of massage in this st ate; however, restrictions shall be im posed to the extent necessary to protect the public from significant a nd discernible danger to health and yet not in such a manner whi ch will unreasonably affect the com petitive market. Further, consumer protection for both health and econom ic matters shall be afforded the p ublic throug h legal rem edies provided for i n this act.\" Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page C-3 With colonics under the Fl orida Massage Board, the specific requirements ar e set forth in t he Florida Administrative code Chapter 64B7-31 64B7-31.001 Colonic Irrigation. (1) Intent (a) The Boar d of Massage finds that the colonic irri gation procedures, while falli ng directly within the scope of Chapter 480, Flor ida Statutes, presents a su bstantial danger to the publi c if performed by incom petent practitioners. (b) The Board of Massage further finds that a si gnificant proportion of licensees do not perform the colonic procedure and further that a significant prop ortion of thos e desiring to enter the profession do not intend to engage in the practice of colonics. (c) This rule is prom ulgated to ensure th at onl y those who have been determ ined duly qualified to practice colonic irriga tion m ay do s o in an effort to protect the health, safety and welfare o f the public. (2) Prior to the practice of colonic irriga tion, an y licensed mas sage therapist, or apprentice shall be required to present certifi cation to the Board of succes sful com pletion of exam ination by a Board approved m assage school after co mpletion of a super vised classro om course of study in colonic irrigation or in the case of a dul y authorized apprenticeship training program , evidence of ha ving com pleted 100 hours of col onic irrigation training, i ncluding a minimum of 45 h ours of clinic al practicu m with a minim um of 20 treatments given.

Specific Authority 480.035(7), 48 0.041( 4) FS. L aw Implemented 480.032, 31.001, Amen 1-26- 5-5-04. The Florida certification application foll ows: Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page C-4 Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page C-5 In addition, please address the benefit to the public if regulation is granted. To help us understand your position better, please explain: (a) The extent to which the incidence of specifi c problem s present from lack of regulation for colon hydrotherapists can reason ably be exp ected to be reduced by regula tion. Although colon hydrot herap y is relatively safe procedure, without r egulation, t here exists a potential risk. The state of Florida has recognized this potential risk and identifies it in the Fl orida Administrative Code, 64B7-31.001 Colonic Irrigation \"... presents a substantial danger to the public if performed by incom petent practitioners.\" (b) Whether t he public can identif y qualified practitioners; Once Washin gton accepts the need for certification, the public can then expect to find a state of Washington \" certificate\" d esignating the indivi dual as being state certified. Currently I-ACT provides its members a c ertificate of membership an d then also provides certificates de signation that the therapist has achieved certain levels of trai ning co mpetence (Fo undation , Intermediate, Ad vanced, and Instructor ). With th is inform ation, the pub lic can then m ake an inform ed decision about the therapist and the procedure. With state cer tification the public will be secure in knowing the therapist is using equipm ent that is safe sinc e it is registered with the FDA. (c) The extent to which the public can be conf ident tha t qualified pr actitioners are co mpetent; Once Washin gton accepts the need for certification, then the publi c will know t hat the therapist has dem onstrated a certain level of know ledge and expertise and this will give the public confi dence that the therapist is qualifi ed and com petent. (d) The assurance to the public that practitione rs have maintained their co mpetence. Once Washin gton accepts the need for certification, then the publi c will know t hat the therapist has dem onstrated a certain level of know ledge and expertise and this will give the public confi dence that the therapist is qualifi ed and com petent, and with a requirem ent for contin uing education credits, the public wil l understand t hat the original level of qualification and com petence will be maintained. Question 6 of the appl icant report Maintenance of standards - legal requir ements that d efine or enforce standards. What are the core curriculum requirem ents in colon hydrotherap y school ? I-ACT has e stablished a syllabi for each level of training. The Foundation level is similar wit h the requirements of the state of Florida tr aining for col on hydrot herap y. The outli ne for the Fo undation Level sy llabu s is shown here: Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page C-6 Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page C-7 What subjects are covered in the certification exam ination? The certificat ion exam for the Foundation Level (Level 1) 1 has 10 0 questions a nd covers; Business Ethics, Offic e Procedures, He alth & San itation, Anatom y & Phy siology, Colon H ydrotherapy Theory , History and Practice. Is first aid part of the curriculum ? Yes, it is covered under health & sanitat ion, and ag ain in the i nternship/apprenti ceship. In 2008, I-ACT will require all new students be trained in CPR prior to enrol ling in a cour se of training. Does the curr iculum prepar e students for e mergenci es they m ay face and how to properly address the m or make emergency referrals? This is determined by the licenses of the col on hydrotherapy student. MDs, DOs, NDs, RN s, PAs, etc. will be able to off er greater lev els of support durin g a pote ntial em ergen cy situatio n, but a colon hydrotherapist should leave em ergency reactions to the experts, the same as any other service provider, and shoul d sim ply dial 911 for assistance. How do the curriculum requirement and exam ination assure public safety ? Yes, it is covered under health & sanitat ion, and ag ain in the i nternship/apprenti ceship. Safet y of the public is a prim ary concern of I-ACT. Do any of the FDA-approved devices used in colon hydr otherapy require a presc ription? If yes, how are colon h ydrot herapists acquiring them ? Yes, the FDA has registere d equipm ent used fo r colon irrigation under two categories, Class 1 devices (gene rally called ene ma kits) do not requi re prescriptions. The Class 2 devices do require prescriptions to purchase the equipm ent and order the supplies. I- ACT reco mmends that the t herapist get prescriptions for the procedure. The the rapists in th e state of Florida do not require prescriptions licensed and certified. The prescription m ay come from any individual that has script authority in their state. Question 7 of the appl icant report Do you have any inform ation o n how m any colon hydrotherapists in Washingto n are not I-ACT certified. Unfortunately, there is no way for us t o gather this inf ormation; ho wever, during a Washingto n meeting in April 2007, there were ove r 20 non-I-ACT mem bers in attendance. Question 9 of applica nt report You state that functions inc lude cons ultation with referring MD, DC, ND, DO Are refe rrals before or after medical procedures the only reason pe ople are refer red to you by these doctors? Is t his the onl y time y ou co nsult with doctor s? Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page C-8 Since I-ACT is reco mmen ding that the therapists get prescriptions for the procedure, each client should have a prescription on file. We r equest the col on hydrot herapist report the results of the colonic irrigation to the referring ph ysician. Additionall y, if there are an y contraindic ations noted on the in take form , the colon h ydrot herapist would report to the referring health care practitioner th e contraindication and their concern, and seek the physicians consent prior to continui ng wi th the proced ure.

INTRODUCTION OF SUNRISE PANEL Margaret Gilbert, Depa rtment of Health, Sen ior Staff Attorney Joshua Shipe, Depa rtment of Heal th, Customer Ser vice M anage r Mike Nat h, public m ember Dick Hoenninger, E xecuti ve Director of I-ACT, was th e first presenter on behalf of the app lican t group. M r. Hoenninger present ed a PowerPoint prese ntation of the Sunrise propo sal, which is attached at th e end of th is appendix. Our delegation m embers are: Dr. Rus sel Kol bo, I-ACT Pres ident, Naturo path, and Ch iropractor Dr. Kornberg, Medical Doctor Dr. Derrick Kim, Naturo path Dr. Bre nt Warner, Chi ropract or Rebecca Harde r, I-ACT ce rtified m ember from Washington vertz, I-ACT certified member from Was hington Cherie Kol bo, Dr. Kolbo's wife, I- ACT certified member an d instructor I-ACT is t he Intern ation al Asso ciatio n for Colon Hydro therapy and we st rongly believe legislation w ould be a very beneficial asset to Washington. I wou ld like to give you my backgr ound on ho w I got involv ed in colon hydrotherapy. I was a pilot in th e United States Air Force for 22 years. For six yea rs, I flew an aircraft called a U-2, high altitu de reco nnaissan ce. Back in th e 1960's, Gary Powers go t sho t down in one over Ru ssia. This is a sing le seat, h igh altitu de aircraft and you have to wear a pressure su it because the altitu de you fly is well abov e 70,000 feet and the mission duration is well in excess of 12 hours. In that aircraft at t hat altitu de, if we had a decom pressio n, the blood wou ld boil, so we flew in a pressure su it just lik e an astron aut. Th ere was a system to urinate in the suit, bu t none t o defecat e. For those of you not used to this ty pe of langua ge, we will talk about the colon a nd defecation because that's part of our profession. In that airc raft, beca use we had no way t o defecate, a fter hours of flying if you felt the urge you had two choices: either soil your suit or hold it. All of us did the best we could so we wouldn't be em barra ssed when we got down and were helped out of our pressur e suit. It was e xtremely embarrassi ng and unimaginable to have to go through. In six years, over 1,000 hours of flying that aircraft I had trained my colon not to go on demand. It had actually becom e so bad that I might have a bowel movem ent once a week . And the flight surgeon would just tell me that was normal for my body, and that's what I heard for years, about 20 years. After I retired from the Air Force I becam e invol ved in nat uropathic heali ng and found out about col on hydrotherapy, a nd I can tell you personally because of col on hydrotherapy, I am now extrem ely regular and have about two t o three bowel m ovem ents a day because I wa s able to retrai n my colon. If you've e ver been constipated for a long time, you know it's very uncomfortable . Because I'm now regular , I've e xperience d a great se nse of relief and it's actually cha nged m y whole sen se of well b eing. That's why I'm so committed to what we're doing. See Powe rPoint attached at t he end of this hearing summary for Mr. Hoenninger's presentation. Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-1 Mr. Hoenninger read the introduction of the article, An Outbreak of Amebiasis Spre ad by C olonic Irrigation at a Chiropractic Clin ic, from the New England Journal of Medicine, August 5, 1982. See article attached at the end of this hearing summary. In the state of Colorado there was a chiropractor using equipment not registered with the FDA. They found this equipment had been contaminated an d over continued use of this equipment, it resulted in the deat hs of over six individuals. So in 1982, the New England Journal of Medicine identified colon hydrotherapy as haza rdous and needing to be reviewed. In 1985, the U.S. Congress em powered the FDA to h ave greater invo lvement in these devices and so the FDA now registers and regulates colon hydrothera py equipm ent. One of their c oncerns was t he spread of amebic dysentery. One of the things we know now is t hat the e quipm ent use d has guara ntees of sa fety. If it is clean , maintained, an d disinfected acco rding to m idelines, th e equ ipment is ab solutely safe. Since t he FDA began registering the equipment, there has not been a single incidence of the spread of disease f rom an FDA registered device. We use single-use, disposabl e rectal tubes a nd tubing. All of that is thrown away after each c onsum er. T hen the table is cleane d extensively. And the room shoul d be im maculate. Now the problem is that not everyone uses FDA registered equipment. There's equipment out there that may be a five-gallon drum on the wall. And we know th ere is equ ipment that is not registered with th e FDA bu t is in use. We recommend and require our therapists to use that, but I can't tell you that every colon hydrotherapist in the state of Wash ington is using FDA registered e quipment. If I could we'd know it was safe, bu t I can't tell you that. Conce rns: Puncturing See Imbalances - See P owerP oint Dr. Russell Kolbo next presented the remainder of the PowerP oint. I've been license d as a c hiropractor in Washington since Febr uary of 1970 and as a n aturopathic ph ysician since 1971. I've presented on colon hydrotherapy at many conferences as well as one of our naturopathic institutions. I have over 40 years experience in using e nemas and col on hydrothera py. I'm presentin g contraindications, precautions, ris k manage ment, and indications fo r this procedure. First I'd lik e to em phasize and talk briefly ab out sanitation. Our t herapists no t only follow th e manufacturers' guidelines for sanitizin g their devices, but they make sure their facility is clean and maintained in th e app ropriate manner. Part of the certificatio n pro cess is t o send in pictures of their facility wh ich includes a picture of the device they're using, the room where th e session is held, the waitin g roo m, and the restro oms. Personal hygiene is also one of the important parts of our training, including the frequency of hand washing, and the rest of the personal hygiene. Contraindications are taught by our I-ACT certified instructors or certified schools. The difference is that an instructor can train one to three p eople at a time an d the school can train as m any students as th ey have the facilities to accomm odate. St udents are taught acc ording to I-ACT standa rds by the sylla bi, copies of which we re given to Sherry Tho mas this morning. The following is a list of contraindications as submitted by the manufact urers of FDA registered e quipment. When they submit for approval of their devices, t hey subm it lists of contraindications. The individuals who have any of the con traindicatio ns we will b e talking abou t must be referred to th eir pri mary h ealth provider for evaluation before they continue to have a colon hydrotherapy session. It is I-ACT policy and is taught by I-ACT instructors that the list of c ontraindications as listed with the FDA m ust appe ar on their i ntake form .

Dick referred to a study regarding electro lyte i mbalances. The study shows they occurre d in quadra and paraplegics. T his is because of the retention of the water for longer. I want to refer to an incidenc e most of us have heard about that happened in the early part of the spring. It was a ra dio contest in San Francisco to see how much w ater you could drink, how long you could hold it, and you could win a video game. The l ady entered the contest so she could win the video game for her son. She wasn 't feeling well when she got home so s he called the radio station w ho suggested she get medical help. Unfortunately, the lady died. She was 27 years ol d, I believe, a nd the mother of three young children. The cause of death wa s water auto-intoxication. It was set up from the electro lyte i mbalance. So there is a c oncern a nd I rece ntly surveyed all the m anufact urers of FDA registere d equipm ent and t heir average tim e for a session is approxim ately 45 m inutes.

The first thing I would do for infants to save me from making a house call was t o have them receive a n enem a. The n if they were n't better I would go to t he house .

Rebecc a Harder , I-ACT certified colon hydrotherapist in Washington, present ed the DVD of a colon hydrotherapy sessi on, including the intake form. Every day at m y clinic I hear a comm on st atement that I think every colon h ydrotherapist in this room hears as well. \"This is not what I thou ght it was going to be lik e.\" And they u sually say it with a big smile o n their face. I knew coming he re today that I was addressing a panel that had probably never seen a colon hydrotherapy session, probably neve r been in a clinic or probably never seen FDA registered equipment. The best way to introduce y ou to that is to show it to you on a video. I've prepared a five-m inute video of an overall colon hydrotherapy session. It shows one of the room s at my place and it i s using FDA re gistered equi pment. As Dick and R ussell both said, the re are differen t types of FDA reg istered equipmen t. As I-ACT is no t petitioning only on e, we are reco gnizin g all th e diffe rent types of FD A registered equipm ent; this is just the one I use at my place. In this video, there are two things I wan t to point out before I show it. Fi rst is you are going to see a tub e. I'v e brought you on e. The tub es must be used with a prescription. You m ust be an I-ACT ce rtified therapist with a presc ription i n order to receive this tube. (Passed tube to panel). As you can see, th is is a one use only, disposable rectal tu be. In the video, I will b e showing how far th e client will in sert t his tub e into themselves in privacy. The seco nd point you will see is th e intake form. Every therapist in this room that is I-ACT certified uses a form that has contrain dication s, and they go over it with clients bef ore each ses sion. In addition, I go over a consult so they understand what is going to happen and how their digestive syste m is going to be affected . Showed Video Now I would like to in troduce Dr. Derrick Ki m, naturopath in Portland, Board Certified in Washington and Oregon, who is here to answ er any questions t he panel may have. Also, Dr. Brent Warner is a ch iropractor in Portland. He also taugh t at th e naturop athic college and he's als o here t o answer questi ons. Now I would like to introduce Dr. Jacob Kornberg, who is a medical doct or and surgeon and he would like to make a few statem ents. Dr. Jacob Kor nberg. I'm a licen sed m edical doctor in Wash ington. I am also a board ce rtified s urgeon and a fellow of th e American College of Surgery. I've practiced medicine for over 30 years in Washington, 25 of them as a general surg eon in Puyallup and the last five years as a m ore holistic, functio nal medicine practitio ner. You may ask how an allopathic, board surgeon would take his day off to com e down here to testify for colon hydrotherapy. I was i ntrodu ced to this marvelous modality ab out 10 years ag o when a patient was sen t to m e by a gastroen terologist for something called Megacolon. This is a lady who was not on a U-2 plane but had been constipated for so long that her colon was so large that th e gastroen terologist thou ght the only thing we could do was t o remove that part of her colon. She was able to get back to fairly normal bowel function after having colon hydrotherapy. As a surgeon, I was also sent all sorts of difficult cases. I was t he elder surgeon in Puyallup, a nd I would be sent cases o f abdominal pain. After listening to them and ha ving this experience with the colon hydrotherapist, I got to realize that these pat ients who were sent to me with like sets of adhesions, real ly didn't have a surgeon problem. They had a functio nal problem of their bowel. I started my search for an answer, g ot hooked up with the Institute of Functional Med icine, got cert ified and the last few years of my surgical career, d id very little su rgery. I was ab le to help most of my patients through a more functional approach to th eir bowels. On e of th e things th at was so amazing to me was how little yo u learned in m edical sch ool about the normal functions of the bowel. We learn ed abo ut pathology and all th e parasites bu t we didn't learn abou t the no rmal flo ra, the normal functio n of these cells th at are actually over 100 trillio n foreigners liv ing within our bodies that are m ore than our own normal cells. I was very disappo inted with all my g astroenterology friends an d their approach in helping me. I would send these functional patients to them and t hey would get a colonoscopy, an endoscopy and they would get sent back to me saying they're ready for surgery. And these people need ed no more surg ery th an you and I do. Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-5 Another great case was an older boy who was so constipated that he was on cups of Miralax. He would have a bowel movem ent once a week. It so destroyed his social life that he spent his whole morning and afternoon on the toilet. Finally with the help of a colon hydrotherapist, we retrained him and he se nt me a letter say ing he went out for football his seni or year. All his life, all the pediatricians did was give him more laxatives, neve r addressing retraining his colon. From a functional medicine point of view, we live in a country with very poor diet, very poor exercise, very poor fiber, and we are chronically constipated. About 95% of my patients I see who have chronic disease have constip ation. I define that as anyone who doesn 't go once or twice a d ay, hav e soft stools, and the am ount of the stool equals fro m your elbow to your fingertips. If you're one of these people, you are constipated, and yo u need diet, ex ercise, stress redu ction , and maybe the help of a colon hydrotherapist to retrain yo ur bowel. I can still remember as a child having that urge, wanting to have a bowel movem ent an d my mother telling m e to finish my food before I could have a bowel movem ent. We a re trained as children, just like the pilot, to hold our stool in. I myself after this youn g man, went to the hydrotherapist and said that I needed to know more about this. My wife and I had several th erapies and I actu ally stoo d there an d watch about a dozen proce dures. I was am azed at, when there is certificatio n and FD A approved equi pment (this wa s alm ost as clean as my opera ting room ) that this is a great m odality. I no w use it freq uently with my p atients. I believe deeply that just lik e a medical d octor that I n eed to be certifie d, have continuing e duca tion. As a s urgeon, every piece of my equi pment has to be FDA a pprove d, I believe the public needs the protection of certification of colon hydrotherapists. They need to have a level of education , level of internship, and con tinuing edu catio n. I have found it to be an excellen t modality with my patients. I'm here t o strongly recom mend ce rtification. Any questions? Rebecc a Harder : Do you believe an MD needs to be prese nt during a c olon hydrotherapy sessi on? Answer (Dr. Kornberg): Absolutely not. As a surgeon, I do not believe colon hydrotherapy is surgery. It is no more su rgery than in sertin g a rectal th ermometer. Th is boy, for example, will probably need recurren t training with a therapist. He doesn't need to pay $290 to see m e just to be referred to that colon hydrotherapist. I do believe the colon hydrotherapists nee d to be certified to protect the public. Rebecc a Harder : Ha ve you see the guidelines at I-AC T and do y ou think they a re sufficient ? Answer (Dr. Kornberg): Yes, they are excell ent. QUESTI ONS FOR APPLIC ANTS FROM SUNRISE PANELIST S Mike Nath: Working with children, is there an age lim it where maybe a medical doct or isn't necessa ry? Are there preca utions t hat are c with c hildren of a ce rtain a ge? Answer (Dr. Kornberg): I think you saw the precautions t hat an I-ACT ce rtified colon hydrothera pist would use. I don't think you're going to have a real problem. What is amazing to me is that I consider a colon hydrotherapist as sort of a personal trainer for your bowel functio n muscles. One of the am azing t hings is they actually look at t he stool. Nobody does t hat, even your gastroe nterologist. And they ca n tell m e about digestive and pancreatic function by the material . There's a lo t of inform ation, so when a ch ild comes in, you can look and see poo r eating h abits, whet her they have enough dietary fiber, enough hydration like water. I feel a ph ysician does not need to be present for th is typ e of treatm ent. Mike Nat h: Is there a n age limit? Answer (Rebecca Ha rder): I believe with I-ACT it is eight . A lot of it ha s to do wit h the size and em otions of a child. The mother is always present i n the roo m. She helps the child in sert the tub e. You cou ld have a very sm all eight year old. If you just look at the contrai ndications, what else is going on. Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-6 Answer (Dr. Kornberg): I think the em otional ag e of the child is im portant. They can look at th is as an invasive thing and you don't wan t to trau matize a ch ild. It's wh en you get into the teenage year s and they've had 15 and 20 years o f poor bowel habit that I really see t he benefit of colon hydrotherapy. Answe r (Rebecca Ha rder): And t he children have wanted it. They are not doing this agains t their will. They a re in pain and are having problems. Their doctors have referred them. Answer (Dr. Kornberg): Have you ever taken Miralax ? It's the sam e exact p urgative they g ive for colon therapy, which completely wip es you out. These little k ids are tak ing cups of it because they have no other way. Colon hydrotherapy is an ex cellen t altern ative. (Unknown responder): I think the doctor was r eferring to tak ing it fo r a co lonoscopy. Yes, i t's the same strong stuff a G.I. guy would give you for cleaning out your colon before a colonoscopy. This is what t hese kids are on chronically today. Josh Shipe: You had mentioned that colon hydrotherapists can view the waste material that com es out and give you some indications of diet and what -not. In that situation, would they be m aking particular diagnoses, as far as what types of food you shou ldn't eat, or im proper diet? Or wou ld they refer y ou to so meone like a dietitian? Answer (Dr. Kornberg): What they no rmally do is put on the rep ort wh at they see. Th ey will write so meth ing like \"undigested fiber\" or \"undigested fruit\" or whatever. They don't make the diagnosis. It's up to the referring physician to do a follow up examination and use his or her clinical judgment to actually make a t reatment. Work together in a team and i t's an amazing am ount of information that I don't get from any of my other c olleague s in the medical profession. Answer (Rebecca Ha rder): The size of the waste c oming out, if there is a lot of gas or bloa ting, what color, we write down what we see and fax it into the doct or. W e're there to assist and encourage the client. They don't need much encouragem ent beca use it's not an unp leasan t sessi on. They relax , listen to music, and feel so much better afterwa rds. Marg aret Gilb ert: In at least so me of the insurance programs in Washington, individuals can self-refer for a variety of therapies. How do you feel th is fittin g in to your proposed legislation ? Answer (Dick Hoenninger): It depends on how Washington establishes it. In Florida, the clients can self-refer because it's part of the state law a nd certific ation for the colon hydrothera pists. They do not re quire a prescription or anything. We recommend that our therapists are getting physician referrals of their prim ary h ealth care practitio ners. The FDA regu lated the manufactu o f the devices. Th e state regu lates th e profession , so every state h as the right to determine how this happens. For ex ample in Georg ia, the city of Stockbridg e, they requ ire the colon therapists to follow the national board CEU requ iremen t, but the medical board of Georgia has said that it is not the pract ice of medicine so they don't want their doctors involved in it. In California, they have determined if the client does the insertion of the speculum or rectal tube, it's no t the practice o f medicine and the clien t can get it as they deem appropriate. So, eve ry state will be sl ightly different, depending on the requirements of t he state and what you determin e. In all cases, we're going to reco mmend the clien t still d o the intake form , check for th e contraind icatio ns reported by the clien t and that they m ust go back to t heir health ca re provider if they check any. Mike Nat h: I'm confuse d about the water. Is this high temperature wat er? Answer (Dr. Kolbo): No, the temperature of the wate r is between 98 a nd 104 de grees. We rec ommend t hey start out at a bout 99 or 100, but not to exceed 104. T he devices are programm ed to shut off at 104 and t hat's t he FDA regulation. You may wan t to fluctuate it m ore to th e warm side or cool side to get the bowel to respond better. All the water is filtered, m ost of them by carbon filter and ultraviolet, so the water is v ery clean . This is filt ered tap water. Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-7 Answer (Dick Hoenninger): That's why we reco mmen d the u ltraviolet fil tration because some city tap water still has pr oblems. Answer (Dr. Kolbo): In the FD A reg istered devices, m ost have at least two filtration systems. Mike Nath: Nothing is add ed to the water, su ch as salin e? Answer (Dr. Kolbo): There can be substances ad ded to the water as long as they're prescribed by a provider with state presc riptive authority. For exam ple, if our medical doctor here wanted to have a substance or medication adde d to the water, he could do that. But without a prescription, it is pure water in, water waste out. Mike Nat h: What kind of medications? Answer (Dr. Kornberg): Most of what I pres cribe a re called im plants. I've prescri bed probiotics. I've asked the colon hydrotherapist to in still in to the colon a mix ture of good, health bacteria. Th at's the m ain additive I'v e used. It's usually done at th e end of th e session to try to improve the health of the colon flora. Answer (Dr. Kolbo): As a physician I've al so presc ribed the implants. For irritable bowel syndrome, I've used aloe vera. Some physician s may wan t to add in cortison e drugs for something like sev ere co litis. Mike Nath: Are th ere I-ACT guidelines or lists for t he typ es of th ings to be u sed? Answer (Dick Hoenninger): That's up the refe rring physician . All I-ACT reco mmen ds is water in , water out unless direction from a phy sician. Mike Nat h: I also wanted to ask in regard to preca utions. Is there monitoring of blood pressure , heart rate, or anything ? What if som eone suddenly feel s weak and t heir blood press ure drops ? Answer (Dr. Kolbo): They immediately stop the sessi on, anything that's not within their training as far as a norm al sessi on, as far as car diac conditions, uncontrolled blood pressur e, high or low. I personally am consci ous about if a client was going in for a ses sion with low blood sugar, for exam ple, I m ake sure they have something to eat before going in for a sessio n. I think therapists are t rained and listen to I-ACT and are m ade aware of th ese factors, will stop the session if an ything is no t norm al. Karen Jensen: I think he was asking if th ere is actu al monitoring during the session ? Answer (Rebecca Harder): Yes. Not blood press ure. Answer (Dr. Ko lbo): They will be aware o f the changing of the ind ividual but not actual blood pressu re monitoring. Mike Nath: Th e first th ing they d o when I go into a doctor's office is check my blood pressure , heart rate, and maybe my temperat ure just to m ake sure I'm ok. Answer (Dr. Kornberg): I've actually been impressed with over-cautiousness, having patients kicked back to me because they found s omething on the intake form that I overlooke d and they wa nted to patient rec hecked a nd confirmed. I've actu ally found them over rather than under-cau tious. Mike Nath: You talk ed about co ntraindictions that have to do with th inning blood, medicatio ns that would thin blood. Is there any attention given to aspirin? What if I just took five ibuprofen before I cam e in? Answer (Dr. Kornberg): Five ibuprofen prob ably wouldn't matter. Bu t any medicatio ns that thin the blood has the potential to increase t he bleeding from a pol yp. I used to do a lot of colonoscopies. People could start bleeding from just the prep. They would probably kick the patient back to me if there were any of the medications listed on the I-ACT list. Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-8 Mike Nat h: What pre vents t he wast e from going back into the tube? Answer (Rebecca Ha rder): Excellent questi on. Answer (Dr. Kolbo): Anatom ically, we ha ve a solid gate that only opens one way called t he ileocecal valve, s o the material d oesn't p ass back in to the small in testine. Th ere is also a backflow prevention valv e on the FDA regu lated devices. Th at's ano ther safety facto r built into the FDA regulated d evices, wh ere th ere are not these facto rs built into the home devices. Answer (Dick Hoenninger): If there's equipment that doesn't have the backflow prevention, some of the evac uation may go back in. T hat's what happe ned to the chiropract or in Colorado. The tubing act ually got contam inated. Answer (Rebecca Ha rder): The FDA has done a very thorough job investigating the m ain factors. It's incre dibly thorough wh at they've had to go through to get th ese devices registered w ith the FD A. Answer (Dick Hoenninger): They will h ave engineering documents that show that there cann ot be that possibility and to show what happens af ter the session is over. Everything is disinfected . Answer (Rebecca Ha rder): It takes m e at least 30 m inutes to disi nfect t he room and syste m, every s quare inc h of that system, the lines, the tube, eve rything. There is no way a ge rm coul d be passe d from one cl ient to the next. Marg aret Gilb ert: How is th e equipment inspected or m onitored? Things leak, let's face it. Answer (Dick Hoe nninger): The u nfortunate answer to that is th at we d irect o ur therapists to follow t he manufact urer recom mended guidelines for maintaining the equipment. Each m anufact urer has to have a set of maintenance st anda rds they want each user of that e quipm ent to follow. If I happen to be going though an area, I'll swing in and see if th ey've got their log s of changing filters and all of that. If th ere's leak s or anything like that, the manufacturer will h ave to tak e it back and repair it or send a repairman out. But the bottom line is th at it is I-ACT's recommendation to do this, but unless y ou're in a state th at has reg ulations to do this, th ere's no entity th at has the authority to go out and do that. Marg aret Gilb ert: Th at kind of respon sibility and maintenance is th e responsibility o f the therapist? Answer (Dick Hoenninger): Yes. Josh Shipe: You mentioned the treatm ent can be used for training the colon. Has there been any stud ies do ne on excessi ve treatment of colonics that could cause a ny issues of harm or overexpansion of the colon? Answer (Dick Hoenninger): We have n't heard anything like that. We don't want people to becom e dependent on colonics any more than we want them to become depen dent on laxatives. Each m anufacturer has a certain set of guidelines on how their equipment should be used the way they registered it with the FDA. We truly don't want our thera pists to e xceed those guidelines because there may be problem s. If y ou get a colonic eve ry day for 30 days, that's not good. You would really be cha nging the electrolytes and structure of the body. Answer (Rebecca Ha rder): There are differe nt protoc ols doctors refer for. Som e send in just for two ses sion, s ome once a week for six wee ks. Some are m ore than that. There is no cookie-cutter protocol for every client com ing in. They're c oming in with di fferent healt h issues and trying to achieve diffe rent goals. Kind of lik e chiropractic. Josh Shipe: You also m entioned the differen t levels of certificatio n, I think it was on e through four. Could you talk a little b it about th e differen t training and what it means, how th ey affect t he therapist when practicing colonics? Answer (Dick Hoenninger): The initial train ing, they are ta ught business ethics, health and hygiene, how to san itize equipment and maintain standard s, how to protect th emselves if work ing with clien ts with Aids. They are taugh t about history of the professi on, the proce dure itself. During the founda tion level t raining, each the rapist must do a minimum of 20 colonics with an instructor under supervision so they can ensure this individual is going to be Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-9 practicing safely with the pub lic. On e of the biggest co urses is anat omy and physiology, and they are given the entire stru cture with emphasis on the alim entary tract digestive system, functioning of the digestive function, etc., so they are a ble to comm unicate with referring physicians on a rudimentary level. That's the foundation or beginning level. On the intermediate level, they are given greater levels of anatomy and physiology, the impact of the venus and nervous system on the c olon, what is t he structure of that. How do the parasym pathetic and sym pathetic ne rves affect colon functioning, the stomach, et c? They get great er and greater l evels at eac h level. The adva nced level is the highest level an d you must be at th is lev el to become an instructor. That requ ires fo ur hour of instruction in fron t of individuals. One must be done at a convention in front of th e edu cation co mmittee to ensure the indi vidual can speak appropriately and t hat requi rement right now is t hey must teach on anatom y and physiology s o we know t hey are a ble to communicate to another therapist on anat omy and physiology. Josh Shipe: I'm still co nfused as far as, do es lev el one qualify yo u to go out and practice and is there more or less things as you advance l evels that you can do? Answer (Dick Hoenninger): Level one does qualify them to practice. That's the le vel that was duplicated from what t hey used in Fl orida so we figure d if that was ok for 30 years i n Florida with no problems, it must be a good standa rd. We just wanted to establish great er levels. As I-ACT has been growing, we've want ed to continue t o increm ent the bar of professionalism up. So, I mentioned that we're going to start requiring college anatomy and physiology before they ev en co me into their training so we can focus on the digestive tract instead of teach ing all th e anatomy and physiology. It's patterned after Florida which has worked very well for 30 years with no problems. We thi nk it's a n acce ptable le vel for certif ication to start practicing. The reality is that without legislation, people can open up their doors and have absolutely no training at all. Answer (Dr. Kolbo): The differen tiatio n between lev el one and level two, foundation level an d intermediate lev el. In add ition to the advancement of t he degree of an atomy and physiology and neurology, they also h ave a greater number of colonics they have to do in that period of time and t here's also a time period between how soon they can get to level two from foundation, so they're gaining more clin ical ex perience during t hat tim e. Answer (Rebecca Ha rder): They're not offering a ny different level of service. They just have greater knowledge and expe rience . Answer (Dr. Kornberg): And as a physician, I look for that. My lev el of confidence goes up as I find t hat the col on hydrotherapist has the different levels of certification. In other words, if I find a new hydrotherapist that is just beginning, I'll do a lot of hands on myself to make sure. As I've found, the more ad vanc ed are actually telling m e things I d idn't learn in medical scho ol. As a practitio ner, it reliev es me of a lot of worry with the increased certification and training. So when I send a patient, I know this person has had this many under her belt. Just like a surgeon, do you want to be the first patient? They're s till certified , but would you rather have the surgeon with a fellowship and 1,000 cases ? Both have cert ification and both are leg al to do surg ery but it's ju st a lev el of confide nce a referring s urgeon has between a first day su rgeon and one that has been in practice 25 years . Margaret Gilbert: You mentioned a number of medications t hat might create preca utions. How are those medicatio ns iden tified on your list up dated? Answer (Dr. Kolbo): That's a go od question. They are c onstantly being updated. This is something we've put into gear the last few years, as we get more knowledge a nd get more medical doct ors working with this and in our associatio n. Doctors coming to us to g et train ing on how to do colon hydrotherapy and the ins an d outs of it. We've asked them to start co mpiling a list o f medicatio ns that our therapists should be aware of and maybe refer back to the primary car e provider or make sure the primary provider is aware of the medications and how t hey m ay be affecte d by col on hydrothera py. As you know, we have m edical doc tors a nd other doctors com ing to us for trai ning because they do n't know what is really h appening during these sessions. If our therapi sts see a medication and have been referred, they may want to check back to that referring doctor. More and more as we upgrade ourselves the list o f contraindicated m edications as well as ones we want to ta ke precautions with, we 'll update as we get differe nt input from our medical p ractitio ners. Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-10 Answer (Dick Hoenninger): That inf ormation is handed out at our co nventions an d reg ional meetin gs, as well as i n our quarterly newsletter. An example is when we learn ed about the pro blem with water intoxication , we immediately put it in the newsletter and warned our the rapists that if t hey exceed the manufactur ers' guidelines on the duratio n of the sessi on, they run the risk of water in toxication. We use that ve hicle as well as the conventions . Answer (Dr. Kornberg): It's also s ome of th e modern medications t hat actually create the problem which a patient goes to a colon hydrotherapist for because it's a G I side effect of the medication. So having the colon hydrotherapist know this might be a problem, rather than just going on doing colon hydrotherapies forever, it could be a fee dback to the physician . If you realize drug X has a slowing effect o n the bowel, and this patient has reported increasing constip ation, it is really h elpful as t he list of medications that affect t he intestinal tract is created. Josh Shipe: How m any diffe rent a re there a vailabl e? Are they spread out across the country? Answer (Dick Hoenninger): I believe we've go t appr oximately 3 0 scho ols and over 200 instructors and an instructor can train just lik e a school can. The differe nce is that an i nstructor can train one or two individuals, whereas a school can train 10 or 15, de pending on how m any pieces of equipm ent they have to train on. T here a re six instructors in Washington, I believe. We are getting quite a large instructor core out there to be able to help train other people as we m ove forward. Since we want to get to the public co mment period, we're cu tting off the panel question s now, bu t I will g ive them a chance to submit q uestions in writing for us to forwar d to the app lican ts. Any written follo w questions and respon ses will b e made availab le to the public. PUBLIC COM MENT Dirk Yow : See testim ony attached at th e end of the heari ng summary. Ann Clifton: I'm with Mercury Awa reness Team of Wash ington and Health Free dom Washi ngton. I'm also going to read testim Mother's Against Mercu ry Amal gam. See t estimony attached at the end of the heari ng summary. Also , see ad ditional in formation from Ms. C lifton attache d at the end of t he hearing s ummary. Mike Nat h: Is there some study that shows that colon hydrotherapy works with mercury detoxification? Answer (An n Clifto n): I'm sure there are a lot of stud ies that show it does. It sure worked for m e. I lost 56 pounds of toxic fat. I was using both oral d etox wit h colon hydrotherapy and of course I had all th e mercury fillin gs taken from my mouth a second time beca use the dentist had left the mercury in. My pers onal results were so astounding because it cleared m y thyroid, m y liver. The mercury was every where. I had the vacci ne m ercury in m y hypothalam us. I'm sure there are a l ot of st udies th at I can 't quote at t his point, but I will lo ok them up for you . Sandra Duffy: I'm boar d president of Consumers fo r Dent al Choice, which is a national non-profit in Washington D.C. I'm a municipal lawyer in Oreg on and have done litig ation for 29 years an d I'v e done administrati ve law fo r 23 years. I'm looking directly at th e outline of factors to be looked at under 18.120.030. The keyston e of the process is defining the problem and w hy regulation is nece ssary and this answer by I-ACT is that the problem is that there is no regulation. That is not what 18.120.030 is aim ed at. That criteria requires proof of harm to the public if regulation is not imposed. There is no substantial ev idence that has been presen ted either in th is applicatio n or through I-ACT 's prese ntation today of evidence from which one could conclude that harm exists because of c olon hydrotherapy being practiced in this state and that the public could only be protected through regulation. One of the things that Dirk Yow d idn't men tion and is part of the materials he provi ded is that his malp ractice in surance is $300 per year. I guess Dr. Kornberg isn't here, but I would estimate th at his is prob ably in the ten s of thousands of dollars. The insu rance co mpanies are tellin g us that there is much risk with M.D.s, t heir surgeries, delivering babi es, and the different things they do. But they've d ecided, and obviously th ey've got statistics to come up with that $300 figure, th at there is literally no risk of claims b ased on the practice of colon hydrotherapy. In fact, I would submit that the $300 is prob ably the cost of them doing the paperwork each year t o issue the policy. Go ing on to the seco nd criteria, wh ich is the effo rts m ade to address the pro blem. First of all, th ere is no problem, so regulation can't be a Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-11 solution for someth ing that isn 't a prob lem. The intent of 18.120 is to allow th ese kinds of unlicen sed practitio ners to practice un til there is proof of harm and then only with proof of harm to trigger a sunrise rev iew lik e we're having here tod ay. Then the evidence wo uld come forward of what th e harm is an d if t he proposed regulation is the way to protect citizens from harm . The real pr oblem here is th at there is a co nflict between 18.120 which say s we wa nt unlicensed practitio ners to be able to practice and 18.71, which defines the practice of med icine so broadly that it is interpreted b y the Department of Health to inclu de colon hydrotherapy. The real so lution is the bill su bmitted by Health Freed om last year, which was Se nate Bill 1 714, which exempts colon hydrotherapists fro m the defin ition of the practice of medicine. That is th e sim ple solution. As far as t he third criteria un der 18.120.030, as to what alternatives were considered. Here I-ACT states that th e consideratio ns were b etwee n certificatio n and licen sure and they decided certificatio n was t he better way to go. I submit that this is p robably a Trojan horse and the reason I say th is is th at under the propo sed legislation , DOH is d elegated all the auth ority b y the legislatu re to develop all th e rules, ev en though I-ACT included a cop y of its own rules and operating procedures, DO H is no t bound by them at all under the leg islatio n. DOH is au thorized to go forward and make rul es to certify colon hydrotherapists. In the case of Dirk Yow and t he Departm ent of Health that is in King County Su perior C ourt, the Dep artment of Health has sub mitted in a brief th at is has been Department of Healt h's con sisten t position that co lon hydrotherapy is th e practice of medicine and that with that position, I submit very lik ely th at if th ey get the abilit y to do regulatio ns on this, th ey will req uire direct su pervision of li censed physician s of colon hydrotherapists. The next criteria is nu mber four, the benefit to the public if regu lation is granted. Th e respo nse by I-ACT is to ensure the safety of t he public but there has been no proof of harm to the public. You don't need regulation to protect you from harm that doesn't exist. Also si mple certificati on can b ecome quite co mplicated de pending on how much you want to encourage or discourage a practice. Criteria fiv e, the extent to which regulation co uld harm the public and I-ACT has stated it sees no foresee able situations or conditions t hat could res ult in ha rm. I submit that there are a number of ways the public coul d be ha rmed. One is lack of acce ss to c olon hydrotherapists of their c hoice. Dirk Yow is a good e xample of that. Increased costs is ano ther. Any time yo u have regulation, you will h ave increased costs. Nowad ays tho se costs are going to be put on those professionals. I belong to the Oregon State Bar. I pay $500 per year so I can be regulated, and so does Dr. Kornberg, and the naturopaths and chiropractors as well. T here is no questio n that those are going to be increase d costs. As expenses, those a re going to have to be calculated into what you need at the bottom line and they will b e passed on to their clien ts. Ano ther potential p roblem is th at if th is syste m ends up being under the direct sup ervision of physician s, they can veto patients own desires fo r colon hydrotherapy. It will n o longer be the patien t's cho ice. It will b e the physician's choice. I have other materials t o submit as well. As fo r number si x, the maintenance of standards, again I-ACT has submitted its own standard operating procedures as the model. I'v e got two comments on that. One is that the Departm ent of He alth does have the carte bla nche unde r the legislatio n. Two, I r ecently had the opportunity to review th e stan dard operating procedures and found them to be internally inc onsistent. In one place, it sai d that eve ryone t hat bel ongs to I-ACT SHALL only use FDA approve d equipment, but in three other places, it i ndicated that they RECOMMENDED FDA equipm ent and if you we ren't using it, you sho uld try t o come in to compliance. It was very confusing whether it was a mandate or not. Also, there is no scop e of practice at all. Th ere is no specifi c proh ibition again st additives, yet they have interpreted it to say th ey ar e not allo wed. The procedures fo r discipline or griev ances allows the tak ing of potential p roperty ri ght of a profession without the required due process. Number seven is the description of the group proposed fo r regulation and their ass ociations. I-ACT has 67 m embers in Washington State. There are a pproximately 200 colon hydrotherapists in Washington State, so I-ACT represe nts less than one-third of them. The other colon hydrot herapists could see this as an attem pt to take away independent practices an d they've had no input in to this process other than what they're being given today . I consider myself a stakeh older and would like to be given the notice you are giving stakeholders. Karen Jensen: Added a co mmen t that an yone wh o wasn't prev iously on the interested part ies list b ut signed in today will b e added. Rebecc a Waggoner: I'm readi ng something from a client of Dirk Yow's and who was a lso a cl ient of mine. Ka ren O'Connoly. Acco rding to the twen ty plus docto rs I've been exam ined by over twe nty-five years, I was se nt home to die. I told my family goodbye, m ade preparatio ns and resigned myself to the fact th at my mysterio us illnesses t hat had kept me bedridden for a number of years had won. I had no more fight left in me. I had not experienced the quality of life for over a decade. Exha usted with no hope, I accepte d the prognos is of medical doctors. Time was running out. A frien d gently su ggested that if I was willing to try just on e more health option that she would take me to see th is gentleman, Dirk Yow who work ed with water th erapy. A this po int I felt t hat I h ad nothing to lose Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-12 and with a desire to som eday see m y grandc hildre n, I c onsented. My fi rst session took place fi ve years ago. I wa s so weak that I need h elp to get on the tab le. I was so sick that I di dn't re member much about it. Dirk suggested I see a m edical doct or and request that blood tests be done to determine if I had toxins in my system. What an understatement. The blood tests cam e back and resulted in a mercury reading so high it was off the charts. Also there were high levels of lead, arse nic, and other toxic substances. Now, I knew that the last 25 plus years, my deat h was being slowly po isoned to death literally. I was d ying a v ery slow and painful death. As I embarked on my new journey to health , Dirk was my coach eve ry step of the way. His ki ndne ss, enc ouragement, and e xpertise motivated me to keep going. What I had see n come out of my small body seem ed like scie nce ficti on. If I h adn't seen it with my own eyes, I don't think I would have believed i t. Today, I have passe d over 1,500 adhesions, some six feet long. Othe r range from a few i nches to three to four feet. I have seen the grey of the mercury, the gra vel and destruction of toxins flushed out in colon hydrothera py sessions. Duri ng this tim e, amazing tra nsitions have take n place in m y health. My hair now grows healthy and glowing. It had fallen out. My skin is clear. My legs ca n support my body and feel st rong. I no longer need a wheelch air. The tumors and cysts th at had spread throughout my system are gone. I can open doors with the strength in my arms and c an digest and absorb my food which I hadn't done for years. My c olon is no longe r collapse d and is healing a nd in place. My m ind is clear a nd I ca n enjoy reading once again. The list of rediscovering life is endless. I feel that I have come out of a time capsul e from being suspended over a quarter of a century ago and now have been released into life agai n. I have no more pai n and my ener gy level continues to improve. How can a person possibly do justice u sing only words when their life has been saved by colon hydrotherapy and Dirk Yow. I only hope with my renewe d health and energy I can do things with my life to improve the wo rld we liv e in and the people in it. Dirk, although alw ays in the face of adversity, h as been a shining exam ple of ca ring for humanity and a dministering his extraordinary hydrotherapy techniques that give people another chance to have improved heal th. God bless y ou Dirk. Note: freedom of choice for citizens t o choose their health care program must be protected. The state of Washington is taking aggressive m easure s to take alternative healing options away from us. T he state is pursuing e very means availabl e to put succes sful do ctors, de ntists, massag e therapists, co lon therapists, etc. out of business just as quickly as they can. We need to supp ort th e people who have helped us to get well with altern ative options, take a stand to let the state kno w we want our right to choose . I'm Rebecca Waggone r and I'm a colon hydrot herapist a nd I'm kind of a ngry s o I'll m ake this real quick. I'm more and m ore angry because I'm a pe rson who received a letter fr om the healt h depa rtment. I'm being attacked by t he health department. I've cal led and asked them quest ions and they have totally co ntradicted what t hey wrote m e. I'm going to read a small para graph. I was sent a letter that says the Washington State Department of Health is authorized under RC W 18 .130.190 to investigate co mplaints concerning t he allege d practice of healthca re by unlicensed persons. The department has rec eived information that you are advertising performed col on hydrotherapy. It is th e department's po sition that you are engaging in such conduct as alleg ed. You must have a license t o practice un der Chapter 18.71 or 18.36A RCW, or under a health care discipline that is within the scop e of practice. According to our records, you a re not licensed to practice as a me dical doctor i n the state of Washington. Based on the a bove, an invest igation has bee n initiated i nto the com plaint that wa s recei ved a gainst y ou. There has been no complaint against me. I called and they said th ey saw a flyer. The h ealth department has been tellin g me that the followi ng actions are to take place . To issue a cea se and desist ord er to m e, to impose a civ il fine in the amount of $1,000 per day for each day that I enga ge in unlic ensed practice, and to see k an injunction in S uperior Court with regard to unlicen sed practice. They sen t a lis t of things like I'm an unlicen sed doctor pract icing and I'm really an gry abo ut this. I'd lik e to ch ange this and I need help. Beth Christ: I can' t speak of any RC W numbers or anything. I'm a wife, mother, grandm other, the Presid ent of BC Logo products and apparel, which means nothing to you. I am a pat ient of doctors, a client of Dirk Yow and many other alternative heal th care providers. I've spent 30 years of my life not being well and not knowing why. I was referred to this doctor, that doct or, this psychologist, that psychologist. I went to so much therapy, I could probably be one of tho se therapists. Finally, in February of '98, and I'm sorry to g et a littl e uncomfortable here. I started having horrendous periods and throughout my normal life I ha d always had very slight periods. All of a sudde n three weeks out of the month, I was bleeding ext remel y heavi ly and was i n pain and in bed. My doctor who has been my doct or for 20 years, Dr. Joan Halley who I think the world of, referred me to a gynecologist who I had known v ery well. He said simple fix , we will d o an endometrial o blasion . It destroys the lining of the uterus and everyth ing else is in tact. He said that the bad news is when you wake up, you will b e in the wo rst pain of yo ur life. The good news is th at I will med icate you for th at. It is just for a day and you go home and rest fo r the week end and Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-13 Monday you go back to running you r business. We did the oblasion and for six solid m onths I was in screaming pain in bed. It took me two years t o recover. Finally, what Joan Halley had put on one of my pink slips years before, Fibromyalgia, w as true. Fi nally I was diagnosed with Fibro myalgia, Chr onic Fati gue Syndr ome, Irritable Bowel Synd rome, etc. Th at was i n February of '98. Luckily, n one of my customers k new I was sittin g in my pajam as talking to them. Luc kily I didn't have to give up my b usiness. I barely hu ng on to it. After 20 years of seein g Dr. Halley, still in so much pain and the g ynecologist said he could not help me. I had told him right before the surgery I very well could have Fibromyalgia. But I'm doing everything I've learned to take care of this. He said go see t he specialist. I h ad to wait six months to see h im. He's on e of the best specialists in this state, which I shoul d know because I've seen most of the specialists in thi s state. I've joined Fibrom algia support groups a nd have been through the University of Washington Pain Center, the very first twelve wee ks of Fibromyalgia study. I've been to the Pain Clin ic in Taco ma now know n as Northwest Cen ter for Integrated Med icine. I've been to Medege nics, a three-m onth, three times FM study, performed by Dr. Bob Leem an. A ndrew Holman in Renton on Fibromyalgia. Ev eryone I kno w that was half as sick as I was filed for disability, g ot an atto rney and got it. I've spoken to three atto rneys. I've filled out for disability th ree years in a row and all th ree years, I've ripped up those papers. Once I file fo r disability, as far as I'm concerned, I'm disabled. I don't choo se to be disabled. I choose to be as w ell as I can be. I choose to be a health mother, wife, grandmother, and President of BC Logo which means nothing to you, but a lot t o me. I have large accounts like KIRO Tele vision, like Washington State Ba nkers Asso ciatio n. I choose to work. I choose to be a v ital part of this world . I pay tax es from my co rporation. Fi nally, after seei ng a renowned psychologist for many years, he knew he couldn't help me any further a nd he knew I want ed to be well. He had worked with someone who was quite unique and he had sent three patients to her. He said he didn't know if she would see me because t he three patients he'd s ent were term inal and he didn't know if I was t erminal. I waited six months to see her and counted the days. Whe n I got in to see her, I knew I was i n the right place. We're not talking about a doct or. We're not talking a ny num bers here. We're just talking a bout someone I trusted who could help me. She saw me once a nd said that I needed to see Dirk Yow at least five times before she could see me agai n. Unknown to me, our energy flow in all human bei ngs is all clear an d is moving and flowing. Mine was dark, dark brown, almost black, barel y, barel y moving. I had had constipation m ost of my life. I had so m any ulcers i n my stomach that the scar tissu e was unbelievable. I started seeing Dirk Yow. I'm a little girl born in Gard en City, Kansas and believe, this is not the kind of thing I was raised with. I did not take to this easily but the people that recommended t his were people I had known a long time and I trusted. Whe n you're to the point you're in so much pain you want to die, and I'm a really u p person, you will do just abo ut anything to gain your life back . I started seei ng Dirk Yow and when they mentioned adhesions, you wouldn't believe the rocks, grey. I too had all the mercury removed from my mouth. The adhesions, four feet long, and I lost 20 pounds. I walked out of the re feeling like I'd be en given back l ife, every si ngle tim e. Currently because of my personal sit uation with my busi ness, and I have three homes, I can 't go to Portland. I don't have the time or m oney to go there. I've gained 20 pounds and don't feel well. I sp end a lot of time back in the restro om and that is no way to live a life. I need m y choice of my care providers. Dr. Joan E. Halley in Gig Harbor, Washington has been my doct or for 20 years. Whe n I told her what I wan ted to do , she told me she didn't learn about this in medical schoo l, but that she had a frien d who did it and had success. We've been working together. After com ing home from one of these visits, my friend and my husband were waiting fo r me at th e dinner table and th ey ask ed me when I w as goin g to stop throwing away money seein g quacks. At th at time, I told them that I would not mention these altern ative h ealth care providers to them for one year an d neither will th ey. B ut I told them that in one year, i f I'm not better, I will ad mit I mad e a mistake. In one year, if I'm better, you're going to get off my back. In that year, I progressed s o much that my husband is eight years older than me and was a jock his entire life, and I could do circles around him. He was happy for me but he was never going to do anything like this. He now does it. My best friend can't believe how well she becam e. My daughter as well. I feel strongly that I worked so hard to find this that I have the right to do what is going to help my daug hter be well. Karen Jensen: I appreciate you r comments, but could you please let u s know your position on the advocates p etition for regulation since that's the focus today . I have n't had time to read all this, but my posi tion is that I should have the right to choose and I know what kind of job Dirk Yow does, so why would we put people like him out of business. I hadn't even gotten to the part about that I had Stage Two Cancer. I was sent to the best oncologist at U.W. She gave me three m onths and wanted to start doing surgery immediately. I told her I was doing ozone colonics and I know you'll think I'm nuts but how long do I have . She gave m e three m onths and within three m onths, I cam e back to the top oncologist in Washington with Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-14 six interns that put m y private area on a sc reen as large as that for everyone to see and every single bit of what was called VIN 2, Moderate Sq amish Dysp lasia of th e Vu lva, not just a little sp ot here an d there bu t everywhere. After three m onths with Dirk, she looked ev erywh ere and there was not one spo t. That was five years ago and there is still nothing. The proof is in the pudding. All I'm saying is that he's done no harm and save d my life. Linda Kelley : I'm against licen sing. I'm licensed with the city a nd state a s far as all the licensed available to m e. But I'm not for regulation that is go ing to change the scope and ability we've h ad as co lon hydrotherapists. I'd like to let you off t he hook at DOH because I'm sure you have enough to do and adding another area which would be a huge a rea to regulate when it's not actua lly needed. As I look at the c riteria for regulation , it is only when unregulated practice can clea rly harm or endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public and the potential for harm is easily recog nizable and not remote or dependant on tenuous argument. There has not been harm done in Washington. There 's been a lot of good done. I've completed a m inimum, more than 2,000 hydrotherapy sessi on and there has b een no harm done . There have been no complaints. The peo ple I've wo rked with, anywhere from telling m e they feel better, have m otivation, etc., to people who say I've saved their lives. There are people writing up their testimonies to submit as w ell. The company whose equipment I use has not had any problems for 20 plus years. As a lot of thi ngs have already been stated, pe ople have always known i nside that they nee d to cleanse t heir body and cleansing the colon is part of that. They 've done it in all dif ferent way s. It's very non-invasive. It's a n orifice of the body, not medical, no t surgery. It's the sam e type of thing as clean ing your ears, brushing your teeth , cleansi ng your body. It's something we need to do to keep our health or sometimes regai n it. It's very safe, very gentle, very non -invasive. We'v e seen testim ony on that here as well. I have liability in surance and it's un der $200 per year. As was said be fore, the insurance c ompanies look at harm , and they look at cl aims. I'm sure s ome of you have particularly lower car i nsurance because you ha ven't had accide nts. That's they way they com e up with the amount t hey charge y ou. Doctors who ha ve highe r liability and claim s are tens of thous ands per yea r. They are regulated. We are not m edical. I ha ve a license with the City of Lacey. I do a se rvice a nd it's not a m edical procedure. Therefore, I don't understand why there would need to be any other type of licensi ng. I have a master licen se. I pay all th e tax es I need to pay and renew my licenses ev ery year. If th e only clien ts I had were clien ts referred by doc tors, I woul d most likel y be out of busine ss because i n the state of Washington, we have very fe w doctors like Dr. Kornberg. We have very few wh o I bel ieve understand colon hydrotherapy and so they don't suggest it to their clients, i n fact they sugges t they not do it because the re is a fea r due to lack of knowle dge. I would not want to nee d a pres cription fo r every client that came to m e because that would m ost likely not happen. All the things I've heard from I-ACT, I've had all the training they've suggested, been tested and certified. I've had all the things i n place they ta lk about and to my knowledge, all the other t herapists I know have done the m too. If I- ACT or som e group cam e in and said th ey need to regu late, it wou ld be redundant beca use it's alrea dy being done. If the real problem is that there are people doing colon hydrotherapy in Washington with no training, that would be the issue to address . I can provide the four page form I provide as king them about medications t hey are taking, contraindications, etc. If there is anyt hing out of place, I refer them to a do ctor. I've actually had m ore than one clien t that I've referred back t o their doctor to have something checked out more thorough ly before having colon hydrot herapy because I'm not a doctor or nurse. I always let every one know I'm doing a cleansing servi ce and that I'm not a medical p rofession al. I let my clie nts tell m e how it's h elped th em. Ho w can hyd rotherapists be made to desist what they're doing because they don't have a l icense with the state of Washi ngton when there is no such license ? Rather than working on that, I don't understand how they can be st opped from doing what they're doing. They 're not doing anything illegal and haven't cause d any harm. A fe w times I've worked with doctors, I always fill o ut a form to send back to them so we can work tog ether. If th e doctors wan ted to work with u s, that would be a different story. We need to have our freedom of ch oice in healthcare as well as other things. People are very upset about losing their freedom s. Bill Kelley : I wante d to speak separately as a client beca use that's all I can speak to. At 61 years, I'm healthier than ever an d I attrib ute it to co lonics. It's a good thing. I go to do ctors for what I th ink they're good at, which is surgery and drugs. I don't see much el se. I make m y deci sions when I go to my regul ar doctor. I'm an adult able to make my o wn decision s about my own bod y. I believe you can sense wh en you' re healthy an d wh en you're not. Conce rning the situation he re, I'm against it because I see I-ACT as a union. You have to follow the m oney to see if that's tru e or not. I don't believe there's an y need for th is and for people to control what I do. Tim Z immer: I'm one of the owners of the Tum my Tem ple. I support a lot of what people are saying here but not in the way you mig ht think. We've em ployed over 16 colon hydrotherapists in the last five year s. According to the Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-15 training they go through, they aren 't performin g certified h ydrotherapy on clien ts until they've had 125 sessio ns. We use FD A certified equipment. We ha ven't had one complaint, but 90 percent of our clients are ref erred. I'd say over 90 perce nt of those clients are c onstipated. We can't diag nose because we're not docto rs. We don't take insurance . We only work with people paying cash. Based on rectal speculum use fr om one of the largest rectal speculum manufact urers in the country, we are one of the busiest colon hydrotherapy practices in the country. I'm fully in support o f certification . You should work as a regu latory body to support this industry. When I look at the three points mentioned in the sunrise process. Unregulated practice can cl early harm or endanger the health, safety, or welfare of the public and th e potential for h arm is easily recogn izable an d not remote or dependent upon tenuous argument, I'd like to address that from a slightly different perspect ive than I think you've been looking at it so fa r. I believe it's important t hat the equipm ent used is FDA regul ated. I know becau se we've used e quipm ent that was not FDA regulated and it was out of our practice very quickly. It was i n the learni ng process as a business. I believe that the regulation estab lishes the safety m echanisms that I as a business own er with trained, resp onsible, intellig ent, capable therapists still will minimize an d elimin ate th e potential for m anual erro r. When we l ook at pressu re, temperature, backfl ow, these are things we want to ensure the people coming to see us don't have to think about. They ca n rest assure d that when they c ome in, there are m echanisms to protect their safety. No harm has bee n done. Let it cont inue in that direction. Whe n I look at the \"no harm has bee n done...\", I think of Dirk Yow. No harm was done and yet as an unregulated pract ice, he is out of business. Not to be overly dram atic, but they are unsung heroes in this industry doing a job that n obody else wants to do. They're do ing with a major organ of elim ination that has a severe issu e acro ss the Un ited States. If you take this industry out, people are taken out of busi ness w ho support a major organ of elimination, in a way that an enem a at hom e can't do, that s urgical practice of taki ng out the actual organ cannot do, then you are actually harm ing the people of Washi ngton State. It would be like saying we should take out inoculations because they're not safe anymore. L et's take out a major tool that has been going on for 1,000s of years. If it didn't work, it wouldn't be used. The same goes f or massage. You have respect for the massage i ndustry. Let 's do the sam e for c olon hydrotherapy. Let's en sure that it m aintains a stron g position for Wash ingtonians and for the rest o f the United States. Fl orida has taken a fantastic po sition supp orting the indu stry and we should follow suit. As far as right to cho ose, I'm 100 percent behind everyone. We're seei ng people in my clinic beca use they're getting results. I can tell you that my wife and I don't sleep at night because we're thinking about how many people we've see n. We don't sleep because we're afraid we're going to be put out of business. We do this because we care ab out the people in our commu nity. We'v e thought about relocatin g to another state because what we've seen in Washingt on St ate doesn't bode well. I get c oncerned when I hear about a business getting put out of business without doing any harm to anyone. To me, that is no t justice. I believe in the Depa rtment of Health. I im plore you to crea te a certification program because we don't have standards right now. We don't have standa rds in this industry to give the com munity a sense of comfort, to give the business owners and therapists a sense of comfort that within a defined scope, we know what we are doing is legal. We pay taxes a nd provide tax es for people so they can take care of th emselves and stay in Wash ington, support their commu nities in being health y. As far as t he seco nd part abou t the public need ing and expectin g to ben efit fro m assurance of in itial and con tinuing ab ility, I can 't tell yo u how man y people I've spok en with over the phone ask ing what is th e certificatio n or licen sure. There is value to estab lishing a lev el of co mfort for th e people in Wash ington State th at they know t here are fundam entals bei ng addresse d in standardizing what is neces sary to ensure the safety and quality of serv ice being provided fo r them. I'v e seen people get colon hydrotherapy trainin g in a week end. I don't think that's reasonable. T here are people using equ ipment that is not FDA reg ulated. I don't th ink it's safe. With the best of intentions, with the most experi enced colon hydrotherapists, manual error can happen. The FDA in its job has estab lished criteria with its eq uipment that minimize s or elimin ates maj or issu es with potential man ual error, such as tem perature, press ure, bac kflow. The public ca nnot be e ffecti vely pr otected by other m in cost- bene ficial manner. They can't. I haven't seen other ways they can be better protected. Right now though no harm has been done, we recognize the potential for harm. I think about that for every clien t that co mes through my door, what ca n I do to elim inate the pote ntial h arm. I can tell yo u that manual error occurs so you need to use the equipment that can elim inate that. I can tell you t hat whe n I look at protected by other means, it means t wo things. One is that t hey are protected by standards they know and trust. Two is protecting their health. I think all three of the criteria apply. I want to continue to live and practice in Wash ington State, bu t I don 't feel co mfortable with it right now. We have invested every thing in our lives to take care of our community and i f I got a knock on the door by Department of Health without doing any harm to anybody and it ruined our lives financially, I would be deva stated. My family woul d be devastated. You all did a fabulous job in your presentation and I thank you and all the colon hydrotherapist who h ave put themselv es at risk to help people in their communities. Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page D-16 Terry Kohl: I'm with the Wash ington Associatio n of Naturop athic Physicians. See test imony attach ed at th e end of the heari ng summ ary. Lori Liv ely: I'm not heal th dependent upon colon hydrotherapy but I do employ it and fe el very strongly about it. What I'd like t o leav e you all with is, as a l ong-time write r and I wo rk in the natural food in dustry, I've seen this pract ice devel op through the years. I'm all in favor of certification. I'm all in favor of registration. I'd have to draw the line at regu lation for all th e reason s that have alread y been mentioned. I stron gly believe in my righ t to self-re fer. I'm an a dult. I'm educate d and I'm very uncomforta ble with one agency or group, when clearly as statistics sh ow, only on e-third in our own state ar e members of I-ACT, that yo u shou ld be regulating all practitio ners, many of who m have excellen t train ing that may o r may not fall u nder you r guidelines. But it still is excellent traini ng. Carol Sivertz : I've been a colon therapist for almost seven years i n the state of Washington and have a clinic. I'm a member of I-ACT and have sort of been on both sides of the fence . It may have seem ed like a nice idea to not be regulated at some p oint, but when I spent time in Olym pia I was assured that we need to go there by more than one represe ntative. That's why I f eel lik e this is a good idea. It's good to see every one here and I hope we can c ome to a con clusion everyone can b e happy with. A few follow up points are: I-ACT an d the bill are no t asking for insuran ce. Abo ut 80 percent of the therapists are g etting some medical referrals. I th ink I fall a little b elow that bu t I also get medical referrals. Another point, when you have one I-ACT member, you may have four in the clinic working under them, so I 'm not sure the numbers rep resent everyone. I support t he applicants. I feel like this is a long time in coming. I think everyone has done a great job here of saying everything I wanted to say. We need to save our testimo ny for when we go to the leg islativ e hearing s on the hill. Susan L oForti: I am a heal er and ashaman from Olympia. I've had a very dysfunctional life with potentially going crazy w ith doub le incest from both parents. At a cer tain point, I realized I couldn't be in any situ ation where I would be vulnerabl e with any medical professional or anybody who was going to dominate me or the same kind of thing I'd bee n through before. In 1978 I deci ded I di dn't wa nt anythi ng to do with any pharm aceutical drugs because I di dn't want t he side-effects, so I di vorce d myself from that and s tarted re ading everythi ng I c ould a bout herbs and American Indian and felt God's love going through the plant force an d all that. I have been totally independent from every body except chiropractors a nd colon hygienists since th at tim e. In 198 3, I was sallo w and went to somebody and in the monitor where the wat er was coming through, what I saw was a green ball the size of a cherry to mato which supposedly was a co llectio n of toxic substa nces which had collected ever since my childhood. Thank God that came out and then everything was vital and wo nderful. What I do is prayer and fasting . I'm a religious nut, not a C hristian scien tist. I just go to the roots of it. Budd ha, Christ, m editation, whatever I can do so I can be vital. And I care a bout everyone. I care so thoroughly about everyone having the highest level of vibrancy and the ability to find themselves in life and do what they have to do with the God -given intellig ence to find out their uniqueness instead of just pushing papers and when it's time to die you never knew who you really were. That's who I am and I didn't know I was going to say all this bu t this is why I'm so fervent and I'm against regulation beca use I believe i n healers . There have been people who have helped me so deeply in my life where nobody else could have. You can't regulate a heal er. I want every one here to be totally happy and find themselves and never have to commit su icide because they're su ffering so much ph ysically. Dr. Kolb o: I just wan t to make a clarificatio n. I-ACT is no t here to regulate the state. We're here to assist the Depa rtment of Heal th if they want our help to establish regulations. Also, referring to naturopathic doctors and assistin g, the clarificatio n is that we assist our clien ts in hydrotherapy sessions and may com municate bac k to the doctor, but we are n ot assistin g the doctors. As far as the education , there is no medical in stitution, ch iropractic, naturopathic, or m edical that teaches c olon hydrothera py. MEETING CLOSED Kare n Jensen closed the public hearing and reminded t he audience t hat there is now an additional 10-day com ment period to follow up on anything additional an yone wants to add to th e record. She reminded the group that the department will th en begin draftin g the report, which will be sh ared with th e interested parties.

I had been exposed to herbicides on a go lf cou rse and the result was ex teme swellin g of organs and edema with joint pain. I tried traditional medicine but only go t worse. I finally found Dirk Yow. He administered c olon therapy over a two month period and I fully recovered. I want to continue t o receive these treat ments from him but because you ha ve stopped him from practicing this m odality that literally sav ed my life, I now am at risk of diseases that can not be treated effectiv ely an y other way.

Brackin, R oxie I believe licensing of colon therapi sts is important, and could br dont through the board of massage t herapy.

See also chapter 480.033(6)480.041 (4)(b)480.044 (1) (i)(j) Thank you for RY VIG EANT I am writin g this letter in support of having colon hydrotherapy be availab le through certified practition ers, and not require licen sure. As a consumer, I have the right to choose who and how I want colon hydrotherapy to be avai lable. For many years now, I have both self-adm inistered e nemas, and have seen colon hydrotherapists. This has benefited my comfort and my h ealth in multiple ways, inclu ding increasin g my energy. I sho uld not be req uired to have a prescri ption, nor to see a m edical doctor in a clini c or hospital in orde r to recei ve this health ca re. The professionalism and cl eanliness of the colon hydrotherapists that I have see n rivals that of any doctor's office where I've had gynecological and other personal exams. Ther e is no legitimate reaso n to restrict th is practice to licensed i ndividuals. Please conside r my request t o certify co lon hydrothera py as a service allowable in the state of Washington. Thank you. Ruth M. Cooper I have just been informed that the DOH in WA State is considering banning trained colon hydrotherapists from practicing in this state. I ask th at you do not ban them from their profession , but instead research the practice and form a licensur e program for them so that the y would be license d healthcare profess onals . What do ot her states do about this? This is a v ery leg itimate form of health care with m any benefits. I have personally benefitted from this form of therapy in the past. I p lan on using it in the n ear future as well. The places have always been clean, ste rile, wi th disposa ble piec es of e quipment whe re pertine nt. The practitione rs were all trained a nd very professional and informative. This therapy helps many digestive and elimination problems. It is safe, effective, an d has been used for centuries in many cultures. I wan t and should be able to decide for myself if I wan t this form of therapy. The western medical m odel is very differen t and does no t commonly utilize this. It should be kept separat e from doctors and hospitals and insu rance co mpanies in order to continue to make it affordable, an d to also keep this work with the train ed specialists who devote their en tire time and effort in this. Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page E-1 I am a License d Acupuncturist in Washington. I have had many patients who have chosen hydrotherapy on their own and have told me only of positive resu lts and experiences. Please do what is righ t and loo k into this issu e and adju st what needs fixing. Please do not act im pulsively and limit access to t he long-standing practice of c olon hydrot herapy. Sincerely, Nancy Kreide r, L.Ac. Please cert ify colon hydrotherapy and establish it as a recognized and legitimate health care profes sion i n the state of Wash ington. I liv e in WA and would like to con tinue to be able to choo se this therapy as an option for my h ealth . I have greatly bene fited from colon hydrotherapy for over 30 years now and I consider it a ve ry important part of my stayin g health y. I wou ld not be do ing this if I had to go to a doctor or a hospital to get th is do ne. I have used both the closed and the open systems, and neve r had a problem or indiscret ion from any of my therapists. Again, I hope you will certify colon hydrotherapy as a recognized and legitimate health care option, with our righ t to choose it. Th ank you . Ann Labe I heard a bout the recent action of the DOH in WA re garding c olon hydrot herapy. Please conside r licensing col on hydrotherapists as an additional practitio ner in Wash ington. I have taken couses wh ile in naturop athic med ical school llege of Natu ral Med icine in Portlan d, OR) on colon hydrotherapy and find its application quite beneficial. While th ere is no locatio n in our office to offer the service we do refer patient s out to others for the procedure. Agai n, Please consider certifying colon hydr otherapists in the State of Washington. In Health, Johan Keller, LAc, MSOM, Oregon licen sed Naturop athic Physician, Wash ington licensed Acupuncturist, Medical Director - Har mony Event Medicine (5 01 c 3) org I am writin g to request that Wash ington State estab lish Colon Hydrotherapy as a recog nized and leg itimate h ealth care profes sion in the state of Washington. Since 20 03 I have un dergone num erous colon hydrotherapy sessi ons in an effort to detox myself. The be nefits have been enourmous c onsisting of improve d gastorintestinal functioning and an increased overall sense of well-being. The se ssions were performed in an immaculate setting at the hands of a consum mate professional. The setting wa s infinitely cleaner an d less ch emicall y toxic than an y hospital or doctor's office I've ever been to . The practitio ner also provided more so und nutritio nal informatio n than any tradition Western m edicine practitio ner I'd ever met. I think it wo uld be great if Wash ington State wanted to licen se this practice and mandate insuran ce co verage for it bu t I would not want to have it performed in a medical setting by an untrained physician's em ployee. Thank you for you consideratio n in this matter.

NHFA works to protect h ealth seek ers op tions in health care an d are sup portiv e of m aintaining the availability of all types of c olon hy dro therapists in t he public dom ain. We support consum er access bi lls that protect access t o all unlicense d practitione rs, and support disclosure require ments by practitioners of thei r education and background and modality. We also support the ability o f state gov ernmen t to prohibit practice on an individual case basi s if the government has s hown that they have presented an imminent and significant risk of significant harm to a clien t. We h ave been in strumental in the passing of safe h arbor exemption bills for unlicensed practitio ners in a number of states (Minn esota, Califo rnia, Rhode Islan d, Lou isiana etc.) as well as i ntrodu ction of m any state b ills in this area. If you are open to receiving our c ontact inform ation I woul d like to let you know that we see oursel ves as a stakeholder in your hearing agenda. We would not supp ort mandatory government credentialing of Colon Hydro Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page E-2 therapists.

If you wou ld be op en to formal co mments from our organizatio n please let u s know. Thank you so much for your consideration. Very Best Regard s, Dian e Miller JD I-ACT is a ch artered asso ciatio n in I oppose regulating Co lon Hy drotherapy with I-Act as th e agent sim ply because they have no connect ion with any school of higher learning, colle ge or unive rsity. T he CE Us are worthless because they a re not backed up by an accre dited colle ge or university. Also they a re an association in Texas a nd by what au thority d o they have jurisdiction over the state of Wash ington? Also , I wan t to kn ow who validates th eir test? In addition I-ACT is no t licen sed by any health dept. I pay approximately $50. per year for my massage license an d they want $250. for just membership. This ju st do es not feel quite appropriate. Robin Sha ran I strongly support that colon hydrotherapists do NOT need to be regulated by WA DOH. Thank you , Mary Ann Newell I wonder who keep s statistics on the number of patient's these u nlicense d colonic irrigationists have perforated. I doubt that an y one does. When I saw a patient in my office wh o was in sep tic sho ck due to three co lonic perforations a fter recei ving irrigation t herapy, I was amazed to find out that there a re no standa rds of education for these people. He had gone to this pe rson while having acute abdom inal pa in and unde rwent the placement of water unde r press ure in his colon, enough to perforate him in two places. He required emergent surge ry and removal of most of his colon. Carole B uckner D.O. Gastroente rologist/Hepat ologist reg arding Wash ington State DOH Su nrise Hearing, held Augu st 28, 2007, regarding evaluating mandatory certification of colon hydro therapists. My n ame is Dian e Miller an d I am the Leg al and Public Po licy Director for Nation al Healt h Freed om Actio n (NHFA). I am also a n attorney licensed t o practice in the st ate of Minne sota. NHFA is a non-profit orga nization working to protect acces s to health ca re options for he alth seeke rs of all kinds. We provide resources a nd information to states gra ssroots organizations, information to state legislatures an d governments, and information an d prese ntations to individual lawmakers. Our work also provides leadership training, guidance regarding federal substance and device issues, and attend ance at in ternatio nal gath erings including UN Codex gat herings. Recently we le arned that the state of Washington, De partment of Health, has held a hearing on evaluati ng whethe r to mandate certifi catio n for co lon hydro th erapists. We co nsidered co ming to th is hearing but because of short notice were unable to atten d. We d o apologize fo r need ing to sen d written comments instead of prov iding pub lic testimony. As a national l eader, NHFA has desi gned health care bills to protect access to holistic pra ctitioners a nd natural products. One of the models we have drafted is a safe harbor exemption law for u nlicensed practition ers of all kinds. Th e purpose of this type of bill is to statutorily ex empt certain un licen sed health care practitio ners fro m Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page E-3 crimin al violations of practicin g a licen sed profession without a licen se as lo ng as th ey disclose cer tain backgr ound information an d that they are not licensed and as long as they avoi d the prohibited conduct set out in the exem ption language. This typ e of law is con stitutionally least rest rictiv e and fou nded on the presum ption that there are m any healin g arts t hat do not rise to the lev el of requ iring regulation und er the police po wer of a state, in cluding licen sure, certification, or re gistration. This presumption acknowle dges the i nherent right of health seekers to acce ss whom they wis h when they a re on a personal healing journey. It also ackn owledge s the state's interest in restrictin g professions that cause a n imminent risk of significant harm to the public. NHFA does not support mandatory state cert ification of colon hydro therapists. We un derstand that co lon hydrotherapy is an age old healing art, existing in many cultures a round the world, and we understand that it does not pose an imminent risk of significant harm to the public requiring mandatory regulation. We believe that a safe harbor exemption bill addresses an y con cerns a state gov ernment might have regarding the practice of this profession . For tho se reaso ns we ask you to consider this less restrictiv e form of regu lation and adop t a safe harbor freed om of access ex emption law. This would allow the prac titioners to practice as th ey always h ave in your state, as lon g as th ey practice with in the safe h arbor parameters th at the state of Washington se ts up. It avoids the m andate that they need to obtain permission from the government before doing their healing acts, and would also provide the consumer with i mportant background informatio n abou t the practitio ner providing those serv ices. Thus far, six states h ave safe harbor exemption laws for unlicensed practitio ners, ex empting them out of crimin al violations for practicin g medicine withou t a licen se as long as they rem ain in the parameters of the exemption language . They are M innesota, Rhode Island, California, Louisiana, Idaho, an d Ok lahoma. An d 20 more states including the state of Was hington (Sessi on 2007 SB6034 which we were in support of) have recently introduced such legislation. In addition, it is my unde rstanding that the state of Wash ington is unique in that it has very clear law th at sup ports un licen sed practitio ners practicin g their trad legislat ure believes that all individuals shoul d be permitted to ente r into a health professi on unless there is an overwh elming need for th e state to protect the interests o f the public by restrictin g entry in to the profession. Where su ch a need is identified , the reg ulation adopted by the state shou ld be set a t the least restrictive leve l consisten t with the pub lic in terest to be protected ...\" WA Stat 18.120.010. We hope t hat these c omments have been hel pful. We are aware of m any consum ers obtaining colon hydrotherapy services with great be nefit a nd apprecia tion. We hope that you protect th is long time healin g art b y regulating it in the least rest rictiv e means possible including on ly disclosures and prohibitions that are necessary for public safety. Colon hydrotherap y is practiced freely arou nd the world and NHFA wou ld like to maintain it in the public do main. My Very Best Regards, Dian e Miller JD Director of Law and Public Policy Since t he NIH has not studies Colon hydrotherapy performed by inexperienced heal th professi onals it behooves me to allow a person with th e lowest ed ucation on the health care to tem pole to be permitted to such forcefu l power of water being thrust up the colon without a physician 's prescrip tion. In add ition, is t his not part of the genital area that keeps getting massage therapists in trouble? After twen ty years of experience in th is field, I am opposed to allo wing any person with su ch a limited education to perform such a risky procedure on the public without a physician's prescri ption. What if there is the beginning of colon cancer? Will the force of water pro gress th e disease? Have you discussed this with a panel of physician s? What is th e research to prove the benefit to the public? I would be curious to have the panel hear the answ ers to these questions before proceeding. Thank you , Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page E-4 Kare n Zaharatos, ACR, Direc tor Massage online Profe ssor I am writing to provide my com ments on t he proposal that is curren tly under Sunrise Review c onsiderati on that seeks t o credential colon hydrotherapists in Washington. While I do not believe that there is a need to credential colon hydrotherapists, I hope that the Sunrise Review process will con sider whether or not colon hydrotherapy procedures sho uld continue to be classified as the practice of medicine an d make any necessary recommendations to the Legislature. The services provided by these practitio ners support th e work of several typ es of cred entialed health care prov ility o f these serv ices th e ability to com prehensively treat certain patients is diminished. Restrictions on the practice of colon hydrotherapy also limit patient choice. In many cases, individuals are fo rced to seek these serv ices i n other states where the practice is p ermitted. It is m y hope th at the Sunrise Rev iew process will help to estab lish an exception from the practice of m edicine that will pro tect p atients while als o allowing them choice in health care decision making. Thank you for the opp ortun ity to contribute these co mments to this discussion. Sincerely, REP. RIC HAR D CURTIS House Health Care and Well ness Committe e Assistant Ranking M inority Member I am writing to you to express my pers onal conce rn that I may loose my right to choose an alternative health care professional such as a Certified Colon Hydrotherapist, or a Certified Chiropractor.

Thank you Steven Kellas I am writing to say that I have used colon hydrotherapy and feel that this treatm ent is very beneficial. I want it to continue to be avai lable. Sincerely, Steve Be nnett Please, please certify colon hydrotherapy as a legal procedure. It is crucial that this not be taken away from peopl e who are benefitting from it. It is a cleansi ng. It has nothing to do with surgery or prescribing drugs or doing the things MD s do. Thank you for your consideration, Alice Co tton My letter was read at the su nrise meeting held on Wednesday A ugust 29th, 200 7 I am Karen Connolly and a citizen w ho has discovered that the process of colonic irrigation has not only benefited my over-all he alth, but literally save d my life. I have receive d sessi ons se veral times a wee k for well over 6 yea rs. We do not need this modality to be registered or licen sed. As m ature adu lts, surely, citizen s do not need the State nor any government, deci ding for us what we can a nd cannot choose to help our body heal itself. Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page E-5 The R ussian population here cannot unde rstand and a re dismayed that the very reasons they left Russia a re happening here in Washington State. The Department of Health is becoming the \"police\" and are attempting to regulate areas that do not need licensi ng or regulating. Creativity and a nd progress are slowed and usually preve nted by too much regulation and control. Who, of this panel to recommend what should be done,have ever had a colonic? Especially from the world reknown expe rt, Mr. Dirk Yow. Who, in the Department of Heal th, can ove rsee o r even begin to regulate someone wh o has 26 years i n the business, is recognized in Japan , Germ any, Cu ba, Malta, Great B ritain and other coun tries as th e most respect ed and knowledable aut hority on ozone colonics in the world, and our tiny state has decided he should be reg ulated with other colon hygenists? This is ab surbed. Stay ou t, stay away. Eileen Codys bill is based on nothing but political j argon and just how much knowledge or expe rience does she have on the subject matter of colonics. Medical doctors don't want to do this and don't have any understanding or experience in this art. Neither do natureopaths. Next we will req uire regu lation to take a shower and do studies on that activ ity to find out if we really feel better or are cleane r for it ? I do sugg est sup port fo r HB2266 and SB6034. Eileen Codys b ill is just a decoy from the real grass roo t efforts. She is no friend of freed om of choice for th e citizen s or the altern ative arts. To continue my quest for wellness a nd even survival I have followed Mr. Yow to Sitka, Alaska for sessions and now to Portland Oreg on. I have the State DOH to thank for disrupting my life and a dding additional stress t o continue s omething as natural a cleaning m y colon. Colon Cleansi ng used to be taught in grade school in the early 1900's We nee d to get back t o basics, brush our teeth, clean our colons and be aware that pharmacitical drugs are not the a nswer for a lo t of us. Please do t he right thing, a nd allow the citizens t o direct their own health path and leave our drugless h ealers, who cause no harm the freedo m to use their art wi thout regu lation. Karen M. C onnolly Tum water, WA. I am oppose d to BILL RE Q. #: H-3505.1/07 as it is written. Please c onsider this letter a s my input to the Sunrise Heari ng on Colon Hy drotherapy, whi ch occu rred Au gust 29, 2007. It seem s to me th at the propo sed licen sing/certificatio n/registratio n of C HT's in the state of Wash ington is not a cost-effectiv e thing to do . A major role of t he DOH is t o protect Washi ngton citizens from harm. As far as I or anyone knows, there has never been a case of harm on the part of C HT's in th e history of their activ ity in Wash ington. There h as never been a clien t complaint. Liabilit y insurance premiums for CHT's are am ong the lowest of any of the health care disciplines, license d or unlicense d. So why s pend a significant amount of m oney to im plement som ething t hat is unneces sary? You propos e to \"protect\" the people from something that is com pletely safe. Why ? The obvious answer is: \"They asked us to do it.\" However, \"they\" (I-ACT) do not represe nt a majority of CHT's in Washington, and based on what I have \"hea rd\", a majority of C HT's in Washingto n do not want th is (I have not taken a formal poll). The most compelling reason I oppose this propo sal is m y compassio n for the medically uninsured folks in Washington. T here are a great many of them , and they m ust find a way to main tain their health outside of the medical m ainstream . Licensing/ certification/registration would cause the cost to the c onsumer to escalate. T he fee s the CHT's would be encumbered with would have to be passed on to the consumer. A nd there is the specter of the possibility o f a further (dram atic) escalatio n of costs by requiring \"prescri ptions\" Natu ropaths or MD's. Th is Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page E-6 would be the death knell for the uninsured. There is already a proposal to require a \"prescription\" for the use of ozone and herbs. I have personally expe rienced the effectiven ess of these in gredients in co lonic fluids, as h ave friends. They have been instrumental in deal ing with such things as C andida, parasites, and heavy metal and other toxins. T o the extent that the prece ding a re \"diagnoses\", t hey are of course never offered by CHT's, rather they are the clien t's self-d iagnosis or the result of clien t/MD-in itiated lab tests. As a policing arm of the state, yo ur duty is to \"serv e and protect\". App arently protectio n is no t needed for a m odality that has never expe rienced a client com plaint in Washington. And you would not be serving at least the uninsured by enactin g this proposed m easure. Thomas H. M orrin I wan ted to take th e tim e to send you my views in reg ard to th e Wash ington State Department of Health's rev iew of purposed regulation of Colon Hy drotherapy by the Dept. of Heal th. I have practiced as a license d and re gistered healthcare professional for 30 year s and have practiced in the state of Washington for 17 of those years. I work in conjunction with MD's , nutritio nists, an d others, as well as co lon hydrotherapists. On a personal lev el I first research ed colon hydrotherapy in New Mex ico in 1981 when I had an in terest due to having been diagnosed with IBS, irritab le bowel synd rome. Mo st doctors gave nutrition al reco mmendations and presc riptions but had not much el se to offer me. I researc hed and found out about colon hydrotherapy and did about 6 sessi ons which were ex tremely h elpful in reliev ing irritatio n to my colon and the discom fort of constipation. I self referred myself and was ab le to find a skilled and knowledg eable practitio ner and was really g lad this treatment was available to m e at a reas onabl e cost a nd in a comfortable and sanitary environment. I currently re nt an office s uite where an I-ACT cert ified colon hydrotherapist works and have observed their pract ice and noted how extremely b eneficial this treatment is and how a ppreciative people are to hav e this therapy av ailab le. I have noticed most find out about this treatment from friends, relatives, internet searc hes, and through other practitio ners who have had this therapy. It see ms that an occasio nal ND o r DC will refer b ut very few MDs and D.O.s, if at all, exce pt with their p atients requ est. I attended the heari ng and noted only one MD, one ND, and 2 DC's prese nt at the m eeting. T hey were there as represen tatives of th e I-ACT organizatio n only. I realize t hat if there was a high ris k factor in this t reatment that the therapist's liabilit y insurance would reflect th at, an d this doesn 't seem to be an issue. In my ex perience and observation, I see col on hydrotherapists to be very care ful and steadfast in regard to safet y and cleanline ss. I also observe a t horough and professional manner in consultation and phone conversations. In addition, I have observed colon hydrotherapists referring clients to physicians w hen appropriate. I would urge the panel to regulate the industry while continuing to make col on hydrotherapy widely and easily accessible wit hout the necessi ty of phys ician approval an d/or referral. Thank you for your consideration. Heidi Go uld, OTR/L, CST I have practiced c olon hydrotherapy for more than 10 years as a t rained and I-ACT-certified colon hydrotherapist following t he guidelines recei ved by t he Review Pa nel from I-ACT a nd my own comm on sense. I deci ded, upon m y own volition, to furth er my anatomy and physio logy training by attend ing massage scho ol in the State of Washington a nd also have attende d continuing education c ourses (at least one) for each year that I have bee n in pract ice. These courses have included topics suc h as digestion, nutrition, first aid and CPR, HIV/AIDS training and body m echanic s. I have built an independe nt and successful practice in the Ci ty of Olym pia with a large clientele that self-re fer to me as well as referrals fro m many of th e local naturopathic physician s, some acupuncturists , chiropractors, physical and Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page therapi sts and nutritionists. I use FD A-registered and approved equipment, sterile and disposable speculae, and hospital-grade cleaning and disinfect ing materials. M y client's are neve r exposed to me and do their own self-insert ions and clean-up of themselves. M y equipment is very similar to the equipment viewed by the Panel at the hearing review. My profession al liab ility insurance costs app roximately $ 175 annu ally. I concur, that colon hydrotherapy should fall under the RCW 18.120.030 code with standardized guidelines an d regulations. It is a pro cedure that can b e safely ad ministered by train ed, independent practitio ners such as m yself. However, Washington State has a history of higher continuing education standa rds for the heal th care professi ons. The panel may wish to consider placing colon hydrotherapy certificatio n with in the purview of the already ex isting education al institutions in th e state, e.g., m assage scho ols and community co lleges. I must stress to th e Pan el that the days of \"d octor-directed\" health care and prevention are long gone\u2014all you have to do is watch the commercial s on the telev ision during the 6:00 p.m. news to observe this. BY FAR, MOST OF MY CLIE NT'S ARE SELF-REFERRED. I urge the P anel not to take away the p ublic's righ t to m ake their own health care an d pre vention choices. Most of my clients see c olon hydrotherapy as a way to prevent having to go to the doctor. Many of them have g oals of obtaining and maintaining optimum heal th\u2014much l ike people who go to the gym. I have cl ients who are mountaineers, scuba drivers, tri-athletes. I have other clients who believe, as I do (my brother died from colon cancer ), that proper cleansing and detoxifying of the body is one way of enhancing overall health and vitality. Whe n I deem it appropriate a nd/or necessary, I am the one to engage these clients and nudge them into going to see a doctor\u2014something they may be a voiding. I also have cl ients who are woefully constipated an d lack proper bowel function and elimination. I have some clients under direct doctor supervision\u2014a few who are using this procedure to avoid more invasive and long-term debilitatin g surg eries. I h ave seen clien ts as y oung as 12 and as old as 94 . I have made a person al an d pro fessional decision to NOT adm inister the col onic to minors; I always have the parent or guardian in the room administering the proced ure and com municating to the child after a thorough in-take and a discussion of other potential altern atives. There is a CPT cod e for th e pro cedure of bowel irri gation, and colon hydrotherapists shou ld be able to bill insurance s, when m edically approved, for this procedure. Thank you for the inclusion of my comments during your delib erations. Jalen e Smith, LMP Certified Colon Hydrotherapist, I-ACT My nam e is Cathleen R ogers and I have been a recipient of Colon Hydrotherapy over the past few years. In the beginning I wa s referred by m y Naturo path to a C olon Hydrot herapist. This took place a fter I had some stom ach pains and X-rays rev ealed that I was backed up to my ribcage. As far as I knew then I h ad no sign s of this until the pain began. I was 5'5\" and weighed 130 pounds. My stomach did not protrude and to look at m e at that ti me one would not understand how t his could be possible. I di d not realize that I was not \"re gular\" until this all took place. Since having Colon Hydrotherapy I have become more reg ular, but most amazing is that I have much m ore energy, my skin has cl eared up, the dark circle s under m y eyes are gone, m y hair and nails a re healthier, I am less stresse d and have an over all feeling of good health which I was seriously lack ing prior to be introduced to Colon Hydrotherapy. I now am self-referred and discuss the fact that I have regular hydrotherapy sessi on throughout the year with my Naturopath when I see her. I know when I need C olon Hydrotherapy - I can feel it in all senses. Colon Hydrotherapy is a preventative to needi ng to see m y Naturopath and my Naturopath is happy that I take my heal th serious eno ugh to listen to my body and preven t sickn ess fro m having grounds to grow. I strongly feel that needing to obtain a referral every time one nee ds Colon Hydrotherapy is a waist of time and money. Health care is far to regulated a nd most of the tim e it is ab out making more money for th e doctors or companies and no t really abou t the patient. Some regu lation as far as e quipment, proper training and sanitation Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page E-8 make sense although the Hydrotherapist that I see is extremely knowledgeable, explained the procedure completely, is very professi onal and her facilit y is v ery clean. In all I am very co mfortable and feel co mpletely safe. On a si de note, I am also self-refe rred to a Massage Pract ioner and Chiropractor. Sincerely, Cath leen Rogers I am a retired federal em ployee and have health benefits that allo w me to self refer t o any specialist in my providers book. I choo se to pay out of pocket for many practitio ners who are not cov ered by my insurance. It was eith er my homeopathist or naturopath who told me about colon hydotheraphy. I believe in settin g stan dards for certificatio n to weed out the bad apples and protect the consumers. I find colon hydrotheraphy to be a very gentle, cleansing treatment. My altern ative health care providers never hesitate to coax m e to go see an MD if th ey th ink I have a condition that is not respon ding to th eir treat ment. Howe ver, my MDs n ever su ggest an y altern ative treat ment even when they give up on me and say they can't help me. As consumers we need m any choi ces in health care and need to do our research to be informed cons umers. Please help to prese rve that right of c hoice. Christin e Tutor I have been under a gast roenterologist care for severe constipation si nce 1 992. I have been treated with multiple laxatives a nd the latest pha rmaceuticals none of whic h had any effect on my condition (lack of peristal sis). In the ea rly 90's I receive d colon hydrotherapy from a naturopat h in Olympia but m y condition did not respond well to the type of equipment use. In 2004 I began seei ng a colon hydrotherapist in Olympia wh o used the Libbe system (grav ity-fed) an d my health and quality o f life has improved ten-fo ld. I continue under th e care of my gastroenterologist (Dr. Michael Schuffler, Pacific Medical Center) who approves of this avenue since it is effect ively managing my sym ptoms and t he only other option for treatment would be a subtotal colectomy which has its own complications. My doct or has also re ferred others to my hydrotherapist. My colon hydrotherapy is not covered by my insurance (Premera Blue Cross) even though it is an absolut e necessi ty for my heal th - as insulin would be to a diabetic. My monthly expenditure is approximately $240 ($60.00/week). I hope that someday soon the insuran ce companies will recogn ize th e importance of this treatm ent and cov er as t hey do other altern ative treatmen ts. I think that it is i mportant that an individual have the right to choose the practitio ner that he/sh e is m ost comfortable with - just as you would choo se a chiropractor or massage therapist. Having to settle for a \"prefe rred provider\" would not be accep table. I believe some regu lation is necessary to b e sure that a t herapist is pro perly train ed and would include inspection s to be sure that the equipment is maintained acc ording to guidelines an d protocols. I have absolute confidence in the professionalism of m y colon hydrotherapist. Resp ectfu lly su bmitted, Kathleen Heidenrei ch, Educator My nam e is Gloria R oss and I am a practicing C olon Hydr othera pist in t he state of Washington. I received my training and certification from the Michigan School for Colon Hydrotherapy in Ithca, Mich. I worked at the Det roit Who listic Cen ter an d the Cen ter for Healin g Arts i n Mich igan prior to relocatin g to Seattle. I currently own m y own business on Mercer Island and I work with a licensed Naturopathic Doctor in Issaquah, WA. I recei ved m y first colonic tre atment in 1984 and immediately underst ood the bene fits to my health. It is unfort unate that m ost medical practione rs are not a ware of th e health b enefits an d safet y of col onics when adm inistered by a properly train ed and certified practitio ner. I'm proud to be a Colon Hydroth erapist and I know I hav e helped hundreds of people, purely based on what they have told me. As far as regulating and bringing standards to the professi on I must ask y ou \"why reinvent the wheel?' Why spend taxpay ers' dollars doing what the International Association for Colon Hydrotherapy (I-ACT) has al ready done. Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page E-9 Their training and certification program includes an in-depth educat ion in anatomy and physiology, digestion, nutrition, the history col on therapy, eq uipm ent use, professional practice s and ethics. Additionally each ce rtification an I-ACT certified structor. I have been tested and certified through I-ACT and have gone on to take additional trainin g, education , and adva nced testing so that I can teach a nd train othe rs in the field of c olon hydrothe rapy. I have traine d and certified several Colon Hydrotherapists who are now employed in the state of Wash ington, Florida, and Michigan. I strongly support some type of licensu re in the state of Wash ington but it m ust be implemen ted in fairness to currently practicing C olon Hydrotherapists. Thank you for taking my commen ts eration . Gloria Ross Certified Colon Hydrotherapist P.S. I hope one chiropract or who practiced 30 years ago, with what looks like home-made equipment, does not determine the fate o f an en tire profession . (re: Am ebiasis d ocument) I am so di sturbed to here of WA DOH's crusade to regulate col on hydrotherapists under the guise of protecting both therapist and client. Something is definitely ro tten in th e state of Denmark. Why is it th at this modality is being targeted and given DOH's top priority when it is not broke and doesn't need fixing? I vehemently oppose any regulatio n and licen sing of colon hydrotherapy, including what should or should not be put in the water us ed. I am a receiver of this t herapy. It is an integral part of my health care routine. T he course of treatm ent in a session is between me and m y colon hygienist. I respect fully request that I have the freedom to choose . Respectfully, Paula M uth My nam e is Kristi McKinney Zimmer and I am a licensed massage therapist in the state of WA since 1997. I am also an IACT certified colon hydrotherapist practicin g in WA State since 1996. I have trained i n colon hydrotherapy with local naturopathic physician s in Seattle, Prim e Pacific Health Innovations and Bousher Institute of Naturopathic Medicine in Vancouver BC, and the International School for Colon Hydrotherapy in Kiental, Switzerland. I co-own and operate a su ccessful health ce nter in Seattle, WA with m y husband si nce 2003. We employ ~ 10 people year round, 7 day s a week pr oviding col on hydrotherapy, massage, and nut rition counseling since 20 03. We see up to 7 new clients a day in peak seaso n (spring) and have strong referral networks in the ND and CAM community of Seat tle and surrounding areas. We have health y relatio nships with the colon hydrotherapy community aro und the United States in cluding sev eral instru ctor level practitio ners. We are a leader in the industry and pro ud to serv e our community with these ancient healing m odalities. I was first introduce d to the idea of colon hydrotherapy in massage sc hool. It has been instrumental for me in achieving optimum health and I have witnessed 1 000's of consumers reg aining health as a resu lt of th is in combination with other self healin g modalities. Th is therapy was im portant in ancient times for hygiene and bowel conditioning and remains an effect ive tool for that purpose today . It proves to be even more im portant in modern times to address b asic physical h ygiene due to the lev el of pollution in ou r environment and con sequently in our bodies. Colon hydrotherapy is effective, inexpensive, enjoyable and safe. We receive cal ls on a daily ba sis from cons umers who are looking for a provi der for this thera py. They often ask about training, certificatio n or some standard sk ill set th at is appropriate for th e prov ider to have in order to feel good about receiv ing the service. Th ey want to make sure the water an d facility are clean , the therapist is profe ssional, a nd that the re will be no health risk invol ved with receiving th e the rapy. We provide a n extensi ve Colon Hydrotherapists Sunrise Page E-10 expla nation in order to e ducate the public. This is a tas k we gladly take on both l ocally and nationally because we want e ducated consum ers that create a demand for high standards. We have those standards. For this reason I feel that state reco gnition and certificatio n or licen sure is a posit ive step forward for pr oviders and c onsum ers. I have witn essed first hand the power of state licen sure with massage. This recogn ition took a modality known for centuries for its effectivenes s with many health goals an d turn ed it into a modern therapy choice cov ered b y insurance com panies . Now c onsumers are e ducate d as to what massage is, how it serv es health, an d wh o can provide it with a certain standard of care. This is prog ress an d serv es the public. The public wou ld also be well serve d by the regulation and support of colon hydrotherapy. This is evident in the many letters from consum ers regarding their use of th is valuable therapy. From my years of e xperience both perform ing, receivi ng, a nd teaching colon hydrothe rapy I feel t hat thi s is one of the safest m odalities av ailab le to the pub lic. Its record is as flawless as m assage. While there are m odern factors that po se cau tion (ex : drugs that thin the intestinal lin ing) I feel th at it would never cau se seriou s harm when applied within appropriate param eters. T he most discomfort I have ever witnessed has been intestinal cram ping (due to the exercising of a weak col on) and nausea (a common det oxification si de effect). These can be experienced up to 12 hours post session and then they quickly abat e. They can also be remedied with hydrating electro lyte so lutions an d applied heat. Medical prescriptions are not neede d for this therapy unless a co ntraindication is present. It would be a crim e to take a sel f healing tool such as colon hydrotherapy out of the hands of the public. This therapy should be available to all ju st lik e massag e, acu puncture, ch iropractic and other spa services . The allopathic medical community is not providing, training, or educat ing others about this therapy. Th ey are not qualified to con trol it. Certain herbs, electro lyte so lutions, and other natural healing solutions can b e extremely helpful with the effectiv eness of this therapy. A list of non drug items can be drawn up in th e bill to allow fo r these item s to be infused in to the water. Th ey prove completely safe. Lastly, th e decisio ns made by the DOH th at will d etermine the way t his ind ustry flourishes in WA state need to be guided by those promoting, educat ing and providing services in colon hydrotherapy. I believe in the goodness of people and the spirit of democracy . I also underst and the fear experienced by people when they do not understand something. It is our job toget her to assure that ignora nce does not precede experie nce in th is situation a nd lim it the people of this great state to a powerful heal th tool. Heal th is a fundam ental birthright and I challenge you to support WA state citizens i n their que st for it.

Although the draft is well written, there are so me erro rs of either omission or int erpretation that cause the draft to reflect a bias that should not be present in an impartial Sunrise Review report. The re port should accurately report the information pr ovided during the Sunrise Review so the legislative body can make their decision on the bill H -3505. 1/07. The first secti on of the draft provides a review of \"The Sunrise Review Proces s\" and lists crite ria for healthcare pr ofessions that should be regulated and t he types of regulation t hat may be consi dered. There is another benefit of havin g a Sunrise Review as it provides the Legislative bod y the op portu nity to identif y when or if there is a bias in the Depart ment of Health that is inconsistent with the dire ction of the legislative body . The second section is an \"Overview of the Proceedings\". We suggest a change on the last li ne of the thir d paragraph to read: \"On Decem ber 21, 2007, t he Depa rtment of Health distribu ted a draft repo rt to participants and interested parties for review, fo llowed b y a ten-da y rebuttal per iod to comm ent on t he draft report.\" Rationale: this provi des the date of the draft. The third section is a \"Summary of Information\". It is in the fourth sub-section that is inaccurat e in its reflection of the record. The Sub-Section entitle d Col on H ydrotherapy a Medica l Practice, second paragraph, \" The practice of colon hydrotherap y is recognized in Washington a s an instrumentalit y to diagnose and treat medical conditions.\" This statemen t is inaccurate and m isleads the legislative body by referring to the State v. Pacific Health Center, Inc. , as the rationale for colon hydrotherap y being the practice of medicine. That case was not about colon h ydrotherapy , but was about an individual that held them selves out as healing medical conditions us ing Electroderm al Testing (EDT), not col on hydrotherap y. There is no similarity between the two m odalities. The practice of colon hydrotherapy SHOULD NOT be recognized in Washingt on as a Medical Practice as the Sunrise Review He aring docum ented that colon hydrotherapists do not diag nose, do not prescribe and do not treat medical conditions. Additi onally, the S unrise Revie w Hearing clear ly docum ented that colon hydrotherapists do not insert any device into an y orifice of the bod y. In the next sentence, the Depart ment of Health stat es, \"Medical procedures may be performed only by an appropriately licensed healt h professional acting within the scope of his or her lic ense. In Was hington, colonic irriga tion is within the statutor y practice for naturopaths, ph ysicians, and osteopathic physicians.\" This statement is not factual. This is an i nterpretation that shows the bias of the Depart ment of Health. There are no laws that specif ically delinea te colon h ydrotherap y in the scope of practice of any of those profe ssions. The fact is that there is not a single medical school or naturopathic school in Washington that trains naturopaths, physicians, and os teopathic ph ysicians that provides train ing in co lon hydrotherap y. The next line s continue to reflect the De partment of Health' s bias and interpretation as the y state, \"These practitioners may delegate colon h ydrot herapy to other practitioners under lim ited circu mstances. When delegated, colon hydrotherapy must be in the scope of practice and training of the licensee perf orming the task.\" There are no laws that list the services that naturopaths, phy sicians, a nd osteopathic physicians Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page G-1 may delegate, nor are there any laws that direct to whom it may be delegated. This is an interpretation of the Department of Health and is not cons istent with current practice. To m ake the point, currently, there are other class II medical devic es that are ro utinely prescribed for patient use and that is the use of Oxygen. Patients with pulm onary or heart issues are routinely prescribed oxygen. The licensed pract itioner writes the prescrip tion, and the patient takes the prescription to a medical supply com pany where they are taught h ow to use the equip ment, the patient then takes the equipm ent home and uses i t when necess ary. There is no requirem ent for another licensee to a dminister the ox ygen. The records of the Sunrise Hearing clear ly establish that the therapist should have a prescripti on from an indivi dual lic ensed by the state to purchase colon hy drotherapy equipment and supplies, howe ver, the public was very clear that they do not w ant to have to get prescriptions for the procedure. In Florida, where the stat e certifie s colon hydrotherapist, ther e is no requirem ent for prescriptions to purc hase the equipm ent or to provide the service to the customer. It is this interpretation by the Depart ment of Health that screa ms for the legislative body to c ertify colon hydrotherapists. If the legi slative bod y does not pr ovide certificati on, then the result may be that the public is deprived of access to colon hydrotherapy , or they will be forced to go to a practitioner that may not be pr operly trained. The last paragraph of t his sub-section. For accuracy , the second li ne should rea d: \"Under FDA regulations, colonic irrigati on equi pment is considered to be a class II medical device.\" Rationale: accura cy, as the FDA does not use the te rm colon hy drotherapy . Under the section \"Safety and Efficacy \", third paragr aph, second and third sentence, the Depart ment of Health state s, \"Frequent treat ments can result in the absorption of too m uch wat er. This can lead to electroly te imbalances in the blood, naus ea, vom iting, heart failure, fluid in the lungs, abnorm al heart rhythms, or coma.\" This s tatement is not accurate as reflected in the Serum Electroly te Study provided. The study showed that no patients experienced any clinically signifi cant co mplications or com plaints during or after the course of treatment. The onl y problem might be encountered with paraplegics that are unable to com pletely release their bowels. The last line of this sub-section, \"Death and serious injury have bee n associated with colon hydrotherapy treatment without physician inv olvem ent.\" is also misleading. The inform ation we provided was fro m a report in New England Jo urnal of Medicine, August 5, 1982, that t here was a spr ead of am ebiasis due to improperly cleaned equipment. It was the a mebiasis t hat lead to th e deaths, not t he colon h ydrotherap y session. This would not ha ppen with appropriately trained therapists using state of the art colon hydrotherapy equipm ent as registered wit h the FDA, and disposable speculums/re ctal tubes. There have been no other docum ented a nd verified cases of death a s a result of colon hydrothe rapy. In the section Findin gs:, we contend tha t colon h ydrotherapy is not the practice of medicine. The colon hydrotherapist receives a pr escription from a licensed practitioner, and the writing of the prescription is the practice of medicine. The colon hydrotherapist i s following t he directions of the licensed practitioner, the colon h ydrotherapist is not practicing medicine. The next to t he last section Review of Sunrise Cr iteria, under the sub section, Fir st Criterion Unregulated practice c an har m or endanger health and safety , ther e are errors th at need corre ction in each paragraph. Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page G-2 The first paragraph un der the sub section, First Cr iterion Unregulat ed practice can harm or endanger health and safety , third sentence, \"Patien t injury or death may also occur from frequent treat ments.\" Is not accurate. There is no basis for that state ment, in fact, it is in dire ct conflict with the study that was provided which found , \"In spite of the considerable dur ation of tre atment and volum e of water used in our study, the su bjects experien ced none of t he symptoms of water intoxication.\" The first paragraph un der the sub section, First Cr iterion Unregulat ed practice can harm or endanger health and safety , last sentence, \"Injuries and d eath from colon hyd rotherap y have been documented.\" This is m isleading and should reflect that the death was fro m the spread of a mebiasis, and that was the cause of deat h, not the colonic. The second p aragraph und er the sub section, First Cri terion Unregu lated practic e can harm or endanger health and safety , last sentence, \"Regulat ion for the health professionals who administer the treat ment is appropriate and necessary to protect patient health and saf ety.\" This state ment requires that the legislative body support the bill and provide certification for colo n hydrotherapists \"to protect the public\" and is in direct conflict with the final reco mmendation of t he Departm ent of Health. The third par agraph under the sub section, First Cr iterion Unregulat ed practice can harm or endanger health and safety , \"Colon hydrotherapy is already regulated in Washington because it is the practice of medicine. It is within the scope of practice of physicians, osteopaths, and naturopaths. These professionals may delegate the task to other personnel if the delegatee is properly trained and has colon hydrotherap y within his or her scope of practice.\" This was addre ssed earlier a s it reflects the bias of the Depart ment of Health. No medical school or natur opathic school in WA trains or teaches ab out colon hydrotherapy . Without legi slation, there are no la ws that preclude the practitioner from using equipm ent not registered with the FDA, and since the professiona l may delegate the task, then colon hydrotherapists must be regis tered or certified to perform the t ask. Colon hydrotherapists are the onl y ones tha t are trained and skilled in t he procedure. The fourth paragraph under the sub section, First Cr iterion Unregul ated practice can har m or endanger health and safety , \"The depart ment concludes, theref ore, that unre gulated practice of the single procedure proposed for this profession can harm or endanger hea lth and safety. This conclusion, howeve r, does not support t he need to regulate colon hydrotherapists as an independe nt profession. Professionals already regulated in Washington c an provi de thi s treatment.\" This paragraph, once again, cries for the legislative body to certify the colon hydrotherapist s. The Departm ent of Heal th continues to contend that there are professionals in WA that can provide the treatment y et the only individuals that have been trained in colon hydrotherapy are unregulated colon hydrotherapists. The Depart ment of He alth has made the case that colon hydrotherapists need to be regulated under the first criterion, yet they continue to deny that fact. The Second criterion: Publ ic needs will benefit fro m an assurance of professional ability, can onl y be guaranteed by reco mmending the legisl ative bod y regulate colon hydrotherapists, y et the draft report continues to maintain that a curre ntly licensed practitioner that m ay or m ay not have received any training is superior to a regulated profession that guarantees th e therapists ar e trained and regulated. Regulation can guarantee that the practitioners are using FDA re gistered equipment and disposable speculums/rect al tubes. The d epartm ent co ncludes the Sunrise Review does not satisfy the second Su nrise criterion, yet the exact opposit e is true. The Sunrise Review showed th at Public needs will benefit from an assurance of professional ability which includes appropriate training. The Third cri terion: Public protection cannot be me t by other m eans in a cost -effective manner, has the same problem as the Departm ent of Health continue s to contend that, \"the scope of practice for the Colon Hydrotherapist S unrise Page G-3 proposed profession is alre ady regu lated by other professions with established programs ad ministered through the D epartment of Health. There are, theref ore, other m ore cost effective means for providing public protection.\" Yet the fact is that the current professions do not have any required training for colon hydrotherap y in an y school s and the onl y way the le gislative bod y can ensure that indivi duals t hat perform this valuable service are properly traine d is th rough certification or regul ation b y law. The Conclusion the depart ment reaches is that the Su nrise Review did m eet the f irst Sunrise criterion. Yet the draft states, \"However, this criterion does not s upport regulation of t he profession because the practice of colon h ydrot herapy is already regulated in Washington.\" This interpr etation of cur rent regulations is not consistent w ith current practices and the testi mony received by the Sunrise Review process. Dr. Jacob Kornberg, Surgeon/MD provided test imony at the Sunrise Review hearin g that colon hydrotherap y is not the pra ctice of medicine and th at an I-ACT certified colon h ydrotherapist should be permitted to perform these services with out MD supervis ion or further medical tr aining. The testi mony clearly shows that there are highl y trained and hi ghly skilled colon hydrotherapists that perform this service to the public. Testim ony also showed that the public defini tely wants to have this service available to them . Testimon y showed there are no medical or naturopathic schools in Washin gton t hat train colon h ydrotherap y. The onl y possible conclusion sho uld be to recommen d legislation. Finall y the R ecommendation of t he dep artment was th at the \"legislature should not ado pt the proposed bill establishing certification for colon hydrotherapist s.\" as the proposal did not satisfy the thr ee Sunrise criteria. Yet, in their Concl usion, the depart ment did find that t he first Sunrise criterion had bee n met. Bottom line: Throug hout this draft, the departm ent has attem pted to interpret th at colon h ydrotherap y is in the scope of practice for naturopaths, physicians , and osteopathi c physicians , yet there is no training available in an y Washingt on medical sch ool or naturo pathic school that provi des training o n colon hydrotherap y. The colon hydrotherapist s that ca me forward during the Sunrise Review have been appropriatel y trained and are using FDA registered eq uipm ent. The Sunrise Process has d etermined a n eed for certif ication for this profession. The draft and the departm ent should resoundingl y recommend the legislat ure support the bill and enact regulation to certif y colon h ydrot "}
