There is no consensus regarding its exact denition, and it may be interpreted differently by physicians and patients. Physicians prescribe various treatments, and patients often adopt differentover-the-counter remedies. Chronic constipation is either caused by slow colonic transit or pelvic floordysfunction, and treatment differs accordingly. Methods: To update our knowledge of chronic constipation and its etiology and best-evidence treat- ment, information was synthesized from articles published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Levels of evidence and recommendations were made according to the Strength ofRecommendation taxonomy. Results: The standard advice of increasing dietary bers, fluids, and exercise for relieving chronic constipation will only benet patients with true deciency. Biofeedback works best for constipationcaused by pelvic floor dysfunction. Pharmacological agents increase bulk or water content in the bowellumen or aim to stimulate bowel movements. Novel classes of compounds have emerged for treatingchronic constipation, with promising clinical trial data. Finally, the link between senna abuse and coloncancer remains unsupported. Conclusions: Chronic constipation should be managed according to its etiology and guided by the best evidence-based treatment.(J Am Board Fam Med 2011;24:436 - 451.) Constipation, Clinical Review, Evidence-Based Medicine, Family Medicine, Gastrointestinal Problems, Systematic Review The word \"constipation\" has varied meanings for different individuals. Although medical personneldene constipation as /H110213 bowel movements per week, 1,2patients often equate constipation with stool consistency, feelings of incomplete emptying,straining, and urge for defecation. 3,4Furthermore, the normalcy of bowel habit ranges widely from 3bowel movements per day to 3 per week, 5with a tendency to underestimate while self-reporting6; hence, using defecation frequency alone may not bediagnostic of constipation. The Rome Foundationwas established in 1991 by Drossman et al, primar- ily to standardize consensus-derived criteria offunctional gastrointestinal disorder, and releasedthe Rome III criteria in 2006 for constipation ashaving at least 2 of the following: (1) strainingduring /H1135025% defecation; (2) lumpy or hard stools in/H1135025% of defecation; (3) sensation of incomplete evacuation in /H1135025% of defecation; (4) sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage in /H1135025% of defe- cation; (5) need for manual maneuvers to facilitatein/H1135025% of defecation; and (6) fewer than 3 defe- cations per week. 7,8Also, patients should rarely have loose stools without laxatives and be distinct from having irritable bowel syndrome.8,9For con- stipation to be dened as chronic, a patient must besymptomatic for at least 6 months with applicablecriteria for the previous 3 months. 3,9Although the validity of the Rome III criteria for constipation hasbeen recently questioned, 10with a known disparity between self-reported and criteria-based deni-tions, 11the use of colonic transit time12,13andThis article was externally peer reviewed.

Downloaded from anorectal function tests14as diagnostic tools is still controversial. In general, the prevalence of consti- pation among the general population in NorthAmerica has been quoted as 1.9% to 27.2%, 15,16 with 50% to 74% of the institutionalized elderlyreporting daily use of laxatives. 17,18Women are 2 to 3 times more likely to have constipation thanmen in terms of prevalence 3,15,19 -21and physical symptoms.15,20Possible reasons include higher risk of injury to the pelvic floor from childbirth22and the general willingness of women to report theirsymptoms and respond to surveys. 23Advanced age is also a risk factor for chronic constipation, withthe largest increase in prevalence after the age of 70years. 15This can be due to effects of medication, immobility, and blunted urge to defecate. In theUnited States, constipation accounts for 7 m illion physician visits per year 24and is among the top 5 outpatient gastrointestinal diagnoses.25Annually, diagnostic workup for constipation averagesUS$3000 per patient, 26and it takes another US$4500 per person to provide treatment.27In general, constipation has a signicant impact onquality-of-life indicators irrespective of culture andnationalities, 28especially on the elderly.29A recent systematic review showed that impairment causedby constipation as measured by Health-RelatedQuality of Life scores predominates in the mentalhealth domains and is comparable to that caused byserious chronic conditions such as osteoarthritisand diabetes. 30 Etiology of Chronic Constipation Extrinsic Factors Low ber intake, inadequate hydration, reducedmobility as the result of general functional declineand neuro-logical (eg, dementia, Parkinson disease,neuropathies, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord inju-ries, cauda equine syndrome), psychological co- morbidities (eg, depression, distress, NSAIDs) all are said to contribute tochronic constipation, especially in the elde-rly. 17,31-36Among them, the trio of insufcient dietary ber, fluids, and exercise has been widelyascribed, 37but in fact the evidence behind these 3 factors is inconsistent and of low to medium qual-ity. 38(See Notes section: Diagnostic Approach for Chronic Constipation.) The association betweensmoking, alcohol, and body mass index withchronic constipation L131(BMI) is inconclu-sive. 36,39 Intrinsic Factors Normal defecation requires a series of orchestratedactions, starting with relaxation of the puborectalismuscles, descent of the pelvic floor with straight-ening of the anorectal angle, inhibition of segmen-tal colonic peristalsis, contraction of muscles, and nally, relaxation of the externalanal sphincter with expulsion of feces. Intrinsicfactors leading to chronic constipation can bebroadly classied into 2 categories: pelvic floor dys-function (PFD) and slow colon transit time (STC).A retrospective study reported the prevalence ofPFD as 37% and STC as 23%, 40based on physi - ologic tests. However, a clear distinction betweenthe two is often impossible, with an overlap ofup to 55%. 40,41 Anorectal/PFD involves laxity of the pelvic floor muscles, impaired rectal sensation, and decreasedluminal pressure in the anal canal and have beendocumented as causes for chronic constipation inthe elderly, especially in women. 42- 44On the con trary, paradoxical contraction of the puborectalisand external anal sphincter during defecation canlead to incomplete emptying 45,46or even functional outlet obstruction. Finally, anatomic anomalies(such as rectal wall prolapse or rectocele) or peri-neal damage (from traumatic childbirth or sacralnerve injury) can also distort the normal functionsof the anorectal/pelvic floor unit. STC is a poorly understood condition thought to be a cause of intractable constipation in chil-dren 47and young women.48It is characterized by reduced high-amplitude propagated contrac-tions 49,50in the colon, leading to slow transit of feces, bloating, abdominal discomfort, and infre-quent defecation. 51The protracted time in the co - lon also renders the feces hard and small and fails tomount sufcient rectal pressure to trigger the def-ecation reflex. 52Often, the pressure required is found to be higher than in subjects with normalcolonic transit. 53Various physiologic and histobio - doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2011.04.100272 Chronic Constipation 437copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from chemical ndings have been postulated to explain the phenomenon interstitial of bolus 67may confuse the diagnosis of chronic constipation unless a rectal examination isperformed. The odds ratio for developing fecal in-continence with chronic constipation is 1.7. 68 (2) Hemorrhoids: Prolonged straining and in- crease of intra-abdominal pressure raises the ve-nous pressure in the plexus and ateriovenous anas-tomoses of the anorectal junction. 69The relative risk for development of hemorrhoids with consti-pation is up to 4.1. 70 (3) Anal ssure: Trauma and sudden tear of the anal mucosa during evacuation of hard stool isusually an initiating event, but spasm of the internalanal sphincter leading to relative ischemia isthought to be the perpetuating factor. 69It is esti - mated that anal ssure is 5 times more likely todevelop with chronic constipation. 70,71 (4) Organ prolapse: Chronic constipation is a known risk for prolapse of pelvic organs such as theuterus, rectum, urinary bladder, and vagina 72and their recurrence.73The odds ratio for having rectal prolapse is quoted as 2.3.68 (5) Fecal impaction and bowel obstruction: Pro- longed stasis of fecal matter leads to impaction andgiant fecolith obstructing the large bowel, necessi-tating surgery. 74,75Retrospective analysis revealed a 5- to 6-times increased risk of fecal impactionresulting from chronic constipation. 68,70,71 (6) Bowel perforation Extremely sterc - oral peritonitis78,79and sometimes death.79It is not a common condition; fewer than 90 cases have beenreported in the medical literature from 1894 to2006. 80Diagnostic Approach and InvestigationsIt is important to conduct a detailed history andphysical examination before proceeding with in-vestigations. It is imperative to understand thepatient's views and denitions of chronic consti-pation, which may often differ from medical cri-teria. The clinician should also weigh the cost-benets of investigations and only order thosethat help diagnose the etiology of chronic con-stipation and affect the treatment and prognosisin such patients. A brief outline of the diagnostic approach for chronic constipation is given in theNotes section: Diagnostic Approach for ChronicConstipation. It must be emphasized that theseinvestigations are not indicated as routine studiesexcept for differentiating between slow colon tran-sit time and pelvic floor dysfunction, in whichtreatment would differ. Moreover, contrast studiesand colonoscopy should be considered if the pa-tient has a positive family history of colon cancer orinflammatory bowel disease and presents withalarming complaints of rectal bleeding, abruptweight loss, anemia, or change in bowel habits. Evidence-Based Management of Chronic Constipation Methods A literature search of published medical reports inall languages was performed from PUBMED,EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of System- atic Reviews from inception to October 2010 usingthe OVID Portal of Queen's University, Kingston,Ontario. Abstracts were initially obtained using keywords of \"chronic constipation,\" \"treatment,\" and\"trials.\" Manual searches of references and reviewarticles computerized search,and only full-length articles were considered. Tworeviewers (L.L. and T.R.) worked independentlyand went over the initial search for abstracts thatsatised the key words as mentioned. They thenadopted a simple form to select studies that satisedthe following 2 inclusion criteria: (1) involving hu-man subjects over the age of 18 years and (2) de-scribing at least 1 form of treatment for chronicconstipation. Evaluation of selected studies wasperformed by each reviewer (L.L. and T.R.) re-garding their quality and evidence accordingto the Strength of Recommendations Taxonomy(SORT), 81with levels of evidence from I to III and recommendations from A to C.

Downloaded from was discussed and resolved among the reviewers to reach mutual consensus. Results One hundred forty-ve abstracts were identied byusing key words of \"chronic constipation\" AND\"treatment\" AND \"trials.\" Duplicates were re-moved, and, after imposing the selection criteria,only 62 relevant full-text articles were then re-trieved for potential inclusion. 9,34,46,82-141They were deemed eligible on which mutual consensuswas reached between the two reviewers (LL andTR). Additional consultation with the other twocoauthors (WR and JK) was sought as required.The studies were then rated according to theSORT as below and summarized in the Notes sec-tion: Senna, Melanosis Coli, and Colon Cancer: Fact or Myth? Lifestyle Modications Despite the fact that chronic constipation had beenobserved with deciency in dietary ber, fluids, orexercise, lifestyle modication to prevent or treatchronic constipation is still unsubstantiated. 82,142 (See Notes section: Lack of Dietary Fiber, Fluid,and Exercises Will Cause Constipation: How TrueIs This?) However, such principles are widely dis-seminated to the public through pamphlets 37and practice guidelines (http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/assets/downloads/en/pdf/guidelines/05_constipation.pdf). Studies only report benets ifthere is a lack of any of the three. Physicians andallied medical professionals should be aware of theevidence when advising their patients. Biofeedback For the PFD type of chronic constipation, biofeed-back provides a retraining of the sensation andcontrol of the anorectum and pelvic floor, therebyeliminating paradoxical contractions during theprocess of defecation. Its value has been shownboth in uncontrolled trials 93and in recent random - ized, controlled trials (RCTs)46,92,94for improving both psychological and clinical outcome measures.There have been no reports of adverse effects forusing biofeedback. As a result, the level of evidenceand recommendation in using biofeedback for PFDtype of chronic constipation is good except for thediversity of protocols and heterogeneity of trialdesigns.Pharmacological Treatment Medications for chronic constipation can be agents, agents are ber supplements that ex-pand with water to increase bulk of the stool andenhance bowel movements. Commercially avail-able preparations include psyllium (ispaghulahusks), calcium polycarbophil, methycellulose, andbran. Adequate fluid intake is a must for bulk-forming agents to work; lack of water enhancesbloating and may paradoxically predispose to bowelobstruction. Among them, psyllium has superiorefcacy in treating constipation, with at least 3RCTs demonstrating benets over placebo in im-proving colonic transit time and stool consiste-ncy. 98 -100Two controlled trials reported the ben - ets of bran in reducing the use of laxatives in the elderly.102,103In comparison, there is only 1 con - trolled trial for methylcellulose104and a case series for polycarbophil105supporting their clinical use. Bulk-forming agents are considered as rst-lineagents for chronic constipation, especially in pa-tients with dietary ber deciency. Stool Softeners and Emollients Docusate sodium is a commonly prescribed stoolsoftener that has a detergent effect. Although thereis no known study comparing its stand-alone ef-cacy against placebo, one double-blind randomizedtrial found docusate to be inferior to psyllium inchronic constipation. 98Another systematic review did show a small effect of docusate in increasingstool frequency in the chronically ill, but overallquality of evidence was poor. Hence, the recom-mendation for use of docusate sodium is only mod-erate. Mineral oil is an emollient used for its lubri-cating effect on stool, but no placebo-controlled,randomized trial has been reported. Aspiration andlipoid pneumonia is a known risk of using mineraloil in children 143and the elderly.144The level of evidence for use of mineral oil is hence moderate.Stool softeners are often prescribed when bulk-forming agents do not work or are not preferred. doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2011.04.100272 Chronic Constipation 439copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from Osmotic Agents Agents such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), lactu- lose, sorbitol, and magnesium hydroxide adsorband retain water as the result of their hyperosmolarnature and enhance stool passage. PEG has the bestevidence of use, with at least 3 well-designed RCTsdemonstrating signicant benets of PEG overplacebo 106 -108in increasing stool frequency and softness. However, PEG can cause nausea, flatu-lence, and diarrhea, especially in the elderly, andthe dosage should be titrated upward according toresponse. 19In fact, some studies also reported ef - cacy at a low dosage of PEG.145-147For lactulose, at least 2 systematic reviews reported RCTs show-ing efcacy over placebo, 109,110and the evidence is considered superior. No randomized, placebo-con-trolled trials have been conducted with sorbitol, butat least 1 double-blind, randomized, crossoverstudy when 111Similarly, the use constipation is notsupported by placebo-controlled trials, withonly 1 report of severe hypermagnesia requiringhemodialysis after chronic use. 112Osmotic agents are useful when bulk-forming agents orstool softeners do not work. Stimulants Senna and bisacodyl are the most commonly usedstimulants. They act on the myenteric plexus of thecolon and stimulate peristaltic contractions, 148,149 which decreases transit time.150,151They also de - crease water absorption from the lumen. For bi-sacodyl, there is a double-blind, randomized, safetyover placebo so-dium 113The level recommenda - tion for using bisacodyl is superior. Surprisingly,despite the widespread use of senna for more thana century, there is no well-designed RCT compar-ing its efcacy with placebo. However, at least 3controlled trials compared the effects of senna withanother laxative in treating chronic constipation. Itwas found that senna was a better choice, 115or, senna enhanced the effects when given in combi-nation. 116,117Even so, the recommendation for senna is only considered moderate. There has beenintense debate as to the potential risk of coloniccarcinoma as the result long-term use of senna,based on the observation that senna use leads toMelanosis coli, an alleged risk for cancer of the colon.

At least 3 doubleblind, randomized, placebo-controlled 118 -120 have shown efcacy of lubiprostone in increasingspontaneous bowel movements and improving self-reported symptoms of chronic constipation.Known adverse effects include headache, nausea,and diarrhea but are well tolerated. Long-term useof lubiprostone also appears to be safe. 154Evidence and recommendation for use of lubiprostone ishence excellent. Subtype 4 Agonists 5-Hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT4) receptors are found in the primary afferent neu-rons, smooth muscle cells, enterochromafn cells,and the myenteric plexus of the colon. 155They mediate the release of other neurotransmitters thatinitiate peristaltic action in the bowel. 155,156Tega - serod, a 5-HT4partial agonist, was approved by the FDA for use in 2002 both for constipation thedominant type of irritable bowel syndrome and alsofor idiopathic constipation in patients under theage of 65 years. its efcacy shown by mul-tiple randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trialsfrom different countries, 121-124the FDA disap - proved marketing of tegaserod in 2007 because of asmall increased risk in cardiovascular events, whichled to its nal withdrawal in 2008. This led topublic criticisms against the FDA for being pater-nalistic and counterproductive. 125,126Research in - terest in tegaserod still continues,127and 2 recent cohort studies have specically shown a lack ofassociation of cardiovascular events with tegas-erod. 128,129Whether tegaserod will be relaunched in the future remains to be seen.

Recommendation and level ofevidence for prucalotide will not be forthcomingbecause of its experimental nature. Other Treatments Bacteriotherapy (Probiotics) Lactobacillus and Bidobacterium are recognized symbiotic flora in the large intestine that compete with harmful pathogens in binding to the surface ofenterocytes and confer mucosal health. Both florahad been reported at low levels in patients withchronic constipation, 160which supports the use of these probiotic bacteria for treating chronic consti-pation and other inflammatory bowel condi-tions. 161One prospective study showed that Bido - bacterium supplementation relieve constipation in hypocaloric dieting,95whereas another prospec - tive trial reported efcacy of Lactobacillus in im- proving chronic constipation in nursing home res-idents. 96However, survival and viability of these probiotic bacteria as consumed in commercial formhas yet to be standardized for such treatment to beofcially endorsed. 97Because of the lack of prop - erly controlled trials, evidence and recommenda-tion is poor. Traditional Chinese Medicine Chronic constipation was described in the ancienttexts of Chinese medicine in 200 AD. It is treatedby a combination of herbs and acupuncture, de-pending on the symptomatology. At least 2 RCTshave shown efcacy of a particular formula (Yun-Chang capsule; aka Hemp Seed Pill) in treating thefunctional type of chronic constipation. 136,137 However, the overall quality of studies using tradi-tional Chinese medicine for chronic constipation is heterogenous.138 SurgeryPatients with intractable chronic constipationcaused by slow colon transit who fail pharmacolog-ical treatments may be considered for surgery. Pos-sible operations include total colectomy or partialcolectomy. A recent systematic review based oncase reports and case series concluded that suchsurgical operations can improve defecatory fre-quencies and decrease postoperative use of laxa-tives; however, there is heterogeneity in designamong the studies, resulting in variable quality ofevidence. 139For the anismus type of PFD, at least 2 RCTs have shown benets of partial division ofpuborectalis as compared with biofeedback 140or Botulinum toxin injection.140,141 Conclusions It is indeed surprising that as a common conditionfound in at least one quarter of patients, chronicconstipation is treated in a wide variety of ways,with relatively little evidence-based data, especiallyregarding dietary ber, fluids and exercise. As withany other condition, a thorough history and phys-ical examination is mandatory, with additionalblood and special tests to conrm the diagnosis ofchronic constipation and its subtypes. A practicaltriage approach is summarized in Figure 1), and thevarious evidence-based options for managingchronic constipation are listed in the order of theirlevel of recommendation in Table 1 .In summary, family physicians should look for pelvic floor dys-function as a cause of chronic constipation, which isbest treated by biofeedback. The classic triad ofincreasing dietary ber, exercise, and fluids willbenet patients with actual deciencies. The bestpharmacological treatment for chronic constipa-tion caused by slow colonic transit time is to startwith a bulk-forming senna) and nally the newer agents for severeor resistant cases (chloride channel activators or5-HT 4agonist). In recalcitrant cases, surgical treat - ment may be considered. doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2011.04.100272 Chronic Constipation 441copyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Dietary Fiber A prospective cohort of 3327 women found thathigher daily ber intake (20 g/d versus 7 g/d) sig-nicantly reduces the likelihood of self-reportedconstipation. 83However, other studies have found no such association.34,84,85Increasing daily dietary ber intake may help constipation caused by berdeciency, 34,84,86but one should not assume that ber deciency is the main or sole cause.82,87Evi- dence is Level 2C. Exercise One small, nonplacebo RCT reported that regularexercise decreases constipation as per Rome I cri-teria, 88whereas another even smaller study did not show any benet.89Two other cohort studies showed that physical activity signicantly decreasedthe self-reported symptoms in women.9,83Evi- dence is Level 2C. Fluids A 3-month, prospective study of 21 012 nursinghome residents age /H1102265 years found a link between insufcient fluid intake and constipation. 90One controlled trial showed that higher fluid intake improved chronic constipation in the presence ofa high-ber diet. 91Other than that there have been no known trials looking at the effects ofincreased fluids on chronic constipation. Evi-dence is hence 2C. Senna, Melanosis Coli, and Colon Cancer: Fact or Myth? Senna belongs to the genera of anthroquinone-containing herbal laxatives that also embrace aloe,cascara, frangula, and rhubarb. The active ingredi-ents include sennoside A and B. Melanosis coli is a brownish-black discoloration of the colonic epithe-lium found with chronic use of anthraquinone lax-atives, 168with an association of 73% to 95%.147,169 Histologically, by anthro-quinone-induced apoptosis of the colonic epithelialcells. 168,171Melanosis coli can resolve after discon - tinuation of anthraquinone laxatives.169In the last three decades, induction of aberrant crypt foci(ACF) in rat colon has been widely accepted as thepre-neoplastic lesions for modeling colorectal can-cer. 172-177Although 2 studies showed that senna promoted formation of carcinogen-induced ACF inrat colon when given at high doses, 178,179other studies failed to show any effects of senna in initi-ating ACF per se or promoting existing ACF. 180,181 In fact, one study even demonstrated a reduction ofACF in rat colon after long-term usage of senna. 182 Similar data in humans are lacking, except for onestudy that showed increased ACF after a single high dose of senna colonic lavage. 183A prospective study of 1095 patients reported an increased relative risk of3.04 for colorectal cancer as a result of anthraquinonelaxative abuse. 184Similarly, a retrospective study of 3049 patients who underwent colonoscopy revealed ahigher incidence of Melanosis coli in patients diagnosed with colonic adenomas 184(which are not necessarily malignant). However, subsequent studies failed todemonstrate an association of anthraquinone laxatives 444JABFM July-August 2011 Vol. 24 No. 4 http://www.jabfm.orgcopyright. on 13 September 2023 by guest.
