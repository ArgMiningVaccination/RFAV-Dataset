The test formulation contains the mixture of the herbal root extract ashwagandha and the minerals (zinc, magnesium, and selenium). The test formulation was divided into two parts. One part was denoted as the control without any Biofield Energy Treatment, while the other part was defined as the Biofield Energy Treated sample, which received the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely from eighteen renowned Biofield Energy Healers and defined as the Biofield Energy Treated formulation. The immunomodulatory parameters viz. humoral immune response (IgG and IgM), cellular response (CD4 /CD8 ), hematological parameters, lipid profile, hepatic enzymes, and sex hormones (progesterone and estrogen) in female Sprague Dawley rats were analyzed. The results of humoral immune response data showed decreased levels of IgG and IgM by 80.54% and 78.94% respectively, in the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation group (G3) compared with the disease control group (G2). Estimation of cellular immune response data revealed a significant (p0.01) increase in the ratio of CD4 /CD8 by 161.71% in the G3 group, while it was increased by 100.50% in the untreated test formulation group (G4) compared with the G2 group. Thus, the humoral and cellular immune responses were significantly altered in the G3 as compared with the G4 group. The TLC and neutrophils counts were significantly increased by 11.34% and 1.34% respectively, in the G3 compared with the G2 group. Lipid profile data suggested that the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation showed improvement in the tested parameters compared with the untreated test formulation group. However, significant improvement was found in the tested hepatic biomarkers i.e. decreased levels of the SGOT, SGPT, by 14.28%, 8.54%, and 20.79% in the G3 group compared with the G2 group. The levels of total protein, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and globulin were increased by 11.93%, 1.24%, 6.10%, and 20.74% respectively, in the G3 compared with the G2 group. Consequently, the levels of progesterone and estrogen were significantly increased by 199.86% and 50.19%, respectively in G3 with respect to the G2 group. In conclusion, overall data suggest that The Trivedi Effect\u00ae-Biofield Energy Healing Treatment on the herbomineral formulation can be used for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, stress management, and anti-aging by improving overall health.
