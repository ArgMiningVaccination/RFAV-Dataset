Although chiropractors largely focus on the spine, they can improve your health in ways you didn't realize. Advanced chiropractic care has many more benefits beyond the spine. It can help you heal both body and mind. The Mind and Body Connection We often think of our [mind and body](https://www.mindful.org/body-and-mind-integration/) as being separate. We feel things in our body, and we feel things in our mind. But we never understand how closely linked the two can be. There are some obvious examples that show how closely linked our body and mind are. Think about moments when you are very scared - what happens to your heart? Chances are it will start beating at a rapid rate. Similarly, if you are feeling nervous or self-conscious, you may feel an unusual and uncomfortable feeling throughout your body. That is your body reacting to your emotions. And it is not just when you are experiencing heightened emotions such as those. Throughout your day, you are feeling a certain way. For instance, some people go through days and weeks where they are feeling sad or depressed. Research has shown that feeling such negative emotions can have an impact on our bodies. Even loneliness can lead to bad habits like smoking or excessive drinking that cause damage to our bodies. It may sound insane, but being lonely and sad for years at a time will have a seriously negative impact on your health. Advanced Chiropractic Care for Mind and Body What can we do to control the link between our mind and body? The best thing that you can do is take care of both, and remember they are connected. Just because you eat healthy and you are in good shape does not mean you should ignore the negative feelings in your mind. Similarly, if you are in a good place emotionally, but you are feeling pain or something uncomfortable in your body, get it checked out.
