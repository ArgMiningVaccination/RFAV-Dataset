Lymphoma is cancer that begins in the body's lymph system. The lymph system is part of the immune system and helps the body fight infection and disease. Lymph tissue is located throughout the body, so lymphoma can begin almost anywhere. There are two main types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Hodgkin Lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma can usually be cured. With most types of Hodgkin lymphoma, abnormal white blood cells develop in the lymph nodes. These are called Reed-Sternberg cells. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Non-Hodgkin lymphoma may be either indolent (slow-growing) or aggressive (fast-growing). There are many different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that form from different types of white blood cells - B-cells, T-cells, and NK cells. The most typical type develops from B-cells. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type in adults and it is usually aggressive. Another common type is follicular lymphoma, which is usually indolent. S\u00e9zary syndrome and mycosis fungoides are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that start in white blood cells in the skin. Primary central nervous system lymphoma is rare and starts in white blood cells in the brain, spinal cord, or eye. Risk Factors There are few known direct risk factors for lymphoma. However some factors that may increase risk include: - Severely altered immune function, such as in people who receive immune suppressants to prevent organ transplant rejection. - Certain infections such as the Epstein-Barr virus. - Family history moderately increases risk. - Environmental exposures - Body weight Learn More About Lymphoma What to Expect Diagnosis Cancer treatment begins with a diagnosis. Through testing, your care team will determine your type of cancer. These test results will help us develop an individualized treatment plan for you. We understand that this phase can be very difficult as you are waiting for answers. Our goal is to move you through the diagnostic process as quickly as possible in order to minimize the emotional strain. Your Treatment Plan We offer a coordinated approach to care that varies based on your specific needs. Your case may be discussed at our weekly [Tumor Board](/ContentPage.aspx?nd=238#TumorBoard) meetings. This is a multidisciplinary team of physicians and support staff that discusses patients' care plans and makes recommendations for multiple types of cancer. After testing and consultations are complete, your oncologist/hematologist will explain to you the type, stage, and characteristics of the cancer and discuss treatment. Treatment for your cancer will depend upon the type, location, and stage of the cancer. Other factors that impact treatment decisions include your age and other health conditions. Our physicians provide the latest in treatments. When more complex treatments are necessary, we work closely with specialists across the state and nation. Treatment for lymphoma typically includes [chemotherapy](/ContentPage.aspx?nd=848) and/or [radiation](/ContentPage.aspx?nd=851). For certain types, stem cell transplant or [targeted therapies](/ContentPage.aspx?nd=236) with antibodies may also be combined with chemotherapy.
