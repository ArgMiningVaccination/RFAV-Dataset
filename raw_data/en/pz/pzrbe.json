However, ove r-vaccinating can also pos e significant health risks, including over-stimulation of the immune system resulting in allergies, recurrent skin and ear infections, immune mediated diseases (such as thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia), as well as certain kinds of cancer. \"What to vaccinate for\" and \"how often to vaccinate\" remains a controversial topic amongs t veterinarians. Many ve terinarians are now changing their protocols based upon c linical studies that show that many va ccines that were once given annua lly actually provide protection for a much longe r period of time. Pharmaceutical companies are now making va ccines that are licensed and labeled for 3 ye ar duration of immunity. Annua l revaccination is not required by l aw in Ontario, how ever compulsory rabies vaccination is gove rned by O ntario Regulation 567/ 90, w hich requires all cat or dog ow ners to ensure that their pets are immunized against rabies. Although va ccination for rabies may be compulsory, there is no requirement for annua l revaccination. Under provincial legislation, a pet is considered vaccinated against rabies if the time that has elapsed since the vaccination w as given is less than the duration of immunity as set out on the vaccine's label. To reduce the health risks of vaccinations I sugge st: Regular phys ical examinations (at least once a year) to opt imize health and m aintain balance. Suppor ting your pet's immune system using nut rition, a cupunc ture and he rbs. Individualized vaccine protocols based upon your pet's risk of expos ure, age, lifestyle, and he alth. Checking antibody* l evels (titres) annua lly and onl y vaccinating when levels are low. Using thimerisol (mercury) free vaccines wherever possible. Using adjuvant free vaccines in cats to reduce the risk of vaccine- associated sarcomas (cancer). Using 3 ye ar labeled vaccines when available. Puppy a nd ki tten core vaccines given at about 12 w eeks of age, boos ted 3-4 weeks later, and again 1 ye ar later. Vaccinating for rabies is the law and is given every 3 ye ars where possible, unless the pet has had a documented vaccine reaction. Lyme, leptospirosis, bordatella, and feline leukemia vaccines are given on a n individualized basis dependent upon s pecific risk criteria (indoor versus outdoor; family pet versus show pet; travel plans, daycare/kenneling, e tc) Vaccination for FIV is not indicated at this point in time as the vaccine is only partially effective, and there is no test that differentiates a vaccinated cat from an infected cat. Vaccination m ay increase the euthanasia rate of stray/homeless cats at shelters due to positive FIV tests in vaccinated cats. Avoid vaccinating pe ts when they are sick, as this could result in worsening of their current condition by c reating m ore stress on a n already bur dened immune system. In addition, c ertain antibiotics inactivate Bordatella vaccine, making it ineffective. Canine corona virus vaccine is not indicated at this time because studies show that many dogs that are expos ed to the virus do not develop any evidence of disease (enteritis, diarrhea), and m any infected animals have very mild clinical signs that are self-limiting and resolve on their own. *Antibodies are immune proteins that neutralize specific foreign m aterials such as viruses or bacteria in the body. T hey form part of what is called the \"Humoral\" or \"Memory\" immune system respons e. The body r etains a \"memory\" of prior expos ure to foreign m aterial so it can qui ckly neutralize it at future expos ures. There are 2 other compone nts to the body' s immune respons e, called the \"Cellular\" and \"Mucosal\" systems. Unfortunately, tests of the latter two systems are not available at present. My vaccine protocols are based upon t he individual pet's risks and comprehensive integrated examination findings, the American Animal Hospital Association's 2006 C anine Vaccine Guidelines, and the 2000 R eport of the American Association of Feline Practitioners and A cademy of Feline Medicine Advisory Panel on F eline Vaccinations.

One study f ound a dequate serum antibody t itres to last for at least 6 ye ars for feline panleukope nia virus, 4 ye ars for feline calcivirus, and 3 ye ars for feline herpesvirus. Many ve terinarians are now adjusting their vaccination pr otocols and de termining the frequency of vaccination ba sed upon e ach individual patient. When determining the frequency of vaccination, s everal things must be taken into consideration: Medical history and pr esence of disease or active allergies Antibody t itres The age of the animal Prior adverse reaction to vaccination Potential for expos ure to the disease Prior vaccination schedule Titres are tests that determine the amount of antibodies to a particular agent in the blood ( i.e. a virus such as parvovirus). This information he lps to determine an animal's immune respons e upon e xpos ure to the agent, and is used to help decide whether revaccination is required. Titres do not distinguish between immunity generated by va ccination and expos ure to the \"wild\" disease; generally the magnitude of immunity produc ed by va ccination is lower. An adequate titre is only a measurable quantity of the immune system's \"Memory\" respons e. Neither vaccination nor an adequate titre guarantees protection, which is why it is essential to ensure proper function of the immune system. Benefits of Checking Titres: May reduce the frequency of vaccination Reduces the risk of allergies, cancer, and ot her immune mediated diseases Reduces the risk of an anaphylactic reaction associated with vaccination Reduces expos ure to toxic chemicals and foreign pr oteins that are found i n some vaccines Canine Titres Include: Distemper Virus Panleukope nia Virus Calici Virus Herpes Virus Rabies Virus "}
