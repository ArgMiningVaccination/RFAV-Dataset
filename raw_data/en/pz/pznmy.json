Link live after 1:00pm 2Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for Use of Herpes Zoster Vaccines1) Recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is recommended for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications for immunocompetent adults aged 50 years . 2) RZV is recommended for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications for immunocompetent adults who previously received zoster vaccine live (ZVL ). 3) RZV is preferred over ZVL for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications. In October 2017, the ACIP made the following recommendations: Dooling et al. MMWR Jan 25, 20183CDC 2018 Herpes Zoster Policy Note recommendations serve as a supplement to the existing recommendations for the use of ZVL in immunocompetent adults aged 60 years.ACIP Recommendations & CDC Policy Note for Herpes Zoster Vaccines Herpes Zoster Disease and Epidemiology Rationale Clinical guidance for ShingrixOutline 4Background 5Herpes Zoster 6Herpes associated Treatment: antivirals reduce duration of rash and pain1 PHN Pain at least 90 days following resolution of rash Treatment: minimal or no efficacy.

This topic is will be discussed at ACIP meetings as additional data become available. 20Shingrix -Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV)Clinical Guidance For adults who previously received ZVL: No interference or safety problems when RZV vaccination administered 5 years after ZVL Consider a shorter interval if individual is >70yrs --protection from ZVL is 38% over ~3yrs Minimal interval 8 weeks -Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV)Clinical Guidance CONTRAINDICATION: Allergy: RZV should not be administered to persons with a history of severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to any component of this vaccine. PRECAUTIONS : Current herpes zoster infection : Pregnancy and breastfeeding : Vaccine (RZV)Clinical Guidance Counseling for Reactogenicity . Before vaccination, counsel about expected systemic and local reactogenicity pain (78%) myalgia (45%) fatigue (45%) Reactions to the first dose did not strongly predict reactions to the second dose vaccine recipients should be encouraged to complete the series even if they experienced a grade 1-3 reaction to the first dose. 23QUESTIONS? 24 "}
