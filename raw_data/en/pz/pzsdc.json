Safety, Efficacy, and Transparency The DoD has full confidence in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. The COVID -19 vaccines follow rigorous U.S. Food and Drug Administration safety and efficacy standards. COVID -19 vaccines were tested in large clinical trials to make sure they meet safety standards. Many people were recruited to participate in these trials to see how the vaccines offers protection to people of different ages, races, and ethnicities, as well as those with different medical conditions. Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) were granted for the COVID -19 vaccines after careful testing and trials, as required for all vaccines. The accelerated development processes for the COVID -19 vaccines followed all safety, scientific, and ethical practices.Kentucky's Adjutant General, Haldane B. Lamberton , gets his COVID -19 vaccine on 11 January at the medical detachment on Boone National Guard Center, Frankfort, Ky. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Spc.

These are normal signs that your body is building protection. At the site of injection: > Pain > Swelling Throughout your body: > Fever > Tiredness > Chills > Headache You may feel flu -like symptoms which could impact your ability to complete routine activities, but they should resolve in a few days. Currently, two of the authorized COVID -19 vaccines require two doses to complete the series. The third authorized vaccine requires a single dose. It takes time for your body to build protection after any vaccination. You are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receipt of the last dose of vaccine. If you have had a severe allergic reaction to other vaccines, ask your doctor if you should get a COVID -19 vaccine.Approved for public release; distribution unlimited.

Understand each person has the choice to receive the vaccine. Employees who do not receive the vaccine may be required to follow additional health protection measures, such as regular testing, wearing a mask, and physical testing. Understand the risks and benefits of the vaccine, both real and perceived. Encourage a discussion with a health care provider before vaccination. Know if someone currently ill with COVID -19 can be vaccinated. Know who should and should not receive the vaccine. Know dosage and vaccine series information (Source: FDA vaccine fact sheets). Explain what an EUA is and why one is issued. Reinforce that some precautions are still required by workplaces and communities for preventing COVID -19, even after vaccination. Always follow local and workplace guidance.Approved for public release; distribution unlimited. Frequently Asked Questions What is an Emergency Use Authorization? Drugs and vaccines must be authorized for use by the FDA to ensure only safe and effective products are available to the Amer ican public. During public health emergencies, when good scientific evidence exists to support that a product is safe and is likel y to treat or prevent disease, the FDA may authorize its use through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), even if definitive proof of the effectiveness of the drug or vaccine is not known. Such pre -licensure authorization is considered for the treatment or preventio n of diseases that are very serious. What are mRNA vaccines and how do they work? The Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines. They do not cause COVID -19 disease in recipients. The vaccines give our cells instructions to make a protein unique to the virus. Our immune systems recognize the protein as foreign and build immune cells to fight the virus, should one later be infected with the virus. These vaccines do not alte r the recipient's DNA. What is an adenovirus vector vaccine? Viral vector vaccines use a modified version of a different virus (in this case the adenovirus) to deliver important instruct ions to our cells. For COVID -19 viral vector vaccines, the vector ( notthe virus that causes COVID -19, but a different, harmless virus) will enter a cell in our body and then use the cell's machinery to produce a harmless piece of the virus that causes COVID -19. This piece is known as a spike protein and it is only found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID -19. This triggers our immune system to beg in producing antibodies and activating other immune cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection.Approved for public release; distribution unlimited. Frequently Asked Questions (cont'd) What kind of information is available for recipients prior to vaccine administration? Each potential COVID -19 vaccine recipient receives a vaccine -specific FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) Fact Sheet for Recipients, which provides the following information: Basic information on COVID -19 disease, symptoms, and what to discuss with a health care provider before vaccination Who should and should not receive the vaccine Recipients have the choice to receive the vaccine Dosage and vaccine series information Risks and benefits of the vaccine An explanation of what an EUA is and why it is issued Any approved available alternatives for preventing COVID -19 Additional resources How many doses of vaccine will I need? Currently, two of the authorized COVID -19 vaccines are given in a two -dose series, separated by either 21 or 28 days, depending on the product. Vaccines from different manufacturers are NOT interchangeable. The recipient must receive the same vaccine for b oth doses. The third vaccine is given in a single dose. Will the vaccine protect me from new variants of the virus? Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time. So far, studies sugg estthat antibodies generated through vaccination with currently authorized vaccines recognize these variants. This is being closely investigated and more studies are underway. Vaccine breakthrough cases are expected and occur in only a small percentage of vaccinated people. To date, no unexpected patterns have been identified in the case demographics or vaccine characteristics a mon g people with reported vaccine breakthrough infections. CDC recommends that everyone 12 years of age and older get a COVID -19 vaccine as soon as they can. Some evidence indicates that those who are vaccinated against COVID -19 have much less severe illnesses.Approved for public release; distribution unlimited. Frequently Asked Questions (cont'd) How long does protection from the vaccine last? It is currently not known how long either natural immunity or immunity from vaccination will last for SARS -CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID -19. Research and studies continue to offer more information on immunity. If I get vaccinated, do I still need to wear a mask and practice social distancing? Masks and physical distancing may still be required by workplaces and in local communities. Always follow local guidance rega rding personal protective measures such as wearing a mask, washing your hands, and practicing social distancing. Are there certain people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID -19? The risk for severe illness and death from COVID -19 increases with age, with the greatest risk among those aged 85 years or olde r. Adults of any age with the following conditions are also at increased risk of severe illness: cancer, chronic kidney disease, chroni c obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, weakened immune system, obesity, pregnancy, sickle cell disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and smokers. As COVID -19 is a new disease, currently there are limited data regarding the impact of many underlying medical conditio ns and whether they increase risk for severe disease. Talk with your provider about your individual risk factors and appropriate pre cautions. Can I get the vaccine if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding? Yes. If you are pregnant, you may choose to be vaccinated when it's available to you. Experts believe that COVID -19 vaccines are safe for a person trying to become pregnant in the short or long term. There is limited data about the safety of COVID -19 vaccines for pe ople who are pregnant or lactating because it was not studied in the vaccine trials. Trials are beginning now for pregnant and lactati ng women. The vaccine can help reduce risk to pregnant women in certain higher risk lines of work, such as healthcare. Each person needs to make an individual decision with their health care provider regarding getting the vaccine while lactating, while pregnant, or if plan ning on becoming pregnant in the near future.

People with underlying medical conditions can receive the FDA -authorized COVID -19 vaccines as long as they have not had an immediate or severe allergic reaction to a COVID -19 vaccine or to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Vaccination is an important consideration for adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions because they are at increased risk f or severe illness from COVID -19. If you have questions about getting vaccinated, talking with a healthcare provider may might help you make an informed decision. If I've had COVID -19 and recovered, should I still get the vaccine? Yes. You should be vaccinated even if you already had COVID -19. Experts do not yet know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID -19. COVID -19 is associated with severe health risks, which the vaccine protects you from. If you were treated for COVID -19 with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma, you should wait 90 days before getting a COVID -19 vaccine. Speak with your doctor if you are unsure about what treatments you received, or if you have additional questions about the COVID -19 vaccine. How do we know if the vaccine is safe? How will you monitor and track vaccine side effects? The Department of Defense (DoD) is confident in the stringent regulatory process and requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Manufacturers are required to submit raw data for the FDA to review. Safety, immune response, and efficacy data from clinical trials are submitted to the FDA before the vaccine is authorized for use and distribution. Per FD A requirements, DoD will monitor and track reports of vaccine side effects through various surveillance activities, both intern al and external to the DoD. Approved for public release; distribution unlimited. Frequently Asked Questions (cont'd) How will I be able to keep track of what vaccine I got and when I need to get a second dose? All vaccine recipients are provided a copy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \"COVID -19 Vaccination Record Card\" after receipt of the vaccine. It is recommended that the second -dose appointment be made at the time of initial vaccination, or instructions provided on procedures for follow -up. If a vaccine recipient has a smartphone, it is recommended that they take a p hoto of the vaccination record card as a \"back -up\" copy and set a calendar reminder for receipt of the second dose. Will Tricare for Life (TFL) cover the vaccine? Military MTFs will offer the COVID -19 vaccine to TFL beneficiaries when those age and risk categories are eligible for the vacci ne according to the DoD prioritization schema. As of April 19, all eligible and authorized TRICARE beneficiaries are able to mak e an appointment to receive a COVID -19 vaccine. You may choose to get the vaccine through your regular medical provider or other source (e.g., local vaccination site) when available. "}
