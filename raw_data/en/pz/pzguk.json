No cases associated with this outbreak have been identified in Philadelphia at this time. The Kentucky Department of Public Health recently confirmed a case of measles identified in an unvaccinated Kentucky resident who attended that event. Any Philadelphia residents who attended the event in Wilmore, Kentucky may have been exposed to measles and are encouraged to talk with their primary care provider about their vaccination status. Anyone who has not received their measles (MMR) vaccine or has received only their first dose should be vaccinated immediately to help prevent infection. Infants and people with certain medical conditions and pregnancy are unable to be vaccinated but can receive other medication to help prevent measles disease. According to Dr. Shara Epstein, Medical Director for the Division of Disease Control, \"Measles is a highly infectious virus that spreads through the air. Anyone who attended this revival may have been exposed. If you were at this event, please check with your primary care provider to make sure that you are fully vaccinated. If you develop symptoms of measles, please isolate yourself from others and contact your medical provider, urgent care, or emergency department to get tested. Call ahead to avoid exposing others.\" As a highly contagious respiratory virus that is spread through the air, early symptoms of measles are typical of many upper respiratory illnesses\u2014fever, cough, conjunctivitis (Pink Eye), and runny nose\u2014turning into a characteristic rash three to five days after symptoms begin. In the United States, the first dose of measles vaccine is routinely administered in combination with mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) to children at age 12 months through 15 months. A second MMR dose is routinely administered at age 4 through 6 years. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles if exposed to the virus.
