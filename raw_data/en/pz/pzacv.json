Overview Does your dog need supplements to stay healthy? Chances are, your dog's food provides them with all the nutrients they need. In fact, if your furry best friend doesn't have any medical conditions or specific health considerations, they may not need any help from supplements. But there are some instances in which your pup could benefit from supplemental sources of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. If you're curious about whether vitamins and supplements could help support your dog's health, be sure to consult with your veterinarian. Learn more about vitamins and supplements for dogs and their potential benefits. Does My Dog Need Supplements? Well, the answer to this question is: it depends. Like we said before, if your dog has a clean bill of health, a nutritionally complete diet, and you don't have any concerns, they may not benefit from additional vitamins or supplements. However, supplements can provide some benefits to dogs who are lacking in one area or another. For example, if your dog is a picky eater, is recovering from an illness, is pregnant or nursing puppies, or has certain diseases or skin problems, ask your vet whether a nutritional supplement might be useful. Just like with humans, not all dogs have the same nutritional needs or medical ailments. Additionally, there are many factors that can affect their need for supplements, such as age, size, breed, medical conditions and diet. What Are Some Benefits of Supplements for Dogs?
