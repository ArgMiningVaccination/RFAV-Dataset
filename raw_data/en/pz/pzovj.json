Does it mean not having aches and pains? Does it mean not taking medications? Does it mean that whatever you have \"going on\" isn't serious enough to do something about, because you can \"live with it?\" In homeopathy, health is defined as a state of freedom. This freedom means that you are not only feeling well physically, it means that underneath it all, there is harmony and balance. This harmony radiates from all parts of you: physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and energetically. The most wonderful thing about natural health is that it honors each person as an individual and seeks to provide this freedom for each person by using that which is available to us in nature in order to achieve that harmony. One of my favorite aspects of naturopathy is that it respects that you are in charge of and responsible for your own health. You have the power to claim a state of ease or the power to refuse a state of dis- ease. You can actually do this for yourself, and it doesn't mean turning to outside authorities to make decisions for you or spending large sums of money in order to do it. Now , the key word is responsible; this can be daunting to some people, because this means that you have to listen to your body and your inner voice, make decisions that are in your best interest, and take action in implementing changes and activities to su pport those decisions. Yet, once you achieve your goals and are living the life you've always desired, then you, alone, can take c redit for your amazing transformation. And really, no one else can \"cure you\" or \"make you healthy;\" your health really is your responsibility. Though at times we may not want to admit it, isn't this the freedom for which we are longing? In that spirit, this edition of the NITE Light is filled with simple practices and remedies that you can use at home to address those areas that have lost their balance. Education is empowerment. The more you learn about how to use natural health at home to help yourself, the more you wield your power: you begin to listen to your body more, trust your own instinct more, and as a result, your own good health grows stronger. You free yourself. Then, when you live in your state of freedom, you start to free others, too. Your family members and friends will witness your vitality, and they will become interested in finding out how to accomplish this for themselves. I hope you enjoy this issue and find inspiration that can enrich your life daily. Let's all be free. Amy Jo Howard, ND Nature's Sunshine Products Anxiousless Distress Remedy Refuge Essential Oil 10% off October & November 3 Viral hepatitis infections are the most common cause for liver disease. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, hepatitis is a viral infection that causes liver inflammation which can ultimately result in liver damage. Hepatitis occurs in several different forms including A, B, C, D, & E. Hepatitis A & E infections can occur from contact with an infected person's stool or contact through food or water that has been contaminated; these infections are typically acute or short in duration. Meanwhile, Hepatitis B, C, & D are spread through coming into direct contact with an infected person's blood or other body fluids; these infections are typically chronic and can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, liver failure, and liver cancer (2017). The best way to avoid infection is to exercise good hygiene practices and stay away from locations where hygiene isn't regulated. The risks for infections increase for those traveling overseas to countries where sanitation levels are subpar. Also, the risk increases for those who have been acutely exposed to bodily fluids, human waste, or contaminated foods. Direct exposure to those infected with hepatitis creates the most concern for those suspecting an infection. Standard medical procedures recommend hepatitis vaccines to help prevent the spread of infections. However, because the vaccines contain a high amount of their own toxins and risks factors, looking to a more natural means of prevention is necessary. One way to do this is through nontoxic homeopathic prophylaxis; these work like vaccines except without the toxic burdens on the body. Additionally, these homeopathics can be taken as antidotes if one has also already contracted the virus. Natural treatments for hepatitis can depend on the type of hepatitis presented. Hepatitis A & E are considered acute viruses and typically, are resolved by the body's immune system within 4-6 weeks. During this process, the immune system can be bolstered in order to speed up the recovery. The first thing is to reduce inflammation by supplementing with high doses of Vitamin C, Lecithin and Milk Thistle; these help protect the liver during the infection phase. Secondly, a rotation of antiviral herbs including Yarrow, Una De Gato, VS -C, Olive Leaf Extract, and Morinda helps assist in removal of the viruses. Over the next couple weeks, the recovering person should spend time resting and focusing on eating lots of vegetables, healthy fats, and non-processed foods; this allows the body to focus on the healing process rather than adaptation to other external stressors. Chronic hepatitis infections that occur from Hepatitis B, C, & D more commonly can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer. Typically, the body does not recognize these viruses as easily, and so, the process of removal may need to be assisted through antiviral treatments medically. However, there are cases where recipients do not respond to these treatments, and in these instances, research shows that those who do not respond to standard medical treatments for the viruses actually respond once supplemented with Vitamin D (Petta, et al. 2009). Evidence suggests that Vitamin D levels play an important role in the ability for the body to fight off these viruses. Additionally, research also shows that B12 supplementation is helpful for the body dealing with these chronic types of infections as well (Rattue 2012). As with the acute versions of the virus, controlling inflammation levels is key, using high doses of Vitamin C, Lecithin, Colostrum, CoQ10, and Milk Thistle. These will help prevent liver damage during the infection phase of the disease. Additionally, research shows that there is a link between developing liver cancer as a result of the virus and low levels of selenium (Ming- Whei Yu et al. 1999). So, adding in therapeutic doses of selenium to the healing process can be helpful in preventing damage to the liver cells as well. It is important that the body gets plenty of rest and healing and nutritious, non-processed foods during this time. Consult with a Naturopath for specific personalized healing plans in the case of these types of hepatitis. Hepatitis Natural Solutions Common Concerns and Natural Health Protocols 4 The Herbal Rub The Peppermint, Capsicum, Lobelia rub therapy is a relaxing and healing therapy for the muscles, tendons, and ligaments. This therapy uses a combination of essential oils and herbal tinctures topically along the spine in conjunction with specific massage techniques and thermo -hydrotherapy. The therapy works to loosen the pelvic and spinal muscles allowing the spine back to come into alignment; additionally, it reduces inflammation, muscle spasms, and promotes relaxation. What to Expect? To start, the recipient will lie face- down on a massage table. Four drops of Peppermint essential oil will be applied alongside the spine from the base of the head, down the spine, to the sacrum (low back). This will open up the pores and warm the area, which will help loosen the muscles. Next, 15 drops of lobelia extract will be applied along the same regions; this will help relax the muscles and reduce any spasms. Lastly, 10 drops of capsicum liquid herb will be applied along these regions in order to promote circulation and warmth to the tissues. The herbs will be worked into the tissues with light pressure first and then, increased to deeper pressure, the therapist making circular motions along the spine. Long sweeping strokes will be applied from head to sacrum to help the flow of circulation. A muscle pain relief technique called trigger point therapy will be applied to the muscles along the spine to release any hypertonic muscles. The connective tissue around the sacroiliac joint (low back area) will be released using a light pressure myofascial release technique. At this point, a hot towel will be applied over the back region if the recipient is okay with the heat. Then, a dry towel maintains warmth. The muscles of the upper leg will be warmed up with massage, and mild isometric stretching will be applied to balance the pelvic muscles. The recipient will be asked to roll onto their back, so the therapist can work the front muscles of the leg and continue with the stretches. Muscles of the abdominal region are considered antagonists to the muscles along the spine. The therapist will work this tissue using myofascial release techniques or trigger point therapy. The herbal rub therapy is safe for most everyone! It can also be repeated at home with just the 3 key ingredients applied to the spine, knee, shoulders, etc. with the wet towel being a key to penetration and muscle comfort. Warts Warts are a result of a virus in the body. There are some key natural remedies used to get rid of warts that also deal with the underlying cause of the virus. First, VS-C; this is a Chinese herbal blend from Nature's Sunshine that was formulated specifically to resolve chronic viral disorders. Second, choose a homeopathic remedy: Antimonium crudum or Thuja occidentalis. The combination of the VS-C with one of these homeopathic remedies has been very successful in ridding the body of warts, even in cases that have been stubborn or long- standing. Take both of the above and apply Tea Tree Oil or Purification Oil until all the warts have disappeared. Hot Flashes: News Bulletin from the Liver Many people think that hot flashes are \"normal,\" relating to menopause and changing hormones. However, hot flashes are a sign from your liver that things are out of balance. The liver is the largest internal organ, and when it is overworked or under stress, it generates a lot of heat in order to process hormones and perform its other functions. So, you get hot, and then, you sweat in an attempt to cool your overheated body and allow for the release of built up toxins. To make your liver happy, squeeze fresh lemon juice into your drinking water. Eat beets. Choose a supplement to support the liver; Nature's Sunshine has Liver Cleanse Formula, LIV -J, Chinese Liver Balance, and Milk Thistle Combination. They also make a blend called FlashEase that helps with hormone balance in addition to assisting the liver. Allergies are a Gut Issue Any type of allergies, whether food or environmental related, actually begins due to an imbalance in the intestinal lining. Have you heard of leaky gut? This is when the lining of the intestines becomes irritated, inflamed, and permeable and allows substances to pass through the lining into the bloodstream. These substances then trigger an \"allergic response\" by the immune system and become an allergen. So, the best way to heal your allergies is to heal your gut. Here are some steps: drink pure water, eat real foods, eat organic foods, avoid processed foods, avoid using a microwave, consume bone broth, take probiotics, and Liquid Restore (a supplement made specifically to heal and restore the gut lining). In addition, a very popular remedy called Protease Plus greatly reduces allergies by breaking down the very protein poison of each individual allergen. 45 Incontinence Loss of bladder control, or urinary incontinence, is a con- cern for many. There are different types of urinary incon- tinence, including stress incontinence, urge incontinence, overflow incontinence, functional incontinence, and a mix of types. First of all, consider Uva Ursi. This is an herb that helps to strengthen and tone the bladder and urinary system. Next, start incorporating Kegel exercises into your daily routine and/or Yoni eggs (see the Vaginal Dryness article for more information on Yoni eggs). Also, consider CranioSacral therapy. This is a light touch bodywork therapy that works with the alignment of the spine. It encourages the proper flow and nourish-ment of the nerves that feed into the spine including the nerves that nourish the bladder and other pelvic organs. (So, tension or misalignments of the low back can affect the bladder and lead to incontinence.) We also offer an essential oil blend called Uttati Urinary Blend to be placed on the sacrum. Toe Fungus is More than Fungus Toenail fungus is a common issue that is more than what meets the eye. This unsightly condition is another way that the body indicates that there is a more serious issue. There are several possible root causes for toenail fungus, the most common being an imbalance in gut health. Other possibilities include thyroid health or lowered immunity; it may be wise to see a natural health practitioner to confirm the root cause. Toenail fungus can be spread easily and thrives in a moist and warm environment. It is wise to keep the feet clean, treat all toes on both feet, and expose feet to open air. Gut health is the first area to work. Digestive enzymes such as Proactazyme by Nature's Sunshine and a multiple strain probiotic are very important. Living Streams Multi-Blend is unique in the fact that it is a liquid probiotic designed to both take internally and apply externally. Topical application is essential when it comes to working with toenail fungus. A foot soak with apple cider vinegar works wonders at ridding the body of the infection. The essential oil Tea Tree is popularly known to aid in the healing process with toenail fungus. Remember, the fungus did not develop overnight. This is an expression from the body of an imbalance of health that is possibly years in the making. Patience will pay off, and your body will thank you for it! Vaginal Dryness This can result due to a number of reasons. One way to increase natural lubrication and balance estrogen levels is by doing a Yoni egg practice. Yoni eggs are egg-shaped polished stones, usually made from jade, onyx, or quartz, that you self insert temporarily into the vagina to stimulate the bartolin glands that are responsible for producing natural lubrication. Yoni eggs are also beneficial for strengthening the pelvic floor muscles to help with incontinence, to prevent prolapse, and more. From a nutritional standpoint, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Maca, and probiotics can also be beneficial. Peppermint oil on the low back (sacrum) area can also stimulate lubrication; just don't get it on any soft tissue area! The Power of Massage for Acid Reflux According to Mayo Clinic, more than 3 million people a year are diagnosed with hiatal hernias, or stomach hernias. A hiatal hernia is a condition where the stomach pushes up through the esophageal opening in the diaphragm muscle and can lead to abdominal pain, nausea, and acid reflux. Are you one of the 3 million people that suffer from this discomfort on a weekly or even daily basis? An easy, non-invasive step to help address these symptoms may be to ask your Massage Therapist to implement abdominal massage into your bodywork sessions. The protocol for \"pulling down the stomach,\" is... basically, what it sounds like. As a client getting bodywork, you would start by lying face up on the table. Your therapist would then present you with a towel or sheet to cover the chest, while they pull down the sheet to a few inches below the navel. The therapist will apply lotion and work the entire abdominal area to release tension from the muscles and then work up to the stomach. Using the tips of the fingers, pressure will be applied inward toward the spine to try and \"grip\" the stomach. A slow, downward motion, as in pulling towards the feet, is then applied to bring the stomach to its normal resting spot. This protocol will help release the stomach from pressing upwards into the esophagus, reducing the prospect of acid reflux. Abdominal massage may be the path to help relieve stomach complaints and acid reflux. It's easy, simple, and can be incorporated into your regular massage or be the focus of your entire session. Whether you are new to massage or a regular client, ask your therapist to guide you. Improvement is felt after just one session! 56 Cell Salt Chart Cell salt Main focus Emotional symptoms Other physical symptoms #1 Calc Fluor Calcium Fluoride June 22 - July 22 Bones, teeth, muscles, ligaments, and veins Indecisiveness, low self - esteem Poor tooth enamel, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, carpal tunnel, any tissue that is too weak and needs strength #2 Calc Phos Calcium Phosphate Dec. 22 - Jan. 21 Bones, teeth, and muscles Lack of motivation, mental weakness, discontent, and restless Structural stress, tooth formation, headaches, growing pains, repair for bones, wounds #3 Calc Sulph Calcium Sulphate Oct. 24 - Nov. 22 Blood, mucus membranes, and skin Fatigue, nervousness, nerve sensitivities Sinus congestion, coughs, sore throat, skin eruptions, reproductive weakness. #4 Ferrum Phos Iron Phosphate Feb. 20 - Mar. 20 Blood, Cell Oxygen Stimulation and overheating following dullness Anemia, blood loss, inflammation, first stage of cold or cough, nose bleeds. #5 Kali Mur Potassium Chloride May 21 - Jun. 21 Blood, muscles, saliva, and mucus membranes Irritability, apathy, sluggishness White coated tongue, swollen glands, blisters, stuffy heads, earaches, lung/ear complaints #6 Kali Phos Potassium Phos.

Along with phys- ical and emotional ailments, the cell salts can also be determined by the date of birth and 2 months following. 677 Castor oil, made from the castor bean, is great to have on hand for at -home remedies. Rich with fatty acids, flavonoids, phytosterols, amino acids, and other compounds, it has been noted as having many beneficial properties, including being: anti- inflammatory, anti -microbial, liver protective, lymphatic system supporting, an antioxidant, and more. One of the best ways to use castor oil is to use it topically as a \"pack\" to draw out toxins and other impurities, encouragin g the body to release them from where they have stagnated and to move them through the lymphatic system and even pull them out through the skin. To do a castor oil pack, heat the castor oil so that it is warm (but not super hot, otherwise it will burn your skin). Use a flannel or cotton cloth (one that you don't mind if it gets stained) to soak up the castor oil. Appl y the castor oil over the body area on which you want to focus (for example: liver, intestines, kidneys, or knee, etc.). You may also apply plastic wrap and/or a heating pad over the top of it to drive the oil deeper into the body. Leave on the body for 20 -45 minutes. The frequency with which you do this will vary depending on your area of focus. Do keep in mind that the castor oil will stain other clothing with which it may come in contact. This is especially great for liver and digestive concerns and even inflamed joints!

A Voice Analysis session analyzes the frequency patterns in your voice to reveal which tones are showing \"high\" or \"low\" on your personal print. A \"high\" tone indicates a note that is stressed, and the corresponding areas of the body are stressed and overworking. A \"low\" tone indicates a note that is weak, and the corresponding areas of the body are weak and functioning below their ability. Once you have a Voice Analysis session and see where your tones are, then you can use Sound Therapy and Color Therapy to bring these areas of the body back into balance. Listening to certain sounds, as indicated from your analysis, enables your frequency patterns to harmonize and restore balance to those areas of the body that were overworking or weak. Additionally, you can also receive Color Therapy by lying and relaxing under certain color lights to achieve a similar effect or to enhance the work of the Sound Therapy. Schedule your Voice Analysis session for only $36 and discover your personal frequency print!

Fluid Retention Nat Mur Tissue Salt Fluid retention is a sign that the body is having trouble with eliminating water. This can be caused from an imbalance of the electrolytes present in the extracellular fluid, which aid in the exchange of water between cells and maintain a fluid balance in the process. Nat Mur is a Homeopathic Tissue Salt of Sodium Chloride that helps keep the amount of fluid inside and outside of our cells in balance. You can simply dissolve 4 pellets under the tongue up to 4 times a day to aid in the balancing process. Nature's Sunshine Lymphatic Drainage This liquid blend of herbs affects the cardiac system, kidneys, and the lymphatic system. It helps eliminate excess fluid by stimulating lymphatic drainage and clears toxins from tissue spaces. You can take \u00bc teaspoon in water twice daily. Is this a Chronic Condition? Does it seem like you have tried everything and the fluid just isn't coming off? This can be an indication of a chronic heart and/or kidney condition. Also, sometimes, parasites within the blood and lymph system can cause obstruction of the flow of fluids. Partner with your Naturopathic Doctor to formulate a protocol which consists of the appropriate therapy and modalities to aid in the healing process. 5.

In a nutshell, this can desensitize the receptors and result in the burn out of your dopamine stores! This process is then followed by the pituitary gland releasing hormones that signal the adrenal glands to produce adrenaline which can make us stuck in the fight or flight response. When we are stuck in this response on a long term basis, this causes adrenal exhaustion. Long story short, coffee consumption can eventually lead to sleeping problems, thyroid and adrenal imbalances, depression, and fatigue. 9.

Gallbladder and Liver Flush - Use common sense and precaution for pre -existing conditions This is a fast that some people use to flush the liver and gallbladder. It can work for stones as well\u2014the hydrangea and malic acid (from the apple juice) soften hardened bile and stones! What you will need: Instructions: Fast for 2 days, consuming apple juice plus 1/2 your body weight in ounces of water w/ lemon each day. (Consider taking 3 caps, 3x a day of Hydrangea for 2 weeks before and during the flush and Gall Bladder Formula at 1 cap 3x a day for 2 weeks before and during the flush.) At the end of the 2nd day, before bed, blend together 1/2 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup lemon juice. Drink, then immediately get into bed, pull your knees to your chest, and lie on your right side. The oil stimulates a large release of bile; the lemon juice softens bile. Within hours, a sudden urge to evacuate the bowels may occur. Foul liquid and stones will mostly likely be in your toilet!
