Kotecha, however, clarified that in addition to the recommended medicines, general and physical measures are to be followed. Gargling is recommended with warm water added with a pinch of turmeric and salt. It also suggests applying medicated oils (anu taila or shadbindu taila) in nasal passage and performing steam inhalation with ajwain or eucalyptus oil. Also recommended are six to eight hours of sleep and moderate physical exercise. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted that the \"upgradation of protocols\" has been done in sync with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been endorsing the traditional ways to boost the immune system. In his address to the nation in April, Modi had directed people to follow the guidelines issued by [the Ayush ministry](/topic/the-ayush-ministry)to avoid contracting Covid-19. \"Drink hot water and kadha frequently,\" he had said. Earlier, too, the PM had suggested that people should follow the protocol of the ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy to fight Covid-19. In his interaction with Ayush practitioners through video link on March 28, he had suggested that those who produce traditional medicines could be asked to manufacture essential items such as sanitisers. The Ayush ministry had subsequently issued a notification on March 31 asking all Ayush practitioners and institutions to submit their inputs. It said the proposal will be reviewed by a task force comprising representatives from the biotechnology department, CSIR and Ayush practitioners.
