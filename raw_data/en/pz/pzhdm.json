Individual herbs, specifically prescribed for a particular situation may assist the body to come back into balance, thereby allowing a healthy homeostasis to be reinstated as nature intended. The herbalist looks to the whole person, their values and attitudes as well as their circumstances and physical condition along with other aspects of their individuality. This is in marked contrast to the allopathic medicine approach. Below you will find an example of selected herbs for a particular condition. Herbal support can take a variety of forms and combinations, so it is vital that each person consult directly with a qualified holistic practitioner to gain the full benefit of immunity and health building support. Gastro Intestinal Tract (GIT) health depends on all the organs supporting the digestive system performing in harmony and the gut itself functioning calmly and moving food along through the various stages of digestion until it is converted into a normal stool in the descending colon and discharged. Stress induced cramps in the system generally, and the duodenum in particular, can ultimately produce Duodenal Ulcers if the habit becomes deeply entrenched, and the liver at the same time is producing too much bile. This is because an interruption in peristaltic movement in the duodenum will allow the excess bile to attack its mucosal lining. Bile is a strong chemical substance that is alkaline, which is really the opposite to acid and it is secreted by the Gall Bladder to break down fatty substances so they may be digested. The emotional profile of a patient suffering from duodenal ulcers is a person who has too much fatty food, who eats as a response to stress, and who is often resentful or bitter about certain of their life circumstances or the actions of others (The 'billious' disposition). These sorts of emotions can overstimulate the liver and result in excess bile production. Some of those folk who have had serious gall bladder problems like stones forming and creating a blockage resulting in Gall Attacks will have had their gall bladders taken out. This means that instead of bile being stored and only provided to the duodenum when required by the presence of fatty food, it is leaking continuously into the duodenum and constantly irritating it. Most folk suffering from duodenal ulcers will already have worked out that fatty food aggravates the problem and will have reduced fat intake. They may however not have realised that milk or chocolate for example, are extremely fatty foods or that the cheese on pizza make them amongst the highest fat meals it is possible to have. Caffeine drinks, Coke and Coffee primarily, are responsible for a stimulation which can result in worsening this GIT cramping response in adults and should second group of foods removed from the diet of someone suffering from duodenal ulcers. My herbal treatment involves two recommendations. Firstly, a course of Slippery Elm Bark Powder. One dessertspoon daily mixed into a paste with cold Chamomile Tea and taken for a continuous period of 12 weeks. Slippery Elm provides a protective lining to the mucosal lining of the gastro intestinal system, and in 12 weeks will completely heal any ulceration of the duodenum. Secondly, a herbal mixture to support the healing is made up from the following ingredients: Agrimony, Chamomile, Dandelion, Gentian, Rue and Uva Ursi with the Bach Flower Remedies Willow, Vine. This mix is taken at a dose rate of 20 drops three times daily followed by a cup of Dandelion Tea. The treatment must be maintained initially for at least 3 months and most folk find that when they have finished with the Slippery Elm they generally benefit further from maintaining the herbal tonic as a supplement for longer particularly if they have had their gall bladder removed.
