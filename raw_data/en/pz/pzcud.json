Shank Papers, Bernard Becker Medical Library Archives, Washington University School of Medicine. Identifier: FC034-S04-B017-F06 EXCLUSIVE Why AHA recommends low cholesterol diets American Heart Association president cites research which he says justifies his organization's recommendation to limit your cholesterol intake. He explains why AHA has dubbed the \"no scientific evidence\" NCEN ads as \"incorrect and misleading.\" By Dr. Richard S. Ross AHA president THE NATIONAL COMMISSION on Egg Nutrition has placed adver\u00ac tisements which state: \"There is absolutely no scientific evidence whatsoever that eating eggs in any way increases the risk of heart attack.\" The American Heart As\u00ac sociation believes this statement to be incorrect and misleading in the light of current scientific thought and data. The evidence, based chiefly on a vast body of population studies, shows that the incidence of heart attack increases with blood levels of cholesterol; and that diets high in saturated fats and cholesterol tend to increase the blood levels of cholesterol. Moreover, several preliminary studies strongly sug\u00ac gest that reducing the blood cho\u00ac lesterol will decrease the incidence of coronary disease. The AHA recommends for the general public a diet moderately restricted in saturated fats and cholesterol. That means a well-bal\u00ac anced nutritious diet including limited amounts of meat, dairy products and eggs. Such limita\u00ac tions are prescribed because these foods are the chief sources of cho\u00ac lesterol and saturated fats in the diet. The egg yolk is one of the most concentrated sources of choles\u00ac terol in the diet. One yolk con\u00ac tains approximately 85% of the cholesterol recommended as the maximum total daily intake for the American public\u2014namely 300 milligrams. (The yolk of a large egg contains 275 milligrams). Before we get to a description of the studies which implicate cho\u00ac lesterol in heart disease, we ought to stress that no one is suggesting that cholesterol is the only risk factor associated with a high incidence of heart disease. Other factors\u2014particularly high blood pressure and cigarette smoking \u2014 have been shown to make independent and significant contributions to risk. But there is little question that cholesterol in and of itself has a very strong, positive association with the development of prema\u00ac ture coronary disease. First, evidence linking dietary and serum cholesterol and lipids to coronary risk: Serum cholesterol levels above 200 (milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood) are rarely found in animals excent for man in affluent societies. In the United States on the other hand, the aver\u00ac age serum cholesterol levels for man aged 50-59 is 240. Thus, the average level of serum cholesterol found in the U. S. population may not be the ideal level for man. It is important to distinguish be\u00ac tween average and normal. They may not be the same. The cholesterol in the blood comes from two sources: some is manufactured in the body and some is taken in the food. Cho\u00ac lesterol is a normal component of bile acids and some hormones and is therefore essential for certain body processes, but the amount the body manufactures is suf\u00ac ficient for these purposes. Since the 1940's numerous studies have shown that popula\u00ac tions consuming diets high in saturated fats and cholesterol have a high mean serum cholesterol level and a high mortality from premature coronary heart dis\u00ac ease. By the same token, human populations consuming diets low in cholesterol and saturated fats have low mean cholesterol levels and a low incidence of heart dis\u00ac ease mortality. Additionally, within any one population group, the risk of de\u00ac veloping premature coronary heart disease increases as serum cholesterol levels rise \u2014 a fact thoroughly substantiated for the American male population in sev\u00ac eral large-scale long-term pros\u00ac pective epidemiologic studies. The studies also show that there is no cholesterol safety cut-off point: the relationship between cholesterol levels and the extent of arterial disease is continuous. With increasing cholesterol con\u00ac centration, risk is increased. There is no evidence of a level which separates high from low risk. Now to some of these specific epidemiologic studies: The Framingham (Mass.) Study began in 1949 has been fol\u00ac lowing some 5,200 randomly se\u00ac lected adults aged 30 to 59 who were free of disease when the Heart attack incidence increases with your blood cholesterol level study started. According to a re\u00ac cent communication from the Framingham researcher, published in 1972, the rate of development of coronary attacks was strikingly related to the level of blood lipids (fatty substances). However, of the various blood fats, none proved more potent as a precursor of coronary disease than cholesterol. Serum choles\u00ac terol levels in the Framingham population ranged from 180 to 300, with an average of about 225. The average value of those who developed coronary attacks was 245. An optimum value for adults, the Framingham scientists say, would appear to be the lowest value achievable without inducing illness\u2014certainly below 200. This is based upon the concept that average is not necessarily normal; the average in the U. S. may be abnormally high. To get some handle on how much cholesterol levels increase risk, the Framingham data shows that a man with a blood choles\u00ac terol level of 250 or above has about three times the risk of a heart attack of a man with choles\u00ac terol below 194. The Los Angeles Heart Study, involving 1,859 randomly chosen males (median age-47) followed since 1949, showed that the in\u00ac creased risk of heart attack or sudden death was primarily as sociated with higher cholesterol levels. The heart attack risk for white males was 44.3 per 1,000 at cholesterol levels of less than 210, increasing to 67/1,000 at 210-269 and 97.9/1,000 at 270-389. The results of the National Cooperative Pooling Project (in which data from several prospec\u00ac tive studies\u2014including Framing\u00ac ham, Los Angeles, Albany Civil servants, Chicago Western Elec\u00ac tric Company employees and Min- neapolis-St. Paul businessmen, was put together) indicates that the risk of developing premature heart disease \u2014 including sudden death and all fatal heart attacks\u2014 increases as serum cholesterol levels increase. The International Atheros\u00ac clerosis Project measured the de\u00ac gree of atherosclerosis of the aorta and coronary arteries at autopsy in over 31,000 persons aged 10 to 69 who died during 1960-1965 in 15 cities throughout the world. Populations in coun\u00ac tries with a high intake of satu\u00ac rated fats and serum cholesterol levels had more severe atheros\u00ac clerotic lesions than did popula\u00ac tions in countries with low satu\u00ac rated fat intake and low serum cholesterol. The U. S., with the highest such intake among the populations considered, showed the highest degree of atheros\u00ac clerotic involvement. Mortality statistics developed by the World Health Organization for 22 developed countries showed sizable differences which correlate with differences in nutritional fac\u00ac tors, including cholesterol. Studies of migrants (for ex\u00ac ample, Japanese and Neapolitans) to the United States from areas with low coronary heart disease death rates show them to have higher serum lipids and choles- About the author DR. RICHARD STARR ROSS, presi\u00ac dent of the American Heart Associa\u00ac tion, is presently physician to The John Hopkins Hospital, director of the cardiovascular division of the de\u00ac partment of medicine, and director of the myocardial infarction research unit. He was born in Richmond, IN, in 1924 and received his M.D. degree cum laude from the Harvard Medical School in Boston in 1947. He com\u00ac pleted internship and medical resi\u00ac dency on the Osier Medical Service of The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, MD. In 1952 he was a re\u00ac search fellow in physiology at the Harvard Medical School. He returned to Johns Hopkins in 1953 and a year later began teaching there. Dr. Ross was promoted to Professor of Medi\u00ac cine in 1965 and named Clayton Pro\u00ac fessor of Cardiovascular Disease in 1969. He has broad and deep interest in Dr. Richard Starr Ross many areas of cardiology, particularly in the field of coronary cineangio\u00ac graphy, myocardial blood flow, and myocardial performance as affected by coronary artery disease. The meth\u00ac od of measuring myocardial blood flow with radioactive gas injected selectively into the coronary arteries was developed at Hopkins under Dr. Ross's direction. Dr. Ross is author and co-author of over 100 articles for medical journals and textbooks concerned with var\u00ac ious aspects of cardiovascular physi\u00ac ology and disease. He is a member of the major national professional and academic societies and has been ac tive in the American Heart Associa\u00ac tion since 1956. He has been on the Board of Directors and on the Cen\u00ac tral Commmittee, AHA's top medical committee. He served as Chairman of AHA's Scientific Sessions Program Committee from 1965 to 1967 and of AHA's Publications Committee. It is prudent to follow a diet aimed at lowering cholesterol levels terol levels and higher coronary death rates than their stay-at- home counterparts. An international study of 18 population samples in seven coun\u00ac tries (Finland, Greece, Italy, Jap\u00ac an, Netherlands, Yugoslavia and the U. S.) and involving 12,000 men originally aged 40-59 who have been followed for more than 10 years now revealed marked differences in the coronary dis\u00ac ease incidence and mortality rates among the different groups. The highest incidence was re\u00ac corded for men from Eastern Fin\u00ac land and the U. S.\u2014over 120 and 80 per 1,000 men, respectively. By comparison, the rates were 20 per 1,000 or less for men in Corfu, Crete, Dalmatia and Japan. The differences were significantly re\u00ac lated to saturated fat intake and serum cholesterol levels. Studies using angiography (X-Ray films of the coronary ves\u00ac sels) have shown a clear associa\u00ac tion between serum cholesterol levels and coronary disease. Mid\u00ac dle-aged patients with consider\u00ac able narrowing of the coronary ar\u00ac teries had levels of serum choles\u00ac terol and other lipids significantly higher than those of patients with\u00ac out narrowing. Experimental animal data provides additional support: a large number of studies in a wide variety of animals show that ar\u00ac terial lesions cannot arise in ani\u00ac mals without a substantial modi\u00ac fication of diet involving an in\u00ac creased intake of fat in the diet which in turn leads to an elevation of the levels of cholesterol and fat in the blood. Recently, Dr. Robert Wissler and colleagues at the University of Chicago performed the same tests in primates. They fed diets resem\u00ac bling the usual American diet to Rhesus monkeys and found arte\u00ac rial lesions similar to atherosclero\u00ac sis seen in man. There was a close correlation between serum choles\u00ac terol levels and the severity of the lesions. And in still another study, Dr. M. L. Armstrong and colleagues reported in 1970 that feeding Rhe\u00ac sus monkeys a diet rich in choles\u00ac terol increases serum cholesterol and causes arterial lesions to ap\u00ac pear. So much for the compelling evi\u00ac dence linking cholesterol to heart attack risk. But this raises the question of whether altering the diet to reduce cholesterol levels can help diminish the shocking toll from heart attack (which now takes on the order of 1 million new cases and over 650.000 deaths in the U. S. annually). Here, too, there is encouraging evidence to suggest that the cholesterol-re\u00ac ducing dietary modifications can help. To wit: Studies in Rhesus monkeys who were returned to diets low in cholesterol (after high cholesterol feeding) produced a decrease in serum cholesterol levels and a concomitant decrease in the size of atherosclerotic lesions. Three experimental clinical studies have been conducted\u2014in Los Angeles, Helsinki and New York\u2014to see if modification in the diet, particularly reduction in satu\u00ac rated fat and cholesterol, would have any bearing on heart dis\u00ac ease incidence. All told, several hundred men have reported a sizable decrease in the incidence of new coronary events in the experimental (i.e., diet-modified group) vs. controls (those who continued to eat the same diet). Both the Los Angeles and Helsinki studies also reported a reduction in coronary mortality rates in the new-diet groups. Admittedly, these studies are not conclusive as to the preven\u00ac tive aspects of the dietary change. Each dealt with relatively small numbers, but the findings hold out a strong potential coronary dis\u00ac ease prevention through dietary modification. The potential for prevention has been suggested in a report by the Inter-Society Commission for Heart Disease Resources (ICHD), a federally-supported agency es\u00ac tablished to create guidelines for optimal medical resources for the prevention and treatment of car\u00ac diovascular diseases. In a report published in April, 1972, titled, \"Primary Prevention of Atherosclerotic Diseases,\" it was suggested that reducing serum cholesterol, say 5% in the U. S. population, would yield a 12% decrease in coronary disease inci\u00ac dence, while a 10% reduction in serum cholesterol would result in a 24.4% decrease in coronary in\u00ac cidence. In conclusion, we are dealing with a disease which accounts for over one-third of all deaths in this country. More than one-quarter of these occur in persons under age 65. The evidence presented shows that an elevated cholesterol level is associated with an increased probability of death from coronary disease. Current data indicate that the average American has higher than desirable levels of blood choles\u00ac terol and consumes excessive calories, saturated fat and choles\u00ac terol. For most individuals, this can be altered in a safe and prac\u00ac tical manner by diet modification. The AHA believes that it is pru\u00ac dent for the American people to follow a diet aimed at lowering serum cholesterol levels. They are joined by the Task Force on Ar\u00ac teriosclerosis of the National Heart and Lung Institute, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council, the Council on Food and Nutrition of the Ameri\u00ac can Medical Association, and the Inter-Society Commission on Heart Disease Resources in urging the public to lower intakes of calories, cholesterol and saturated fat. In addition, other risk factors should be controlled such as ces\u00ac sation of smoking and control of high blood pressure. \\ AFFIDAVIT OF RICHARD S. ROSS, M.D. STATE OF MARYLAND ) ) ss.

I am a citizen of the United States, over 21 years of age, residing at 214 Wendover Road, Baltimore City, in the State of Maryland. 2. I attended Harvard College and was graduated from the Harvard Medical School (M.D., 1947).. _ 3.

I have carefully studied the National Commission on Egg Nutrition (NCEN) newspaper advertisements entitled \"The Sexy Egg,\" \"Cholesterol and the Egg: A Mystery,\" and \"There's More to the Egg than its Perfect Shape,\" and the NCEN informa\u00ac tional booklet offered to the public in these advertisements. r 8. In my opinion, and in the opinion of the Nutrition Committee of the American Heart Association, the NCEN advertise\u00ac ments contain false and misleading information concerning the relationship between cholesterol and the risk of heart attack. The statements in these advertisements which we consider to be false and misleading are the following and variations thereof: <3 1) \"There is absolutely no scientific evidence whatsoever that eating eggs in any way increases the risk of heart attack.\" 2) \"There is absolutely no scientific proof that eating good, wholesome, fresh eggs - nature's miracle in a shell - increases the risk of heart attack.\" Contrary to those representations, there is a great deal of evidence linking the eating of dietary fat and cholesterol as contained in eggs with increased risk of heart attack. Moreover, there is no sound scientific evidence of which I am aware showing that increased intake of dietary v cholesterol does not increase that risk. 9. The link between eating eggs and heart attack consists of two bodies of evidence. The- first establishes the fact that serum cholesterol is increased bykthe adding of cholesterol, such as that contained in egg yolk, to the diet. The second establishes the relationship between the level of serum cholesterol and the incidence of heart attack. 10. The scientific evidence which indicates that the con\u00ac sumption of eggs or other cholesterol containing foods raises the serum cholesterol is presented in the following papers: Ahrens; Blankenhorn, D.H.

JAMA 181:102-107, 1962. 11. The second body of scientific evidence shows that there is a strong correlation between high serum cholesterol levels and risk of heart disease and that the higher the blood level, the greater the chance of suffering a heart attack.

The above scientific evidence comes from many different disciplines, such as epidemiology, pathology, bio\u00ac chemistry ahd clinical dietary studies. The evidence is summarized and translated into recommendations for prevention of atherosclerosis in the ICHD (Inter-Society Commission for Heart Disease) revised report in 1972 (Stamler, J. and Lilienfeld, A.M. et al: Primary prevention of the atheroscleroti diseases. Report of the Inter-Society Commission for Heart Disease Resources, Circulation, 42:55-95, 1970). This report was prepared by a committee of experts in fields of athero\u00ac sclerosis, research and epidemiology and has an extensive bibliography of scientific studies documenting the association of dietary and serum cholesterol to coronary heart disease. PTC L-35G2 rev. 13. It is the opinion of the American Heart Association, and my own personal belief, that the statements in the NCEN advertisements concerning the scientific evidence are false as discussed above.^ Furthermore, the overall impression of the advertisements is misleading; and, therefore, they pose a risk to the health of the general public. In a Petition, 9 dated December 19, 1973, and over my signature, the American Heart Association so stated to the Federal Trade Commission and requested that the Commission take action to prevent the continued dissemination of the advertisements in question. 14. These advertisements threaten the public health because they encourage the general population to regularly increase its egg consumption. Increased egg consumption will be likely to result in increased blood cholesterol levels and therefore may increase the risk of heart attack. We believe the average American cholesterol intake per day of 600 mg. is already too high; in fact, the American Heart Association recommends a maximum of only 300 mg. per day. (American Heart Association, \"Diet and Coronary Heart Disease: Statement of Physicians and Other Health Professionals,\" 1973.) The best opinion based upon current scientific evidence is that regularly adding egg yolks, at 250 mg. of cholesterol each, to a diet already containing excessive amounts of cholesterol will result in higher levels of serum cholesterol and will probably add to the chances that the average American, especially the male, will develop premature heart disease. At a cholesterol level of 250 mg./lOO ml. or higher the risk of developing coronary heart disease is twice that of persons with levels under 220 mg/100 ml. 15. Furthermore, NCEN's misrepresentations also may have the effect of causing persons with blood fat abnormalities known to be associated with high risk of heart attack to disregard PTC L-35G2 rev. 1 their physician's advice to minimize consumption of eggs and other foods rich in cholesterol. Approximately 9,400,000 adult Americans have a cholesterol level of 300 mg. or above. By consistently disregarding such advice, these persons could suffer serious health consequences. / r '-jp .

BLACKBURN, being first duly sworn, depose and say that: 1. I am a citizen of the United States, over 21 years of age, f residing at 2108 Oliver Avenue, South, City of Minneapolis, County of Hennepin, State of Minnesota. 2. I am a graduate of the University of Miami (B.S., 1947), Tulane University School of Medicine (M.D., 1948), and the University of Minnesota (M.S., 1957). 3. I am presently Professor in the Department of Medicine of the University of Minnesota, and Professor and Director, Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene in the School of Public Health, specializing in cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology (the study of the causes and prevalence of heart disease in large population groups). 4. A complete list of my professional positions, memberships, editorial duties, honors and publications is contained in my curriculum vitae and list of publications, current copies of which are attached and incorportated by reference. 5. For a period of over twenty years, my professional duties have required me to maintain familiarity with research and practice regarding the relationship between heart disease and dietary components such as the cholesterol found in eggs. 6. In my opinion, based on my medical practice and my research and study in relevant medical fields, representations by the National Commission on Egg Nutrition (NCEN) that there is no scientific evidence that eating eggs increases the risk of heart attack are misleading. 7. Contrary to NCEN's advertisements, there is a large body PTC L-35G2 rev. of scientific evidence indicating that eating foods containing chol\u00ac esterol and saturated fats increases the risk of heart attack. (The yolk of an egg contains large amounts of cholesterol and saturated fats.) One medical field from which this evidence is drawn is cardiovascular epidemiology, the field of my specialization. 8. Epidemiological studies concerning heart disease observe the incidence of heart disease and heart attack and of certain suspected risk factors in large groups of people over a number of years. After statistical analysis, it can be determined whether there exist correlations between certain risk factors and the occurrence of heart attacks. These studies are conducted under best existing designs and are considered by the medical ccmmunity to be \"scientific evidence.\" 9. Examples of epidemiological studies are the Framingham study in which approximately 5,000 citizens of Framingham, Mass, have been studied since 1948, and the Minnesota Seven Countries Study in which 12,000 men were followed five years. The number of heart attacks occurring within this time to the men tested, as well as their blood cholesterol level, blood pressure, smoking habits and other suspected risk factors have been recorded and analyzed. [Kannel et al., 1971; Keys, 1970] * 10. The results of the Framingham study and all other carefully controlled epidemiological studies which have been conducted on American populations have shown a strong correlation between blood cholesterol levels and the incidence of heart attack, particularly when the excessive blood levels are combined with high blood pressure and a habit of smoking. [Keys, 1973; Blackburn, 1974] Other scientific studies have indicated that, in most people, the amount of cholesterol and saturated fats consumed in the diet influences the level of cholesterol in the blood, and that high blood cholesterol occur levels/in populations on a diet high in saturated fat and cholesterol intake. [Keys, 1970] Further, many human feeding experiments shew *A list of references is attached and incorporated by reference. PTC L-3562 rev. \u2014:-r~c 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 a predictable relationship between increasing diet saturated fat and cholesterol and increasing serum cholesterol levels [Keys, 1965]. 11. There are also international epidemiological studies which indicate a close correlation between elevated dietary cholesterol and saturated fat consumption and heart attack incidence. [Keys, 1970] Bor example, the Finns have the highest intake of dietary cholesterol r and saturated fat, the highest blood cholesterol level and the highest incidence of heart attacks. [Keys, 1970] On the other hand, the Japanese have one of the lowest intakes of dietary cholesterol and fat, one of the lowest blood cholesterol levels and correspondingly few heart attacks [Keys, 1970]. 12. In my opinion, claims in the NCEN advertisements that there is scientific evidence that eggs not only do not increase the risk of heart attack but actually decrease that risk, and that avoiding dietary cholesterol increases the risk, are false. I knew of no competently performed and evaluated scientific studies that would support those claims, and the great majority of the existing scientific evidence supports the opposite conclusion. 13. To the extent NCEN's misrepresentations about the relationship of eggs to heart disease lead to increased consumption of foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats, such as eggs, these misrepresentations threaten to increase heart attack risk among large numbers of persons in the general population. For example, the addition of one egg a day to the diet of many people will result in approximately a 5 mg./lOO ml. rise in the mean blood cholesterol level of the population. This would be related to a 4% increase in the estimated number of heart attacks or deaths frem coronary heart disease. [Diet-Heart Supplement, 1968] Since there are over 670,000 deaths from coronary heart disease each year in the United States, a 4% increase in those deaths would mean over 26,000 additional deaths, on the average. 14. Heart disease is the major contemporary health problem in the United States, tore than 670,000 people die of heart attacks PTC L-35G2 rev. annually. Medical intervention after the occurrence of heart attacks is usually of limited avail and about 60% of persons suffering a first heart attack die within a year or less as a result of the attack. Twenty-five percent die immediately. Thus the most effective weapon against heart disease is prevention through public education. Misrepresentations such as NCEN's prevent sound public understanding of the causes and possible prevention of heart attacks. Subscribed and sworn to before me in the year 1974.

All of these studies are considered to be \"scientific\" by nutritionists. 8. The average American1s diet contains large amounts of dietary cholesterol, about 600 mg per day. This amount is considered by many nutritionists and physicians to be too high. For example, the American Heart Association recommends a maximum of only 300 mg. per day in its Prudent Heart Dipt. 9. Dietary cholesterol is found in many foods, '.including eggs, beef, pork, dairy products and certain shellfish. It is more highly concentrated in eggs than in most other foods, however, and the average egg contains about 250 mg. Thus, adding one egg to the average American dietary cholesterol intake of 600 mg., an intake considered to be excessive already, will result in a significantly higher cholesterol intake and raise the blood cholesterol level in many people by more than 10 mg/ml. /' 17 IS 12 P.o 21 P.2 2-3 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 10* Heart disease is a na-Jor health problem in America, not only among the elderly but even among individuals in their thirties and forties, especially males. To the xtent that tl -se misrepresentations in the NCEN advertise- lead to significantly increased egg consumption and correspondingly higher cholesterol intake, they increase the risk of heart disease, especially among individuals * who already have above-normal blood cholesterol levels or who have symptoms of heart disease. 11. For example, (based on the results of extensive scientific studies conducted over many years, it can be predicted that a lifetime habit of consuming two eggs per day over and above the \"invisible eggs\" contained in the diet results in an increase of approximately 15% in risk that the white American male at age 50 will develop coronary heart disease within six years, keeping all other factors constant, such as smoking, blood pressure and diet.

Furthermore, in my opinion, the representations in the NCEN advertisements that there is scientific evidence that eating eggs does not increase the risk of heart attacks and even, in fact, decreases that risk are also false, j know of no reliable scientific studios which have produced such results. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 I'o * 14. In iny opinion, the further representations that dietary cholesterol, including that in eggs, is needed by the body for building sex hormones, for transmitting nerve impulses' and for maintaining life in cells are likewise false. While it is true that cholesterol is a necessary component for many of the body's functions, the normal human body produces enough cholesterol for these purposes, and any cholesterol taken in through the diet is superfluous. For example, populations' which live on vegetarian diets which provide little or no dietary cholesterol do not I suffer a deficiency |in cholesterol.

In my opinion, at least the following claims in those advertisements}are false: that there is absolutely no scientific evidence that eating eggs in any way increases the .risk of heart attack; that there is overwhelming scient fic evidence that eating eggs does not increase the risk of heart attack; that there is evidence that eating eggs will decrease the risk of heart attack; that avoiding dietary 2'i 22 29 >0 3' cholcsteroir chat' in eggs, increases the risif - heart disease; and that eating eggs does not increase blood cholesterol level in a normal person. 8. contrary to the advertisements' representations, there is a great deal of scientific evidence which indicates that eating eggs raises the blood cholesterol level, and that \"elevated blood cholesterol levels increase the of heart attach.

Scientific evidence suggesting that, eating eggs increases the risk of heart attack exists in many forms: it is drawn from epidemiology (the study of the causes and prevalence of disease in large population groups), animal experimentation, pathology (the study of diseased and tloan tissue), clinical dietary and drug studies, basic biochemj.cal i research, and from other sources. This evidence has been developing for many years and is widely known among those 'concerned with heart disease research and treatment, has been carefully developed in accordance with rigorous methodologies and thus i's \"scientific\" evidence. 11. The first source of evidence that eating eggs may increase the risk, of heart disease is in the field of epidemiology. American and international epidemiological studies indicate that there is a close association between blood cholesterol levels and heart attack incidence, and that populations: with high dietary cholesterol consumption, such as the United States and Finland, also tend to have * < high blood cholesterol levels and a high rate of heart attacks.* The statistical correlations developed in epide\u00ac miological studies cannot by themselves prove causality; but, when taken together with scientific evidence from other disciplines, they are strong circumstantial evidence that heart attacks are in fact related in part to dietary cholesterol ingested and taken into the blood stream and arterial walls. Major medical decisions in individual therapy and public health are often based on just such circumstantial ev.1 donce. See citations numbered 1-9 contained in the page' o 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 that eating eggs increases the risk of heart attack is animal experimentation. In animal studies, sustained high cholesterol consumption has been shown to induce significant atherosclerosis (the injury to artery walls which, when combined with blood clots, is the ordinary cause of heart attack) in numerous animal species, including rhesus monkeys and other primates. [See citations numbered 10-12) The studies in which these findings have been made suggest that dietary cholesterol is a major factor in causing atheros\u00ac clerosis and resulting heart attacks in man. The implication -is not conclusive, but in medical fields, including cardiology, the results of animal studies have proven highly applicable to man. 13. A third category of scientific evidence which suggests a causal relation between heart attacks and dietary cholesterol is pathology. Pathological studies in live and deceased heart disease victims indicate that a major component of the atherosclerotic tissue causing heart attacks is-cholesterol. [See citation number 13J studies in of ''tagged\" radio- \\active dietary cholesterol ingested and taken into the blood stream suggest that the cholesterol in atherosclerotic tissue is derived in large proportion from dietary cholesterol. [See citation number 14] 14. NCEN's claims in their advertisements that the body increases . ts synthesis (production ) of cholesterol in an amount equal to any decrease in intake of dietary choleste.roi as well as their comments regarding elimination of the same amount of cholesterol as' that eaten, thereby resulting in a stabilized blood cholesterol level, are mi s lead i.jiu . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 83 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Contrary .to NCEN's above assertions, there are studies that show that persons* blood cholesterol levels have increased with an increase in their dietary cholesterol intake and, likewise, there are studies that show the converse; that is, persons' blood cholesterol levels have decreased with a decrease in their dietary cholesterol intake. [15, 16, 17, 18]. Therefore, the body mechanisms will not necessarily prevent the human blood cholesterol level from varying with the amount of dietary cholesterol intake. 15. In its booklet, Eggs, Your Diet and Your Health, NCEif makes additional misleading representations. In that booklet, NCEN cites NHLI's Task Force on Arteriosclerosis as officially stating that any recommendations concerning diet in relation to heart and artery disease are strictly \"intuitive\" and are based only on personal impressions ana fragmentary conclusions, rather than on scientific proof. As the then Director of NHLI, I was responsible for convening that Task Force and commissioning its report, Arteriosc1erosis, NHLI, June 1971. ' I am thoroughly familiar with the contents f of the report. The language quoted by NCEN from the Task Force's report is out of context and grossly misrepresents the clear and obvious thrust of the report that, whi[Le evidence indicating that dietary cholesterol is one of the primary causes of heart disease is not yet conclusive, it is sufficient to support a Task Force recommendation that the general public lower its intake or dietary cholesterol (see, for example, Arteriosclerosis, vol. II, p. 148). 16. it is my opinion that in addition to being false, the NCEN advertisements are irresponsible and could result in a significant threat to public health. To the extent \\ \"l 2 3 4 .5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 80 NCEN's misrepresentations about cholesterol and heart attacks lead to increased dietary cholesterol consumption and resultan increased heart attack risk, these misrepre\u00ac sentations constitute a threat to the health of many persons. 17. In the case of persons v;.ith elevated blood cholesterol levels that are genetically determined as , well as persons who, ..because of environmental or genetic reasons, are unable to handle dietary cholesterol (patients with diet-sensitive hypercholesterolemia), the threat of premature heart attacks is especially high and a diet low \\ in cholesterol is thJe usual therapeutic recommendation. i These two categories comprise over one million Americans, both diagnosed and undiagnosed. la Theodore Cooper, M.D. Subscribed and sworn to before me this / & day of Z.'^7 ,{ p , 1974 . \\ [seal of notary] \\ Notary Public C r S't ' 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 83 24 25 26, 27 aa CITATIONS 1.

However, in V/ view of the natural history of this disease, it appears likely that its morbidity and mortality can be substantially reduced through education and management aimed at preventing or retarding the development of atherosclerosis and its thrombotic complications. This can be said despite uncertainty concerning the exact role of many of the factors believed to contribute to the rate at which lesions develop in individual vessels. While the epidemiologic data correlating risk factors with incidence justify public recommendations based on these data, these recommendations undoubtedly will be more sharply defined according to the results of continuing investigation. Preventive measures should be initiated early in life to have the best chance of preventing or retarding coronary heart disease. For example, correction of established adverse eating or smoking habits, while evidently beneficial, is certainly of less value than if the improper practices were never begun. GUIDELINES FOR REFERRAL Epidemiologic studies demonstrate that certain factors are associated with an increased rate of development of coronary heart disease. These factors include overt problems and personal attributes which may require modification and environmental factors which are correctable. In considering the several risk factors which contribute to the rate of development of atherosclerosis, it should be recognized that no single factor is absolutely etiologic \u2014 multiple causal factors play interrelated roles. AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION 44 East 23 Street, New York, N.Y. 10010 \u00a9American Heart Association, 1968 Overt Problems and Personal Attributes Familial occurrence of coronary disease at an early age Hypertension Electrocardiographic abnormalities Diabetes mellitus Lipid abnormalities involving serum cholesterol and triglycerides and their lipoprotein vehicles Obesity Gout (hyperuricemia) Certain personality-behavior patterns Environmental Factors Cigarette smoking Lack of physical activity Emotionally stressful situations Diet Some of these factors may directly or indirectly modify the rate of development of atherosclerosis, while others, such as severe emotional stress, may precipitate an acute cardiac event. Although final proof is not yet available, most of these factors can be modified in what appears to be a favorable direc\u00ac tion. Additional research to provide more effective prevention is urgently needed, but enough information is at hand to advocate that individuals who are highly susceptible to coronary disease be placed on regimens designed to correct their unfavorable characteristics. This is particularly true when the early development of coronary disease is a family characteristic. It is well recognized that a strong family history of coronary disease may be due to a tendency to atherosclerosis, to hyperlipidemia, to diabetes, or to essential hyper\u00ac tension as the basic disorder. Many individuals, if forewarned of their susceptibility to heart disease, may be willing to follow a regimen to reduce their risks. Early detection of susceptible individuals involves some form of routine surveillance for the appearance of risk factors. Most people today receive health exam\u00ac inations for a variety of reasons including insurance or school health examinations, periodic health check\u00ac ups, and pre-employment physicals. Inclusion of cer\u00ac tain procedures for identifying the \"coronary prone\" is one important approach. For such examinations to be effective, the persons with abnormalities must be referred to a physician, and the physician must be able to institute corrective measures. It is recommended that individuals with a two-fold or more increase in risk be referred to physicians for prophylactic management. The \"coronary-prone\" adult with at least this level of elevated risk demonstrates one or more of the following: 1. Serum cholesterol of more than 260 mg%, a fasting triglyceride of more than 250 mg%, or a prominent electrophoretic pre-beta lipo\u00ac protein band 2. Sustained blood pressure over 160/95 mm Hg 3. Body weights 30% or more above standards listed in tables of desirable weight* 4. Fasting blood sugar of more than 120 mg%, or a casual blood sugar of 180 mg%, de\u00ac creased glucose tolerance or significant glycosuria 5. History of gout or a uric acid level over 7.5 mg% 6. Electrocardiographic abnormalities** 7. Habitual cigarette smoking The designation of \"abnormal\" levels for certain of these risk factors is arbitrary. For example, risk has been demonstrated to increase from the lowest to the highest level of blood pressure and cholesterol re\u00ac corded in the population. As single abnormalities, each of these items carries at least a two-fold excess risk of coronary disease. Lesser abnormalities than the values listed may be important when two or more factors are present. Indi\u00ac viduals with multiple abnormalities demonstrate up to a ten-fold excess risk of coronary disease. Sedentary individuals appear to be especially prone to lethal coronary attacks. The appearance of new electrocardio\u00ac graphic abnormalities may indicate the development of early asymptomatic coronary disease. GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PHYSICIAN When patients present themselves for periodic exam\u00ac inations or for other reasons, identification of the fac\u00ac tors which enhance the risk of coronary heart disease should be included in the examination. These factors should be looked for in young adults, as well as in older individuals, to permit the earliest possible iden\u00ac tification of susceptible individuals. Once identified, long-term supervision and periodic re-examination of the coronary-prone individual are of paramount im\u00ac portance in establishing effective and sustained con\u00ac trol of the factors which enhance risk. It is important that physicians develop a greater interest in the pre\u00ac vention of atherosclerosis rather than confine their con\u00ac cern principally to the treatment of patients with symp\u00ac tomatic coronary disease. \u00b0 Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. Statistical Bulletin, November-December, 1959. 00 These include left ventricular hypertrophy, intraventricular block, distinctly abnormal S-T segment displacement and T-wave abnormalities at rest, atrial fibrillation un\u00ac and unequivocal ischemic S-T preventive approach to atherosclerosis is par\u00ac ticularly important in the care of children from families demonstrating metabolic abnormalities including the hyperlipidemias, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, gout, and early coronary disease. Preventive measures ap\u00ac plied to these individuals early in life should be even more fruitful than those applied only after the develop\u00ac ment of overt disease. Long-term management by the physician should in\u00ac clude repeated evaluation of both the cardiovascular system and the several coronary risk factors. This entails periodic determination of body weight, blood pressure, blood lipids, uric acid levels, blood glucose, and ECG. A simple total vital capacity and chest x-ray for heart size are also helpful. These examina\u00ac tions are also required to evaluate the effect of the measures instituted to control the risk factors. Un\u00ac recognized or silent myocardial infarctions are neither rare nor innocuous and may be detected only by peri\u00ac odic electrocardiographic examination. Annual exami\u00ac nations should, therefore, be encouraged particularly in subjects exhibiting these risk factors and especially in subjects over forty years of age. RECOMMENDATIONS TO PHYSICIANS RELATIVE TO REDUCING THE RISKS OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE In the presence of established coronary heart disease, successful correction of obesity may decrease the risk of sudden death and congestive heart failure and reduce blood pressure and serum lipid levels. Symp\u00ac toms of angina pectoris may also diminish with weight reduction. Avoidance of cigarette smoking in subjects with established coronary disease is important to re\u00ac duce both the risk of sudden death and recurrent myocardial infarction. An individually prescribed pro\u00ac gram of physical activity in recovered heart attack victims and in individuals with angina pectoris may improve their exercise tolerance and, especially, their psychological attitude. In the long-term management of the coronary-prone patient it is advisable to recommend: \u00a9 Discontinuance of cigarette smoking. Cigar and pipe smoking have not been proven to be asso\u00ac ciated with any substantial increase in risk of coronary disease. \u00a9 The avoidance of obesity or its correction if pres\u00ac ent. Control of obesity should include not only reduced caloric intake but also participation in regular physical exercise. \u00a9 Development of a program of regular physical exercise. A program of physical activity increases exercise tolerance and improves the psychological outlook of coronary-prone individuals. It may enhance the effect of a modified diet in controlling obesity, hyperlipemia, and the metabolism of carbohydrates. Physically active indiv iduals tend to have a better prognosis when a heart attack does occur. It should be remembered that un\u00ac usual, strenuous physical exertion may precipitate a heart attack and should be avoided. Exertion that induces pain or dyspnea should be avoided. In general, unusual exercise shortly after a large meal, when experiencing emotional stress, or in extremely cold or extremely hot weather should be discouraged. 0 Modification of the diet. Controversy continues concerning the particular items in the diet that are most basic to the atherosclerotic process. All agree, however, that overeating and weight gain are undesirable. An acceptable way to modify the usual diet, while maintaining sound nutrition, is to restrict the intake of saturated fat, cholesterol, and the simple sugars. Increasing the proportion of polyunsaturated to saturated fat is recom\u00ac mended. Such dietary changes, along with a suit\u00ac able program of physical activity, may help in correcting obesity, reducing serum lipids, and improving carbohydrate tolerance. The individ\u00ac uals whose elevated lipid levels are primarily influenced by the intake of carbohydrate and/or simple sugars can only be identified by special studies including the clinical trial of a reduced carbohydrate intake. \u00a9 Correction of elevated serum lipid levels. Accord\u00ac ing to present knowledge, lowering of serum lipid levels including beta and pre-beta lipoprotein, triglyceride, and cholesterol is best accomplished by alteration in diet, correction of obesity, and a program of regular exercise. The use of various drugs and hormones to achieve normal lipid levels is under widespread investigation at this time. Subjects with familial lipid disorders, with a \"milky? fasting serum (due to high serum trigly\u00ac cerides), serum cholesterol levels in excess of 400 mg%, or having xanthoma, should be investi\u00ac gated thoroughly, including determination of the several serum lipid components, the function of the thyroid gland, and the carbohydrate tolerance, as well as other procedures to identify disorders that require special management. The interaction of blood pressure and lipid levels appears to be particularly important in the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Persons with both hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are at substantially increased risk and especially merit efforts to control both conditions. Here again, prophylactic measures applied in the pre- clinical phase should be more rewarding than those applied after the development of myo\u00ac cardial involvement. @ Avoidance of situations which might precipitate acute coronary episodes. Ischemia of the myo\u00ac cardium may be precipitated by intense emotional states, ingestion of an unusually large meal, un\u00ac accustomed strenuous exertion, and unusual exer\u00ac tion in very cold or very hot weather. 0 Correction of disease states which may predispose to or may precipitate coronary heart disease. It is recognized that anemia, hyperthyroidism, aortic valvular disease, pheochromocytoma, paroxysmal tachycardia, hypotensive episodes, hypoglycemia, certain drugs (epinephrine, hydralazine), and reactions to drugs may precipitate acute ischemic episodies. Nutritional, hygienic, and medical therapeutic measures are useful in the management of hyper\u00ac tension, diabetes, and gout. Pharmacological treatment is generally employed in these condi\u00ac tions when nutritional and hygienic measures are ineffective. Evidence indicates that even minor impairments associated with these diseases can have grave significance in individuals who are otherwise predisposed to coronary disease. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HEALTH AGENCIES Programs for the public to encourage more physical exercise, to modify the diet in the directions indicated, and to make the cigarette smoking habit less popular are desirable to reduce the morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease in the general population. Such programs can be implemented by general health education, school, college and university health pro\u00ac grams, and other public health procedures aimed at modification of the environment. Facilities and com\u00ac munity health resources to assist the physician in obtaining blood lipid analyses and nutritional counsel\u00ac ing services, as well as supervised facilities where he may direct his patients for exercise programs, should be provided if an effective program of prevention is to be achieved. SUMMARY It must be realized that with the identification of risk factors, only a beginning has been made toward the reduction of atherosclerotic heart disease in the popu\u00ac lation. Any significant change in mortality or morbidity may take years or even decades. Such reduction can only be achieved through the increasing effort and example of individual physicians with their patients and the action of public health agencies and voluntary health organizations in furthering preventive measures. As this program develops and expands, there must be frequent, careful re-evaluation. Additional research to determine the basic etiology and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and controlled prophylactic trials are essential to achieve control of this disease in all its manifestations.

It particularly challenges the stated relative eject on riot of CUD at different levels of serum cholesterol. Some of the questioning is based on clinical experience confirmed by others (e.g.. the unimportant eject on scrum \"cholesterol levels of significant reductions in diclary cholesterol). Moreover. Dr. Osier casts doubt on the value of epidemiologic studies of this type and questions the mathematical underpinnings of the statistical meth\u00ac ods employed in this case. To review such matters we har e railed upon a consulting mathematician to offer a critique of Dr. Osier's remarks as weli as the methodology of the Framingham Study. His com\u00ac ments immediately follow Dr. Osier's paper. V ;- n December 1970. The Inter-Society Commission for Heart Disease Resources, \"comprised of out- standino- leaders in the held of cardiovascular dis\u00ac eases and representatives of national professional or\u00ac ganizations capable of making significant contribu\u00ac tions. reported its suggestions for the prevention of Chi'f rr\"'T 'l\":i'ysis of tltc K. : Mr. IVygcr, a s.tn'.nu at the University < theorem ,his \"'erk !.v a research grant fro, Ute Hear' Association.

The Commission worked un\u00ac der contract No. NFJ 69-29 with the Health, Sci\u00ac ence, and Mental Health Administration Deoart- ment of the Department of Health. Education'and Welfare. The funds came out of taxpayers' money. In its introductory note to the reader, the Com\u00ac mission invites constructive criticism of the work oJ its study groups, particularly those who attempt to apply these guidelines. In the following paper such constructive criticism will be given and it will be shown that the Report of the Commission is prejudicial, based on dubious data and therefore probably deceptive. Furthermore, by thus wasting the taxpayers' money, the Report of the Commis\u00ac sion. instead of advancing the cause of coronary heart disease prevention, channels the research funds overwhelmingly into narrow, preconceived, subjective, discredited areas of research. It thereby hinders, il it does not preclude, the development of other approaches which may provide more effective solutions of this problem, so vital to the health of the American people. To the tune of scheduled press conferences and through recourse to the various media, the Ameri\u00ac can people were advised to change their diets drasti\u00ac cally and especially curtail the consumption of cholesterol to 300 mgs. daily from the usual 600 mgs. and reduce the intake of saturated fats to 35% from 40%,.

Proc. 21 (Suppl. No. 4):58-61, July-August, 1962. These data illustrate the potential for prevention, and the possibility of achieving declines in CHD morbidity and mortality. For example, a ten per cent reduction in serum cholesterol level of the U.S. population (u = .10) is estimated to yield a 24.4 per cent decrease in CHD incidence (v = .244). would affect the life habits of the American people and alter the manufacturing of basic foods and the raising of livestock, the Commission presents some alleged facts, studies, and tables to support their un\u00ac proven theories. On page A-83 of the Commission's Report1 we find Table 16, The Estimated Relative Reduction in Coronary Heart Disease Incidence Associated with Relative Reduction in Serum Cholesterol (re\u00ac numbered as Table I of this article, above). The values of ' v\" were obtained from the relationship v = 1 \u2014 (1 \u2014 u)2 0G described in a study of Corn\u00ac field,2 where \"v\" is the relative incidence of CHD and \"u\" is the relative serum cholesterol level. An example is given that a 10% reduction in the serum cholesterol level in the United States population (u = .10) is estimated to yield a 24.4% decrease in coronary heart disease incidence (v = .244). Since such pivotal importance is ascribed to this table and since it is utilized in two prior studies,3,4 we deemed it worthwhile to re-read Cornfield's orig- inal work and find out if the statements contained in there correspond with the table published by the Inter-Society Commission. In the entire study of Cornfield, we were unable to find the equation v = 1 \u2014 (1 \u2014 u)2,66 but we do find equation (7), P =r .0091 Y1\\2,6VY2 \u2014 75\\1,47 100 100 where Yx serum cholesterol systolic blood pressure re\u00ac spectively. Cornfield states, \"A 1% decrease in cholesterol would be associated with a 2.66% decrease in risk of coronary heart disease throughout the range of cholesterol values.\" In other words, it is not just limited to the levels of frank hypercholesterolemia, but also applicable to the lower values of,choles\u00ac terol in the serum without exception. So, if to drive this point home by reductio ad absurdum, a lower\u00ac ing of cholesterol level from a normal of 220 mgs to 110 mgs/per cent would put a theoretical person at an 84.4% less risk of coronary heart disease; the same as if lowering the cholesterol from 480 mgs. to 240 mgs/per cent, providing that the experi\u00ac mental reduction of cholesterol is of the same risk (a condition that the Commission fails to mention). Cornfield states in a personal letter: \"My paper, 'Joint Dependence of Risks of Coronary Heart Disease on Serum Cholesterol and Systolic Blood Pressure: a Discriminant pp 58-61, July-August, 1962) states, 'If one could lower cholesterol levels by a given amount, say 15%, and if equation (7) describes not only the association between risk and cholesterol level in Framingham, but also the change in risk that would accompany an experi\u00ac mental alteration in serum cholesterol, then the relative risk would be (.85)200, or a reduction of about 85%' \" Mathematical analysis reveals Corn\u00ac field's formula correct insofar as statistical signifi- cance is concerned. Having shown the biological impracticability of the Report's Table 16, we turn to the collection of data lor Cornfield's equation. We question this data, which was given to him by the Framingham Study, and also the paucity of numbers from whjt h MEDICAL COUNTERPOINT | APRIL 1972 17 table; si\u00ac new CHD m 6 YEARS FOLLOW-UP: ACTUAL AND EXPECTED NUMBER OF CASES AMONG MEN 40-59 Serufn Systolic over 10.5 12 0.8 2 1.4 1.3 2 2.3 1 1.6 2 0.7 1 1.4 3 0.5 1 5.9 2 0.5 0.8 2 1.4 1.0 1.0 0.7 0.4 0.1 5.9 6 0.4 0.9 1 1.0 2 1.5 0.4 0.9 1.1 0.8 3 22.3 23 0.5 2.9 8 4.7 2 5.5 6 .7,4 3 1.5 1 3.1 2 1.6 1 11.6 8 0.5 1.3 2.3 2.0 3 1.9 2 1.3 0.7 2 1.5 1 319 53 66 59 65 37 13 21 5 133 21 27 34 19 16 10 121 15 25 21 25 6 11 11 6 20 69 83 81 29 15 27 10 136 14 24 33 23 19 11 5 over 16.0 23 156 1.0 1 22 1.4 5 22 2.1 2 26 3.5 2 34 1.9 4 * 16 1.7 2 13 2.7 6 16 1.5 1 7 18.9 13 130 0.7 11 1.7 1 19 3.1 4 23 3.1 4 23 2.8 1 16 2.5 4 12 3.2 3 14 1.3 1 7 , (population at risk) Expected number of cases = je].ca,T:< \u2014 ti. 11;Sc7C\"a!pyx7' Note: Cholesterol determinations were done by the Kendal!-Abe! method at Framingham. Massachusetts he derived his equation. We doubt the validity of the application of Cornfield's equation to Table 16 in the Inter-Society Report in view of the latter's simplifications and the omission of the risk of ex\u00ac perimental alteration in serum cholesterol levels which Cornfield mentions. According to the Com\u00ac mission's attitude, this risk would be zero-. The Commission implies that the reduction mentioned in the footnote to Table 16 would only be valid for the very high levels of serum cholesterol found in hypercholesterolemia, but Cornfield claims bis formula is valid for the whole range of cholesterol levels. A total of 1329 male persons between the ages of 40 to 59 were examined for freedom of coronary heart disease in the Framginham Study. Neither then (1962) nor at the present time can even the most astute diagnostician say with certainty that an individual is free of coronary heart disease. So one of the basic assumptions of the Framingham Study is open to serious doubt. Of the 1329 allegedly coronary heart disease-free persons only 92 developed various incidents of coronary heart disease, which must have included angina pectoris. Seventy-four were distributed'over a range of cholesterol from 200 to 284 mgs/per cent, with groupings as high as 23 to a low of 2 per\u00ac sons. The groupings were arbitrarily chosen as shown in Table II reprinted from Cornfield's paper (see at left). A questionable transformation takes place by semantic legerdemain on the part of the Commission. The risk of coronary heart disease in 92 persons out of a group of 1329 reported by Corn\u00ac field is equated by the Commission to the incidence of coronary heart disease in many millions of the U.S., if not the world's, population \u2014 a substitution which is unacceptable. Again, we doubt the ac\u00ac curacy of the data presented to the computer. It is a known fact that cholesterol in the non- fasting individual, as tested in Framingham, is not greatly affected by dietary intake of fats and choles\u00ac terol in the short run. From values of our own study, described below, as well as from the world literature we learn that the same individual has variable values of serum cholesterol on different days, different seasons and other circumstances.3 Cholesterol was determined in five males and five females of an age group from 18 to 30 on two different occasions. On one occasion a low caloric breakfast was served consisting of two ounces of Oval tine\u00ae* dissolved in twelve ounces of milk. * Ova I tine\u00ae contains 18 APRIL 107?

Post-prandial blood specimens tvere examined 45 minutes after the ndividual finished eating the low caloric meal. Ninety minutes after the high caloric meal post- prandial blood specimens were examined. Four in\u00ac dividuals (2 males and 2 females) aged between 30 02 consumed the high caloric meal with an addi- on ol 2 ounces of Ovaltine\u00ae in i2 ounces of milk, fasting and 90 minutes post prandial specimens were'examined. There was a total of 48 different Siolesterol determinations. It was lound that only eight times did the fasting \"id post-prandial specimens pair (see Table III, page 09). Tiie other pairs of fasting and post-pran\u00ac dial values varied significantly in the same in\u00ac dividual and projecting fltis finding to the Framing\u00ac ham Study, 66% of the post-prandial values used in this population group might be subject to grouping 'ranges\u2014a lactor that would throw the application \"i Cornfield s equation to the Framingham Study mto serious doubt. i he l'rannngham blood specimens were taken wuen convenient to the volunteers regardless of diet, time of the day, or other anamnestic in- .!uenecs. The accuracy oi our determinations was '-3.5% as determined by duplicates. If hyper- .lolesterolemia :s defined as serum values over 260 mgs per cent, only one individual had such a fast- :ng serum value, and that went, down 20-10 mgs/ per cent post-prandiailv. jumping two of Cornfield's 'ample groups. Tt is also quite presumptuous to project or generalize findings found in a homo\u00ac geneous northeastern community whose racial and - dune background is not given (and which could we completely different eating habits) to embrace he considerable diversity of the United .States cpulation. It lias been reported by others in epi- wmiological studies that the death rate from coro\u00ac nary heart disease is-different in various states pf be Union. Due to the narrow range chosen by Con)field in n groupings, an individual's cholesterol level >uid shift from one ol Cornfields cholesterol cups into another, from clay to day. and week to cck. I his would also apply to blood pressure i (Msuiements. These shifts would then raise havoc .util Cornfield's formula. Again we find Cornfield's '> mu la pitiably wanting (biologically) though sta- istically valid, assuming the constancy of starting . i ties. Cornfield aiso stresses the fact that the percentage reduction of cholesterol pertains to risk of coronary heart disease in all values of the table high or low. But it is different if one considers the presentation of risk in actual milligram/per cent reduction. There we have a large absolute difference in risk when added to a large, rather than to a small, initial level of serum cholesterol. Wbtli complete disregard of the above considera\u00ac tions, the Commission devised its own interorcta- tion ol Cornfield s data. Instead of risk, we are now told that the coronary heart disease incidence is re\u00ac duced with a relative reduction in scrum choles\u00ac terol. According to Webster's Dictionary, 2nd edi\u00ac tion, incidence have two completely unre\u00ac lated meanings\u2014 Incidence: act, fact, manner of falling upon or affecting, range of occurrence or influence Risk: degree of probability of loss or chance of loss T e are now told that a 10*% reduction of choles\u00ac terol in the population of the United States will yield a decrease of 24.4% in the incidence of coro\u00ac nary heart disease. From Table 16 in the Commis\u00ac sion's report we can learn that a 50% decrease in serum cholesterol will yield a decrease of S J.2% of the incidence of coronary heart disease. Anv bio\u00ac logically oriented researcher knows tint this is a physiologic impossibility and is absurd in its im\u00ac plication because a 50% reduction of serum choles\u00ac terol levels may entail untold dangers. Cornfield must have sensed these shortcomings because in a later (1969) publication7 lie stated, \"We must admit at the outset that we have no se\u00ac cure basis for estimating the reduction in incidence of or mortality from coronary heart disease that could be achieved by application of current knowl\u00ac edge.' He also states in the same article. \"It seems clear that despite a very considerable scientific, effort and some tantaiizinglv suggestive results, we have no clear-cut generally accepted answer to the question whether cholesterol lowering measures can nfleet coronary heart disease.' We concur in Corn\u00ac field s doubts. We feel that his equation is not valid biologically and should not be used to substantiate die implied effect ol proposed dietary changes sug\u00ac gested by the Commission. Obsessed with the idea of correlating values from blood chemistry with actual disease, the Commis\u00ac sion was undisturbed by reality and objectivity. Since the Commission's mind was made up in ad\u00ac vance. the membership of the Commission did not want to be bothered with the confusing facts. For example, in a study ol cigarette smoking, the find- 23 EDICAL COUNTERPOINT | APRIL 1172 mgs of Keys and others5 that there was no connec\u00ac tion between cigarette smoking and coronary heart disease in certain European countries was not men\u00ac tioned; whereas the findings concerning the rela- tionship between cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease in the same study are given promi\u00ac nence. Keys also states in the same study, (again, not mentioned in the Commission's Report) that the in\u00ac cidence of coronary heart disease is lower among individuals who smoke less than 20 cigarettes per day than among non-smokers or heavy smokers. An unbiased report would not have suffered from such omissions. In a very recent study by Keys9 we find that in contrast to a value of 2.66 found in the Framing:- ham Study as the exponent for coronary heart dis\u00ac ease incidence, a value of 2.24 has now been estab\u00ac lished. There is also a quotation that angina pec\u00ac toris was less closely related to scrum cholesterol level than it was to myocardial infarction. This re\u00ac sult was also duplicated by a study of Western Elec: trie Co. employees and Los Angeles civil servants.9 However, as mentioned before bv Cornfield in his paper,-' all phases of coronary heart disease are in\u00ac cluded in the Framingham Study. This again shows the unreliability of his original data. Furthermore, the statements of Pearce and Day- ton,\"' who warn that their'findings are not to be construed as recommending a change in the Ameri\u00ac can diet, are alarmingly absent in the Commission's Report. I ne fact that there is a potential danger from unsaturated la tty acids as carcinogenic agents is underplayed, i he American people are led to be\u00ac lieve that unsaturated fatty acids do not undergo chemical changes under heating and during cook- ing \u2014 though such changes are a fact well known to every organic chemist but not mentioned in the In\u00ac ter-Society Commission Report. U publications ol the individual members con\u00ac stituting the Commission are examined, one finds that in July 1970 J. T. Doyle wrote, in an editorial in the Annals of Internal Medicine.11 about the prevention of coronary heart disease: \"The consci\u00ac entious physician must then be guided by his in\u00ac stincts. Ins common sense, and the fundamental principle that he should do no harm.\" In December of the same year one finds him as a member of the Commission giving his consent to sweeping recom\u00ac mendations of dietarv changes. A more cautious view ol such dietary changes is reflected in the remarks of Dr. Donald S. Frcderick- son when discussing the Inter-Societv Commission Report in his St. C.vres Lecture of the National Heart Hospital at the Royal College of Physicians of London, published in the British Medical Jour\u00ac nal:12 \"There are some things about the report to be pitied, how\u00ac ever. In the light of what is actually known, the injunctions on consumption of cholesterol and fats seems too radical as they stand. What evidence do we have that an egg vo'.k a day spells jeopardy for all Americans?\" . . . \". . . One looks vainly in the Commission Report for some\u00ac thing new and strong enough to change the present gov\u00ac ernmental non-position concerning dietarv fat consump\u00ac tion.'1 ... * The Commission disregards the potential economic dislocations which would result from their recommendations, should they become reality. It also completely disregards the warnings and ex\u00ac cellent deliberations in the Report of the Diet- Heart Review Panel of the National Heart Insti\u00ac tute (dated June 1969 and published as American Heart Association Monograph No. 28, 1969, which antedates the Inter-Society Commission Report).

CRITIQUE: Limitations of the Statistical Methods Used in the Framingham Study of Risk Factors in Coronary Heart Disease Stephen A. Bauman Consulting Mathematician In the foregoing paper Oster takes as his starting- point a paper by Cornfield, who tried to apply bi\u00ac variate gaussian statistics to the relation between tiirce parameters: serum cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure and the risk of coronary heart dis\u00ac ease.1 In view of the'assumptions necessary with Corn\u00ac field's approach and possible misunderstanding of their application by others? it is first necessary to review Cornfield's methods and his reason for choos\u00ac ing them. The relative frequencies of those who would get coronary heart disease (CUD) and those who would not (NCHI)) as functions of: serum cholesterol level and systolic blood pressure are not known. It is pos\u00ac sible to obtain these frequencies if enough observa\u00ac tions can be made. They can often, but not always, be made in the physical sciences; thev can seldom, if: ever, be made in medicine. In a later paper (not mentioned by Oster). Tru- ett. Cornfield and Kannel- allude to a cohort of per\u00ac haps several hundred thousand persons required for multiple cross-classification analysis of the several risk factors involved in coronary heart disease. This contrasts with the less than .0,000 subjects reported in later Framingham studies and less than 1000 in the earlier ones. Faced with the dilemma of an insufficient num\u00ac ber of observations and a desire to have a decent confidence interval. Cornfield guessed the mathe\u00ac matical descriptions of the CIID and NCHD rela\u00ac tive assumed that both relative fre\u00ac quencies were bivariate log-normal. Mis reasons for choosing these statistics were twofold: a non-rigor\u00ac ous agreement ol his assumption with the observa\u00ac tions as well as computational ease. Thus, instead of having to determine the entire relative frequency functions. Cornfield had only to estimate the means, variances and covariances of the observed data for the CKD and NCHD populations. These relative frequencies cannot be log-normal because an infinite range in serum cholesterol and systolic blood pressure is implied in the first as\u00ac sumption. Results of this assumption which depend on the tails of these distributions should be care\u00ac fully examined. The second assumption states a relation between the CHD and NCHD relative frequencies. This as\u00ac sumption is that these relative frequencies have identical variances,and differ only in their means. While this assumption again has a basis in observed data, its computational significance is tremendous. Bayes' theorem is applied to get the conditional probability distribution function of CHD risk given the serum cholesterol level and systolic blood pressure: F(CHD j Yi, Y.) = in mg/per cent. Y2 = systolic blood pressure in mm. of Hg. P(CHDiY). Y-j) = conditional probability distribution func\u00ac tion of CHD Yj and Y\u00ab P'NCHD) of p(Yj, Y-> j NCHD) = conditional probability densitv function (relative frequency) of Yi and Y; given NCHD p(Yj, YojCHD) = conditional probabilitv density function (relative frequency) of Yi and Y\u00bb given CHD. This expression, which is equivalent to Corn\u00ac field's equation (1), shows that the relative frequen\u00ac cies appear as a ratio. The second assumption means that the exponent of the gaussian exponential must be a linear function \u2014 namely equation (1) reduces to: P(CHD I X*.

Eggs are an excellent natural source of high-quality, well-balanced protein. Leading nutritionists agree, eggs rank right after human breast milk in good- value protein and above cow's milk, meat and fish in their biological value to humans. Why is protein, especially good-value protein, necessary for human consumption? Protein, a vital constituent of every cell, makes life possible and furnishes the building materials for repair of illness, injury or disease. For health protection, antibody formation requires protein. Resistance to infection is reduced when protein in\u00ac take is inadequate. A daily adequate amount of protein, .035 oz. per 2.2 pounds of body weight for an adult, is recommended by the National Acad\u00ac emy of Sciences-Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council. What is protein? Protein is a complex substance made up of a series of twenty different amino acfds \u2014 ten essen\u00ac tial and ten non-essential. The body synthesizes the non-essentials from simple substances; the body must have the essentials to live but it can't manu\u00ac facture them. Complete proteins (animal proteins of eggs, meat and milk) have all the essential amino acids, while incomplete proteins (cereal proteins) are lacking one or more essential amino acids. By eating a variety of health-giving foods, nutritional needs are met. Eggs, which have all of the essential amino acids, contain 12% protein. These essential amino acids are in eggs in such a well-balanced propor\u00ac tion, that they approach the theoretical ideal pro\u00ac tein that is indispensable for humans. For this rea\u00ac son, eggs are used experimentally as the reference standard in evaluating the protein of other foods. The essential amino last two, believed to be required for growth, are especially important for children.) What other nutrients do eggs provide besides protein? Since eggs are a complete food containing high-quality, complete protein (essential amino acids), they are easily digested. Eggs are a source of vitamins A, the B complex, D, E and K; Iron, Copper, Sulfur, Magnesium and Phosphorus. Along with the essential amino acids, a whole egg usually provides 10-15% of our minimum daily requirements for protein, needed fat and vitamins. Mid-morning fatigue results from an insuffi\u00ac cient breakfast of animal protein. Eggs \u2014 every morning \u2014 have a place in your diet. It's desirable that at least one-third of the daily protein intake be derived from animal sources such as eggs. Some high-quality protein, as from eggs and other animal products, should be included in every meal. The tissues must have all of the essential amino acids at one time for cell synthesis. The human metabolic system can't store pro\u00ac tein as it can fats and starches. All unusable protein is excreted. Any combination of food which ex\u00ac cludes eggs and other animal protein won't keep a person in perfect nutritional balance. We can exist comfortably on a minimum intake of protein if adequate starches and fats are provided but the minimum of protein must be present! Generally, 10 to 15 of every 100 calories should be from pro\u00ac tein. You need some egg protein every day. Some food writers, taking their cue from the Ameri\u00ac can Heart Association, have recommended that men limit egg consumption to three per week. Why? There is no scientific evidence whatsoever indicating that eating eggs will increase the risk of heart attack. There is considerable evidence that the opposite is true. It all started when, in 1913, a Russian scientist showed that feeding cholesterol to rabbits could in\u00ac duce heart disease in the rabbits. Rabbits are vege\u00ac tarians and their systems cannot handle cholesterol- containing animal foods. Since then, hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent attempting to prove that dietary cholesterol can induce heart disease in man. Many of these research funds have come from commer- cial interests which manufacture cereals and poly\u00ac unsaturated fat.prpd.ucts, At this point, we can only assume that these statements are stilimade, in the face of overwhelm- ing evidence to the contrary, to keep research funds coming from commercial interests._ The hypothesis on which the anti-egg propa\u00ac gandists base their statements begins with: Since eggs contain cholesterol, eating eggs will increase the blood cholesterol concentration in a person. They further hypothesize: The higher a person's blood cholesterol, the greater the risk of coronary heart disease. Neither part of the hypothesis is valid, based on the scientific information available today. A leading diet-heart researcher has recently said, \"These people are confusing hypothesis with fact and that is a cardinal scientific sin.\" A 1972 official statement came from the Na\u00ac tional Heart and Lung Institute Task Force on Arteriosclerosis. This group of physicians, sup\u00ac ported by the Federal Government, said that any recommendations concerning diet in relation to heart and artery disease are strictly \"intuitive\" and are based only on personal impressions and frag\u00ac mentary conclusions, rather than on scientific proof. Dr. Roger Williams, of the University of Texas, the discoverer of the B vitamin, pantothenic acid, is one of the world's leading nutritionists. In his new book, Nutrition Against Disease, Dr. Williams states: \"A vast amount of investigation and study by agencies of the medical profession support the idea that heart disease can be pre\u00ac vented by better nutrition. On the basis of present information, the best abbreviated advice for pre\u00ac venting heart disease is this: Concentrate on the quality of the food consumed. Whnlesome foods like milk, eggs, fish, and vegetables, which are generously endowed with essential nutrients should take precedence over those processed foods that crowd out the good foods, contribute mostly calories, and provide very little in the way of amino acids, minerals, and vitamins.\" Dr. Williams goes on to say, \"Anyone who deliberately avoids cholesterol in his diet may be inadvertently courting heart disease.\" EGGS AND CHOLESTEROL Cholesterol is a physiologically important sub\u00ac stance in animal tissues. All foods,of animal origin contain cholesterol. Cholesterol is absolutely es\u00ac sential in order for your nerves to transmit their impulses throughout your body. Your nervous sys\u00ac tem could not work without an adequate amount of cholesterol to act as a conductor. In addition to nerve impulse transmission, the body must have cholesterol in order to make sex hormones, of which cholesterol is an integral part. So anytime you eat eggs, meat, milk, or fish you are taking in some cholesterol. Eggs, organ meats (such as liver), and shellfish contain more cholesterol than equivalent portions of most animal foods. Eggs are higher in cholesterol because the primary purpose of an egg is to create new life \u2014 a baby chick. Cholesterol is essential for life. If you were to avoid all the cholesterol you could in your diet, your body would still manu\u00ac facture cholesterol at a fairly steady rate and in a relatively profuse amount. It has been shown re\u00ac peatedly that the less cholesterol a person eats, the more his body produces. It has also been shown that the average person's body will rid itself of just about the same amount of cholesterol as that eaten. Does eating eggs increase blood cholesterol concentration? A temporary increase in blood cholesterol concentration after eating several eggs is normal, just as blood sugar is elevated after eating candy. Both blood cholesterol and blood sugar levels will be back to where they were after a few hours in a person whose metabolism is functioning normally. Research reported in The Journal of Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, in 1953, showed that blood cholesterol will rise after eating a quantity of eggs but, within a few hours, will be back to where it was before eating the eggs.1 Is there a connection between the level of cholesterol concentration in a person's blood and a risk of coronary heart disease? It has not been scientifically established that there is a relationship between blood cholesterol level and the possibility of having a heart attack. Dr. Michael De Bakey, the world famous heart surgeon, in an article in The Journal of the Ameri\u00ac can Medical Association, wrote: \"An analysis of cholesterol values by usual hospital laboratory methods in 1,700 patients with atherosclerotic dis\u00ac ease revealed no definite correlation between serum cholesterol levels and the nature and extent of atherosclerotic disease.\"2 The Food and Drug Administration requires that advertising for drugs to lower the blood choles\u00ac terol concentration, carry this warning: \"An im\u00ac portant note: has not been established whether drug-induced lowering of serum cholesterol or other lipid levels has a detrimental, beneficial, or no effect at all on the morbidity or mortality due to atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease.\" The only area where high risk of heart attack and high blood cholesterol concentration are known to be correlated is in people who have familial hypercholesterolemia. This is an inherited trait and has nothing to do with diet. 1 Ten grams of cholesterol were given to 73 healthy men with breakfast of toast, butter, scrambled eggs, coffee and cream. Serum cholesterol rose to a peak within four hours following administration of this massive dose, returning to normal within 24 hours. 2 JAMA, Vol. 189, No. 9, Aug. 31. 1964; pgs. 655-659 Iffjl m fJswf Ml MM. IsS ifjlll m - M \"Since medical science has not, as yet, even come close to proving that cholesterol in the blood is the cause of heart disease, it becomes ridiculous to postulate that altering the amount of cholesterol in one's blood, especially through diet, will make any difference in the health of one's heart,\" accord\u00ac ing to Dr. Edward Pinckney, a physician and medi\u00ac cal writer.8 In a project reported in the September, 1961, issue of Lancet, the British medical journal, Oliver and Boyd reported a study of one hundred subjects who were survivors of a first myocardial infarction \u2014 a heart attack. For five years, fifty of these men received estrogen to reduce their cholesterol levels and the other fifty were used as controls. Through\u00ac out the five-year study, the mean serum cholesterol level of the estrogen group remained significantly lower than that of the control group, and at the end of the fifth year, the average was 198 as compared to 236 in the control group. The morbidity and the mortality of the two groups did not differ signifi\u00ac cantly during the five years. Eighteen men in the estrogen group and eighteen men in the control group had further myocardial infarctions. As long ago as 1959, another study was done at the University of Western Ontario and its results were presented at the annual meeting of the Cana\u00ac dian Heart Association in Montreal. The following is directly from the summary and conclusion. \"Serum cholesterol determinations have been carried out at least once a year on 800 ambulatory patients who are permanently confined to the hos\u00ac pital. These determinations were begun in 1953 and by April, 1959, there were 191 fatalities in the series. In each of these the severity of atheroscle\u00ac rosis was determined at autopsy in four different arteries and using six different criteria. The mean serum cholesterol level before death was then com\u00ac pared with the severity of disease in arteries of the patients and with the presence or absence of the complications of atherosclerosis that can be de\u00ac tected at autopsy. \"The results lend little support to the conten\u00ac tion that the severity of atherosclerosis is related to the level of serum cholesterol except perhaps when it exceeds 300 milligrams percent. In 58 cases in the age group 60 to 69 years, significant relation\u00ac ships between the level of serum cholesterol and the severity of disease were found only once in 40 statistical analyses and the complications of athero\u00ac sclerosis were just as frequent in cases with low 3 The Cholesterol Controversy, Edward R. Pinckney, M.D., and Cathey Pinckney; Sherbourne Press, Los Angeles, 1973 scrum cholesterol levels (150 to 199 milligrams percent) as in cases with moderately, high ones (250 to 299 milligrams percent).\"4 It is also known that low blood cholesterol level is a fatal syndrome in many human diseases. Other studies which the anti-egg propagandists have chosen to ignore. Dr. Cuyler Hammond and Dr. Lawrence Gar- linkel, of the American Cancer Society, conducted a study on the dietary habits of 804,409 persons who had no previous history of heart disease or stroke. After a six-year period 14,819 of these had died of heart disease and 4,099 died of stroke. The subjects were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of those who ate whole eggs five or more times a week in addition to the eggs consumed in other food preparation. The sec\u00ac ond group consisted of subjects who ate less than four eggs per week or no eggs at all. Those in the second group who ate practically no eggs had more deaths from heart attacks and strokes than those who ate all the eggs they wanted.5 Dr. Sam Berman, a Boston physician, put more than 400 Boston policemen on a weight- reducing diet which included several eggs each day. These men were all obese and mostly middle-aged. After eight years, there have been no heart attacks reported among the men on the diet.6 The program is still going on. A most interesting study about eating large quantities of eggs and the effect on blood choles\u00ac terol levels was done at Highland Hospital, Oak\u00ac land, California, and was reported in the December, 1968, issue of Metabolism. The investigators fed the equivalent of nine eggs per day or more (50 to 110 grams of egg yolk) to thirteen people. Six of the subjects were bedridden but seven were healthy, ambulatory people. Of the thirteen, only two showed a marked blood cholesterol elevation. Both of these were in the bedridden group and had his\u00ac tories of difficulty in the cholesterol-cardiovascular area. The seven healthy, ambulatory subjects had an average serum cholesterol slightly lower at the end of the study than at the beginning. Eggs have something good for everyone \u2014 naturally! * Canadian Jan. 2, 1960, vol. 82, pg. 499 D American Cancer Society, 219 East 42 Street, New York 10017 6 The Boston Police Diet and Weight Control Program, Sam S.

Headquartered at Bethesda, Maryland, NIH is charged with the management of federally-supported research and training programs directed against our Nation's leading health problems. Currently NIH is responsible for support of approxi\u00ac mately one-third of the medical research conducted in the United States. Its purposes are to increase scientific knowledge of the body and the diseases that afflict it; to improve methods of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment; and to increase the health research re\u00ac sources and manpower of the Nation. Some of this research is con\u00ac ducted in federal laboratories at Bethesda and elsewhere, but most of it is supported through research grants or contracts awarded to scientists and clinicians at universities, medical schools, hospitals, and other research institutions throughout the country. The special province of the National Heart and Lung Institute is the conduct and support of research and training programs con\u00ac cerned with the prevention, diagnosis, and relief of cardiovascular and chronic Jung disorders. This booklet is the outgrowth of research in many laboratories; a major part of it was conducted in the Institute's own laboratories and clinics in Bethesda. 11 TABLE OF CONTENTS Page General Introduction_ v DIET 1: HYPERCHYLOMICRONEMIA (TYPE I HYPER\u00ac LIPOPROTEINEMIA) _ 1 Introduction to Diet 1 for the Patient_ 2 Diet for Children_ 3 To the Patient_ 5 Meat, Fish, Poultry_ 6 Low Fat Diet_ 8-9 Sample Menus_ 10-11 Meals Away From 2: HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (TYPE Ila HY\u00ac PERLIPOPROTEINEMIA) _ 13 Introduction to Diet 2 for the Patient_ 14 Diet for Children_ 15 To the Patient_ 16 Meat and Fat_ 17 Polyunsaturated Oil_- 18 Learning to Live With Your Diet_ 19 Low Cholesterol, Modified Fat Diet_20-21 Sample Menus_ 22-23 Meals Away From Home_ 24 DIET 3: HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA WITH ENDO\u00ac GENOUS HYPERGLYCERIDE MI A (TYPE lib OR TYPE III HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA)_ 25 Introduction to Diet 3 for the Patient_ 26 Maintenance Diet Plan_28-35 To the Patient_ 36 Calorie Reduction Plan (Example)- 38 Calorie Maintenance Plan (Example) - 39 Food Groups_40^45 Meat, Fish and Poultry_ 40 Skim Milk_ 41 Breads and Cereals_ 41 Desserts and Sweets_ 42 Alcohol _ 43 Fats and Oils_ 43 iii TABLE OF CONTENTS Fruits and Vegetables_ 44 Free Foods_ 45 Meals Away From Home_ 45 DIET b: ENDOGENOUS HYPERGLYCERIDE MI A (TYPE IV HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA)_ 47 Introduction to Diet 4 for the Patient_ 48 Maintenance Diet Plan___50-56 To the Patient_ 57 Calorie Reduction Plan (Example)_._ 59 Calorie Maintenance Plan (Example)_ 60 Food Groups_ 61-63 Meat, Fish and Poultry_ 61 Skim Milk _ 62 Breads and Cereals_ 63 Desserts and Sweets_ 63 Alcohol _ 64 Fats and Oils_ 64 Fruits and Vegetables_ 65 Free Foods _ 65 Meals Away From Home_ 66 DIET 5: MIXED HYPERGLYCERIDEMIA (TYPE V HY\u00ac PERLIPOPROTEINEMIA) _ 67 Introduction to Diet 5 for the Patient_ 68 Maintenance Diet Plan_70-77 To the Patient_ 78 Calorie Reduction Plan (Example) _ 80 Calorie Maintenance Plan (Example) _ 81 Food Groups _82-86 Meat, Fish and Poultry_ 82 Skim Milk _ 83 Breads and Cereals_1_ 84 Desserts and Sweets_ 84 Fats and Oils_ 85 Fruits and Vegetables_ 85 Free Foods_ 86 Meals Away From Home_ 86 Appendix Bibliography _87-89 Sources of Recipes_ 90 Order Form_ 95 IV DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA General Introduction An abnormally increased plasma concentration of cholesterol or triglyceride is commonly encountered in clinical practice. Such hyperlipidemia may arise from one of many causes. Sometimes it is \"secondary\" to other diseases known to affect lipid metabolism. Typical examples are hyperlipidemia caused by hypothyroidism, insulin-dependent diabetes, obstructive liver disease or the nephrotic syndrome. Treatment is directed toward the causative disorder, not the hyperlipidemia. \"Primary\" hyperlipidemia is that which is not obviously caused by a well-known disease. It may be due to some disorder of lipid metabolism, to an abnormal diet (or abnormal response to a normal diet), to excess alcohol, or to other still obscure causes. Primary hyperlipidemia is sometimes inheritable. Treatment of primary hyperlipidemia is usually undertaken for one of three major reasons: Most commonly it is because hyperlipidemia of certain kinds is associated with a high risk of premature athero\u00ac sclerosis ; this is especially important in certain children and young adults. Another reason, less common but sometimes urgent, is to relieve the recurrent abdominal pain and the risk of acute pan\u00ac creatitis that attend severe hyperglyceridemia. Finally, annoying and alarming skin lesions (xanthomas) may be due to hyperlip\u00ac idemia and frequently can be made to disappear with proper treatment. Proper control of diet and body weight is the keystone to man\u00ac agement of primary hyperlipidemia. Often attention to diet is the only therapy required and it always accompanies any other form of treatment. Dietary therapy is maximally effective when it is tailored to the type of hyperlipidemia or hyperlipoproteinemia. Therefore we recommend that you answer four questions sequentially in han\u00ac dling your patients: 1. Does he or she have hyperlipidemia ? 2. Is it primary or secondary? 3. If it is primary, what type of hyperlipoproteinemia does it represent ? 4. Is it familial? v To assist you in answering these questions, we offer the follow\u00ac ing definitions and recommendations. GLOSSARY C: cholesterol concentration in plasma (mg per 100 ml). TG: triglyceride concentration in plasma (mg per 100 ml). HYPERLIPIDEMIA: excess C or TG, or both. HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA: excess concentration of one or sev\u00ac eral of the lipoproteins that may carry C and TG in plasma. CHYLOMICRONS: particles of newly absorbed (dietary) fat, nor\u00ac mally in plasma only, 1 to 8 hours after the last meal. VLDL: very low-density or pre-/3 lipoproteins that transport trigly\u00ac ceride synthesized in the body. Practically all the TG in plasma not in chylomicrons is considered to be VLDL. LDL: low-density or /3-lipoproteins, normally account for almost % of C and are mainly derived from VLDL metabolism. HDL: high-density or a-lipoproteins, normally account for 14 of C. No pathological significance is usually attached to high HDL concentrations. SECONDARY HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA: elevations in C, TG, or lipoproteins explained by other diseases, including that due to insulinopenic diabetes mellitus. PRIMARY HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA: all that is not sec\u00ac ondary. TYPE OF HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA: refers to abnormal lipo\u00ac protein patterns, does not designate specific disease, but overload of a particular lipid transport pathway, i.e., Type I: loss of enzymatic step in removal of chylomicrons. Type II: excess production or inadequate clearance of LDL. Type III: block in metabolism of VLDL to LDL, causing an ab\u00ac normal \"intermediate\" form of lipoprotein to circulate in plasma. Type IV: excess production or inadequate clearance of VLDL. Type V: VLDL excess combined with poor chylomicron removal. TABLE 1 CONCENTRATIONS OF C, TG OR LDL WHICH, IF EXCEEDED, CLEARLY INDICATE HYPERLIPIDEMIA Age 1-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50- C LDL TG (mg. per 100 ml) (mg. per 100 ml) 230 170 150 240 170 200 270 190 200 310 190 200 330 210 200 VI HOW TO DEFINE HYPERLIPIDEMIA The cholesterol (C) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations deter\u00ac mine whether hyperlipidemia is present. Reliable measurements are now available to all physicians through local, regional, or national laboratories. Accept results only from laboratories that regularly control their analyses by comparison with standards. A reputable laboratory will be glad to answer your questions about its quality control. A few words about the sample. Either plasma or serum will do. For C, it does not matter when the patient had his last meal. For TG, he must have fasted 12 to 14 hours. If you want to have base\u00ac line values, do not sample while the patient is on a diet, especially one causing weight loss. Wait 4 to 8 weeks after a myocardial infarction or similar traumatic episode. If feasible, discontinue hypolipidemic agents, estrogens, steroids, contraceptive pills, or other drugs 3 to 4 weeks before the sample is taken. Other Tests: There are two other tests that are sometimes done in conjunction with the initial C and TG: (1) Electrophoresis: So-called \"lipoprotein phenotyping\" of the four major lipoprotein bands. If your laboratory does this routinely, be certain that con\u00ac current C and TG measurements are made. Patterns interpreted without benefit of C and TG, or which rely solely on the \"percentage of a- and /3-lipoproteins,\" are often worthless. You do not need electrophoretograms to define hyperlipoproteinemia, but good pat\u00ac terns can be helpful. (2) Chylomicron Test: When plasma or serum stands in an ordi\u00ac nary icebox (not a freezer) overnight, any chylomicrons will layer on the top. A \"cream\" layer means a positive chylomicron test. Have your laboratory run this test, or do it yourself. When TG is up, you want this information. Chylomicrons in plasma after an overnight fast are abnormal. Generalized turbidity means VLDL are ab\u00ac normally increased. What is an Abnormal C or TG ? There are no absolute definitions of when C or TG are \"abnormal\" or unhealthy. In taking into account the available information, we suggest two rules that may be followed. Rule No. 1. Obvious hyperlipidemia requiring diligent manage\u00ac ment exists when the values of C, TG, or LDL in table 1 are ex\u00ac ceeded. These limits have been used in studies of familial hyperlipo\u00ac proteinemia. They are set high to include only about 5% of vii individuals in any age group. Any patient whose lipid concentrations exceed these limits has hyperlipidemia, but it is not necessarily of genetic origin. The limits set in table 1 are not adequate for general clinical practice for two major reasons: First, they allow for the increase in lipids with age that occurs in adult Americans as though this were a normal or healthy phenomenon. There is increasing belief that this is not so. Second, epidemiologic data clearly show that individ\u00ac uals with cholesterol concentrations below those shown in table 1 still have an increased risk of premature coronary artery disease. If this information is to have a proper effect on the practice of preventive medicine, we need : Rule 2. Hyperlipidemia deserving some attention may exist when C exceeds 220 mg/100 ml or TG exceeds 150 mg/100 ml. This rule is applicable to all patients under age 55. You may find that a third or more of your adult patients, considered \"normal\" under rule 1, will be abnormal under rule 2. These individuals merit your attention to their general health, family history, and way of life, including dietary habits, weight control, and alcohol intake. Any therapy you recommend will probably involve these latter three factors; rarely will drugs be used. What to do Next with the Abnormals Take a moment here to reconsider whether the patient properly belongs in one of the two categories of abnormals. If the only abnormality is a TG in the neighborhood of 150, are you sure the patient was fasting? Has the laboratory seemed reliable lately? Any uncertainty merits another TG determination with an admoni\u00ac tion about fasting. Has your patient been reported as \"abnormal\" on the basis of an electrophoretic pattern? Such a diagnosis also requires that either C or TG be elevated. A common laboratory error is the report of a \"type IV pattern\" because of a prominent pre-/J band in the presence of a normal TG. In this instance, the excess pre-/3 does not represent VLDL, but an inherited polymorphic form of LDL (\"sinking pre-/?\"). This is a normal variation. Exclusion of Secondary Hyperlipidemia If your patient has hyperlipidemia, next consider whether it is secondary. Take measures to exclude the following: (1) hypothy\u00ac roidism, (2) obstructive (For practical purposes, hyperlipidemia associated with ketosis-resistant diabetes, pancreatitis, obesity, or dietary or alco- vm holic excess is considered primary.) Secondary hyperlipidemia is usually not treated as such. Attend to the basic disease; if it is managed successfully, hyperlipidemia should be reduced or elimi\u00ac nated. Conversion of Primary Hyperlipidemia to Hyperlipoproteinemia When you have found no other obvious disease associated with hyperlipidemia, it is time to localize the C and TG elevations to one or more of the specific groups of lipoproteins that carry the fats in plasma. At the least, this translation of hyperlipidemia to a type of hyperlipoproteinemia helps determine which of the fat transport processes is overloaded (see under Types in Glossary). Sometimes it leads to diagnosis of a specific inherited disease. Above all, it makes management of the hyperlipidemia more rational and often more successful. Proceed now to the appropriate set of C and TG limits that describes your particular patient: TABLE 2 TYPE OF HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA AS SUGGESTED BY C AND TG C C normal; TG high Type Ila Type lib, III, or IV Type III, IV, or V Type I or V Type IV (I or V) C high but TG normal: Almost without exception this combina\u00ac tion means hyperbetalipoproteinemia, or type II\u2014more specifically subtype Ila because the TG is normal. Sometimes mild pure hyper\u00ac cholesterolemia is due instead to very high HDL levels (more likely in females, and especially those taking estrogens). Electrophoresis may help to discriminate between increased /3-LP (type II) versus increased \u00ab-LP (considered normal). Milder forms of type Ila are usually due to dietary indiscretion. Severe forms are more often due to genetic abnormalities, almost always so if accompanied by xanthomas in skin or tendons. Ex\u00ac amine blood relatives, even young children, of patients with type II. In the commonest known kind of familial type II, the inheritance of a single mutant allelic gene causes elevation of C and LDL. Such heterozygotes for this \"monogenic\" form of type II are not rare. You may expect that one of their parents and about half of other relatives will be affected regardless of age. C high; TG 150-/00: Patients with this combination of lipids are IX heterogeneous, but mainly divided between type II (specifically lib, because TG is elevated) and type IV. To separate them, use the nomogram in figure 1. The type lib pattern, with clear-cut LDL elevations, alternates with the Ha pattern in relatives affected with \"monogenic\" familial type II. Other patients with type lib, esepcially those with lesser elevation of LDL, seem to represent several different disorders, some of which are also familial. The hyperlipidemia in these patients tends to be sensitive to the caloric intake and composition of the diet. In this way, it resembles that of most type IV patients, who as a group have VLDL elevations with normal or even sub\u00ac normal LDL concentrations. Admittedly, the clinical distinctions between mild examples of types lib and IV are blurred. You will sometimes see these lumped together under the term \"mixed hyper\u00ac lipidemia.\" They can be separated, however, on the basis of the estimated LDL concentration (fig. 1) ; and this step is recommended, for it assists one to avoid misdiagnosing a \"monogenic type II\" patient and also provides a guide to therapy. As LDL levels move progressively above 170 to 200, one emphasizes \"type II\" diets and drugs that are designed to enhance excretion of cholesterol and its breakdown products. When LDL levels are lower, greater emphasis is placed on \"type IV\" diets or drugs that are aimed at curbing excess VLDL production. C high; TG 400-1000: As TG exceeds 400, the estimation of LDL becomes inaccurate and unnecessary. Most patients in this group are either type IV or V. The chylomicron test provides sep\u00ac aration. A positive test means type V, with the following important exception: IMPORTANT: Patients with a rare type III pattern (\"broad beta disease\") may also present in this group or in the one just discussed. The derived LDL concen\u00ac tration will be false because the lipoproteins are chemically abnormal. A positive chylomicron test is often obtained. You should suspect type III when C and TG vary greatly from week to week but stay close to a 1:1 ratio, and when the patient is an adult and has any combination of mild diabetes, yellow lipid deposits on palms and elbows, and premature peripheral vas\u00ac cular disease. A routine laboratory does not have the tools necessary for establishing the diagnosis of type III although often the electrophoretic strip shows a broad, continuous /?- and pre-/J band. The difficulties of diagnosing type III are compensated for by the ex\u00ac cellent response of such patients to vigorous applica\u00ac tion of treatment. x c 400 350 300 nomogram for estimation of plasma LDL concentration (in terms of mg per 100 ml of cholesterol in this lipoprotein). It is derived from the equation LDL = C \u2014 (TG/5 + HDL), where HDL is assumed to be 45. Lay a straight edge connecting the plasma concentration of cholesterol on line \"C\" and the triglyceride concentration on line \"TG.\" Read the LDL concentration where the straight edge crosses line \"LDL.\" As a rough rule, LDL above 180 means type II. (Example: for a C of 320 and a TG of 250, LDL = 225. This is type II or, more accurately, subtype lib, because TG is abnormally high.) C high; TG exceeds 1000: These patients almost invariably have type V. In the visual chylomicron test, note the turbidity below the cream layer. Very rarely, the infranate is clear. If so, and the patient is a child or young adult and TG exceeds C by at least eight\u00ac fold, you have possibly discovered an example of the rare type I hyperlipoproteinemia. Be suspicious, however; most \"type I's\" are usually type V's that Tiave been misdiagnosed. A consultant can help you confirm the diagnosis by lipoprotein lipase assay. (The enzyme activity is severely deficient in type I, and is usually normal or sometimes moderately depressed in type V.) xi C normal; TG high: Nearly always type IV. Do not be deceived by the ease of classifying this moderate excess in VLDL. It is a troublesome medical problem, for we do not know at present how vigorously this uncertain harbinger of early atherosclerosis should be treated. It is often difficult to eliminate completely the trigly\u00ac ceride elevation in mild type IV. Is the Hyperlipoproteinemia Familial? With one exception, there is no laboratory test that can tell you whether your patient's hyperlipidemia is familial. The exception is measurement of lipoprotein lipase activity in familial type I hyperlipoproteinemia. This is so rare as to be of little practical interest to most physicians. The only way for you to be fairly sure of genetic origin is to examine other family members, particularly parents and children of the patient. Besides improving the specificity of your diagnosis, this has several advantages. First, it tells you whether or not you are treating a disorder that is due to environ\u00ac mental factors alone or to a combination of environment and obvious genetic abnormality. The latter often requires more inten\u00ac sive therapy. Secondly, examination of the family frequently turns up relatives who did not realize they were abnormal. Finally, in some disorders there is a possibility for providing helpful genetic counsel, if the family has been well studied. The knowledge of genetic hyperlipidemia is still very limited. You should be aware that (1) the expression of some abnormal genes may be different in affected members of the same family. An example is one disorder, sometimes called \"combined hyper\u00ac lipidemia\" in which \"pure\" hypercholesterolemia (type hyperglyceridemia (type IV) or hypercholesterolemia plus hyperglyceridemia (type lib) may be present in different members of the same family. Another example may be the frequently observed occurrence of severe hyperglyceridemia with the type V pattern in some close relatives and mild hypergly\u00ac ceridemia (type IV) in others. (2) The expression of an abnormal gene may be delayed until later in life or be greatly altered by some other factor(s). An example is familial type III hyperlipo\u00ac proteinemia; it is rarely seen in children and appears earlier in males except when the female is quite obese or has had premature menopause. (3) The same pattern (or type) may be caused by different genetic abnormalities. An important example is type II hyperlipoproteinemia. Sometimes this abnormality is due to a \"highly penetrant\" single gene defect which appears shortly after birth in about half of the children of an affected parent. The usual pattern is \"type Ila\" and LDL elevations are likely to be severe; tendon xanthomas are very common in the adults. In other in\u00ac stances, familial \"type lib\" patterns may occur that are more xii responsive to weight control and dietary restrictions. The geno\u00ac types and metabolic defects are probably different in these two familial forms. We do not yet know how to distinguish them with certainty. Selection of Diet. We have stressed the difficulties of making a diagnosis of the genetic disorders in the paragraph just above to emphasize the primitiveness of our understanding of the specific causes of most types of hyperlipoproteinemia. Dietary therapy in either genetic or acquired forms is therefore empirical and, to a certain extent, still experimental. The type of hyperlipoproteinemia in the individual patient, and not his suspected genotype, determines his or her treat\u00ac ment. The diets that we recommend here are constructed from the experience of many others in addition to ourselves. We have tested them all and found them to be effective in hundreds of patients on the wards or in the outpatient clinics of the National Heart and Lung Institute. Our experience is much greater, however, with the familial forms than with the \"purely\" environmental forms of hyperlipidemia. We emphasize that the diets in these booklets are therapeutic and are not designed for the general population. No important side effects of these diets are known, although it cannot be assumed that such will not be detected after more experience is gained. When clear-cut hyperlipidemia is present, the possible benefits of dietary therapy presently outweigh any suspected dis\u00ac advantages. In this edition, we have provided five different diets. The numbers of the diets correspond to the five main types of hyperlipopro\u00ac teinemia with one important exception. The treatment of type lib (hyperbetaliproproteinemia with significant hyperglyceridemia) poses a special problem. Some patients will respond well to a diet that places more emphasis on control of calories than of cholesterol or fat content. We recommend that treatment of type lib begin with Diet No. 3. If the result is a minimizing of triglyceride excess but continued elevation of beta lipoproteins (LDL), the stricter con\u00ac trol of saturated fat and increased polyunsaturate content of Diet No. 2 may be required. Use of Diets Before any diet is begun, at least three lipid determinations a week apart should be made to establish a baseline. The results of diet are followed similarly by lipid measurements made every other week for about six weeks. A reduction of 15 percent or greater in cholesterol or glyceride concentration means that the dietary treat- xiii ment is successful and should be continued. The effects of changing the content of the diet should not be confused with those due to simple lowering of caloric intake. Weight loss alone will lower glycerides in most types of hyperlipoproteinemia. The real test of diet is its effectiveness when body weight is maintained. The diets often may not return elevated plasma lipid and lipo\u00ac protein concentrations to normal. If used wisely, however, they will prove effective in decreasing excessive levels in most patients with hyperlipoproteinemia. xiv HYPERCHYLOMICRONEMIA (Type I Hyperlipoproteinemia) The Type I lipoprotein pattern indicates an inability to clear dietary fat (chylomicrons). Type I is nearly always familial and, in its severe form, a rare disorder. It may occasionally be secondary to dysglobulinemia or insulinopenic diabetes mellitus. When the patients are on a regular diet the plasma appears creamy. After standing in the cold, a discrete cream layer forms in the plasma. The plasma cholesterol may be normal or elevated; triglyceride concentrations are grossly elevated (often above 5,000 milligrams per 100 ml). The patients are usually young and may have lipemia retinalis, hepatosplenomegaly, eruptive xanthomas and bouts of abdominal pain associated with ingestion of dietary fat. Diets low in fat result in a dramatic clearing of the hyperglyceridemia and resolution of the associated abdominal complaints. The etiology of the primary or familial disorders is thought to be a genetic defi\u00ac ciency of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme or enzymes released by heparin, and thought to be responsible for the clearing of chylomi\u00ac crons from the plasma. In the familial disorder there is no increased incidence of diabetes mellitus or atherosclerosis. Therapy for the familial disorder is aimed at making the diet low enough in dietary fat to keep the patient asymptomatic and free of recurrent bouts of pain. Often triglycerides of medium chain length (MCT) make an ideal dietary supplement. These fats are absorbed directly into the portal vein and transported to the liver without requiring chylomicron formation for transport. None of the presently available antilipemic drugs have any sustained effects on this exogenous hyperglyceridemia. THE MATERIAL PAGES 5-12 HAS BEEN PREPARED AS A SEPARATE BOOKLET FOR YOUR PATIENT. IT IS ENTITLED DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA\u2014DIET 1. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE THERE IS AN ORDER FORM ON PAGE 95. 1 INTRODUCTION TO DIET 1 FOR THE PATIENT WITH HYPERCHYLOMICRONEMIA (Type I Hyperlipoproteinemia) Low Fat Diet (25-35 grams) The composition of the diet for the adult patient with Type I hyperlipoproteinemia is the following: FAT Fat intake is restricted to 25-35 grams per day. Polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio is not important. CHOLESTEROL Cholesterol intake is not restricted. CARBOHYDRATE Carbohydrate intake is not limited. (It will be high because of the fat restriction.) PROTEIN Total protein intake is not limited. ALCOHOL Not recommended. The reduction of fat in the diet is accomplished by: Eliminating all separated fats such as butter, margarine, shortening, oils, etc. Eliminating nuts Using lean meats Avoiding many baked goods Restricting dairy products containing fat This is an extremely low level of fat and for this reason the fat content of all food has been considered. (The meat allowance is calculated with the figures of 8 grams protein and 3 grams of fat per ounce of meat.) Meat is restricted to about 5 ounces per day contributing approxi\u00ac mately 15 grams of fat. At intakes of 1600-2400 calories, approxi\u00ac mately 10 grams of fat (basic fat) is added to the diet by low fat food items; i.e., skim milk, bread, cereals, vegetables and fruit. The basic fat could be about 20 grams in a diet of a higher calorie content. Adjusting the Diet for the Patient's Needs and Preferences To provide for weight maintenance, only carbohydrate foods can be increased. 2 Diet 1 3 Fat, as a constituent in food, is important for palatability and satiety. The patient may have difficulty following this diet because of the dryness of the diet. The physician's encouragement will be necessary to help motivate the patient. The meat allowance can be increased to 7 ounces per day if: (1) beef, lamb and pork are restricted to a 3 ounce portion 3 times per week (2) the remainder of the meat allowance be either poultry or fish. To make the diet more palatable, triglycerides containing medium- chain length fatty acids (MCT) have been used for patients with Type I. The use of MCT permits a fat intake without chylomicron formation since these fatty acids are taken into the body by a mechanism differing from that used to absorb long chain fatty acids. Suggested ways of using MCT have been included for the patient for whom it is prescribed. (See page 7). DIET FOR CHILDREN UNDER 12 WITH TYPE I The diet for the child with Type I hyperlipoproteinemia is restricted to 10 to 15 grams of fat per day. In practical terms this is propor\u00ac tionally the same restriction as recommended for the adult. Baby Formula for Diagnostic Procedure The following formula is recommended only for diagnostic testing in a hospital. Its purpose is to demonstrate the disappearance of chylomicrons and fall of plasma glycerides to below 300 mg. per 100 ml. that should occur in Type I hyperlipoproteinemia after 3 to 4 days on this formula. The diet should not be maintained longer than 5 days. The formula composition is: fat\u20141% of calories, protein\u201416% of calories and carbohydrate\u201483% of calories. 1 quart of formula: Skim milk\u20143 cups Corn syrup\u20146V2 tablespoons Vitamin supplements (including A) Add about 1 cup of water or bring up to a total volume of 1 quart Calories/quart = 640 Calories/ounce = 20 Pro Fat Cho Composition/100 ml. of formula = 2.7 gms. 0.1 gms. 13.8 gms. 4 Diet 1 Baby Formula for Maintenance After the diagnosis has been established, the following formula may be used as a maintenance diet for small infants. The degree of fat restriction necessary is determined by the patient's tolerance of fat. The composition of the maintenance formula is: fat 14% of the calories, protein 16% of the calories, and carbohydrate 70% of the calories. Skim milk\u20142V2 cups Whole milk\u2014% cup Corn syrup\u20145 tablespoons Vegetable oil\u20141 teaspoon Vitamin supplements (including A & E) Add about 1 cup of water or bring up to a total volume of 1 quart. Beat the mixture with an egg beater or use a food blender. The oil may separate somewhat on standing. Shake the bottle to mix formula before feeding. Calories/quart = 633 Calories / ounce = 20 Pro Fat Cho Composition/100 ml. of formula 2.7 gms. 1.0 gms. 11.5 gms. As the infant's food consumption is increased with solid food, the fat in the formula should be lowered proportionally. MCT may be included if the physician desires. A low fat powdered mixture and a powdered formula with MCT are available commercially. Nutritional Adequacy for Adult and Child This diet meets the Recommended Daily Dietary Allowances of the National Research Council in all nutrients except iron and vitamin E. The diet is extremely low in fatty acids, and as more knowledge about requirements for different fats is obtained modification may be necessary. TO THE PATIENT WITH HYPERCHYLOMICRONEMIA (Type I Hyperlipoproteinemia) (Low Fat Diet) It has been determined by your blood test that dietary fat parti\u00ac cles (chylomicrons) are elevated in your blood. As treatment of this disorder, your physician has prescribed for you a diet that is re\u00ac stricted in fat. This diet will serve to decrease the amount of fat particles in your blood and help you to avoid such symptoms as abdominal pain. This means that you will need to make some changes in your eating habits. Foods that contribute fat in the diet are restricted or eliminated. For example: the amount of meat is restricted, all fats, oils, etc., are eliminated. Dairy products contain\u00ac ing fat and most baked goods are excluded. Fats should not be used in preparing your food. Extra fat in the form of gravies, cream sauces, bacon drippings or butter in vege\u00ac tables, etc., can erase all other efforts to keep your diet low in fat. Eat enough calories to maintain your weight. Calories should be increased with those foods that contain no fat. If you need additional calories, eat more carbohydrate foods (sugar and starches) such as sugar, jelly, bread, etc., and low fat protein foods such as skim milk, egg white and skim milk cheese. The following guide is recommended to help you choose your food wisely in order to insure the nutrients required by the body. MEAT MILK BREADS AND CEREALS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES A sample menu good eating. Include lean, well trimmed meat in your diet but limit to 5 ounces of cooked meat per day. Drink at least 2 cups of skim milk each day. Use whole grained or enriched\u2014choose 4 or more servings daily. (Whole grained or en\u00ac riched bread or cereals are recommended to provide adequate vitamin B complex and iron) Include 4 or more servings. (One serving of citrus friut is recommended to provide adequate vitamin C and one serving of a dark-green or deep-yellow vegetable to provide adequate vita\u00ac min A) is included on page 11. This is a basic pattern of 5 6 Diet 1 DIET FOR CHILDREN UNDER 12 WITH TYPE I The diet for the child with Type I is also restricted in fat. The same foods are allowed or excluded as for the adult with Type I. This diet will vary from the diet of the average American child. The child with Type I must avoid hot dogs, regular hamburgers, french fried potatoes, whole milk, cheese, ice cream, etc. He should drink skim milk and the meat in his diet should be lean. The meat restrictions differ. See below. A sample menu pattern for a child between the ages of 4 and 6 is included on page 10. This is a basic pattern of good eating. Food Allowed See pages 8-9 for the specific foods that can be included in your diet. THE MEAT, FISH AND POULTRY IN YOUR DIET Meat is a major source of fat and must be limited. Fish and poultry (without skin) are naturally lower in fat and should be used in place of meat as often as possible. FOR THE ADULT CHILD 4-6 YEARS CHILD 6-12 YEARS Limit the total amount of meat in your diet to no more than 5 ounces lean, well trimmed, cooked meat per day. Limit the total amount of meat to no more than 2 ounces, lean, well trim\u00ac med, cooked meat per day. Limit the total amount of meat to no more than 3 ounces, lean, well trim\u00ac med, cooked meat per day. ESTIMATING MEAT, FISH AND POULTRY PORTIONS There are 16 ounces to a pound. Raw meat, fish or poultry lose weight when they are cooked. Three ounces cooked meat equals the following: Four (4) ounces of raw meat or fish without bone. Three-fourths (%) cup cooked, flaked or chopped meat, fish or poultry. A ground beef patty 3\" diameter x 1\" thickness, cooked. One half large chicken breast, cooked. One chicken thigh plus one drumstick, cooked. Diet 1 7 BUYING AND COOKING MEAT, FISH AND POULTRY Select cuts which look lean, that is, those having more muscle than fat. Avoid cuts of meat where the fat is distributed throughout (marbled) and cannot be removed. \"Prime\" grade is the most heavily marbled. Lower grades are less marbled and therefore con\u00ac tain less fat. Use lean round or any other lean cut, trimmed, and ground to order rather than regular ground hamburger which is normally too high in fat. Trim the fat from the meat which you select and remove the skin from poultry. Conventional cooking methods such as barbecuing, pan and oven broiling may be used in cooking the meat, fish or poultry as long as no fat is added. Meat to be roasted or baked should be placed on a rack so that the fat can drain. Remove the fat from the meat drippings by refrigerating the drippings until the fat is hardened and can be removed. Gravies may be made from meat drippings that are only natural juice containing no fat. The following suggestions are helpful in keeping the meat moist and well flavored: Use meat tenderizers, marinades and herbs Bake the meat in aluminum foil Cook with bouillon, tomato juice, lemon, vinegar, wine, onion, garlic, spices and herbs WAYS OF USING MEDIUM CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDES (MCT) (If Prescribed By Your Physician) Use in Food Preparation in the Following Ways: Broiling, baking or frying meats, fish and poultry Popping corn Use as an Ingredient in the Follouring Ways: Cooked vegetable seasoning\u2014(add spices, herbs, etc.) Salad dressings Barbecue sauces Cream sauces made with skim milk Marinades Pie Crust Cakes and cookies made with skim milk and allowed eggs 8 Diet 1 Low Fat Diet TYPE OF FOOD FOOD INCLUDED Beverages Coffee, tea, carbonated bev- (Non-Dairy) erages, fruit and vegetable juice.

When you eat out daily, it is wise to select one particular restaurant. Some of your food requires special preparation. A \"regular\" cus\u00ac tomer is more likely to receive special attention. MEAT Ask that all fat be trimmed. The safest choice is a chop, steak, chicken or fish. Request that the meat be broiled without fat. Because your meat is limited, eat a small serving. VEGETABLE Any vegetable prepared without fat may be in\u00ac cluded. None of those that are creamed or prepared in a sauce containing fat, whole milk or cheese may be used. SALAD Most ingredients such as vegetables, fruit or gelatin are allowed on your diet. Avoid olives, avocado, cheese including cream cheese, sour cream or whipped cream. The salad dressing must be fat free; therefore, lemon or vingar should be your choice. BREAD Saltines are usually available. In addition, you may in\u00ac clude plain sliced bread and hard rolls. Avoid hot rolls, biscuits, cornbread, popovers, muffins, etc. because all of these may con\u00ac tain too much fat. BEVERAGE Skim milk is frequently available. You may also wish to have coffee or tea, fruit or vegetable juice or sweetened beverage (cola, etc). DESSERT Fruit and gelatin dessert are listed on most menus'; angelfood cake and fruit ice may be available. Avoid any dessert which might contain ingredients not allowed on your diet such as fat, egg yolk, whole milk and whipped cream. Sugar, jam, jellies, etc., may be eaten as desired. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (TYPE Ha HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA) Type Ha, or pure hyperbetalipoproteinemia is a common pattern found at all ages. It is characterized by an increase in otherwise normal beta lipoproteinemia. Cholesterol levels are usually in the range of 300-600 mg. per 100 ml. The triglycerides are normal and the plasma is almost always clear. Type Ila is often familial and in its most common form is thought to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. Thus, if familial Type Ila is present, it is possible that one parent and half of the patient's siblings and children will have hyperbetalipoproteinemia as well. The Type Ila pattern may also be secondary to excessive dietary cholesterol intake, myxedema, myeloma, nephrosis, or liver disease. When these diseases are ex\u00ac cluded, the patient's family should be screened as well. The lipopro\u00ac tein abnormality is often detectable before age 1 in the familial disorder. Other manifestations, including xanthomas and vascular disease often become evident in early adult life. Xanthomas usually occur only in familial cases. They appear on the extensor tendons of the hands, the Achilles tendons, and the elbows and may be associated with tuberous lesions over the same locations. Corneal arcus may appear at a young age. In the homozygous abnormal subject who has inherited the gene from both sides of the family, all of the manifestations, including xanthomas and vascular disease may develop before age 10. There is no increased incidence of diabetes mellitus in Type Ila Treatment of Type Ila involves lowering the intake of cholesterol to less than 300 mg. per day, decreasing the intake of saturated fats and increasing that of polyunsaturated fats. This is best accom\u00ac plished by the removal of all eggs and most dairy products from the diet and dietary supplementation with polyunsaturated fats. In the adult with familial Type Ila diet usually fails to bring the choles\u00ac terol to within the normal range and it is necessary to add a drug to the regimen. In nonfamilial Type Ila, diet alone may suffice. The combination of drug and diet therapy should bring the plasma lipid concentration down into the normal region in all patients except those who are homozygous for the familial Type Ila abnormality. THE MATERIAL PAGES 16-24 HAS BEEN PREPARED AS A SEPARATE BOOKLET FOR YOUR PATIENT. IT IS ENTITLED DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA\u2014DIET 2. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE THERE IS A PRINTED ORDER FORM ON PAGE 95. 13 INTRODUCTION TO DIET 2 FOR THE PATIENT WITH HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (Type Ha Hyperlipoproteinemia) Low Cholesterol, Modified Fat The diet for the adult patient with Type Ila hyperlipoproteinemia includes the following: FAT CHOLESTEROL A modified fat intake; one that has a high polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio. CARBOHYDRATE PROTEIN ALCOHOL linoleic acid saturated fatty acids P/S ratio The cholesterol intake should be kept as low as possible. The major source of cholesterol should be the meat in the diet. All high cholesterol foods such as egg yolk and organ meats are eliminated. Carbohydrate intake is not limited. Total protein intake is not limited. In contrast to other lipoprotein disorders alcohol is not known to exacerbate Type Ila; it may be used with discretion. Note to the Dietitian: The P/S ratio is calculated by using the aver\u00ac age figure of 2 grams of fat for 1 ounce of meat, fish or poultry. This fat figure is lower because of the restriction of pork, beef and lamb in this diet. Shellfish (except shrimp) are now included in the diet in accordance with recent figures for cholesterol content of food published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (J. Amer. Diet Assoc. 61: 134, 1972) 14 Diet 2 15 DIET FOR CHILDREN UNDER 12 WITH TYPE Ila The diet for the child with Type Ila hyperlipoproteinemia is the same as for the adult with expected proportional differences due to decreased intake of meat. NUTRITIONAL ADEQUACY ADULT AND CHILD This diet meets the Recommended Daily Dietary Allowances of the Na\u00ac tional Research Council in all nutri\u00ac ents except iron. In regard to Vitamin E: Present in\u00ac formation suggests that vegetable oils contain sufficient tocopherol to meet an added requirement for anti\u00ac oxidants associated with high intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It is possible that future studies may in\u00ac dicate a requirement for further sup\u00ac plementation of these diets. TO THE PATIENT WITH HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (Type Ha Hyperlipoproteinemia) Low Cholesterol, Modified Fat (Increased Polyunsaturated Fat) Diet The purpose of this diet is to lower the blood cholesterol. Blood cholesterol has two sources: the cholesterol in the diet and that which is made in the body, predominantly in the liver. There are three major dietary changes which will decrease blood cholesterol in most individuals. These are: 1. Restriction of dietary cholesterol 2. Restriction of saturated fat 3. Increased intake of polyunsaturated fat Dietary Cholesterol is supplied by foods of animal origin. Egg yolk and organ meats are very high in cholesterol. Any food containing meat or meat fat contains cholesterol. Foods of plant origin contain no cholesterol. A Saturated Fat is usually a fat of animal origin. Its consumption usually raises the blood cholesterol, and it is therefore restrict\u00ac ed in this diet. Saturated fat is present in such foods as butter, cream, whole milk, and cheese made from whole milk or cream. Among the few vegetable fats which are saturated are coconut oil and palm oil (used in non-dairy cream substitutes, some frozen des\u00ac serts, etc.) and cocoa butter (the fat in chocolate). Other vegetable oils, un\u00ac saturated by nature, may be made saturated by hardening or hydrogena\u00ac tion. The amount of saturation is indi\u00ac cated by the degree of hardness. For example, a tub margarine is usually less saturated than a stick margarine. 16 Diet 2 17 Polyunsaturated Fats are fats of plant origin. They are thought to help lower blood cholesterol. Vegetable oils vary in the degree of unsaturation. Safflower oil is, for ex\u00ac ample, more unsaturated than olive oil. These changes in eating habits are recommended: Control cholesterol intake Omit egg yolk and organ meats Restrict saturated fat, substitute polyunsaturated fat Instead of the animal fats, use corn or safflower oil and a soft (tub) safflower margarine. Allow 1 teaspoon polyunsaturated fat for each ounce of cooked meat. Plan fish, chicken, turkey, and veal for your menus. Limit beef, lamb, ham and pork to 3 ounces, 3 times per week. Choose skim milk and skim milk products rather than whole milk, cream, ice cream and cheese. Prepared baked goods with egg whites, recommended fats and skim milk to replace commercial goods containing egg yolks, whole milk, and butter or other saturated fat. The Meat and Fat Allowed in Your Diet A. Up to 9 ounces of fish, shellfish (except shrimp), poultry and veal are allowed per day. B. Limit beef, lamb, ham and pork to a 3 ounce portion 3 times per week. C. Consume in some fashion 1 teaspoon of polyunsaturated fat for each ounce (one) of meat. Limiting the total amount of meat (Step A) controls cholesterol and saturated fat. Limiting the kind of meat (Step B) controls the saturated fat. These two controls help lower blood cholesterol levels. Substituting the polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat (Step C) helps to further lower serum cholesterol levels. Note: If it is not possible or practical for you to limit the beef, lamb, ham and pork, the desired P/S ratio may be achieved with this alternate plan. A. Limit all meat to no more than 9 ounces of cooked meat per day. B. Consume in some fashion 2 teaspoons of polyunsaturated fat for each ounce (one) of cooked meat. 18 Diet 2 WAYS OF USING POLYUNSATURATED OIL The polyunsaturated fat (margarine and oil) recommended does not have to be used with the meat. It may be used as desired. You are not limited to this amount. You may use as much polyunsaturated fat as you desire. The fol\u00ac lowing suggestions are offered: Use in food preparation in the following ways: Broiling, baking or frying meats, fish and poultry Popping corn Use as an ingredient in the following ways: Salad dressings Barbecue sauces Cream sauces made with skim milk Marinades Pie crust Cake and cookies made with skim milk and egg whites Cooked vegetable seasoning (add spices, herbs, etc.) ESTIMATING MEAT, FISH AND POULTRY PORTIONS There are 16 ounces to a pound. Raw meat, fish or poultry lose weight when they are cooked. Three ounces of cooked meat equals the following: Four (4) ounces of raw meat or fish without bone. Three-fourth (%) cup cooked, flaked or chopped meat, poultry, fish, crab or lobster. Nine (9) to twelve (12) clams, oysters, scallops A ground beef patty, 3\" diameter x 1\" thickness, cooked One half large chicken breast, cooked One chicken thigh plus one drumstick, cooked BUYING AND COOKING MEAT, FISH AND POULTRY Fish and poultry should be used in place of meat as often as possible. Select cuts which look lean, that is, those having more muscle than fat. Avoid cuts of meat where the fat is distributed throughout (marbled) and cannot be removed. \"Prime\" grade is the most heavily marbled. Lower grades are less marbled and therefore contain less fat. Use lean round or any other lean cut, trimmed and ground to order rather than regular ground ham\u00ac burger as this is normally high in fat. Trim the fat from the meat which you select and remove the skin from poultry. Diet 2 19 Conventional cooking methods may be used in cooking the meat, fish or poultry such as barbecuing, pan and oven broiling. Meat to be roasted or baked should be placed on a rack so that the fat can drain. Remove the fat from the meat drippings by refriger\u00ac ating the drippings until the fat is hardened and can be removed. Gravies may be made from meat drippings that are just natural juice containing no meat fat. Allowed vegetable oils may be added. LEARNING TO LIVE WITH YOUR DIET You are now aware that you are going to have to make some changes in your eating habits. This does not mean that you cannot enjoy good food. Many recipes are available using allowed foods and fat to make it possible to continue good meals. Be a creative cook. Use your imagination. If you question a new product on the market, read the label. Note\u2014 the label stating \"vegetable fat\" or \"containing no animal fat\" or \"non-dairy\" does not necessarily mean polyunsaturated fat. Such a label might refer to coconut oil or hydrogenated fat\u2014both items which you are to avoid. However, you may include any product that contains ONLY those items listed in allowed foods. Do you have a weight problem and are you concerned about calories ? This diet makes no attempt to control your calories. If you wish to lose or gain weight ask your dietitian or physician for assistance. DIET FOR CHILDREN UNDER 12 WITH TYPE Ila The diet for the child with Type Ila is the same diet as that recom\u00ac mended for adults, the cholesterol intake should be kept as low as possible. This diet will differ-in some ways from the diet of the average American child. For example, the child will learn to enjoy such foods as lean meat, fish, poultry and skim milk and exclude from his diet such foods as hot dogs, regular hamburgers, cheese, egg yolk, whole milk, ice cream, etc. A sample menu for a child between the ages of 4 and 6 is included on page 23.

SUGGESTIONS FOR MEALS AWAY FROM HOME When you eat out daily, it is wise to select one particular restaurant. Some of your food requires special preparation. A \"Regular\" cus\u00ac tomer is more likely to receive special attention. MEAT Ask that all fat be trimmed. The safest choice is a chop, steak, chicken or fish. Request the meat be broiled without fat. Limit the amount and kind of meat according to your diet plan. VEGETABLE Any vegetable prepared without fat may be in\u00ac cluded. None of those that are creamed or prepared in a sauce containing fat, whole milk or cheese may be used. SALAD Most ingredients such as vegetables, fruit or gelatin are allowed on your diet. Avoid cheese, including cream cheese, sour cream or whipped cream. You may select a salad dressing such as Italian, French, or oil and vinegar if the waiter indicates that an oil allowed on your diet has been used. Often lemon or vinegar is the wisest choice. FAT Margarine, salad dressings, etc., that are listed in your diet may be selected. BREAD Saltines are usually available. In addition, you may in\u00ac clude plain sliced bread and hard rolls. Avoid hot rolls, biscuits, cornbread, popovers, muffins, etc., because all of these will contain fat which might be saturated. Sugar, jams, jellies, etc., may be eaten as desired. BEVERAGE Skim milk is frequently available. You may also wish to have coffee or tea, fruit or vegetable juice or a sweetened beverage (cola, etc). DESSERT Fruit and gelatin dessert are listed on most menus; angelfood cake, sherbet, and fruit ice may be available. Avoid any dessert which might contain ingredients not allowed on your diet, such as fat, egg yolk, whole milk or whipped cream. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA WITH ENDOGENOUS H YPERGLY CERIDEMIA (TYPE lib OR TYPE III HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA ) (TYPE lib) Type lib hyperlipoproteinemia or hyperbetalipoproteinemia with hyperglyceridemia is a common pattern. See the Introduction (page ix) for a fuller description of the differences between Type Ha and lib. In many of these patients, diet 3 will help control both choles\u00ac terol and triglyceride elevations. For greatest reduction in beta lipoprotein excess, it may be necessary to switch to diet 2. Type III Type III is a relatively uncommon pattern associated with the presence in the plasma of an abnormal form of beta lipoprotein. It is clinically unique and is usually easily differentiated from Type II. It is characterized on paper electrophoresis by a diffuse or \"broad\" beta lipoprotein band. Patients have clear, cloudy or milky plasma with elevations in both cholesterol and triglyceride concen\u00ac trations in the range of 350-800 milligrams per 100 ml. Tendon xanthomas may occur, but tuberoeruptive lesions over the elbows, knees and buttocks are more common. These are frequently asso\u00ac streaking of the palmar creases (palmar xanthomas), a finding that is practically diagnostic. Male patients with Type III have an increased incidence of coronary and pe\u00ac ripheral vessel disease manifesting often before age 35. Female patients tend to develop these same manifestations 10-15 years later. Type III is usually familial and apparently transmitted as a reces\u00ac sive trait. The results of treatment for Type lib and Type III are unusually gratifying. Dietary therapy initially involves a reduction to ideal body weight. The maintenance diet is balanced in fat and carbo\u00ac hydrate (40% of calories coming from each) and low in cholesterol. Diet alone will often bring the plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations into the normal range. If diet proves unable to do so, the addition of certain drugs almost certainly will. THE MATERIAL PAGES 36-46 HAS BEEN PREPARED AS A SEPARATE BOOKLET FOR YOUR PATIENT. IT IS ENTITLED DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA\u2014DIET 3. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE THERE IS A PRINTED ORDER FORM ON PAGE 95. 25 INTRODUCTION TO DIET 3 FOR HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA WITH ENDOGENOUS HYPERGLYCERIDEMIA (Type lib or Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia) Controlled Carbohydrate, Controlled and Modified Fat, Low Cholesterol This dietary regimen requires the following: Step 1\u2014A reduction diet until the patient achieves \"ideal\" weight. Step 2\u2014A maintenance diet with a calorie level to hold \"ideal\" body weight. In this diet the following modifications are made: Controlled carbohydrate intake\u2014approximately 40% of calories. Controlled and modified fat intake\u2014approximately 40% of calories. Cholesterol intake* restricted to as low as possible. Restrictions in the carbohydrate and fat intake are necessary because of the increase in plasma triglyceride concentrations that occur in these patients with an excessive dietary intake of either carbohydrate or fat. Composition of the Maintenance Diets (pages 28-35) FAT 40 to 43 percent of total calories or 70 to 130 grams. The fat intake should not exceed iy% to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight. Polyunsaturated fat is sub\u00ac stituted for saturated fat. CHOLESTEROL Cholesterol intake is restricted. The major source of cholesterol should be the meat in the diet. All high cholesterol foods such as egg yolk and organ meat are eliminated. *Please note that shellfish (except shrimp) are now included in the diet in accordance with recent figures for cholesterol content of food published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (J. Amer. Dietet. Assoc. 61:134, 1972). 26 Diet 3 27 36 to 41 percent of total calories or 135 to 285 grams. Most concentrated sweets are eliminated. The carbohydrate intake should not exceed U grams per kilogram of body weight. 18 to 21 percent of total calories or 75 to 125 grams. This amount of protein is well above the recommended allowance and is classified as a high protein diet. The protein intake should be at least iy% to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight. Alcohol, at the physician's discretion, may be substituted for carbohydrate foods in limited amounts. See page 43. This diet meets the recommended Daily Dietary Allowances of the National Re\u00ac search Council in all nutrients except iron. Diet Protocol Step 1.

Snack: _2_ Servings from breads and cereals group 3 Servings allowed fat To The Patient with Hypercholesterolemia with Endogenous Hyperglycerideinia Type lib or Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia Controlled Carbohydrate, Controlled and Modified Fat, Low Cholesterol Diet The purpose of this diet is to reduce the elevated concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides in your blood. This is most readily done by first reducing the number of calories in your diet in order to achieve ideal weight. Once you have achieved ideal weight, food excesses that may increase triglyceride or cholesterol levels are then restricted. The diet that your doctor has prescribed for you consists of two steps. Step 1. Attaining and maintaining \"ideal\" body weight. WEIGHT REDUCTION\u2014It is important that you be at the most desirable weight for your height and age as determined by your physician. If you need to lose weight, follow the reduc\u00ac tion diet that your physician prescribes until you reach the weight that is recommended. It will be necessary for you to have a bathroom scale. Check your weight regularly; weight control is important! Step 2. Maintenance Diet\u2014Controlled Carbohydrate, Con\u00ac trolled and Modified Fat, Low Cholesterol The second part of the diet prescription is: (1) a control of the carbohydrate foods that you eat. Carbo\u00ac hydrate (sugar and starch) foods are limited. This means that most sweets and desserts are restricted. (2) a control and change of the kind of fat in your diet. The amount of fat is limited. The kind of fat is specified. The average American eats mostly saturated fat. You will eat considerably less saturated fat and eat more unsaturated fat. (3) a low cholesterol diet. This diet is established at a calorie level which will maintain you at your recommended weight. The source of your calories is important. You cannot make substitutions without your physician's or dieti- 36 Diet 3 37 tian's recommendations. If you gain weight, you are consuming too many calories. You must follow the diet as outlined. Now, let's stop and explain some of the terms just mentioned which are important to you and your diet. Dietary Cholesterol is supplied by foods of animal origin. Egg yolk and organ meats are very high in cholesterol. Shellfish is mod\u00ac erately high. Any food containing meat or meat fat contains cholesterol. Foods of plant origin contain no cholesterol. A Saturated Fat is usually a fat of animal origin. Its consumption raises the blood choles\u00ac terol, and is therefore restricted in this diet. Saturated fat is present in such foods as butter, cream, whole milk, and cheese made from whole milk or cream. Among the few vegetable fats which are saturated are coconut oil and palm oil (used in non-diary cream substi\u00ac tutes, some frozen desserts, etc.) and cocoa butter (the fat in chocolate). Other vegetable oils, unsaturated by nature, may be made saturated by hardening or hydrogenation. The amount of saturation is indicated by the degree of hardness. For example, a tub margarine is usually less satu\u00ac rated than a stick margarine. Polyunsaturated Fats are fats of plant origin. They are thought to help lower blood cholesterol. Vegetable oils vary in the degree of unsaturation. Safflower oil, is for ex\u00ac ample, more unsaturated than olive oil. With this new diet you are going to have to make some changes in your eating habits. Be very conscientious in following the diet plan for the day exactly as outlined. Give up those foods which are high in cholesterol. Use unsaturated fats in cooking and with your meals. 38 Diet 3 STEP 1 _CALORIE REDUCTION DIET PLAN (TO BE COMPLETED BY DIETITIAN OR PHYSICIAN) DAILY FOOD PLAN SAMPLE MENU PATTERN __ Servings poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat page 40 _ Servings skim milk page 41 _ Servings bread, cereal, etc. page 41 _ Servings allowed fat page 43 _ Servings fruit page 44 Vegetables (As desired) page 44 Dinner: _Serving poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat _ Serving potato or substitute Vegetables _ Serving bread _____ Servings allowed fat EXAMPLE _ Serving fruit _____ Serving skim milk A.M.

Raw meat, fish or poultry lose weight when they are cooked. Three ounces of cooked meat equals the following: Four (4) ounces of raw meat or fish without bone Three-fourth (%) cup cooked, flaked or chopped meat, poultry, fish, crab or lobster. Nine (9) to twelve (12) clams, oysters, scallops. A ground beef patty, 3\" diameter x 1\" thickness, cooked. One-half large chicken breast, cooked. One chicken thigh plus one drumstick, cooked. 'Shellfish (except shrimp) are now included in the diet in accordance with August, 1972 figures published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Diet 3 41 BUYING AND COOKING MEAT, FISH AND POULTRY Select cuts which look lean, that is, those having more muscle than fat. Avoid cuts of meat where the fat is distributed throughout (marbled) and cannot be removed. \"Prime\" grade is the most heavily marbled. Lower grades are less marbled and therefore con\u00ac tain less fat. Use lean round or any other lean cut, trimmed and ground to order rather than regular ground hamburger as this is normally high in fat. Trim the fat from the meat which you select and remove the skin from poultry. Conventional cooking methods such as barbecuing, pan and oven broiling may be used in cooking the meat, fish or poultry. Allowed fat may be used if desired. Meat to be roasted or baked should be placed on a rack so that the fat can drain.

AVOID Sweetened fruit and juice Buttered, creamed or fried vegetables, unless prepared with allowed fat Diet 3 45 FREE FOODS Bouillon (without fat) Clear broth Club soda Coffee Flavoring essence Gelatin unflavored Herbs Mustard Rennet tablets Soysauce Spices Tea Vinegar Worcestershire sauce The following guide is included to help you select your food on those occasions when you are eating away from home. SUGGESTIONS FOR MEALS AWAY FROM HOME When you eat out daily, it is wise to select one particular restaurant. Some of your food requires special preparation. A \"regular\" cus\u00ac tomer is more likely to receive special attention. Be familiar with your diet and follow the diet plan for the day as specified. MEAT Ask that all fat be trimmed. The safest choice is a chop, steak, chicken or fish. Request that the meat be broiled without fat. Limit the amount of meat according to your diet plan. VEGETABLE Most vegetables are not limited in your diet; how\u00ac ever, avoid those that are creamed or prepared in a sauce containing fat, whole milk or cheese. Ask that your serving of vegetables be prepared without fat. SALAD Most ingredients are allowed on your diet. You may select a vegetable salad. A gelatin salad or fruit salad may be planned within the limits of your diet. Avoid cheese (including cream cheese) and cream (sweet or sour). FAT Margarine, salad dressings, etc., that are listed in the diet may be selected. Limit the amount according to your diet plan. BREAD Saltines are usually available or you may prefer sliced bread or hard rolls. Remember to limit the amount according to your diet plan. Avoid hot rolls, biscuits, cornbread, muffins, etc.; these may contain too much saturated fat. 46 Diet 3 BEVERAGE Skim milk or fruit juice may be selected within the limits of your diet. You may also wish to have vegetable juice, coffee or tea. DESSERT Your best choice is probably fresh or unsweetened fruit. Sherbet, fruit ice, gelatin dessert or angelfood cake are permissible. The amount must be limited according to your diet plan. Endogenous Hyperglycerideinia (Type IV Hyperlipoproteinemia) Type IV is a very common lipoprotein pattern. It is most fre\u00ac quently seen after the second decade of life and often is associated with diabetes mellitus and, probably, premature atherosclerosis. It is characterized by an isolated increase in endogenous glyceride (pre-beta-or very low density lipoproteins). The plasma may be clear, cloudy or milky depending on the triglyceride concentration. Cholesterol levels may be normal; as a rule, for each 5 mg. per 100 ml. increase in triglycerides, there will be a 1 mg. per 100 ml. in\u00ac crease in plasma cholesterol. The patient generally has no external stigmata. Occasionally when triglycerides are very high, eruptive xanthomas and moderate hepatosplenomegaly occur. About 50% of the patients with Type IV patterns have abnormal glucose toler\u00ac ance tests and many will have hyperuricemia. The pattern may be familial and it is likely that several different mutations are respon\u00ac sible. Type IV is also often secondary to other metabolic disorders. Whether this form of hyperlipoproteinemia is primary or secondary it is usually exacerbated by obesity. Diet therapy in primary Type IV emphasizes reduction to ideal body weight. At ideal weight the patient almost always has lower triglyceride concentrations than when he is a few pounds heavier. Sometimes loss of obesity returns triglycerides to normal. At ideal body weight, the diet prescribed is designed to avoid an excess of carbohydrate and alcohol, since either tends to increase endogenous triglyceride concentrations. THE MATERIAL PAGES 57-64 HAS BEEN PREPARED AS A SEPARATE BOOKLET FOR YOUR PATIENT. IT IS ENTITLED DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA\u2014DIET U. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE THERE IS AN ORDER FORM ON PAGE 95. 47 48 Diet 4 INTRODUCTION TO DIET 4 FOR ENDOGENOUS HYPERGLYCERIDEMIA (Type IV Hyperlipoproteinemia) Controlled Carbohydrate, Modified Fat, Moderately Restricted Cholesterol Diet This dietary regimen requires the following: Step 1\u2014A reduction diet until the patient achieves \"ideal\" weight Step 2\u2014A maintenance diet with a calorie level to hold \"ideal\" body weight. In this diet the following modifications are made: Controlled carbohydrate intake\u2014approximately 45% of calories Modified fat intake Cholesterol intake moderately restricted. Carbohydrate foods are limited because of the increase in plasma triglyceride concentrations that often occur in these patients with excessive dietary intake of carbohydrate. Composition of the Maintenance Diet (Pages 50-60) CARBOHYDRATE 44 to 46 percent of total calories or 165 to 315 grams. Concentrated sweets are re\u00ac stricted in the diet. The carbohydrate in\u00ac take should not exceed 4 to 5 grams per kilogram of body weight. PROTEIN Protein and fat intake are not limited AND FAT other than to control the patient's weight. Polyunsaturated fat is substituted for saturated fat. The amounts of polyunsatu\u00ac rated or saturated fats may vary greatly, depending on the amount of meat eaten and the amount and kind of unsaturated fat. CHOLESTEROL ALCOHOL NUTRITIONAL ADEQUACY Cholesterol intake is moderately restricted. Alcohol, at the physician's discretion may be substituted for carbohydrate in limited amounts. See page 64. This diet meets the recommended Daily Dietary Allowances of the National Re\u00ac search Council in all nutrients except iron. Diet 4 49 DIET PROTOCOL Step 1. REDUCTION DIET for the patient who needs to lose weight. See appendix, page 92. Instructions for the Physician: Match this reduction diet to page 3 in the patient's manual. Complete this page in the patient's manual using the appropriate diet plan. Step 2. MAINTENANCE DIET Controlled Carbohydrate, Modi\u00ac fied Fat, Moderately Restricted Cholesterol. This diet is for the patient at \"ideal\" weight. Instructions for the Physician: Select the maintenance cal\u00ac orie plan from pages 50-60. Match this maintenance diet to page 4 in the patient's manual. Complete this page in the patient's manual using the appropriate diet plan. Note: For assistance in determining \"ideal\" body weight and corresponding caloric recommendations, two tables published by the National Research Council in 1968 are included (Inside Back Cover). Note: This diet controls only carbohydrate foods. The patient may not be able to follow this relatively free diet (an indication might be weight gain). Diet 3 can be prescribed in order to obtain stricter diet control if the blood lipids do not fall appreciably.

Snack: _2^ Servings from Breads and Cereals Group TO THE PATIENT WITH ENDOGENOUS HYPERGLYCERIDEMIA TYPE IV HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA Controlled Carbohydrate, Modified Fat, Moderately Restricted Cholesterol Diet The purpose of this diet is to reduce the elevated concentrations of triglycerides in your blood. This is most readily done by first reducing the number of calories in your diet in order to achieve ideal weight. Once you have achieved ideal weight, food excesses that may increase triglyceride or cholesterol levels are then re\u00ac stricted. The diet plan that your doctor has prescribed for you consists of two steps. Step 1. Attaining and maintaining \"ideal\" body weight. WEIGHT REDUCTION\u2014It is important that you be at the most desirable weight for your height and age as determined by your physician. If you need to lose weight, follow the reduction diet that your physician prescribes until you reach the weight that is rec\u00ac ommended. It will be necessary for you to have a bathroom scale. Check your weight regularly; weight control is important! Step 2. Maintenance Diet\u2014Controlled Carbohydrate, Modified Fat, Moderately Restricted Cholesterol The second part of the diet prescription is: (1) a control of the carbohydrate foods that you eat. Carbohydrate sugar and starch) foods are limited. This means that most sweets and desserts are restricted. (2) a change of the kind of fat that you eat. The amount of fat in your diet is not limited; however, the kind of fat is specified. The average American eats mostly saturated fat. You will eat considerably less saturated fat and eat more unsaturated fat. (3) a moderately restricted cholesterol intake. This diet is established at a calorie level which will maintain you at your recommended weight. The source of your calories is important. You cannot make substitutions without your physician's or dieti- 57 58 Diet 4 tian's recommendations. If you gain weight you are consuming too many calories. You must follow the diet as outlined. Now let's stop and explain some of the terms just mentioned which are important to you and your diet. Dietary Cholesterol is supplied by foods of animal origin. Egg yolk and organ meats are very high in cholesterol. Any food containing meat or meat fat contains cholesterol. Foods of plant origin contain no cholesterol. A Saturated Fat is usually a fat of animal origin. Its con\u00ac sumption usually raises the blood choles\u00ac terol, and is therefore restricted in the diet. Saturated fat is present in such foods as butter, cream, whole milk, and cheese made from whole milk or cream. Among the few vegetable fats which are satu\u00ac rated are coconut oil and palm oil (used in non-dairy cream substitutes, some frozen desserts, etc.) and cocoa butter (the fat in chocolate). Other vegetable oils, unsaturated by nature, may be made saturated by hardening or hydrogenation. The amount of saturation is indicated by the degree of hardness. For example, a tub margarine is usually less saturated than stick margarine. Polyunsaturated Fats are fats of plant origin. They are thought to help lower blood cholesterol. Vegetable oils vary in the degree of unsaturation. Safflower oil is, for example, more un\u00ac saturated than olive oil.

This includes egg yolks used in cooking. You may substitute 2 ounces of liver, sweetbreads, or heart for 1 egg yolk. Cheese allowance: You may use 2 ounces of regular cheese, i.e. Cheddar, etc. per week.

Raw meat, fish or poultry lose weight when they are cooked. Three ounces cooked meat equals the following: *Please note that shellfish are now included in the diet in accordance with 1972 figures for cholesterol content of food published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 62 Diet 4 Four (4) ounces of raw meat or fish without bone Three-fourths (%) cup cooked, flaked or chopped meat, poultry, fish, crab or lobster A ground beef patty, 3\" diameter x 1\" thickness, cooked One-half large chicken breast, cooked One chicken thigh plus one drumstick, cooked Nine (9) to twelve (12) clams, oysters, scallops, shrimp BUYING AND COOKING MEATS, FISH AND POULTRY Select cuts which look lean, that is, those having more muscle than fat. Avoid cuts of meat where the fat is distributed throughout (marbled) and cannot be removed. \"Prime\" grade is the most heavily marbled. Lower grades are less marbled and therefore con\u00ac tain less fat. Use lean round or any other lean cut, trimmed and ground to order rather than regular ground hamburger as this is normally high in fat. Trim the fat from the meat which you select and remove the skin from poultry. Conventional cooking methods such as barbecuing, pan and oven broiling may be used in cooking the meat, fish or poultry. Allowed fat may be used if desired. Meat to be roasted or baked should be placed on a rack so that the fat can drain. Remove the fat from the meat drippings by refrigerating the drippings until the fat is hardened and can be removed. Gravies may be made from meat drippings that are just natural juice containing no fat.

The safest choice is a chop, steak, chicken or fish. Request that the meat be broiled without fat. VEGETABLE Most vegetables are not limited in your diet; how\u00ac ever, avoid those that are creamed or prepared in a sauce con\u00ac taining fat, whole milk or cheese. Ask that your serving of vegetable be prepared without fat. SALAD Most ingredients are allowed on your diet. You may select a vegetable salad. A gelatin salad or a fruit salad may be planned within the limits of your diet. Limit cheese as designated. Avoid cream cheese and cream (sweet or sour). FAT Margarine, salad dressings, etc. may be selected as your diet indicates. BREAD Saltines are usually available or you may prefer sliced bread or hard rolls. Remember to limit the amount according to your diet plan. Avoid hot rolls, biscuits, cornbread, muffins, etc.; these may contain too much saturated fat. BEVERAGE Skim milk or fruit juice may be selected within the limits of your diet. You may also wish to have vegetable juice, coffee or tea. DESSERT Your best choice is probably fresh or unsweetened fruit. Sherbet, fruit ice, gelatin dessert or angelfood cake are per\u00ac missible. The amount must be limited according to your diet plan. Mixed Hyperglyceridemia (Type V Hyperlipoproteinemia) The Type V pattern is often seen secondary to acute metabolic disorders like diabetic acidosis, pancreatitis, alcoholism and nephrosis. It may be familial. Type V is characterized by a mixed hyperlipidemia, both exogenous (chylomicrons) and endogenous glyceride (prebeta lipoproteins) accumulate in the fasting plasma. Patients with familial Type V usually have symptoms after age 20 and may have all the features of Type I; i.e., creamy plasma, hepatosplenomegaly, and bouts of abdominal pain, sometimes pan\u00ac creatitis. They have varying degrees of intolerance to both dietary and endogenous fat. On an unrestricted diet, plasma triglycerides may range from 1,000 to 6,000 mg. per 100 ml. The cholesterol will be elevated to a much lesser degree. Abnormal glucose tolerance tests and hyperuricemia are frequently associated with Type Y. Diet therapy emphasizes caloric restriction and reduction to ideal body weight. Sometimes as in Type IV, weight reduction alone will result in normal concentrations of plasma lipids. After weight reduction, the patient also has a greater tolerance to minor excesses of dietary carbohydrate and fat. Upon attainment of ideal weight, a diet limited in both fat and carbohydrate will usually allow the maintenance of plasma glyceride concentrations below 300-600 mg. per 100 ml. The protein content of the diet is unusually high. Patients need frequent encouragement to remain on the diet. Observations of appearance of the plasma is helpful in gauging the effect of treatment. THE MATERIAL PAGES 78-86 HAS BEEN PREPARED AS A SEPARATE BOOKLET FOR YOUR PATIENT. IT IS ENTITLED DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA\u2014DIET 5. FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE THERE IS A PRINTED ORDER FORM ON PAGE 95. 67 INTRODUCTION TO THE DIET FOR THE PATIENT WITH MIXED HYPERGLYCERIDEMIA TYPE V HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA Restricted and Modified Fat, Controlled Carbohydrate, Moderately Restricted Cholesterol Diet The purpose of this diet is to reduce the elevated concentrations of triglycerides in your blood. This is most readily done by first reducing the number of calories in your diet in order to achieve ideal weight. Once you have achieved ideal weight, food excesses that may increase triglyceride or cholesterol levels are then re\u00ac stricted. The diet that your doctor has prescribed for you consists of two steps. Step 1\u2014A reduction diet until the patient achieves \"ideal\" weight. Step 2\u2014A maintenance diet with a calorie level to hold \"ideal\" body weight. In this diet the following modifications are made: Restricted and modified fat intake\u2014approximately 30% of calories Controlled carbohydrate intake\u2014approximately 50% calories Cholesterol intake moderately restricted. Restriction in the fat and carbohydrate is desirable for the follow\u00ac ing reasons: (1) An increase in plasma triglycerides of exogenous origin (chylomicrons) may occur in this patient with excessive dietary fat; this is often associated with abdominal pain. (2) An increase in plasma triglycerides (and very low density lipoproteins) of endogenous origin often occurs in this patient who has an excessive intake of carbohydrate. Note: If the patient has recurrent pancreatitis or is otherwise intolerant to the fat content of this diet, the diet prescribed for hyperlipoproteinemia Diet 1 may be used. 68 Diet 5 69 Composition of the Maintenance Diets (page 71-77) FAT 25 to 30 percent of total calories or 50 to 85 grams. This amount of fat is less than in the average American diet. Polyun\u00ac saturated fat is substituted for saturated fat. The amount of polyunsaturated fat that may be used is limited because of the total fat restriction. The fat intake should not exceed 0.9 to 1.3 grams per kilogram of body weight. The fat level of the diet should be kept as low as is practical. CHOLESTEROL Cholesterol intake is moderately restricted. CARBOHYDRATE 48 to 53 percent or 180 to 370 grams per day. The carbohydrate intake should not exceed 5 grams per kilogram of body weight. PROTEIN ALCOHOL NUTRITIONAL ADEQUACY 21 to 24 percent of total calories or 90 to 145 grams. This amount of protein is well above the recommended allowances and is classified as a high protein diet. The pro\u00ac tein intake should be at least iy% t\u00b0 % grams per kilogram of body weight. Alcohol is not recommended for this pa\u00ac tient (it may be associated with a marked exacerabation in plasma triglyceride con\u00ac centrations and severe abdominal pain). This diet meets the Recommended Daily Dietary Allowances of the National Re\u00ac search Council in all nutrients except iron. Diet Protocol Step 1. REDUCTION DIET for the patient who needs to lose weight. See appendix page 92-94. Instructions for the Physician. Select the low calorie plan from the appendix, page 92. Match this reduction diet to page 3 in the patient's manual. Complete this page in the patient's manual using the appropriate diet plan. 70 Diet 5 Step 2. MAINTENANCE DIET\u2014Restricted and Modified Fat, Controlled Carbohydrate, Moderately Restricted Choles\u00ac terol. This diet is for the patient at \"ideal weight\" Instructions for the Physician: Select the maintenance calorie plan from page 71-77. Match this maintenance diet to page 4 in the patient's manual. Complete this page in the patient's manual using the appropriate diet plan. Note: For assistance in determining \"ideal\" body weight and corresponding caloric recommendations, two tables published by the National Research Council in 1968 are included. See inside back cover.

Note: *8 grams of protein and 8 grams of fat has been calculated for 1 ounce meat, fish or poultry. . **10 grams of carbohydrate has been calculated for V2 cup of any fresh or unsweetened fruit or juice. Numbers of servings within the carbohydrate food groups may be varied for patient preference. (The total carbohydrate level should be maintained.) Figures except for meat correspond to those used in the ADA diabetic diet calculations. One serving of group \"B\" vegetables per day has been calculated to allow for an assumed intake of these vegetables. The patient is allowed free choice of all vegetables except those grouped with bread. It is assumed that the ad lib vegetables will be eaten in normal amounts.

Step 1. Attaining and maintaining \"ideal\" body weight. WEIGHT REDUCTION\u2014It is important that you be at the most desirable weight for your height and age as determined by your physician. If you need to lose weight, follow the reduction diet that your physician prescribes until you reach the weight that is recom\u00ac mended. It will be necessary for you to have a bathroom scale. Check your weight regularly; weight control is im\u00ac portant ! Step 2. Maintenance Diet\u2014Restricted and Modified Fat, Con\u00ac trolled Carbohydrate, Moderately Restricted Choles\u00ac terol The second part of the diet prescription is: (1) a restriction in the amount and kind of fat that you eat. The amount of fat is limited. The kind of fat in your diet is specified. The average American eats mostly saturated fat. You will eat considerably less saturated fat and eat more unsaturated fat. (2) a control of the carbohydrate foods you eat. Carbohydrate (sugar and starch) foods are limited. This means that most sweets and desserts are restricted. (3) a moderately restricted cholesterol intake. Note: Alcohol may be harmful in this type of hyperlipoproteinemia. You should take none unless recommended by your physician. This diet is established at a calorie level which will maintain you at your recommended weight. The source of your calories is important. You cannot make substitutions without your physician's or dieti\u00ac tian's recommendations. If you gain weight, you are consuming too many calories. You must follow the diet as outlined. 78 Diet 5 79 Now let's stop and explain some of the terms just mentioned which are important to you and your diet. A Saturated Fat is usually a fat of animal origin. It tends to raise the blood cholesterol, and is therefore restricted in this diet. Saturated fat is present in such foods as butter, cream, whole milk, and cheese made from whole milk or cream. Among the few vegetable fats which are saturated are coconut oil and palm oil (used in non-dairy cream substi\u00ac tutes, some frozen desserts, etc.) and cocoa butter (the fat in chocolate). Other vegetable oils, unsaturated by nature, may be made saturated by hardening or hydrogenation. The amount of saturation is indicated by the degree of hardness. For example, a tub margarine is usually less satu\u00ac rated than a stick margarine. Polyunsaturated Fats are fats of plant origin. They are thought to help lower blood cholesterol. Vegetable oils vary in the degree of unsaturation. Safflower oil is, for ex\u00ac ample, more unsaturated than olive oil. Dietary Cholesterol is supplied by foods of animal origin. Egg yolk and organ meats are very high in cholesterol. Any food contain\u00ac ing meat or meat fat contains choles\u00ac terol. Foods of plant origin contain no cholesterol. With this new diet you are going to have to make some changes in your eating habits. You must be very conscientious in following the diet plan for the day exactly as outlined; limit those foods which are high in cholesterol. Use unsaturated fats in your diet. 80 Diet 5 STEP 1 -CALORIE REDUCTION DIET PLAN (TO BE COMPLETED BY DIETITIAN OR PHYSICIAN) DAILY FOOD PLAN SAMPLE MENU PATTERN Breakfast: Serving citrus fruit or juice Servings cereal or toast Servings allowed fat Serving skim milk Lunch: Serving poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat Serving potato or substitute Vegetables Serving bread Serving allowed fat Serving fruit Serving skim milk Dinner: Serving poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat Serving potato or substitute Vegetables Serving bread Serving allowed fat Serving fruit Serving skim milk A.M.

Beef Lamb Pork or lean ham Veal Poultry Fish, if canned, drain oil Egg whites and dry (no fat) desired. Clams, crab, lobster, oysters, scallops, shrimp* Specially prepared low fat cheese Creamed cottage cheese M cup is equal to 1 ounce of meat cottage cheese may be eaten as Egg allowance: You may use 3 egg yolks per week. This includes egg yolk used in cooking. OR you may substitute 2 ounces of liver, sweet\u00ac breads or heart for 1 egg yolk. AVOID All fatty meats Bacon and sausages Canned meat products Corned beef Duck and goose Fish roe (including caviar) Commercially fried meats and fried fish Frozen and packaged dinners Frozen and packaged pre\u00ac pared products (con\u00ac venience foods) Luncheon meats, cold- cuts and hot dogs Meats canned or frozen in gravy or sauce Poultry skin Regular ground beef or hamburger Spareribs Egg yolk Cheese (including cream cheese) Organ meat Except As Specified Above ESTIMATING MEAT, FISH AND POULTRY PORTIONS There are 16 ounces to a pound. Raw meat, fish or poultry lose weight when they are cooked. Three ounces cooked meat equals the following: Four (4) ounces of raw meat or fish without bone Three-fourths (%,) cup cooked, flaked or chopped meat, poultry, or fish, crab, lobster. Nine (9) to twelve (12) clams, oysters, scallops, shrimp A ground beef patty, 3\" diameter x 1\" thickness, cooked One half large chicken breast, cooked One chicken thigh plus one drumstick, cooked Please note that shellfish are now included in the diet in accordance with 1972 figures for cholesterol content of food published by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Diet 5 83 BUYING AND COOKING MEAT, FISH AND POULTRY Select cuts which look lean, that is, those having more muscle than fat. Avoid cuts of meat where the fat is distributed throughout (marbled) and cannot be removed. \"Prime\" grade is the most heavily marbled. Lower grades are less marbled and therefore contain less fat. Use lean round or any other lean cut, trimmed and ground to order rather than regular ground hamburger as this is normally high in fat. Trim the fat from the meat which you select and remove the skin from poultry. Conventional cooking methods such as barbecuing, pan and oven broiling may be used,in cooking the meat, fish or poultry. Meat to be roasted or baked should be placed on a rack so that the fat can drain. Remove the fat from the meat drippings by refrigerating the drippings until the fat is hardened and can be removed. Gravies may be made from meat drippings that are just natural juice con\u00ac taining no fat. SKIM MILK Any one of the following is a serving: Skim milk, or 99 % fat free\u20141 cup Buttermilk made from skim milk\u20141 cup Dry powdered skim milk\u20141/3 cup reconstituted to 1 cup liquid Evaporated skim milk\u20141/2 cup undiluted 1 cup yogurt made from skim milk AVOID Whole milk Condensed milk Dried whole milk Evaporated whole milk Whole milk drinks Commercial whipped toppings Cream (sweet or sour) Cream substitutes Ice cream and ice milk 84 Diet 5 BREADS AND CEREALS Any one of the following is a serving: *1 slice whole grained or en\u00ac riched bread 3/i ounce bread sticks, rye wafers or pretzels 2 graham cracker (2V2\" square) 3 soda crackers (21/2\" square) 5 saltines (2\" square) 20 oyster crackers (1/2 cup) 1/2 hamburger or hot dog roll 1 small or V2 large hard roll 1 piece matzo (6\" square) 4 pieces melba toast (31/4\" x 114\" Vs\" 3 tablespoons flour or cornmeal or dry grated bread crumbs Vs cup corn or V2 large ear of corn on the cob 1/2 cup cooked, dried peas, beans, lentils, chick peas or lima beans 1 small white baked potato or 14 cup mashed 1/2 cup cooked spaghetti, rice or noodles 1/2 cup (cooked) cereal 3A cup ready to eat (dry) cereal 11/2 cups popcorn, popped (no fat) 1/4 cup baked beans (no pork) Made with allowed ingredients: 1 Biscuit (2\" diameter)\u2014[omit 1 serving from fats and oils] 1 Muffin (3\" diameter)\u2014[omit 1 serving from fats and oils] 1/2 Waffle (7\" diameter)\u2014[omit 1 serving from fats and oils] 2 Pancakes (4\" diameter)\u2014 [omit 1 serving from fats and oils] *Whole grained or enriched cereal or bread should be included in the diet to provide adequate vitamin B complex and iron. AVOID Butter rolls, cheese or egg breads Corn chips, potato chips, fla\u00ac vored crackers Soups other than those listed Commercial biscuits, muffins, doughnuts, sweet rolls, pan\u00ac cakes, waffles unless made .as specified DESSERTS AND SWEETS Sugar, except for calorie content, contributes insignificant nutritive value to the diet\u2014in addition, some investigators feel that excessive consumption of sugar increases blood lipids (triglycerides). For these reasons, it is probably wise to avoid, or at least limit sugar as much as possible. Limit desserts to no more than 2 servings per day. Any one of the following is 1 serving and may be exchanged for 1 serving from the Bread and Cereals Group. 1V%\" cube angel food cake V2 CUP plain puding, prepared Vs cup gelatin dessert with skim milk Vl cup sherbet or fruit ice Diet 5 85 If desired and approved by your physician, 1 serving of the follow ing may be substituted for 1 serving of dessert: Limit 1 serving per day. 1 tablespoon of: sugar, honey, molasses, syrup, jam, pre\u00ac serves and jellies 1/2 ounce of: jelly beans, gum drops, hard candy, marshmal\u00ac lows and mints (not choco\u00ac late) AVOID Commercial cakes, pies and cook\u00ac ies, including mixes 6 oz. of one of the following car\u00ac bonated, sweetened beverages: cola type, gingerale or root beer 3 oz. of fruit flavored sodas and Tom Collins mixes Other candies Chocolate FATS AND OILS Each of the following in the amounts listed is considered one serving: 1 Teaspoon of any vegetable oil (except coconut oil) 1 Teaspoon \"special prepared\" margarine* 1 Teaspoon commercial mayonnaise 1 Tablespoon coarsely chopped nuts 1 Tablespoon commercial salad dressings containing no sour cream or cheese Vs Avocado (4\" diameter) 5 Small olives 2 Teaspoons peanut butter *Margarine made from one of the allowed oils.

One serving of citrus fruit is recommended daily to provide ade\u00ac quate vitamin C. 86 Diet 5 Vegetables: Any fresh, frozen or canned without added fat or sauces. One dark-green or deep-yellow vegetable is recommended daily to provide adequate vitamin A. Most vegetables are not limited; however, it is expected that they be eaten in normal amounts, that is, medium sized servings should be selected. Potatoes, corn, lima beans, dried peas and beans are limited as designated in the Breads and Cereals Group. See page 84. AVOID Sweetened fruit and juice Buttered, creamed or fried allowed fat FREE FOODS Mustard Rennet tablets Soysauce Spices Tea vegetables, unless prepared with Vinegar Worcestershire sauce Bouillon (without fat) Clear broth The following guide is included to help you select your food on those occasions when you are eating away from home. SUGGESTIONS FOR MEALS AWAY FROM HOME Club soda Coffee Flavoring essence Gelatin, unflavored Herbs When you eat out daily, it is wise to select one particular restaurant. Some of your food requires special prepartion. A \"regular\" cus\u00ac tomer is more likely to receive special attention. Be familiar with your diet and follow the diet plan for the day as specified. MEAT Ask that all fat be trimmed. The safest choice is a chop, steak, chicken or fish. Request that the meat be broiled without fat. Limit the amount of meat according to your diet plan. VEGETABLE Most vegetables are not limited in your diet; how\u00ac ever, avoid those that are creamed or prepared in a sauce containing fat,, whole milk or cheese. Ask that your serving of vegetable be prepared without fat. SALAD Most ingredients are allowed on your diet. You may select a vegetable salad. A gelatin salad or a fruit salad may be planned within the limits of your diet. Avoid cheese (including cream cheese) and cream (sweet or sour). FAT Margarine, salad dressings, etc. that are listed in the diet may be selected. Limit the amount according to your diet plan. BREAD Saltines are usually available or you may prefer sliced bread or hard rolls. Avoid hot rolls, biscuits, cornbread, muffins, etc., which may contain too much saturated fat. BEVERAGE Skim milk or fruit juice may be selected within the limits of your diet. You may also wish to have vegetable juice, coffee or tea. DESSERT Your best choice is'probably fresh or unsweetened fruit, sherbet, fruit ice, gelatin dessert or angelfood cake are per\u00ac missible. The amount must be limited according to your diet plan.

During weight reduction, blood lipids will likely fall regardless of the composition of the diet. These sample reduction diets are included in the appendix as a convenience for the physician. These diets may be used to achieve weight reduction in patients with either Types lib, III, IV, or V hy\u00ac perlipoproteinemia. For convenience and simplicity, these reduction diets are planned using unsaturated fat and limiting cholesterol. Whenever possible, the diet should be individualized for the patient. Nutritional Adequacy: The reduction diets meet the Recommended Daily Dietary Allow\u00ac ances except for the following: The 800, 1200, 1400 calorie reduction diets, if prescribed for women are nutritionally inadequate in iron. The 800 calorie reduction diet is nutritionally inadequate in thiamine, riboflavin and niacin for men. Some of the reduction diets may be inadequate in Vitamin E. 91 92 SAMPLE 800 CALORIE REDUCTION DIET PLAN DAILY FOOD PLAN SAMPLE MENU PATTERN 2_ Servings (6 ounces) poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat J2 Servings (2 cups) skim milk Serving bread, cereal, etc. Serving (teaspoon) fat 3^ Servings fruit Vegetables Breakfast: _1 Serving citrus fruit or juice _1 Serving cereal or toast _1 Serving allowed fat _1 Serving skim milk Coffee or tea if desired Lunch: _1 Serving poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat Vegetable _1 Serving fruit Coffee or tea if desired Dinner: _1 Serving poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat Vegetable _1 Serving fruit 1 Serving skim milk 93 SAMPLE 1200 CALORIE REDUCTION DIET PLAN DAILY FOOD PLAN 2^ Servings (6 ounces) poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat 2^ Servings (2 cups) skim milk 4 Servings bread, cereal, etc. Servings (teaspoons) fat 3 Serving fruit Vegetables SAMPLE MENU PATTERN _1 Serving citrus fruit or juice Servings cereal or toast Serving allowed fat Serving skim milk Coffee or tea if desired 2 1 1 Lunch: _1_ Serving poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat _1_ Serving potato or susbtitute Vegetable _2_ Servings allowed fat _1_ Serving fruit Coffee or tea if desired Dinner: _1_ Serving poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat Vegetable _1 Serving bread _2 Servings allowed fat 1 Serving fruit 1 Serving skim milk 94 SAMPLE 1400 CALORIE REDUCTION DIET PLAN DAILY FOOD PLAN 2^ Servings (6 ounces) poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat 2_ Servings (2 cups) skim milk <5 Servings bread, cereal, etc. 8 Servings (teaspoons) fat 3 Servings fruit vegetables Lunch: 1 SAMPLE MENU PATTERN Breakfast: _1_ Serving citrus fruit or juice _2_ Servings cereal or toast _2_ Servings allowed fat _1_ Serving skim milk Coffee or tea if desired Serving poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat _1 Serving potato or substitute Vegetable _1 Serving whole grained or enriched bread _3 Servings allowed fat _1_ Serving fruit Coffee or tea if desired Dinner: _1 Serving poultry, fish or lean trimmed meat Vegetable _1 Serving bread _3 Servings allowed fat _1 Serving fruit 1 Serving skim milk 95 Office of Information National Heart and Lung Institute National Institutes of Health Bethesda, Maryland 20014 Gentlemen: I am interested in your publications concerning the DIETARY MANAGEMENT OF HYPERLIPOPROTEINEMIA.

AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION \u00a9 1973 American Heart Association The multi-faceted etiology of atheroscler\u00ac otic coronary heart disease has been amply documented and repeatedly emphasized. The American Heart Association statement on \"Risk Factors and Coronary Disease\"1 describes the factors known to be associ\u00ac ated with the risk of future coronary disease. Some risk factors (sex, advancing age, heredity) cannot be modified, while others (underlying disease, stress, personality traits) may be difficult to adjust and still others (diet, hypertension, smoking, exer\u00ac cise) are more amenable to alteration. In well-documented population studies using standard methods of diet and coro\u00ac nary disease assessment, no populations habitually subsisting on low saturated fat diets have an appreciable amount of coro\u00ac nary disease.2 This evidence suggests that a high saturated fat diet is an essential fac\u00ac tor for a high incidence of coronary heart disease and that other risk factors are im\u00ac portant contributory causes. For example, in the United States, where the diet is gen\u00ac erally high in saturated fats, hypertension and cigarette smoking are the most power\u00ac ful risk influences. The data from these studies, as well as that from early con\u00ac trolled trials,3-7 provides sufficient evidence to warrant taking prudent action at this time, in the population at large. This pamphlet addresses itself to the re\u00ac lationship of habitual diet to coronary heart disease and makes appropriate suggestions for dietary modifications. The three previous statements on this subject by the American Heart Association are brought up to date by this report.8 A definitive, full-scale prospective study of the effect of diet on the prevention of coronary heart disease has not been under\u00ac taken although a preliminary feasibility study was completed. After thorough study in 1971, the National Heart and Lung Insti\u00ac tute Task Force on Arteriosclerosis decided against a nationwide controlled diet study. Instead, the National Heart and Lung In\u00ac stitute has recently implemented several limited prospective studies on specific aspects of this problem. Current knowledge and understanding are based on published findings of world-wide epidemiologic studies, prospective studies in selected populations, prolonged treatment of per\u00ac sons who have had myocardial infarctions or elevations in serum cholesterol and ani\u00ac mal studies.2-7'9'16 It is recognized that the data derived from such investigations do not permit unequiv\u00ac ocal conclusions. Nevertheless, the evi\u00ac dence is strong enough to show that elevated levels of lipoproteins containing cholesterol and triglyceride do lead to ac\u00ac celerated rates of atherogenesis. At a cho\u00ac lesterol level of 250 mg/100 ml. or higher- common in American adults\u2014the risk of de\u00ac veloping coronary heart disease is twice that of persons with levels under 220 mg/ 100 ml.17 It is urged that determination of the lipid profile, and particularly serum choles\u00ac terol, be made part of all health-mainte\u00ac nance examinations for both men and women beginning in early adult life. A recent joint statement by the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sci\u00ac ences, and the Council on Foods and Nutri\u00ac tion of the American Medical Association stresses that the average level of the plasma lipids of most American men and women is undesirably high and that reasonable means must be adopted to reduce the con\u00ac ditions that contribute to coronary heart disease. \"The evidence now available is sufficient to discourage further temporiz\u00ac ing with this major national health prob\u00ac lem.\"18 Since dietary modifications do influence serum cholesterol and triglycer\u00ac ides, they must be considered important preventive and therapeutic measures. More\u00ac over, it is possible to plan changes in diet which are palatable, effective, economical\u00ac ly feasible, nutritionally sound, and appli\u00ac cable throughout most of life. Persons who have severe aberrations in serum lipoproteins may require more strin\u00ac gent control of diet with or without drug therapy. This is a matter for the individual judgment of a physician with the help of a s. 2 nutritionist or dietitian. Diets for the man\u00ac agement of patients with marked lipoprotein abnormalities have been developed and are available from the National Heart and Lung Institute, but the great majority of blood lipid problems do not require lipoprotein typing.19 The American Heart Association20 and others2122 have also prepared modifi\u00ac cations of the basic fat-controlled diet for the management of specific severe prob\u00ac lems, but the general recommendations noted below are effective in lowering the lipids of most people.23 GENERAL DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS 1. A Caloric Intake Adjusted to Achieve and Maintain Ideal Body Weight. Although obesity alone may not relate to coronary heart disease, if it occurs in conjunction with hypertension, hyperglycemia, or hypercholesterolemia, it significantly in\u00ac creases the risk of the disease. Correc\u00ac tion of obesity often results in a reduced serum lipid level, decrease in blood pres\u00ac sure, and improved glucose toler\u00ac ance.2425 Avoidance of obesity, or a supervised weight reduction program for those above their ideal body weight, is strongly recommended. 2. A Reduction in Total Fat Calories Achieved by a Substantial Reduction in Dietary Saturated Fatty Acids. Reduction from the usual 40%-45% of total calories from fat to no more than 35% is desirable. Of that amount, less than 10% of the total calories should come from saturated fatty acids and up to 10% from polyunsatu\u00ac rated fatty acids. When these proportions are achieved, the remainder of the in\u00ac gested fat is derived from monounsatu- rated sources.26 It is generally suggested that the fat calories should be distributed throughout each day and that a massive high saturated fat meal is inappropriate at any time. The Food and Drug Adminis\u00ac tration has recently published regulations allowing manufacturers to state on the labels the fat and cholesterol content of packaged foods.27 These labeling changes should greatly help the consumer. 3. A Substantial Reduction in Dietary Cho\u00ac lesterol. Dietary cholesterol is a substan\u00ac tial contributor to total body cholesterol, although a major portion is endogenously synthesized.28'33 A reduction in the serum cholesterol level can be effected by die\u00ac tary cholesterol only when its intake is very sharply restricted. Therefore, it is recommended that the average daily in\u00ac take of cholesterol approximate 300 mg. For persons with severe hypercholes\u00ac terolemia, an even greater reduction may be warranted. Since cholesterol is pres\u00ac ent in most foods from animal sources, care must be taken to assure adequate protein intake if severe cholesterol re\u00ac striction is undertaken. 4. Dietary Carbohydrate. When the propor\u00ac tion of calories from fat in the diet is re\u00ac duced, the caloric difference will generally be made up with carbohydrate. Dependence on foods containing com\u00ac plex natural carbohydrates, such as veg\u00ac etables, fruits, and cereals, is preferable to excessive use of refined sugar such as that contained in candy, soft drinks, and other sweets. This recommendation aims at the limitation of concentrated \"empty\" calories, i.e., foods providing only cal\u00ac ories without vitamins and other essen\u00ac tial nutrients. Reduction of the dietary fat intake to no more than 35% of total cal\u00ac ories requires a modest increase in car\u00ac bohydrate which will have a minimal effect on the serum triglycerides of most individuals.34 There are many population groups habitually consuming similar diets in whom serum lipids, including triglycerides, are low.35'36 5. Salt Intake. The acceleration of coronary heart disease in the presence of hyper\u00ac tension is well recognized,37 but the causal relationship in man between salt 3 intake and hypertension has not been firmly established. Information available to date from experimental human and ani\u00ac mal data suggests that it is prudent to avoid excessive salt in the diet.38 In the control of established hypertension, con\u00ac gestive heart failure, or edema, the level of salt restriction imposed must be based on the patient's response. 6. Other Dietary Factors. Although there is great interest in the possible role of other dietary factors (trace minerals, hardness of water, vitamin intake) in the develop\u00ac ment of coronary heart disease, the avail\u00ac able evidence does not permit specific recommendations to be made at thistime. These matters are the subject of continu\u00ac ing review within the American Heart As\u00ac sociation and elsewhere. CONCLUSION The development and progression of cor\u00ac onary heart disease is influenced by many factors of heredity, environment, and life\u00ac style. Among these factors, a diet rich in calories, saturated fat, and cholesterol can contribute to hyperlipidemia and obesity. There is substantial evidence that the diets recommended herein will aid in the control of serum lipid levels in man. Present evidence also suggests that maintaining serum lipids at reduced levels will lower the incidence of heart attacks caused by atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries. Diets similar to those recommended have been consumed by many persons in the United States for periods of more than ten years without any evidence, clinical or bio\u00ac chemical, of harmful effects. World-wide population studies have yielded similar findings. In the application of these recommenda\u00ac tions to family groups, any change in the diet must preserve the principles of good nutrition. Although nutritional requirements differ during the various stages of the nor\u00ac mal life cycle, the demands for optimal nutrition during periods of growth and de\u00ac velopment of infants, children, and adoles\u00ac cents, and of pregnant and lactating women can be met by appropriate modifications of the foregoing recommendations. Dietary habits which are formed during the develop\u00ac ing years may continue lifelong and influ\u00ac ence the severity of atherosclerosis in later life. This statement is designed primarily for use by the medical community. A more de\u00ac tailed discussion of this subject is con\u00ac tained in the recent report of the Inter- Society Commission for Heart Disease Resources17 and the report of the special Advisory Committee to the National Heart and Lung Institute. The latter states \"Pend\u00ac ing confirmation by appropriate diet or drug trial, it, therefore, would appear prudent for the American people to follow a diet aimed at lowering serum lipid concentrations. For most individuals, this can be achieved by lowering intake of calories, cholesterol, and saturated fats.\"39 The American Heart Asso\u00ac ciation has translated these dietary recom\u00ac mendations into several publications which are available to the general public and to patients through local Heart Associations and the National Office of the American Heart Association: For patients, on a doctor's prescription only: \"Planning for 288A) \"A Approach to the Dietary Treat\u00ac ment of the Hyperlipidemias\", a hand\u00ac book for physicians and four diets for patients, to be published (EM 585, A, B, C, D) For the general public, no prescription re\u00ac quired: Two companion booklets, \"The Way to a Man's 455) Fat-Controlled, Low Choles\u00ac terol Meals\" (EM 455A) All of the publications listed above are available to physicians, dietitians, nutrition\u00ac ists, and others in related professions. 4 REFERENCES 1.

And smoking... you know you should give up cigarettes but it is hard. And you probably should cut back on drinking somewhat too. It sort of reminds one of the old saw. \"Everything I like is either illegal, immoral or fattening\" \u2014 and makes one wonder what's next! What's \"next\" \u2014 in fact, it's \"now\" \u2014 is that there are those who may advocate \u2014 some even for profit \u2014 cutting down on eggs be\u00ac cause of their cholesterol content. So we thought we'd offer a few facts about what people are being asked to give up \"now.\" 1. Cholesterol is the building block of sex hormones. 2. Cholesterol is needed for the nerves to transmit their impulses throughout the body. 3. Cholesterol is essential for life for every cell in the body. 4. The less cholesterol one eats, the more cholesterol the body produces because a person's system needs cholesterol. 5.

Copyright \u00a9 by Lea & Febiger, 1974 Chapter 1 l*r(h- PROGRESS IN THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PREVENTION OF CORONARY HEART DISEAS Henry Blackburn, M.D. The classical \"up-the-river-from-New-Or- leans\" version of the history of American jazz is a logical and accurate one, as far as it goes, but it misses much of the emotional turmoil, the side battles, and the excitement of the whole development. Similarly, this view of the recent progress in cardiological thought about the epidemiology and prevention of coronary heart disease (GHD) is concerned not with a classical review of the evidence but rather with the present intellectual excite\u00ac ment, questions, and controversies. It is a problem-oriented and personal approach rather than a traditional one. Excellent and thoroughgoing recent reviews of the epi\u00ac demiological evidence and the status of CHD prevention are available and highly recom\u00ac mended.17'18'64'68'69'73 The present state of progress in cardio\u00ac vascular epidemiology includes the overriding * Some of the data and conclusions herein were ob\u00ac tained through support from National Heart and Lung Institute awards (HE 04997; HL 04697; PH 86-64-110; HE 11898; HE 10194), and from the American Heart Association, the Ober Chari\u00ac table Trust Fund, and the Mutual Service Scholar\u00ac ship in Preventive Cardiology. demonstration that there are vast differences in the frequency of CHD among populations and that the risk of the disease varies enor\u00ac mously according to the burden of individual or population risk characteristics. Cardiology, in concert with disciplines from preventive medicine, has arrived at the stage of knowl\u00ac edge in which major preventive trials are considered indicated and imperative.75 These will demonstrate whether individuals and populations at apparently high risk can be converted to lower levels of risk by direct intervention on the risk factors, that is, by prophylactic treatment. These ideas, simple like most important ideas, confront the medi\u00ac cal profession and the public with one of their finest challenges. It is now a part of the mainstream of cardiology to participate in this adventure, to test whether significant reduction is possible of one of the most costly of man's diseases. THE PROBLEM The essentiality of a preventive approach to CHD is clear from what we know of the insidious nature of the atherosclerotic process, 1 2 Progress in Cardiology leading, late in the game, to sudden death or severe organ damage. Once stricken with a manifest coronary event, the early mortality is high. Moreover, the risk of recurrent coronary events and death remains forever excessive among those fortunate enough to survive the first attack. The most aggressive and effective medical or surgical therapy di\u00ac rected toward coronary disease after it be\u00ac comes symptomatic can have, by the very nature of the disease, no large overall favor\u00ac able effect on the rate of sudden death outside the hospital; it can have only small impact on survival of coronary patients beyond the first year, and it can have little impact at all on the epidemic rate of CHD in the United States. Several obvious facts should lead us to humility, though not to inactivity, about the impact of current CHD therapy. One cen\u00ac tral fact is that we have no evidence that the overall mortality rate for CHD has turned downward since the widespread introduction of intensive coronary care and the accession of \"modern\" management, including myo\u00ac cardial revascularization. We should have data before long. This is by no means to dis\u00ac parage the important contribution of inten\u00ac sive coronary care in reducing hospital mor\u00ac tality. Coronary care may have some in\u00ac fluence for as long as a couple of years on survival after infarction.27 However, special coronary care could, in fact, actually increase the pool of those most susceptible to sudden coronary death outside hospitals. The reader will here permit me, hopefully, to engage in a bit of speculation as in Table 1 about only the first-year mortality rate from first attacks of myocardial infarction. The first column represents my summation of the usual experience in the recent precoronary care unit period of history. It contains the still generally unfamiliar gross statistic that about a quarter of first coronary attacks sim\u00ac ply kill the victims before medical care is pro\u00ac vided. It contains also the more familiar gross statistic of 25 per cent for in-hospital mortality for myocardial infarction, rather on Table 1. Estimated First-year Mortality from Myocardial Infarction in Per Cent Time 0-3 Hours 3 Hrs.\u20141 month 1 Mo.\u20141 year PRE-CCU CCU 1984 25 25 22 25 15 13 10 10 10 One-year deaths in % 60 50 45 the good side of the average experience in hospitals of precoronary care unit days. It contains, as well, the still unfamiliar gross statistic that about 10 per cent of those who survive and leave the hospital after their first attack succumb during the first year after onset. The \"clinical impression\" of \"25 per cent CHD mortality\" held by my generation in hospital training, based as it was solely on hospital experience, was far from the mark. When the pre- and posthospital death experi\u00ac ence is added, the first-year mortality was nearer 60 per cent! What is the current estimate? If we assume in column 2 no real impact as yet of medical care on pre- and posthospital deaths, and if we assume a reduction of something around 40 per cent for in-hospital deaths from infarction, we get an estimate of nearly a 50 per cent mortality rate for first attacks in the first year. What might be in store for the next im\u00ac mediate period? If we assume in column 3 a heroic achievement of some measurable re\u00ac duction in prehospital sudden death (from the most advanced technology, professional and public education, and resuscitation services), and assume some further improve\u00ac ment in the hospital experience from equally heroic medical and surgical attacks on myo\u00ac cardial dysfunction, we might estimate a 45 per cent first-year mortality rate as the brightest current prospect for the therapy of manifest coronary disease. Let us also assume that the improved care available for second attacks occurring in the first year, and the Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 3 Table 2.

This would leave intact the 10 per cent overall estimate for first-year mortality in those who have survived the hospital period. This potential for reduction in the first-year coronary mortality rate from 50 to 45 per cent is a large step for man, and particularly for those who directly benefit from this advance, but it is hardly the giant leap for mankind required to reduce the overall personal and social burden of CHD. Next, in Table 2, we see the fact that excess mortality risk continues indefinitely among infarct survivors who return to work after the first year; a 3.5-fold excess in yearly risk of death persists even after 10 years among in\u00ac farct survivors!47 The same magnitude of permanent excess risk holds for angina pec\u00ac toris patients.70,82 A final introductory fact, and sobering thought, is offered in Table 3. It shows dramatically that, despite the great strides of modern medicine, the estimated life ex\u00ac pectancy of men who reach and surpass the age of 40 is actually unimproved in 1970 Table 3.

A., and Seltzer, F.46 compared to that in 1900146 Whatever social affluence and medicine have achieved, something else has taken away; that some\u00ac thing else is principally the atherosclerotic, coronary and cardiovascular disease epidemic. THE FREQUENCY OF CHD The essence of the epidemiological contri\u00ac bution to the understanding of CHD is the information developed on its frequency and its distribution according to risk factors. This has appeared in phases which I like to de\u00ac scribe in musical history terms, i.e. the classical, romantic and modern periods, though the analogy is far from perfect. From 4 Progress in Cardiology the time that death records were kept as vital statistics there has been classical armchair epidemiological analysis which revealed clues about the differences in CHD frequency be\u00ac tween countries and communities and be\u00ac tween races and sexes, because physicians who fill them out know best the limitations of death certificates, this statistical approach was nof accepted as a definitive one. These classi\u00ac cal statistics were complemented, during the romantic period, by well-known peripatetic clinical observations such as those of Paul White and Ancel Keys. The proportion of medical beds and clinical practice occupied by CHD cases was widely disparate between cultures, between the Orient and the west, between the Mediterranean basin and north\u00ac ern Europe or the United States. Only during the modern period has scientifically acceptable evidence been developed that there are real differences in the population frequency of CHD. Systematic comparisons were made of the frequency of defined new CHD events among originally CHD-free co\u00ac horts of persons, in populations followed care\u00ac fully over the recent past years.40 Other evi\u00ac dence of geographic differences in athero\u00ac sclerosis has come from systematic patho\u00ac logical studies of arteries.50 These simple and tedious demonstrations, using the meth\u00ac ods of clinical epidemiology, have provided a strong backbone for and impetus to a larger preventive concept. The simultaneous find\u00ac ings of the quantitative relationship between risk characteristics during \"health\" and sub\u00ac sequent CHD risk provided the present rationale and potential for primary preven\u00ac tion, that is, treatment before the onset of clinical CHD manifestations. POPULATION DIFFERENCES IN CHD FREQUENCY Simple as the prospective studies of CHD were in concept, and tedious in execution, they were both important and necessary. Good clinical epidemiological observations in well-drawn samples are better than volumes of data based on questionable observations. MEN 40-59, CHD-FREE AT ENTRY CHD INCIDENCE/10,000/YEAR U 15-20 JAPAN DEATH INFARCT ANGINA OTHER CHD Fig. 1. Age-standardized average yearly CHD incidence rates per 10,000. 12,529 men, aged 40-59, judged to be free of CHD at the outset. (Reproduced by permission of the authors and publisher.40) Figure 1 gives the essence of the clinical- epidemiological field studies widely known as the Seven Countries Study.40 The study was among 12,770 men, aged 40 to 59 at outset, representing 95 per cent or better samples of total populations in 17 regions of 6 countries, and a 70 per cent sample of United States rail employees. Those with definite clinical or ECG evidence of heart disease at entry were removed from the base cohort for de\u00ac termining these 5-year rates of new CHD events. Except for the American rail work\u00ac ers, all other populations were stable rural and small-town agricultural, forestry, and fishing communities. Centrally trained clini\u00ac cal and technical staff made the field exami\u00ac nations under standard conditions, with standard methods, clinical forms and ques\u00ac tions, electrocardiographic and laboratory techniques. Data were processed centrally in standard fashion, with triplicate blinded reading of the ECGs, review of all clinical data by one cardiologist, and central chemi\u00ac cal laboratory analysis of serum lipid levels and diet samples. In Figure 1 the differences are clear in 5-year rates attributed to each major group of CHD manifestations\u2014and for all com\u00ac bined. These include differences in CHD deaths, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, and nonspecific clinical and Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 5 ECG findings possibly related to coronary disease. On the whole, for the more as well as for the less secure and objective diagnoses, there are important differences in frequency, up to the order of 10-fold, among men of the same age in these different cultures. The CHD frequency in the Japanese population and in parts of the Mediterranean basin is remarkably low. The Finnish situation is a remarkable natural experiment, a hardwork\u00ac ing, simple-living \"rural\" but socially ad\u00ac vanced country having extremely high CHD rates. These data are confirmed and en\u00ac larged by the currently unpublished analyses of the 10-year follow-up experience in most of these same men. The Seven Countries Study provides, I believe, acceptable evidence that some coun\u00ac tries have very little CHD, some have much, and that there are gradations between in frequency. A recent well-designed com\u00ac parison of Framingham, Puerto Rican, and Hawaiian populations confirms similar popu\u00ac lation differences.32 Many other solid prospective studies of the risk factors have provided a conceptual and practical frame for a preventive cardio\u00ac logical effort, though they have not explained the total picture of CHD incidence.64 RISK FACTORS FOR CHD A primary and essential element in a prac\u00ac tical approach to CHD prevention is the rela\u00ac tionship, now well demonstrated, between personal characteristics and the subsequent rate of manifest CHD. A major contribu\u00ac tion from CHD epidemiology has been the detailed and quantitative demonstration of the independence of, and possible interactions between, risk factors in men measured prior to manifest CHD and their subsequent CHD in\u00ac cidence, and of an individual's values and their applicability to his subsequent proba\u00ac bility of developing manifest CHD.43 The associations between risk factors and disease risk do not, in themselves, imply causation. Causal influence is inferred from the totality of evidence developed in clinical, laboratory and population studies together. Causal \"proof' is best tested experimentally in pre\u00ac ventive trials in man. We shall consider briefly some of the evi\u00ac dence, the progress of thinking, and some questions and controversies remaining about individual CHD risk factors. Diet as a Risk Factor When an hypothesis becomes popularly ac\u00ac cepted but is not yet \"proven\" experimentally it is tempting to tear it apart. This is doubly so when an hypothesis involves eating habits, what with all the self-styled expertise in the country. Everyone eats, therefore everyone has a basis of experience, faulty or not, for an opinion on nutrition. The diet issue is ren\u00ac dered more controversial because good in\u00ac vestigators with strong personalities are in\u00ac volved, as are huge commercial vested in\u00ac terests. Combine these facts with the failure of many people, including physicians, to read and carefully consider the written state\u00ac ments and experimental evidence of those actually working and experimenting in the field; people tend rather to read the sensa\u00ac tional or the bought press about their work. Add to this a long tradition in this country of nutritional education, marketing and home economics dominated by the point of view and the ubiquitous influence of the Dairy, Meat and Egg Councils and the agroeconomy supporting them, including the United States Department of Agriculture. In this view, higher and daily meat and butter and egg consumption is necessary and a prime contributor to national \"strides\" in nutri\u00ac tional status. Add to this the very complex, circularly dependent economic relationships and logistics such as feedlot stuffing of animals with, until recently, surplus grains. Enter commercial exhortations to eat high-caloric, fat-filled foods because \"You deserve a break today!\" and so on and on. Investigators in this field could easily spend most of their working lives countering these influences and answering critics within and outside the vested interests. Most of them wisely choose 6 Progress in Cardiology to develop the scientific evidence and to present it to their scientific peers as the best way to arrive toward the truth and to advance the public knowledge. It is important, how\u00ac ever, that the physician be versed in the public controversies about risk factors and CHD pre\u00ac vention, if for no other reason than to answer intelligently queries from patients and col\u00ac leagues. I will attempt here to bring forward, if only sketchily, the better-known challenges and claims about CHD and the diet. Diet-CHD Correlations in the United States A great current confusion, and the most apparent of apparent contradictions about the diet fat-CHD hypothesis, is the poor relationship found between individual food intake and individual CHD risk in studies in the United States. Several investigators have found no difference in the eating habits of coronary patients and their clinically healthy counterparts. More relevant, follow\u00ac up studies have found no strong relationship between individual diet in the United States and future CHD risk.21,32 These findings are widely quoted as rejecting the diet-CHD hypothesis. Should we get very excited by this apparent paradox, find it especially sur\u00ac prising, or consider it a serious weakness in the diet-CHD hypothesis? We should ac\u00ac knowledge the failure to find striking indi\u00ac vidual differences in eating habits of Amer\u00ac icans (at the time they enter into observation studies) between those who later develop and those who do not develop CHD. But does this invalidate the well-established diet- serum cholesterol-CHD risk relationship which holds consistent between larger cultures and populations compared? I don't think so. The finding within the United States popula\u00ac tions is owing in part to the fact that the in\u00ac trinsic regulation of serum lipids is different in individuals who respond differently to their habitual diet. Clearly individuals eating the same diet have differing serum lipid values. Moreover, when the variation, from all sources, in measures made of the diet within the individual approaches the variability of diet, as it is measured between individuals, there is a mathematical certainty that corre\u00ac lations between diet intake and CHD risk cannot be strong. The large, actually un\u00ac acceptable measurement error in assessing individual diet intake, the intra-individual variations over time in eating, and the gener\u00ac ally high level of saturated fat consumption virtually ensure that correlations of CHD with individual diets will be fuzzy in this country. The superficiality of a single dietary interview in a person of middle age, and its unrepresen\u00ac tativeness in terms of the individual's year- round diet, are severe limitations, not to speak of his diet experiences over the years of \"incubation\" of atherosclerotic lesions and CHD. Finally, the relative homogeneity of the \"American way\" of eating, in terms of composition of the diet in its three basic nutrients, is a severe impediment to useful study of the question in the United States. Life styles may differ in many ways, but a high saturated-fat diet is now a hallmark of the \"American way.\" To examine effec\u00ac tively the diet-CHD hypothesis about the population frequency of CHD, one must look systematically at the relationships found by comparing whole peoples having widely con\u00ac trasting eating habits while holding other risk factors constant. Where this has been done these facts hold: (1) The relationship of serum cholesterol level to primary CHD inci\u00ac dence is consistent in all major systematic prospective studies in many countries. (2) Change in serum cholesterol level can be closely predicted mathematically in small group studies from changes in the diet com\u00ac positions. (3) Population differences in satu\u00ac rated-fat intake are associated positively and strongly with CHD incidence. (4) Animal experiments indicate that feeding a diet high in saturated fat and/or cholesterol is the only effective technique to produce experimental atherosclerosis. The population diet-CHD data in the Seven Countries Study were collected by trained teams which went into the community Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 7 and sampled diets year round, during differ\u00ac ent seasons, sent carefully prepared samples of foods for central chemical analysis, and re\u00ac lated these data from population groups to their CHD incidence based on standardized and centrally coded medical examinations. This sort of hard and systematic approach has provided the background for the Minnesota findings which are consistent with the satu\u00ac rated fat-CHD hypothesis. These findings never prove causation; they only indicate compatibility with an hypothesis. It will require data from equally painstaking studies showing contrary results to challenge these findings, however, and such data are not yet forthcoming from any of the so-called popu\u00ac lation exceptions to the saturated fat-CHD hypothesis. In particular, none of the studies of diet and CHD in very primitive populations and nomadic groups, and none of the Rose to revelations,6,48 involves any serious considera\u00ac tion of basic sample size requirements for valid population comparisons nor any ap\u00ac parent comprehension of the confidence in\u00ac tervals around the disease rates they report. The Roseto study, for example, reports \"striking findings\" of differences in CHD rates based on such comparisons as zero in\u00ac farctions in Roseto versus 3 cases in Bangor, for a total population base of 202 men of ages 35 to 54 in both towns!48 The many design deficiencies of that undertaking and the conclusions made have been treated critically elsewhere.41 My own exposure as a \"cardiologist- epidemiologist\" has been direct in these \"natural experiments.\" In these, whole peoples vary widely in CHD rate and are found to eat habitually different diets, while the physical activity, smoking habits and blood pressure levels in the rural men are not vastly different. The evidence has led me, along with others, to the conclusion that an habitual highly saturated fat diet is probably a necessary factor for a mass CHD burden such as that found in the United States. (It is important to separate conceptually this population frequency of CHD from that of individual risk of CHD which may be de\u00ac termined by factors other than diet.) If the Japanese can smoke as much as they do, and have similar or higher levels of blood pressure than North Americans, and have among the highest levels of \"civilized\" stresses, and yet are without CHD in the masses, they are apparently missing a necessary risk factor. They happen to have the lowest of saturated- fat diets; moreover, some curves of serum cholesterol distribution in Japanese men in Kyushu are so low that there is very little overlap between their highest and the lowest values for Americans of the same age.40 Individual risk of CHD in the United States, with its unusually distorted diet (relative to most of the rest of the world), may indeed not be strongly related to individual differences in diet within our culture. This suggests to some the possibility that a \"threshold effect\" is required for any significant population fre\u00ac quency of CHD; such a threshold is not es\u00ac sential to explain the behavior of the disease frequency. The Role of Polyunsaturated Fats A Los Angeles physician, Edward Pinck\u00ac ney, has become a vocal advocate of the potential \"toxicity\" of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet.61,62 It happens that a number of experienced investigators, in\u00ac cluding the Minnesota group, have also long found no reason to push \"excessive\" polyunsaturates. But they base this con\u00ac clusion on very straightforward observations such as those made in the Seven Countries Study, rather than on untestable theories such as Pinckney's about \"free radicals\" and \"aging.\" In none of the regions the Minne\u00ac sota group explored, and in which they care\u00ac fully analyzed chemically the foodstuffs eaten by sampled families, has an \"experiment of nature\" occurred in which more than 10 per cent of total calories were found to be derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids (Fig. 2). Very low rates of CHD clearly do not require high \"polyunsaturate\" diets; rather, low 8 Progress in Cardiology AVERAGE 7. FROM FATS MEN 14 DALMATIA 16 _3j 27 7. 1 7 132 7. SLAVONIA 14 16 3 337.

Average percentage of dietary calories provided by saturated, mono-ene, and polyunsatu\u00ac rated fatty acids. (Reproduced by permission of authors and publisher.40) saturated fats would appear to be a pre\u00ac requisite (Fig. 3). There is, then, no good reason for American diets to become distorted in their content of polyunsaturated fatty acids as an alternative to the present distor\u00ac tion in terms of saturated fats (as well as sugars, salt, and total calories). Longstanding natural diets are used in general populations of many millions of men, women and children in many parts of the world with fat calories totalling less than 35 per cent, with no more than 10 per cent of total calories from saturated and no more than 10 per cent from polyunsaturated fats. The diets of the Mediterranean and the Orient are safe and generally most palatable and attrac\u00ac tive; diets of similar composition are clearly feasible and economic and they are compatible with, and possibly essential to, a very low population burden of CHD. Partial adop\u00ac tion of such a way of eating should, therefore, be reasonable for all Americans, of any age. Partial replacement of saturated fatty acids by polyunsaturates, kept under 10 per cent of total calories, is not unreasonable; there is evidence that it is safe40 and no evidence that it is harmful.16 The fascinating success re\u00ac cently in Australia of changing the fatty-acid composition of beef fat by the special treating and feeding of polyunsaturated grains68 is not, in my opinion, as desirable a public health development as would be, for example, the economic production of lean beef and its grading by overall leanness, taste and texture. Pinckney's polemic against poly\u00ac unsaturates thus appears to me to be mis\u00ac leading and unnecessary. There are better ways of influencing the inaccurate health im\u00ac plications of margarine advertisements. Vitamin E An even better best-seller than Pinckney's, especially in health food stores, claims that the antioxidant vitamin E, found naturally in polyunsaturated oils, is a cure-all and preven\u00ac tive, for both healthy and ailing hearts.3 The interesting hypothesis is quite unsup\u00ac ported, backed only by a testimonial type of evidence. I have had occasion to use this popular book as a classical illustration of self-deception in medicine.3 Diet-serum Lipid Relationships The most unusual discussion of the diet- serum cholesterol relationship to see print in a major medical journal is the one re\u00ac cently by Reiser.63 Because it has created some public controversy we will spend a little time with it here. Reiser's reproof is that serum cholesterol, to the extent that it can be influenced by diet, is largely regulated by the exogenous choles\u00ac terol and phytosterol content of foods rather than by fatty acids, and that the influence of dietary cholesterol varies according to its absorption in the presence of different neutral fat triglycerides in the foodstuffs. These are Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 9 interesting ideas, but they remain just hy\u00ac potheses, backed by no substantial evidence in their support\u2014and the burden of proof lies with the proponent. Mountains of evi\u00ac dence have been collected to the contrary of Reiser's claims, by serious scientists, over a period of three decades. Certainly no evi\u00ac dence is brought to bear by Reiser, who has himself never performed any experiments in human nutrition. In most experiments that he cites, in his extensive \"perspective\" of the literature of diet effects on serum cholesterol,63 he fails to understand the experimental design, or he misinterprets the facts. He attributes serum lipid changes that he cannot \"explain\" by his theories of dietary cholesterol (as the elevating agent) and phytosterols (as the de\u00ac pressing agent) to \"natural variations.\" He is consistently unable to understand how Latin square and cross-over designs \"take care\" of such natural variations in a properly designed experiment and how the statistical theory of probability is used to help interpret such variations. More seriously, he impugns the motives of almost all scientists who have worked in the field. Some of those whose works and motives he has so viciously attacked have replied in de\u00ac tail.44 Meanwhile, the National Dairy Council, which sponsored his \"review of the literature,\" has launched a series of \"discus\u00ac sions\" in hired halls about the country. He and they are performing a disservice to the public, I believe, in sowing widely their mis\u00ac representations. Dietary Sugar and CHD Another of the widely publicized theses about diet and CHD is that of Professor MEN 40-59, % DIET CALORIES PROVIDED BY SATURATED F.A. 3%, JAPAN 18%, U.S.RY. 20%, FINLAND 1 NARROW BARS SHOW CHD INCIDENCE RATE \u2014 Fig. 3. Closed bars represent the average percentage of total dietary calories provided by saturated fatty acids. Open bars represent the 5-year incidence of CHD. 10 Progress in Cardiology Yudkin, Professor of Nutrition of the Uni\u00ac versity of London.81 He maintains the follow\u00ac ing saccharine views: (1) that mortality dif\u00ac ferences in CHD are closely correlated with per capita sugar consumption, (2) that the change in CHD rates over the years parallels the increased consumption of sucrose, (3) that CHD patients eat unusually high amounts of sugar, and (4) that rational mechanisms exist to explain a possible effect of sugar on CHD incidence. His data and these claims have been effectively criticized,39 but the subject remains a hotly controversial one and the sugary claims continue unabated. The many possible flaws are obvious to all in comparing reported rates of disappear\u00ac ance of sugar, per capita, with reported vital statistics on CHD rates during the same period. As important, the Latin countries having the highest sugar intakes (and low CHD rates) were not included in Yudkin's comparisons. Where vital statistics may be considered to have high and comparable quality, the sugar story breaks down, e.g. the sugar consumption of Sweden is greater than that of Finland but the CHD rate is around half that of Finland. In one project actual dietary sugar intake has been carefully estimated in field studies of the habitual diet.40 In those studies there is indeed a rather good correlation of sugar intake with 5-year CHD incidence (r = .78)\u2014 but in those countries sugar intake is also highly correlated with saturated-fat intake (.84). Therefore, theses of the causal influ\u00ac ence of sugar must be considered in terms of other kinds of evidence because the possible sugar effect is confounded by its clear associa\u00ac tion with fat intake. The Yudkin claim of increased overall sugar consumption over the years is not borne out in data from the United States Depart\u00ac ment of Agriculture; the per capita average was 51.7 kg/year in the 1920s and 50.2 kg/ year in the 1960s. In general, because of the inability to pinpoint changes in CHD fre\u00ac quency, there is no good evidence that such changes are related to sugar consumption. We have indicated elsewhere the vast de\u00ac ficiencies of case-control studies to answer questions related to the causes of disease. They are usually only a weak first effort, following clinical impressions, to formalize possible relationships between any character\u00ac istic and the overt disease. Yudkin's case- control studies are especially poor in numbers (groups of 20 patients and 20 controls) and in dietary assessment. In one he estimated, incredibly, 1000 calories of sucrose eaten daily in one-fourth of his CHD patients. Other studies, with more representative and larger samples, and with superior clinical and dietary methods, showed no significant dif\u00ac ference in sugar consumption between CHD patients and matched controls.19,20,28 Prob\u00ac ably more significant than those comparisons are prospective studies of sugar consumption and subsequent CHD rates. Oglesby Paul found sucrose use, coffee drinking and ciga\u00ac rette smoking all crudely related to CHD,60 but each was highly associated with each other, and only cigarette smoking appeared to have an independent association. Knowledgeable readers recognize that such statistical associations do not prove cause. They provide only one test of an hypothesis about cause. In this case, none of the statistical evidence supports the idea that sugar has an \"effect\" on CHD incidence. What about possible mechanisms of an atherogenic influence of sugar? Well-con- trolled short-term experiments indicate that sugar, up to 40 per cent of calories, has a neutral (no) effect on serum cholesterol and other lipid levels when sugar is substituted calorie for calorie for starch.39 In higher amounts, triglycerides are elevated for a few days or weeks. This has questionable rele\u00ac vance to the long-term stabilization of tri\u00ac glyceride levels in habitual diets, and, as pointed out elsewhere, the independent con\u00ac tribution of serum triglycerides to the fre\u00ac quency or risk of CHD, in broader popula\u00ac tion groups, remains conjecture. Finally, it has never been possible in animal experi\u00ac ments to produce atherosclerosis with sucrose Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 11 feeding; rather, fat and cholesterol are the required elements for experimental athero\u00ac sclerosis. Keys states: \". . . there are plenty of good arguments to reduce the flood of dietary sucrose without building a mountain of nonsense about coronary heart disease.\"39 Serum Lipids as Risk Factors A rapidly expanding concept in this im\u00ac portant field concerns the classification of dif\u00ac ferent \"abnormal\" patterns of \"serum lipid phenotypes\" with the implication that these are predominantly inherited characteristics, that they explain the gamut of lipid findings, that there is the necessity for tailor-made management based on phenotype and that such metabolic abnormalities are responsible for the widespread epidemic of CHD. The development is actually an important early stage in the classification, specific diagnosis and understanding of lipid metabolism, as well as in the management of very special individual lipid problems. It has, however, contributed strongly to an academic view of CHD prevention (to be discussed) and has, inadvertently, diverted attention from a workable pragmatic and larger view of the CHD problem in the United States. The lipid phenotyping situation reminds me somewhat of the old question of qualita\u00ac tive somatotyping. Impressed early in my career with the possible role of constitution and related somatotypes, I once asked Ancel Keys what he thought of the Sheldonian somatotype classifications. He snorted some\u00ac thing about having a trunkful of rear-end and full-face nude photographs of important people that a member of his staff had once collected for somatotyping; he speculated that he might be better off burning them than analyzing them. He also remarked how overeating and semistarvation in his World War II experiments pretty well invalidated the basic premise and reliability of qualitative somatic phenotyping. Similarly, a little change in habitual diet, say, from ground hamburger and gravy to subgum and tea, plays havoc with the so-called phenotypic classification of lipid abnormalities, at least in the broader population from which derive most garden-variety cases of elevated blood lipids or CHD. However, there are several very important things happening in this field today. The NHLI Lipid Research Center prevalence studies are producing detailed distributions of lipid fractions in thousands of families in 12 American and 2 Russian communities. Various analyses will be performed to see whether different clusters or patterns occur in the lipid distributions. This will very probably advance the classification of lipids. More important, it is possible that the sub\u00ac jects, including representative samples of the general population, will be followed to de\u00ac termine the natural history and risk associ\u00ac ated with these lipid levels and patterns. Another important happening is the gradu\u00ac ally accumulating evidence concerning the relationship of fasting serum triglyceride levels to the risk of CHD in general popula\u00ac tions. None of the evidence, so far accumu\u00ac lated in general populations outside hospitals, indicates that triglyceride levels contribute information on CHD risk which is indepen\u00ac dent of the associated serum cholesterol level. Despite the clinical association between pa\u00ac tients with atherosclerotic diseases and the mixed lipid \"phenotypes\" lib, III, and IV, the evidence so far in systematic follow-up of populations is that serum triglycerides, or the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, are rela\u00ac tively weak contributors to simple CHD risk prediction and are essentially non\u00ac contributory after adjustment is made ana\u00ac lytically for the associated serum cholesterol level. For example, the Framingham data show no independent contribution of triglycerides (nonfasting) to CHD risk in men above that of serum cholesterol, and a questionable rela\u00ac tionship in women.32,34 The Stockholm data on fasting triglycerides and CHD risk do not adequately account for serum choles\u00ac terol level in the crude and arbitrary cut-off values for each variable used in the simple 12 Progress in Cardiology analysis. The only significant prediction obtained was for cases having both serum cholesterol and triglycerides high, compared to those having both low. Age, glucose tolerance, blood pressure\u2014all of which may be associated with triglyceride levels and with CHD\u2014were not accounted for, and at best the Stockholm information is only sug\u00ac gestive.8 The Gothenberg data, in which other risk elements including serum choles\u00ac terol were adequately handled in the analysis, revealed no residual prognostic importance for fasting triglyceride levels.80 The Coronary Drug Project data show no relationship of fasting triglycerides to the subsequent risk of death, simple or adjusted, in men after a myocardial infarction. Thus this issue re\u00ac mains very much up in the air and requires longer follow-up and multivariate analyses in the studies concerned. The analogy is not perfect, but it is also true that if one considers, in prediction analyses, both diastolic and systolic blood pressure, two strongly correlated variables, one or the other, not both, will show in\u00ac dependent predictive importance for CHD.36 Similarly, this does not mean that elevated serum triglycerides are unimportant in prognosis or should not be reduced when elevated, but simply that they contribute no significant independent information to that obtained from serum cholesterol, glucose, or other risk variables simultaneously acquired. There have been dissemination and applica\u00ac tion of lipid phenotyping information among practicing specialists as well as wide circula\u00ac tion of the NHL I pamphlets recommending \"5 diets for 5 types\" of hyperlipidemia. This otherwise worthwhile refinement in under\u00ac standing of the lipids is, in the pragmatic view, tempered by several limiting facts; it has clearly tended to obfuscate the central urgent matter of a broader approach to reducing the generally high levels of serum lipids in the United States, and the practical need for a reasonable swing of the pendulum away from the present distorted \"American way\" of high-fat, high-calorie eating. It is simply unnecessary, in the garden-variety lipid find\u00ac ing in most persons in the United States, and certainly among the garden-variety of coronary case seen in practice, to submit people and society to the cost of detailed lipid phenotyping. Hear it from the source,22 as follows: \"The not need electrophoretograms to define hyperlipoproteinemia, but good patterns can be helpful.\" \"When plasma or serum stands in an ordinary icebox (not a freezer) overnight, any chylomicrons will layer on the top. A 'cream' layer means a positive chylomicron test.\" It is equally unnecessary to use the five tailor-made diets in treating the usual case of mixed lipid elevation encountered in the usual high-risk subject detected in a preven\u00ac tion-oriented practice of medicine. Sound empirical diet experiments are available which show clearly that most, i.e. better than 90 per cent, of ordinary hyperlipidemias en\u00ac countered in the general population will re\u00ac spond to the simple prudent diet long recom\u00ac mended by Keys, Stamler, the Anti-Coronary Club, and the American Heart Association, i.e. =*=30 per cent total fats in a ratio of 10:10:10 saturated, mono- and poly-unsatu- rated calories.24,29 Again I quote from Fredrickson: \"Diet is the keystone of therapy for all hyper\u00ac lipidemia\u2014often no other treatment is required. Some of us (my italics) prefer to tailor any diet therapy to the type of hyperlipoproteinemia.\" \"The majority of your patients will have mild hyperlipoproteinemia of type 2a, 2b, or 4. For these, you may wish to begin with the combina\u00ac tion of weight control and simple 'prudent' diet that primarily cuts down the amount of choles\u00ac terol and saturated fats in the diet.\"22 This lipid phenotyping question is an example of an academic versus a pragmatic attitude toward the lipids and atherosclerosis. At what point does one diagnose and treat the majority of his patients according to efficient pragmatism based on the larger evidence, reserving phenotypic pother and tailor-made Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 13 treatment principles for the occasional clear- cut familial case, for the case which doesn't fit the common mold, or for the case which doesn't respond well to a practical, palatable and safe \"hygienic\" regimen? Primary Prevention Trials with Diet The most succinct recent review of the evidence from clinical trials of cholesterol- reducing diets is contained in the Inter- Society Report.64 Suffice it to say here that the results of diet intervention alone, in middle-aged persons, are consistent with the idea that diet change is beneficial at that stage of life in populations having high CHD inci\u00ac dence. However, in none are the results overwhelming and in none is the design flaw\u00ac less. Two recent trials, both in mental hos\u00ac pitals, compare a \"usual diet\" with a low saturated, moderate polyunsaturated fat regi\u00ac men. The Helsinki study shows significant changes in coronary incidence and deaths in men and some lowering of total mortality during the low-fat experimental period.51 The trend was reversed in the second 6 years after the diets and hospitals were crossed over at year 6. A recent critique of this study is good reading for those who would like to improve their ability to appraise the litera\u00ac ture on clinical trials.25 The point of the criticism is that the issue is not clear and the results are not sufficiently strong to conclude that a cholesterol-lowering diet considerably reduces the mortality from CHD. There were problems of design and execution, principally troubling being the short-term exposure to treatment of mobile patient populations, apparent differences between the groups com\u00ac pared in characteristics other than diet, and the possibility of bias in diagnoses and management. The Minnesota study of Frantz is in press and the results are not known. The results of studies of diet inter\u00ac vention, so far inadequate, lead one to the idea that middle-aged men may be, if not lost souls, at least unlikely, short of optimal multifactorial intervention, to experience any significant reduction in risk from a change of diet alone. Conversely, however, it is likely that to obtain a significant reduction from multfiactor treatment, diet must be effectively changed. Reports are beginning to come in on single\u00ac factor trials of lipid-lowering agents other than diet in primary CHD prevention.26 45 58 They have, so far, been largely ineffective in second\u00ac ary prevention among coronary patients.10 A Primary Prevention Clofibrate \"Trial\" A truly remarkable report of a CHD pre\u00ac ventive trial appeared in JAMA on 14 Febru\u00ac ary 1972 by Krasno and Kidera.45 It pur\u00ac ports to be a single-blind preventive trial of the effect of clofibrate on CHD incidence. The subjects are said to be pair-matched on 17 variables (it would be a neat trick indeed to parcel out and analyze usefully the 1000 or so subjects among 289 (217) comparative cells\u2014which would be the required number if one were to pair-match 17 variables by only 2 classes each, such as high-low, present- absent!). The investigators were not blinded to the therapeutic assignment and there is no mention of a placebo being given, so it is not clear who was blind to what. They state, \"The original pair-matching was not used to assign a common starting date, but simply as a method of balancing known base-line risk factors.\" This implies that matching was not done before the trial and must therefore have been during or at the end of the \"trial,\" which is, of course, totally unacceptable trial design. Twenty-nine men \"dropped out\" before receiving any therapy; 23 of these dropouts were in the treated and 6 in the \"control\" group. This difference in dropout rate, which clearly biases the group compari\u00ac son, could have happened by chance in less than 1 in 1000 samples! Twenty-four infarct patients were \"assigned\" to the control group and 19 to the treatment group, another source of bias. In addition, many other mismatched variables indicate there simply was no properly randomized treatment assignment. Thus bias occurred in cases submitted to the \"independent referee cardiologist\" which 14 Progress in Cardiology rendered his function an unenviable and use\u00ac less one. In the hierarchy of clinical events observed, it happened that the greater the degree of objectivity of the diagnostic end\u00ac points used, from death as most objective down to angina as least, the less was the treatment group difference observed. This is a good test suggesting bias. In no com\u00ac parison was there actually a significant dif\u00ac ference between the groups subdivided by CHD manifestation. As a crowning argu\u00ac ment the study acknowledged the distin\u00ac guished assistance of the Director of the NHL I and its Biometrics Branch in prepara\u00ac tion of the manuscript. Presumably this ac\u00ac knowledgment was gratuitous; these authori\u00ac ties could hardly have been responsible for such an unusual design and analysis, or for the conclusions drawn. At least this report has served some good; it has been very effectively used in several teaching seminars as a classic of defective trial design and of misleading \"scientific\" con\u00ac clusions. The fact that the report appeared as the lead article in JAMA is, at best, an editorial mishap in scientific journalism. At any rate, the publication contributes nothing to any hypothesis about the prevention of CHD; the possible effects of clofibrate will have to be assessed otherwise\u2014as is happen\u00ac ing in the European trial coordinated by Oliver and WHO.26,68 Overweight and Obesity as Risk Factors Controversy and confusion continue to rage about overweight and obesity and their specific relationship to CHD risk. The more representative of the recent sets of data come from the insurance industry, the Framingham Study and the Seven Countries Study. The insurance data have great limitations in terms of the validity of the raw data and the end\u00ac points of CHD death as well as the in\u00ac appropriateness of the insurance analysis for purposes outside that industry.42 The con\u00ac clusion of the Framingham group is that overweight has an important and unique (independent) contribution to CHD risk;27,32 in contrast, the Minnesota group holds that the effect is relatively weak overall and that obesity is questionable as an independent con\u00ac tributor to CHD risk.38,40,42 I suspect that it may be more a difference in the point of view taken than a difference in the actual findings. The Framingham data show statistically significant simple unadjusted relationships of relative body weight (by Metropolitan stan\u00ac dard tables) to all forms of CHD, in a 16-year follow-up period.32 The CHD risk ratio is relatively small, 1.6 in men and 1.4 in women for those 35 per cent or more overweight (15 per cent of the men and 20 per cent of the women were this much overweight). The Framingham data show a statistically in\u00ac significant, stronger relationship of over\u00ac weight to sudden death and to angina pec\u00ac toris than to nonfatal myocardial infarction. They show a significant relationship of CHD to subscapular but not to triceps skin-fold measurements of obesity. In a multivariate analysis, they show a statistically significant but not large adjusted relationship of relative body weight (RBW) to CHD for only one age group of men, those from 55 to 64. The Seven Countries Study systematically looks at relative body weight, body mass index (BMI) and sums of skin folds, and finds a significant relationship to angina and non\u00ac specific ECG manifestations of CHD but not to \"hard CHD,\" i.e. nonfatal infarct plus CHD death, or to deaths from all causes.38 It does not adequately examine the question of sudden death. In a stringent use of the multivariate analytical model, the discrimina\u00ac tion of CHD events (soft plus nonfatal plus fatal) was not significantly improved by the addition of BMI to the logistic discriminant equation based on age, blood pressure, serum cholesterol and cigarette smoking. For ex\u00ac ample, 88 cases of CHD occurred in the upper 20 per cent of risk scores versus 16 cases among the lower 20 per cent of risk scores when BMI was omitted from the equation. In contrast, 95 cases versus 13 ap\u00ac peared when BMI was included, among Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 15 2,404 United States rail employees, a small and insignificant improvement. Among 8,728 European men, the result was even less impressive; 188 versus 28 were discriminated with BMI, 189 versus 23 without its inclusion. This is regarded as a weak and insignificant independent contribution of body mass to the discrimination of CHD cases in that 5-year follow-up material, over and above that ob\u00ac tained from the classical four risk factors. Finally, both studies show the familiar association of relative weight to blood pres\u00ac sure and conclude that the most important health hazard with obesity is that it is often accompanied by elevated blood pressure. Each shows lesser degrees of relationship be\u00ac tween body weight and serum cholesterol levels. Neither examines adequately the re\u00ac lationship of RBW to fasting triglycerides and glucose tolerance. Each shows that obesity and overweight are weak influences compared to the three primary factors. Each shows that overweight must be rather extreme to influence CHD risk importantly. Neither confirms the insurance experience of a strong continuous relationship to overall mortality risk. Neither concludes that the independent contribution of overweight is a large one. Neither, of course, suggests that overweight is desirable. Keys concludes that the weight reduction \"industry\" in the United States \"\u2014is not totally bad, perhaps, but in regard to preventive medicine and the maintenance of health, one could wish for other priori\u00ac ties.\"38 The conclusion we might reach at this stage of progress in cardiology is that moderate overweight is not a strong con\u00ac tributor to future CHD risk in any population, but that weight reduction is desirable when indicated in an attempt to reduce the level of blood pressure, glucose intolerance, or serum lipids and to enhance a healthy self-image. Hypertension as a Risk Factor Elevated blood pressure has been found to be a consistent and strong contributor to CHD risk in all international cardiovascular epidemiological studies.64 The salient point of this relationship is that the risk rises smoothly with the level of the blood pressure (BP) and there is no logical cut point where \"hyper\u00ac tension\" may be said to be present or absent, at least in terms of its apparent influence on future disease (CHD, brain infarction and heart failure).32,64 This smoothly increasing blood pressure risk curve is more and more appreciated and accepted by the practitioner. But what is the status of information on the effect of antihypertensive treatment on the incidence of CHD? Freis, and dozens of his quoters, continue to make the comment from many platforms that the well-known and excellent VA antihypertensive trial demonstrated that low\u00ac ering elevated blood pressure reduces risk of hypertensive complications but does not modify coronary risk.78 It is factually correct to state that there is no direct experimental evidence about this. It is factually incorrect to say that the VA trial showed a significant absence of effect of BP treatment on CHD in\u00ac cidence. Freis' fallacy here is in the mis\u00ac interpretation of the VA blood pressure trial results; the study was not designed to answer the question about CHD effects and clearly it did not. If the design of a study possesses in\u00ac sufficient power to test whether there is a reasonable difference in CHD incidence, it is ill considered to conclude that no effect on CHD exists. The VA study, with only 380 men and the low incidence of CHD deaths actually experienced in that study (17 cases), had little chance of demonstrating any real difference in CHD rate over the 3-year period of the study. One must also ask how much reduction in CHD it is plausible to seek or to anticipate from any primary prevention study involving reduction of blood pressure (or any other primary risk factor) in a population of elderly veterans? Considering the vast amount of observational evidence of the im\u00ac portant contribution of hypertension to CHD, it is surely inappropriate to maintain that the absence of effects on CHD by treatment in this small study (in terms of CHD incidence) are meaningful. The major NHLI trials under 16 Progress in Cardiology way, involving some 22,000 persons, should answer this question; the VA study simply could not be expected to do so! An important current theme in hyperten\u00ac sion is, of course, Lara(gh)'s song.7 It is the exciting melody that hypertension is quali\u00ac tatively different in nature, in complications and in course, in those hypertensives with low, \"normal\" and high plasma renin activity. This finding is in the highest academic tradi\u00ac tion, to seek out specific subgroups with spe\u00ac cial characteristics; the hypothesis is indeed attractive, and useful explorations have been stimulated. Unfortunately, it is too early to suggest or to infer that the renin subgroup has less need for antihypertensive therapy. This idea has produced a serious and unjustified confusion and a setback to the pragmatic national thrust toward effective preventive management of hypertension since the Freis VA study appeared. At any rate, there are at least two considerations that indicate a wait- and-see attitude before complicating widely the work-up and therapy of hypertension. The first is a series of articles, by good investigators, which fail to demonstrate or confirm an asso\u00ac ciation between plasma renin activity and the prevalence of hypertensive complications.57 Incidence data from prospective studies are not yet available. The second is that there are serious problems of design in the original Laragh study and analyses which led to the hypothesis. For example, there were mixed retrospective and prospective observations on patients about whom treatment status was unclear and in which results for a given pa\u00ac tient might appear more than once in the same analysis. In essence, the thesis is in\u00ac triguing, but it is not yet established, I be\u00ac lieve, by the data available. Very real questions remain for the physi\u00ac cian about the level of blood pressure which requires pharmacological treatment, in terms of prevention of CHD or other complications, and at what levels treatment benefits are outweighed by drug \"toxicity.\" The evi\u00ac dence may still be considered equivocal for the benefit-toxicity ratio of drug therapy with diastolic levels less than 100 mm Hg. The positive yet circumspect approach arrived at here is to treat in such cases whatever other hypertensogenic and CHD risk elements are present, including overweight and dietary salt intake, and to follow the blood pressure evolution at regular intervals. The question will be better answered soon by controlled trials. Tobacco Smoking as a Risk Factor Cigarette smoking is apparently a strong and independent primary risk indicator for CHD in the United States. The fact that ex-smokers are generally found to have an intermediate rate of CHD between current smokers and never smokers is considered satisfactory evidence that smoking may be a causal risk factor. There has not been an adequate clinical trial of this question to provide an experimental answer. Again, however, the safe and sound practice of medicine and of public health should not require always this level of experimental proof. Particularly is this true when hygienic advice can be given safely for health habits having \"no clearly redeeming social value.\" The relationship of cigarette smoking to CHD risk in American studies is strongest at younger ages, and its \"effect\" is independent of, and at least additive to, that of serum cholesterol, blood pressure and activity habits. Though relative CHD risk related to smoking declines with age, absolute CHD risk increases. The strongest relationships, clinically and at autopsy, are with aortic and lower extremity arterial disease, but the relationship holds for all CHD manifestations, fatal and non- fatal.50,84,72 The major new and recent clinical data on this question are contained in the report from Stamler for the AHA pooling project which put together all of the major American epi\u00ac demiological follow-up studies.84,69 A very succinct and topical review by Rose is avail\u00ac able on this question in a cardiological jour\u00ac nal.65 He reckons that stopping cigarette smoking is at least as important in a mild hy- Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 17 pertensive as is treating the blood pressure (smoking is associated with about double the CHD risk at all levels of blood pressure). With regard to possible mechanisms of CHD pathogenesis it is both interesting and fashionable now to consider that carboxy- hemoglobin may be at least as important as nicotine effects from smoking. It would in\u00ac deed have exciting ramifications if the level of bound carbon monoxide were found to have a primary toxic effect, or were sufficiently im\u00ac portant to contribute to myocardial ischemia in the masses of those susceptible, or in cases with unusual binding affinity. Some of these questions are under study in our laboratory. Suffice it to say that the mechanisms of any possible smoking effect on CHD are quite un\u00ac clear and are an important subject for con\u00ac tinued investigation. There are a few holes also in the statistical-epidemiological data and causal theses about smoking and CHD. There is bona fide skepticism about the possi\u00ac bility of interpreting the secular rates of change in cigarette smoking, for example in British physicians, and their change in smoking-related disease rates as strong evi\u00ac dence of the value of giving up cigarettes87\u2014 none of which suggests whatever that smoking is a good thing! Glucose Intolerance as a Risk Factor The detailed metabolic interrelations among glucose tolerance, insulin activity, lipid mobilization, atherosclerosis and CHD are among the most complex and fascinating in current medical science and practice. I am neither inclined nor particularly qualified to try to delve into this here, and there is little worth saying on any superficial level. How\u00ac ever, new challenges and insights are playing about the scene. The Framingham data show that the excess CHD risk associated with their measures of glucose intolerance (admittedly somewhat crude) is not large. In many analyses the relationship is insig\u00ac nificant and at most the CHD risk ratios are around 1.5 among the diabetes-prone com\u00ac pared to the others.33 Investigators also are finding that diabetes and glucose intolerance are rather more strongly correlated with con\u00ac gestive heart failure than with other mani\u00ac festations of coronary disease.32 Whether this is related to the known, but unexplained, association between glucose intolerance and elevated blood pressure is not yet clear. The most profound conceptual develop\u00ac ment in this field is the accumulating evi\u00ac dence, with its calling into question of basic tenets of diabetology, that control of blood sugar in adult-onset diabetes is not effective in reducing CHD or atherosclerotic complica\u00ac tions and that dietary management is as appropriate to long-term therapy, or more so, than are hypoglycemic agents.76 It may turn out to be that in this group of patients the result of many decades of emphasis on blood sugar control with insulin was to treat the wrong mechanism in the wrong way. Hygienic emphasis on weight reduction, physical activ\u00ac ity, blood pressure lowering, with reduction of serum lipids and smoking habits, might well be a more rational, effective and safer ap\u00ac proach than the traditional pharmacological one. For the nonce, this is speculation, but a multifactor intervention trial in which this treatment difference were randomly assigned would be of great interest and importance. Sedentary Habits as a Risk Factor One of those simple questions so difficult to answer is, \"What is the role of physical ac\u00ac tivity in CHD?\" Well over 20 years of systematic researches have failed to provide a clear answer. However, the evidence is in about differences in occupational physical activity and CHD incidence; by and large, the differences are small but in favor of the more active occupations.74 Their slightly lower rates are unexplained by lower levels in the distributions of the major primary risk factors. Occupational comparisons are only a first, and rather unsatisfactory, piece of evidence, however; probably very different kinds of persons apply to be and remain active manual workers than those who seek and remain in white collar and sedentary 18 Progress in Cardiology occupations. For cultures in which most occu\u00ac pations have become relatively sedentary, leisure-time activity makes up the greatest source of differences in energy expenditure. Again, however, leisure exercise is a self- selected and perhaps constitutionally de\u00ac termined factor. We have difficulties finding natural groups which differ only in terms of their level of habitual physical activity. There is an important recent study of this question among British civil service employees by Morris, who also studied London bus- drivers and conductors, and clerks and post\u00ac men, starting 20 years ago.55 He has at\u00ac tempted to get round the occupational selec\u00ac tion question by investigating largely seden\u00ac tary civil servants and relating their leisure\u00ac time exercise habits to subsequent CHD ex\u00ac perience. Morris used an activity diary in these highly motivated and cooperative men and developed a score based on large muscle activities, calisthenics, gardening, carpentry, brisk walking, stair climbing and other British types of active activities. He related five increasing classes of leisure activity to subsequent CHD experience. There were no CHD differences until the highest classifica\u00ac tion was reached, involving frequent peak activities to a level of 7.5 kcal/minute. The results, adjusted for age and for smoking habit, indicated a significantly lower rate of new CHD in those who took part in en\u00ac durance activities with peak levels of con\u00ac ditioning types of exercise. The Framingham study has recently attempted to characterize physical activity by weighting the hours spent at different levels, based on a 24-hour diary, and arriving at a \"physical activity index.\"37 In both simple and multivariate analyses of follow-up data they found a general relation\u00ac ship of the activity index to subsequent CHD risk, the most significant difference being a 2-fold excess of CHD incidence among the extremely sedentary men. The steepest gradient in incidence related to activity was for sudden death, but the actual differences in type of CHD manifestation were not statis\u00ac tically significant. The limitations of all these studies are clear; the slothful, or the \"constitutionally in\u00ac adequate,\" would tend to select themselves into sedentary work and leisure activities, the measurement of habitual activity by diaries is limited, and confounding factors abound. Part of the conflicting results of the several major activity studies may be due to the weak methods of assessing habitual activity. Part may relate to cultural differences where the effect of combinations of risk factors is differ\u00ac ent, where, for example, the underlying bur\u00ac den of arterial disease in the population has a different concentration or severity. The association of CHD with sedentary habits is weakly supported by most studies, but the interpretation varies on \"how much\" is the influence of physical activity. Would the Finns, hardworking at outdoor jobs, have even more CHD if they were less active? Are bursts of peak effort to 7.5 kcal/minute in leisure-time sport really comparable to life\u00ac time habits of endurance activity in which customarily even heavy manual workers rarely get out of breath? Is the proportion of work capacity performed, according to age, the important variable (maximal capacity decreases with age) or is it the absolute level of activity? Do the risks of taking up exercise outweigh the advantages of conditioning in the previously and perennially sedentary? Of course, few would question the desirability of young people continuing to remain vigorously active into later years. In addition to these uncertainties, the rela\u00ac tively weak influence of sedentary status on CHD incidence makes it a bit shaky concep\u00ac tually to consider in detail the possible mechanisms of the protective action of exer\u00ac cise. Those authors convinced that their data show an independent contribution of physi\u00ac cal activity are nevertheless wont to speculate. For example, Kannel considers, in the ab\u00ac sence of statistically significant differences in the type or lethality of CHD manifestation related to activity, that \"physical activity protects more against having a lethal out\u00ac come than against having an attack.\"37 He Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 19 feels compelled to muster a mechanism to explain the insignificant differences by stating that \"physical training benefits the cardio\u00ac vascular apparatus primarily by promoting collaterals to compensate for a compromised coronary circulation and not by retarding atherogenesis.\" On the other hand, Morris, finding similarly insignificant differences in the type of CHD manifestation according to activity index, observes that \"the effects of enough exertion seem to be about the same for rapidly fatal and other heart attacks,\" and he opines that \"the suggestion must be that vigorous exercise is a defense against critical processes further back (my italics) in the lifelong natural history than electrical dysrhythmia.\"55 At any rate, most investigators find little association between activity habits and primary CHD risk factors. Whatever activity \"effect\" exists, if any, appears to be inde\u00ac pendent of the major primary CHD risk fac\u00ac tors. One opinion holds that the \"advantage of exercise seems to be in adaptations to these (risk factors).\"37 At this stage of the available evidence and of the controversy it seems that a well-designed clinical trial is required for an answer, but one can sympathize with the decision makers who have either rejected or avoided this de\u00ac cision. A \"pure\" trial about the effect of exercise alone on CHD incidence is not feasible; exercise obviously cannot be blinded, and change in activity habits involves many other health-related habits and attributes in that it possibly affects diet, weight, blood pressure, glucose tolerance, lipids, smoking, etc. In consequence, a trial to test the ac\u00ac tivity hypothesis would, of necessity, be a multiple risk-factor intervention in which one treatment group might be added to the intervention with an activity program above the usual risk-factor treatment. The num\u00ac bers and cost required for a primary preven\u00ac tion trial to test this question are huge be\u00ac cause of the apparently relative weak in\u00ac fluence of exercise; so are the logistical con\u00ac siderations of recruiting, testing, exercising, assuring safety, motivating and following a group of high-risk sedentary middle-aged men during several years of such a program.'4 Moreover, it would be most desirable to study subgroups involving several levels and durations of exercise in order to decide the level to prescribe. I believe it is unlikely that such a primary CHD prevention trial of exercise will be adequately performed or that the \"definitive experimental evidence\" will be forthcoming in man in the next period of history. The physician is left therefore, as in many other aspects of medical judgment in his prac\u00ac tice, to extrapolate from other observations. These include the descriptive studies earlier mentioned, a number of animal studies on coronary circulation and exercise, and more relevant, possibly, the results of needed con\u00ac trolled trials of secondary prevention using physical conditioning in the rehabilitation of cardiac patients.2 Knowledge progresses slowly in this difficult field. The best clinical judgment of what to do now for the long- sedentary, high-risk American probably lies somewhere between the counsel of the eager fitness buffs and that of the sedentary anti\u00ac fitness snobs among our profession. Moderate activity, in the form of brisk walking and non\u00ac competitive sports, is a part of balanced satis\u00ac fying living which should obtain for all ages in a sedentary technological culture. Such activity is the obvious \"secret,\" missed by most, to long-term weight control. It is the safe and sane hygienic prescription of the thoughtful physician for his patients, the high risk and the healthy alike.2 Soft Water as a Risk Factor The epidemiologists have had a field day on this question. The great appeal to them of this soft water factor, if it should turn out to be one of the \"x factors\" in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, is that it is widely and readily modifiable without the need for personal habit changes. This is often con\u00ac sidered of prime importance for effective mass public health measures. The inverse correla\u00ac tion of water hardness, variously defined, to 20 Progress in Cardiology cardiovascular and coronary mortality has been strong (yielding correlation coefficients of \u2014.5 to \u2014.7) in almost all communities in which the water differences and incidence dif\u00ac ferences are sizable.13,14'49,56 For example, the differences in CHD incidence according to United States vital statistics are on the order of 25 to 40 per cent between the \"hard\" Colorado River basin and the \"soft\" Ohio River basin, and there are differences on the order of 70 per cent for hypertensive heart disease.49 A comprehensive search for dif\u00ac ferences in other environmental variables has not been particularly rewarding, though annual rainfall has been found to \"explain\" the CHD differences as well as water hard\u00ac ness.79 Recent surveys which sampled 6 hard- and 6 soft-water communities in Britain disclosed significant differences in resting heart rate, blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking habits. Crawford's confounding analysis has provided the suggestion that differences in these factors may be sufficient to explain some of the differences in CHD incidence.71 Data from Ontario and from Washington state in North America suggest that CHD dif\u00ac ferences according to water hardness lie in sudden death rates, in this case measured as coroner- versus noncoroner-certified CHD deaths.49 Fascinating also are other reports of public health \"experiments\" of softening or harden\u00ac ing of community water supplies, found pos\u00ac sibly to be associated with a subsequent change in CHD rates. There was a much greater increase in CHD incidence (20 per cent) in communities converting to soft water than in those not changing their water supply (11 per cent), or in those converting to hard- water supplies (8.5 per cent).49 The age- adjusted CVD death rate dropped somewhat, though not significantly, in south Florida communities in the years just after water supplies there were changed from rain water to deep wells.23 The challenge of these findings is great to those interested in minerals and disease as well as to the epidemiologist. The possible mechanisms of such an effect remain quite obscure, however, and the evidence among clinical, laboratory and epidemiological meth\u00ac odologies is not yet tied together. My great\u00ac est problem in interpreting these data on water hardness and CHD incidence is the fact that mineral intake in food generally overwhelms the amounts taken in water supplies, even accounting for sizable amounts of calcium which can be acquired from cook\u00ac ing in water. Despite the current excitement, I count myself, for the moment, among the skeptics as to whether the soft water itself is responsible, or whether hardness is protective, and I consider that soft water as a risk indi\u00ac cator is simply a statistical association with\u00ac out direct causal or preventive implications. One would be happy to learn otherwise, how\u00ac ever. Personality, Behavior, and Stress as Risk Factors Most physicians, including medical inves\u00ac tigators, believe that the behavioral and emo\u00ac tional aspect of life is somehow related to the development of CHD. There is a great deal of uncritical acceptance of a vast literature on the subject, most of which must be heavily dis\u00ac counted because it involves studies of persons already stricken with and obviously changed by their clinical coronary disease. Only the Western Collaborative Study of Friedman and Rosenman in the United States shows any independent association of behavior type with future CHD risk, and it is crucial that this study be replicated elsewhere, as has been done for all other risk factors.15 It is not yet demonstrated that there is a universal, readily measurable, or modifiable behavioral component to CHD risk. The leading proponents of the role of higher nervous activity and behavior in CHD are Friedman and Rosenman.15 They have de\u00ac veloped an interview method which is reason\u00ac ably reproducible in the hands of those they have trained and results in a scaling of be- Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 21 havior in two major types, A and B. Their claims are several: 1. 90 per cent of all American coronary patients under age 60 are Type A. 2. Type As have 2 to 3 times excess future coronary risk when other risk factors are con\u00ac trolled (analytically adjusted). 3. Type As have twice as severe basic coronary atherosclerosis. 4. Type As have elevated serum cholesterol. 5. Hypothalamic manipulation in rats makes them Type A and produces hypercholester\u00ac emia. No one to my knowledge has reviewed and published a thoroughgoing critique of these claims or their works. There is no space to do so here, but the problems are numerous. Few find the interview scoring as reproducible as they. Any method requiring the degree of commitment to the special training or con\u00ac tinuing influence of \"his master's voice\" is difficult to apply universally. The method is clearly difficult if not impossible to transpose directly to cultures other than the one in which it was developed. The populations which the authors have studied are clearly biased; for myself, I cannot easily accept that there is one simple tool which can be used universally to characterize successfully 90 per cent of CHD cases as Friedman claims!15 Then there is, of course, the problem aroused by Friedman's fixation: \". . . We believe that until the possible patho\u00ac genetic proclivities of this behavior pattern are not only seriously and widely accepted as probably operative in coronary heart disease, but also exhaustively studied, the present mor\u00ac bidity rate of CHD will remain at about its present miserable level.\"15 Those of us who have personally observed and followed droves of well-adapted senior workers of the American rail industry, who by the very nature of the work and the system are not in \"chronic, continuous struggle\" and who die with a very high rate of atherosclerot\u00ac ic complications, are quite unimpressed with the idea that personality-behavior stress is a necessary component of CHD, even in our culture. Those of us who have also seen one of man's most civilized, calm, stolid outdoor- working and attractive cultures\u2014that is, among the rural fat-eating Finns, who are disabled and die at the highest rate of CHD known to man\u2014are singularly unconvinced that stress and behavior are primarily re\u00ac sponsible for the modern epidemic of this disease.40 And those of us who have seen the frantic turmoil, overcrowding, social competition and confusions of modern life in Japan, where the CHD rate is still very low, are convinced that stress cannot work alone to cause CHD, at least in the masses\u2014which is our problem in preventive cardiology. That is not to say that individual or group behavior is unrelated to pathogenesis or to the precipitation of coronary attacks in those susceptible in United States culture. They very probably are related; how much of the influence operates through neurohumoral influences on circulation, coagulation, in\u00ac flammation, immunity, catecholamine ac\u00ac tivity, and lipid metabolism, and how much these are related to \"goal-less drives\" and \"chronic struggle,\" simple frustration, bad habits, overeating and depression, etc.? No one is yet in a good position to answer. One problem in the controversy is that the behavioral theses can hardly be considered public health oriented in terms of the aspects of behavior and personality which can be practically measured and effectively modified. The important recent review of this whole topic by Jenkins30 does not really come to grips with the preventive and public health issues. Moreover, there is little likeli\u00ac hood that the hypotheses about personality- behavior and CHD will soon be put to ex\u00ac perimental test, as are the other risk elements now being tested in the hypertension pro\u00ac grams and in the multifactor preventive approach to CHD. So we must all agree to listen openly, but with the uncomfortable feeling that the evidence will probably not be forthcoming, in our time, that modification of Type A or any other classifications of be\u00ac havior, other than that involved in interven\u00ac tion on the primary CHD risk factors, will 22 Progress in Cardiology influence CHD risk. In addition, for the im\u00ac portant aspect of management of persons with high CHD risk, we are still seeking help from behavioral scientists and evidence that their thinking and methods can contribute tech\u00ac niques superior in the reduction of common CHD risk factors to those which simply occur in community mores or individual customs, through straightforward educational-motiva\u00ac tional approaches usually applied by the physician or health worker, usually without ideological models or formal strategy. One awaits and actively encourages the accumu\u00ac lation of such evidence! Heredity and Family History as Risk Factors Probably most physicians still believe that the greatest determinant of coronary disease and of longevity is in the genes. This is de\u00ac spite the fact that we continue to see younger and younger people stricken with coronary disease whose parents had none but who, on the contrary, lived to good old ages. Phy\u00ac sicians generally continue to ignore the mag\u00ac nitude of differences in CHD rates between countries and between genetically identical ethnic groups (10-fold and more) which indi\u00ac cates the overwhelmingly predominant effect of cultural-environmental influences com\u00ac pared to genetic. We tend to forget that much of any familial \"effect\" on CHD is mediated through the commonly known risk elements of blood pressure, lipids, etc., and that these are quite susceptible to diagnosis and preventive care. We tend to forget also that families share habits and attitudes as well as genes. The \"definitive\" analyses are not yet done which would look, presumably, at parental age at death, or other genetic tags, in terms of prediction of new CHD or death, using multivariate techniques to adjust for the effects of associated variables. For example, birth order and age of the father at birth appear to be as relevant as pa\u00ac rental longevity in CHD prediction.69 The evidence suggests that family history is not terribly relevant over and above the presence of good information on measured risk factors', family history is itself neither a sen\u00ac tence to, nor a pardon from, CHD risk in the vast majority of persons and families living in industrial society.64 The lesson for the practitioner, I believe, is that bad family history can be considerably discounted if the individual is found to be really at the low end of the distribution of primary risk factors, and, if otherwise, that such a history is a use\u00ac ful incentive to a positive prevention pro\u00ac gram when risk-factor modification is de\u00ac sirable. RISK FACTORS FOR SUDDEN DEATH There is a growing body of thought which considers sudden death as an entity, only more or less intimately tied to coronary artery disease or to coronary heart disease. This may prove to be a worthwhile concept. It is now leading to attempts to delineate specific elements of risk for sudden or instantaneous death, as opposed to those related to more gradual, less lethal forms of coronary dis\u00ac ease.32,77 It could also lead to attempts at specific modes of preventive intervention as proposed in a recent symposium16 and else\u00ac where.2,4 There is, indeed, evidence that sudden death is at times virtually an accidental, or incidental, coronary manifestation, in \"hearts too good to die.\" However the efforts to single out risk factors highly specific to sudden death have revealed only slight statistical trends. In other words, the primary risk factors for sudden death in the population at large are quite the same as those risk factors related to other coronary events.32 The possible exception of ectopic ventricu\u00ac lar arrhythmias is under intensive investiga\u00ac tion.4,16 Evidence from Minnesota,4 from the Coronary Drug Project,11,12 and from Framingham37 suggests that the simple fre\u00ac quency of ventricular ectopic beats (VEB) relates to risk of death only through associated manifest myocardial disease (clinical or ECG), where VEB are indeed accompanied by excess risk of sudden death. In the ab- Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 23 sence of manifest cardiac disease, including \"high-risk healthy men,\" the evidence is still inconclusive that in the general population ectopic beats contribute independently to the risk of sudden death.4 The findings about ectopic rhythms open a fruitful field for pre\u00ac ventive efforts in those found to have YEB plus ECG or clinically manifest coronary disease. It must be clear, however, that the optimal preventive approach to sudden death, frequently the very first manifestation of coronary disease, requires emphasis and progress in the primary prevention of coronary disease. ADVANCES IN RISK APPRAISAL Some scientists appear to entertain the idea that the ultimate role of science is to develop predictive equations. Without embracing this idea, it is clear that such equations have been the base for obvious successes in the physical sciences, such as in the calculation of orbits. An equation made up of simply measured variables which predicts a future event is certainly the most elegant manner of expressing an hypothesis. Equally as enticing are the clues to discovery provided when observed events do not follow those predicted by an otherwise successful equation\u2014-hence the discovery of mascons from variations in the predicted orbit of space ships circling the moon, etc. The vagaries of biomedical data and the nature of biology allow us much less prognostic precision, but the opportunities are enormous. The prediction of CHD risk from equations using easily acquired infor\u00ac mation on risk elements has provided a power\u00ac ful tool for research as well as for practical risk classification, education, motivation and decision making, for the individual and his physician. One often hears the unthinking repetition that epidemiologically acquired risk data and statistical risk scores \"predict for the group but not for the individual.\" Well- known medical scientific figures, as well as those active on the front of medical practice, have, I think, not yet quite grasped the rele\u00ac vance of the application of \"statistics\" to the individual patient. We need to continue our conversations on this question to increase the understanding between those primarily taking care of sick patients and those primarily de\u00ac voting their work to prevention. I like the recent analogy of Kannel:32 \". . . I take issue a little bit with the prevailing notion that statistics apply only to populations, and clinical impression applies to individual pa\u00ac tients. True enough, a good clinician intuitively can tell if a patient is likely to do poorly or well but I think this could be quantitated too. When a clinician tells a diabetic that he should take good care of his feet, he doesn't know that that patient will develop gangrene. [Rather] he knows the patient belongs to a group which has a high probability of having vascular disorders which affect the peripheral circulation and there\u00ac fore he says: 'You may personally escape the aver\u00ac age experience of your group, but you must act as if you have a high liklihood of this, because on the average you do.' \" In fact, most medical decisions we make for the individual case are based on a larger or group experience of similar or related cases! It is entirely appropriate that we apply the risk probabilities from stable and systematic observations in larger groups, to place the individual case into the risk category which best fits his combined characteristics and to exercise our judgment\u2014in addition to what the prediction equation or risk score tells us. No good clinician accepts laboratory reports at face value. Such methods of prediction simply add a quantitative dimension. They provide the rational basis for preventive ac\u00ac tion in medical practice. Progress has been made in providing tools for the physician to assess CHD risk in a useful way for himself and his patient.33 Solutions of multivariate equations provide \"smoothed\" probabilities of risk, based on the patient's combinations of risk factors. Tables showing this risk allow discussion with patients of their risk relative to counterparts of similar age with greater and lesser probabilities of future CHD. The relative risk idea is given the pa\u00ac tient: \"You are three times more likely to have a coronary in the next X years than a 24 Progress in Cardiology man with these lower values.\" This is in\u00ac structive and motivating. Next, the esti\u00ac mated actual risk probabilities can be shown: \"Your chances of having a coronary in the next 5 years are 3 out of 100, and this is com\u00ac pared to another's of 1 out of 100.\" Such 3 per cent odds of disaster can usually be handled by people without anxiety, if a pic\u00ac ture is simultaneously painted of a positive health image and an individual prevention program is offered. The American Heart Association provides good risk appraisal ma\u00ac terials through its many state affiliates or directly (44 East 23rd Street, New York, New York 10010). STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE RISK-FACTOR APPROACH Despite the lingering doubts and the con\u00ac tinued challenges, the clinical acceptance of the risk-factor approach to identification and management of high CHD risk persons has been, on the whole, rapid and universal in recent times. This is probably because the quantitative epidemiological data are clear, are consistent with data from clinical- pathological and experimental disciplines, and are compatible with clinical attitudes about good practice. Few physicians, after all, hold the view that cigarette smoking, hypertension and high blood lipid levels are actually good for anybody. There are serious conceptual and procedural problems in the risk-factor approach to the prevention of CHD, however, at least to the significant reduction of the population burden of CHD. We should briefly consider this apparent paradox to give a more complete understand\u00ac ing of prevention in cardiology. The screening-for-high-risk-and-follow-up approach to detection and treatment of sus- ceptibles to CHD is a logical culmination of two decades of systematic epidemiological studies. These showed the quantitative relationships of risk factors during health to future CHD experience which provide the basis for the most efficient, safe and reason\u00ac able approach available to the physician and to the American public for preventive action now and for the immediate future. These re\u00ac lationships are the cornerstone of the current National Heart and Lung Institute preven\u00ac tive trials, in which men with multiple high risk-factor levels will be identified and treated (Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, MRFIT), and in which men and women with single risk-factor elevations are being sought out and treated (Hypertension Detec\u00ac tion and Follow-up Program, HDFP, and the Lipid Research Centers, LRC). The MRFIT approach to multiple risk factors is the one designed to test efficiently the most urgent hypothesis, whether CHD deaths can be reduced at all in high-risk men after the age of 35. A disease of multiple causation should respond best, if it responds at all, to multiple intervention.6 Important as is the risk screening concept, and its implementation in carefully evalu\u00ac ated prevention trials among American adults, this approach to risk simply cannot be counted on, in itself, to beat the mass CHD problem. Why? The most practical, effi\u00ac cient and economic risk screen available, based on smoking, blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels, allows one to concentrate risk only to the extent of identification among the upper 10per cent of risk, those who will in 5 to 10 years develop about 30 per cent of all the CHD in the population. If multifactor intervention were a glorious and total success in high-risk middle-aged men, and if it at\u00ac tained the potential figure of 50 per cent risk reduction in that group, risk-factor de\u00ac tection and intervention could, therefore, reduce the CHD burden by 15 per cent in the next decade in the total population from which the high risk men were selected. If this experience could be successfully extrap\u00ac olated to a huge nationwide effort, it would (again) be a great step for those 15 per cent of men who are directly affected but hardly the giant leap for mankind which is required to reduce significantly and to put off premature CHD death and disability. Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 25 The point is that in a population such as that in the United States, where the masses are highly susceptible, where the relative risk is overall very high relative to other countries, and where the distribution of levels of com\u00ac bined risk factors is elevated compared to other countries, the searching out and treat\u00ac ing of those 5 to 10 per cent at the top of the pile will not eliminate the pile. A broader approach is required. Even application of the screening approach to detect high-risk children and young adults cannot produce great advances unless there occurs also a broader influence on risk-factor levels in the country as a result of these efforts. A disease of predominantly sociocultural origins re\u00ac quires a sociocultural, as well as a medical diagnostic-therapeutic, approach for signif\u00ac icant progress to occur. Don't misunderstand; the physician must heartily support and participate in the high- risk detection and treatment approach when it is carried out effectively in the community. One must support, as well, its extension to younger age groups where intervention is likely to be more important. I feel it neces\u00ac sary to point out, however, that union of the academic and pragmatic attitudes on the high-risk concept will not do the whole job on CHD prevention in the larger culture. One of the reasons many of us will, in a sense, sacrifice the next 5 years of our investigative lives to these very burdensome large preven\u00ac tive trials in CHD is that we think the evi\u00ac dential base we anticipate will be produced by them is essential to initiate the chain reaction necessary to achieve a true preventive cardiology and an impact on the public health.\u00ae A personal, social, cutural, economic, and legislative program leading to CHD preven\u00ac tion has been most explicitly and strongly put forth in the well-known report on the Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis of the Intersociety Commission on Heart Disease Resources, Suite 316, 44 East 23rd Street, New York, New York 10010. It provides a valuable source of ideas and programs for the practitioner, legislator and private citizen. It will be updated in 1975. OTHER PROBLEMS IN THE USE AND INTERPRETATION OF RISK FACTORS AND THE RISK CONCEPT The term \"risk factors\" has been widely applied to characteristics found in apparent health to relate to subsequent CHD risk. Risk factors have been \"sold,\" as a handle- able and comprehensible package, by those wishing to popularize the preventive ap\u00ac proach to CHD. The term, the concept and the information about risk factors have been useful to the physician in helping him to think of his patient's, or his own, future CHD risk, rather than thinking purely in terms of immediate CHD diagnosis, and to help him to think of prophylactic action rather than only of conventional therapeutic manage\u00ac ment. I believe that this package has been a good \"buy.\" There are only a few more points that I would like to make about risk factors. One is to reiterate that a \"risk factor\" may not be at all a causal factor, but rather one only associated with future risk. For example, a number of \"minor, nonspecific\" ECG find\u00ac ings are associated with future excess risk of clinically manifest disease. These might better be termed \"risk indicators,\" leaving the term \"risk factors\" for those characteris\u00ac tics thought, from other evidence, to be in\u00ac volved in pathogenesis. Moreover, one should conceptually separate those risk factors sus\u00ac ceptible to modification and directly bearing on preventive management, such as hyperten\u00ac sion, from others powerfully related to risk but unmodifiable, such as age, sex and race, or those questionably modifiable, such as personality. Another point is that, though the risk- factor concept is simple, the study and eluci\u00ac dation of risk factors have their sophisticated problems. Those of us involved in the sys\u00ac tematic and empirical follow-up investiga\u00ac tions of large populations have come to appreciate that the simplest cocktail-type 26 Progress in Cardiology questions, such as \"Is coffee drinking bad for you?,\" are among the most difficult to answer in medicine. We also come to realize that important as are mechanisms of disease, we cannot transpose effectively our knowledge of the mechanisms of acute effects, such as the pressor and excitatory effects of caffeine, to the long-term risk of disease, without some\u00ac where in between conducting very tedious and careful empirical observations and analyses. The most obvious and important considerations are the confounding factors, or co-morbid conditions. To exploit this example, the coffee question might go as follows: Does coffee contribute to CHD risk? The rationale might then go as follows: Caffeine is a widely and heavily used and rather potent drug which affects cardiovascular responses and possibly myo\u00ac cardial oxygen demand, irritability, fibrilla\u00ac tion threshold and metabolic processes. A first step, the least expensive but often the least rewarding and sometimes misleading, is to formalize this idea by comparing the coffee-drinking habits of hospitalized CHD patients versus controls.31 Even in the best of case-control studies one cannot have great security about the results because of the inevitable bias in encountering such patients and in choosing their controls. Moreover, the risk element (caffeine intake) may change after onset of illness, and many possible confounding associations exist with both the CHD risk and the supposed risk factor (coffee drinking). If a carefully matched case-control study suggests that the idea or clinical observation could be true, the next step in answering this simple-minded question is a tedious one. It is so tedious and expensive that few have the courage or re\u00ac sources to undertake such studies, at least out of the context of other studies. The study might proceed, in brief, as follows: Classify the characteristic as well as possible, actually measuring it (chemically) if possible, and in enough men to develop an answer about the simple relationship of the coffee habit to future risk, within a reasonable time. If this is done in \"healthy\" men, and is shown to be crudely related to subsequent CHD risk, then we must determine if it is a dose-related re\u00ac sponse, i.e. if it is a smoothly increasing risk or otherwise. Having thus established a simple relation\u00ac ship does not mean that coffee itself is a risk factor in terms of causation. Independence must be shown. In other words, is coffee related to CHD risk irrespective of other risk factors, or is it related through its association with other risk attributes, such as cigarette smoking? If there are no substantial correla\u00ac tions of coffee drinking with other risk factors, an independent effect may be considered pos\u00ac sible. Actually, important correlations exist between coffee drinking and smoking, and possibly lesser associations with blood pres\u00ac sure, weight, etc.60 The severest test of the independence of the association is to prepare a risk score from the major CHD risk factors and add coffee as a last step to the equation to see whether the prediction of future CHD is improved. If so, we are still not out of the woods. Other analyses are needed to determine whether the effect of coffee is through interaction with another risk factor, i.e. is coffee important for future risk primarily in the presence of obesity and cigarette smoking, etc.? Risk fac\u00ac tors, to be useful to the practitioner, must be significantly, consistently, independently and causally related to risk, and must be poten\u00ac tially modifiable. Finally, the definitive test of the causal influence of coffee would have to be a clinical trial. One needs consider the magnitude of such a trial and the energy and skills required to answer this simplest of health questions, and to decide whether the potential benefit, based on the observations, would be worth the cost. Most physicians have never had the opportunity to examine the logic of determin\u00ac ing the size of the sample needed to answer such a question adequately, quite aside from considering the logistics of obtaining and maintaining such a group of experimental subjects. I have attempted elsewhere to por- Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 27 tray this problem in terms of the controlled study needed of the effect of exercise condi\u00ac tioning on late survival after myocardial in\u00ac farction.2 Under realistic conditions, 2,000 to 3,000 infarct patients would be needed to demonstrate with confidence a 25 per cent favorable effect of cardiac rehabilitation on CHD incidence, if such an effect exists! Con\u00ac sidering that the frequency of CHD events is much less in a general population, and that one could hardly entertain the idea that cof\u00ac fee drinking might be responsible for more than a 25 per cent excess of CHD risk, many thousands more subjects would be required for a definitive coffee trial! RISK-FACTOR MODIFICATION Much good advice is available to the prac\u00ac titioner from the American Heart Association and from the medical literature about reduc\u00ac ing the risk of primary coronary events. His first real decision is whether or not prevention is his forte. Each physician knows himself well enough to estimate whether he will im\u00ac plement an effective preventive approach in his routine practice. If he knows that he will pay only lip service to the matter, he might do well to support the development of other facilities for this purpose, among his col\u00ac leagues or in his clinic or community hos\u00ac pital, and then to keep the facility alive by sending it referrals. One interesting ap\u00ac proach being tried has the physician accom\u00ac pany the patient to the preventive facility as he might accompany a patient to surgery, thus learning as a participant more about his patient and his preventive care. It is remarkable that the splendid models of prevention long provided by the pediatri\u00ac cian, the obstetrician and the dentist are not yet widely copied by the generalist, the intern\u00ac ist or cardiologist. Consider the modern dentist, the only one to which I would com\u00ac mit my family. He requires that each of us spend 4 hours with his hygienist before he will even examine our teeth. I pay for this allied dental service with pleasure; the tech\u00ac niques learned and the motivation provided are very effective. Only then does he give the complete dental examination with x-rays, and only then does he practice reparative and restorative care. The dentist's routine 6-month callbacks are appreciated and not considered commercialism. They are re\u00ac ligiously observed and they motivate one not only to \"look good\" for the dentist but to adopt a truly positive hygienic approach, a pride in good dental health and appearance (and a wonderful by-product, no bad breath!). If families and insurers begin to accept this expense and employ this preventive approach for dentistry, would they not do the same for a physician who set up his medical practice in such a fashion? Enough of us must try it to find out. PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDES ABOUT THE CAUSE AND PREVENTION OF CHD There is clearly more to the pathogenesis of CHD in all its manifestations than just fatty arteries, but if we assume the validity of the general relationship of CHD to atherosclerosis where do we stand with respect to its patho\u00ac genesis and prevention? Remarkably enough, there persist two strikingly polar attitudes on this subject with much talk about each and little listening between them. These I call the academic and the pragmatic attitudes. I will attempt here to characterize these attitudes very briefly because they now dominate car\u00ac diological thought and affect diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, as well as researches and preventive action. The Academic Attitude This concept holds that atherosclerosis and CHD are largely due to a metabolic abnor\u00ac mality, one of absorption, synthesis, circula\u00ac tion and deposition of lipids and lipopro\u00ac teins. This view holds that there are several known types of metabolic lipid abnormality, each independently associated with different degrees of manifestation of atherosclerosis. They are considered intrinsic and largely genetically determined defects, some readily 28 Progress in Cardiology influenced by diet and others less so. Athero\u00ac sclerosis must therefore, according to this idea, be attacked by accurate diagnosis of the metabolic abnormality and type-specific ther\u00ac apy, using the traditional medical therapeutic approaches of drugs or surgery directed at these intrinsically defective mechanisms. A modern thorough medical checkup should now include detailed lipid classification and phenotyping. Individual patients found with lipoprotein abnormalities should be sub\u00ac jected to vigorous treatment. This therapy may be abetted by type-specific, rigid diet prescriptions. The academic attitude further holds that mass control of the atherosclerotic diseases lies in the distant future, and depends upon the success of \"fundamental\" research on the mechanisms of lipid metabolism, lipid transport and deposition in the arterial wall, mechanical, immunological and enzymatic researches, and more understanding of the blood coagulation system. Furthermore, it holds that attempts to change individual liv\u00ac ing habits are not fruitful pursuits and are indicated only for those demonstrated to be among the very high risk according to Amer\u00ac ican norms of values for risk factors. Finally, it is insisted that mass modification of our eating habits, other than a general concern for obesity and overall energy balance, is not indicated, and that it would be particularly unwise to change widely or importantly the composition of the diets of the young, or otherwise to disturb the \"nutritious\" Amer\u00ac ican way of eating. The Pragmatic Attitude This concept contrasts in most respects with the academic one in that atherosclerosis and the atherosclerotic diseases are considered to be predominantly manifestations of a way of life which now involves the greatest propor\u00ac tion of people in many advanced countries. These diseases are known to be multifactorial in origin, associated with varying degrees of inherent individual susceptibility and in\u00ac trinsic regulation, but their epidemic nature and great burden on society are clearly and largely environmentally and culturally de\u00ac termined. The consistency and confluence of evidence from clinical, laboratory and epi\u00ac demiological studies indicate that serum lipids, primarily serum cholesterol, and ar\u00ac terial blood pressure and cigarette smoking are universally strong influences on the risk of the disease and that they are probably causally related to CHD.64 They are, more\u00ac over, culturally modifiable characteristics. This provides the rationale for individual treatment of elevated risk characteristics but, more important, for a large-scale but gradual socioeconomic and cultural evolution directed toward mass prevention of the major cardiovascular diseases. Many other CHD risk characteristics operate, including genet\u00ac ics and family history, but these are either relatively weak or they operate largely through the primary risk factors which domi\u00ac nate other influences in explaining the now- certain large population differences in fre\u00ac quency of the disease. This view holds that, because of the central facts that the atherosclerotic diseases are nearly nonexistent in many populations, the risk is continuous, that is, it increases smoothly with the level of risk factors, and that known primary risk factors are modifiable; because of these and other facts, atherosclerotic dis\u00ac eases cannot be considered due usually to unique inborn metabolic abnormalities. More\u00ac over, because the underlying atherosclerotic process involves the majority of adults in the United States, is insidious in development, often strikes suddenly and, once manifest, is resistant to effective treatment, a traditional diagnostic and therapeutic approach simply cannot bring significant progress in reducing the burden to society of these diseases. Though fundamental research on these dis\u00ac eases is desirable now, such research might conceivably be entirely academic. Because some rather advanced countries have little or no CHD, potentially the complex world of fundamental research and heroically aggres\u00ac sive therapy could be bypassed by effective mass preventive action on the known major Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 29 risk factors. The most efficient and practical approach to prevention of CHD would be to modify simultaneously the major risk factors by concerted effort at detection and treat\u00ac ment of high-risk individuals, over the short run,5,75 and by careful and concerted larger scale preventive action to produce safe, palatable and hygienic alternatives to the present unfavorable characteristics in the way of life of whole peoples. Mass changes in attitudes, life styles and mores, and in the economy as well, are, in fact, possible; this has been repeatedly demonstrated, most re\u00ac cently in the beef freeze. Some such mass social change is essential to a major reduction of the CHD burden. Traditional and pharmacological approaches to risk reduction are suitable only to particular high-risk in\u00ac dividuals, and only when the risk is com\u00ac mensurate with the dangers of long-term drug toxicity or when safe hygienic measures are unsuccessful in the individual case. These then are the battle lines, well drawn, and the conflict of attitudes continues. I be\u00ac lieve that there is a steady trend toward a larger professional and public comprehension and acceptance of the pragmatic attitude toward CHD prevention, but the academic fortress still stands with its elements of cau\u00ac tion and with its elements of validity. It has strong professional adherents in high places. It is hoped that in this progress report the strengths and limitations of each attitude are made more apparent. THE NIHILISTIC VIEW OF CHD PREVENTION In addition to the academic viewpoint of CHD, there are many other impediments to preventive efforts in cardiology, both in and outside the profession. How does the cock\u00ac tail-hour argument go? \"Gotta die some way, some day, why not a nice clean coro\u00ac nary?\" or \"Coronary prevention just means more old folks around, why tamper with Mother Nature?\" etc. These attitudes are frequently bandied about, even by cardi\u00ac ological colleagues. One does not have to be a health evangelist or any other kind of health fanatic to put down most of the phony ideas. I refer you to a little conversation on this matter between a few of us who are \"into prevention\" and a distinguished medi\u00ac cal statesman in Sweden, Professor Gunnar Biorck, who agreed to serve as devil's advo\u00ac cate for our discussion, that is, to present arguments on the social futility of CHD prevention efforts.1,73 One of these arguments is that we are, by preventive efforts, merely displacing outward the inevitable, and only changing the propor\u00ac tion of elderly in the population, already an excess, unhappy and inutile segment of society. How much nicer it would be to glimpse one's grandchildren, to know that the world will go on, and then to drop dead of a coronary! The latter fallacy must be considered first; many of us would indeed choose an instantaneous electrical death, but three-fourths of CHD victims suffer immeasur\u00ac ably from CHD disablement and frighten\u00ac ingly painful, laborious death. Moreover, one cannot choose the age at which sudden death might occur to suit such vanities. What more does therapeutic medicine ever do than that, to push back the inevitable at any stage\u2014gestation, neonatal, childhood, etc.? Why is there every expansion of costly, invasive, unproved efforts to palliate prob\u00ac lems in chronic disease, yet pontification from many quarters against simple and safe, natural and hygienic approaches to the pre\u00ac vention of the major cardiovascular diseases? These are strange paradoxes indeed, but fortunately the nihilistic argument is one with a diminishing following. It is a difficult argument on which to forward progress in cardiology. It is an impossible one on which to base an effective public health policy. The argument given by Professor Biorck also goes that the risk-detection process involves lost time and earnings as well as discomfort and anxiety for participants. It invades the individual's privacy and interferes with pre\u00ac existing physician-patient relationships. Dis\u00ac closure of an individual's \"high risk\" may be 30 Progress in Cardiology a constraint to his advancement in employ\u00ac ment and it may affect insurability. More\u00ac over, labeling as \"low risk\" on the basis of superficial screening may give a false sense of security to the person screened. These may all be considered valid \"toxic side effects\" to preventive treatment. They must be weighed against the disadvantages. Actu\u00ac ally, they should be weighed against the alternative of doing nothing until the clinical disease appears and requires traditional medi\u00ac cal treatment (if the patient survives the first attack). The great danger of CHD is that it is associated with sudden death or extensive disability and carries with it a \"permanent\" excess risk of recurrence in those who survive acute episodes. Against this picture then must be weighed these supposed drawbacks of a preventive approach.73 The economic argument, that survival to older ages is costly to society, is also hardly a firm basis for any public health program, though we should not blindly ignore the economic impact of any medical advances; rather, we should try to anticipate it. Professor Biorck's ethical point about the disturbance of peace of mind is a real one, but in my experience individuals compensate well and promptly for \"high-risk\" anxiety when they are early given an effective explana\u00ac tion of actual risk and offered a positive pro\u00ac gram for risk-factor reduction. If we had nothing to offer for elevated blood pressure, we might indeed be better off not telling of it. When, however, the pressure is over 95 mm Hg diastolic, and this is associated with a 2- to 3-fold long-term risk of CHD, and we can apparently safely reduce the blood pres\u00ac sure with tolerable side effects, is it not good practice to tell the patient, and to enlist him in an approach to its reduction? Does one rather not give a person a false sense of security by not telling him of risk-factor eleva\u00ac tion? In regard to distress, anxiety and loss of income from risk detection, these are im\u00ac portant factors in deciding on any medical procedure, but nowhere in practice are they the prime factors in medical decisions when the best judgment is that a procedure is indicated. The influence on employability and insura\u00ac bility must, of course, be considered in large- scale risk screening and prevention programs. In fact, serum lipids is about the only infor\u00ac mation obtained in such programs which is not routinely taken in employment and in\u00ac surance examinations; special attention must be given to keep this information privileged. Interference with physician-patient rela\u00ac tionships is involved only when the preventive treatment program is administered by others than the personal physician. Most phy\u00ac sicians, in my experience, are pleased to have their patients enrolled in programs providing special help and motivation toward hygienic living, as long as their conventional care is directed by the physician. Recent large- scale trials which involve drug treatment of hypertension definitely enter into a conflict of interest with the practicing physician, and may affect physician-patient relation\u00ac ships. We, as individual physicians, must simply decide whether the possible temporary loss of control of the management of an occa\u00ac sional case of hypertension is not a small price to pay for the development of definitive information on the role of treatment of mild hypertension for cardiovascular disease pre\u00ac vention. For example, in the community of 1.8 million of the greater Twin Cities of Minnesota, two screening and prevention programs that we direct will identify 1000 to 1200 and actually manage a total of 500 or 600 hypertensives, well distributed through\u00ac out the entire community, over the 6-year period of the trials. This cannot prove an economic loss or serious disturbance to any one physician or medical group in the com\u00ac munity. Moreover, the design of these con\u00ac trol programs is such that we will refer an equivalent number of hypertensives, many previously unknown, to local physicians. Another recent collection of thoughtful essays on the possibility of CHD prevention is recommended to the student of this disease.15 In it are summaries of both the positive and the negative facts and the attitudes of dis- Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 31 tinguished physicians about the clinical, the statistical, the epidemiological, and the pre\u00ac ventive approach to this serious health prob\u00ac lem. Commentary on these will serve to bring this discussion to a close. Professor Biorck of Sweden notes that the difference in the burden or distribution of risk factors among cultures seems to be less than he would expect to explain the appar\u00ac ently large differences in CHD rate. He proposes the interesting idea that there is a time factor. The Keys' group prediction equations, involving combined risk factors, indicate that rural European men, with the same risk-factor levels as American men, ac\u00ac tually experienced, in the early 1960s, half the American CHD frequency. Could this be that they have been exposed to the affluence, life style and elevated risk-factor levels relatively less time (starting some time after World War II) than their middle-aged American counterparts? The same holds for the recent demonstration of differences in Framingham, Puerto Rico and Hawaii. Also very possibly, of course, as both Minnesota and Framingham groups point out, there are major factors which promote CHD that are still unidentified and call for continued re\u00ac searches on pathogenesis.32,43 One of the more helpful concepts forwarded by the discussions of this volume is that of Kannel, who develops the theme that there may be different sets of CHD risk elements for different factors in coronary events. What factors contribute to atherogenesis? What factors precipitate clinical events in those predisposed? What factors affect survival once stricken with a coronary event? This concept indicates the important new con\u00ac tributions possible from prospective popula\u00ac tion studies of the natural history of coronary disease. It serves to resolve some of the cir\u00ac cular reasoning and controversies now so rife in the field. For example, the possible roles of personality, behavior and life-event risk- factors are clearly relevant only in populations highly susceptible because of their physical and habit characteristics, blood pressure, diet, and a common base of coronary artery atheromata. Behavior and stress are, we have seen, totally inadequate explanations as primary or necessary causes of CHD. In turn, physical activity, poorly correlated with other coronary risk factors and atherosclerosis, may serve somehow to protect against lethality of the ischemic event, etc. These concepts, of necessary and contributory causes, of underlying and precipitating causes, should allow us to put the picture of CHD risk together eventually and to ap\u00ac proach more intelligently the primary pre\u00ac vention of CHD. Similarly, for secondary prevention among infarct survivors, a differ\u00ac ent set of risk elements apply, some of which may be modifiable. ATHEROSCLEROSIS, A PEDIATRIC PROBLEM? One of the most vigorous current debates in the progress of cardiology is whether and how preventive efforts in coronary disease are appropriate in childhood. The arguments are the quintessence of the academic-prag\u00ac matic attitudes. You are encouraged to read the \"official\" statements which epitomize the conflict of approaches\u2014one, the academic view, contained in a report by a committee of pediatric cardiologists63 and in a symposium of many of the same physicians,54 another a broader preventive conception by the Fram\u00ac ingham group,35 and finally the pragmatic social approach to CHD of the Intersociety Commission.64 Choose for yourself the ap\u00ac proach most likely to reduce significantly, and safely, the CHD incidence in this country. The first report recommends no basic change in the American way of eating for children.53 Rather, the issue is left to the chance detection, in the course of conventional practice, of distinctive lipid \"abnormalities\" among children, only over age 5, having bad family histories, followed by the measurement of their serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and phenotyping for those above 230 mg/ml cholesterol and 140 mg/ml triglycerides. Then follows the careful exclusion of causes 32 Progress in Cardiology for secondary hyperlipidemia, then frequent lipid determinations before and after type- specific diets, and, if need be, a recommenda\u00ac tion on long-term drug therapy. The view is that . some children are at excess risk and they should receive preventive therapy in childhood.\" This approach may be aca\u00ac demically sound. For the preventive cardi\u00ac ologist it is clearly haphazard, inefficient and bound to be ineffective in the public health. It ignores the vast evidence of population studies, and the overriding public health question of widespread atherosclerotic dis\u00ac eases in the United States. The conceptual inadequacy and contradic\u00ac tions in this approach are also illustrated in the report of other committees, including the American Heart Association Task Force on Heart Disease in the Pediatric Age Group:62 \"The Task Force does not recommend diet changes for the entire population, particularly for the entire pediatric population, because the data available at this time do not support the wisdom of such a recommendation. However, in families in which one adult member has a low fat, low cholesterol diet prescribed, the other family members, always excluding infants, can be encouraged to follow the same diet. The family should understand that this recommendation can be made because deleterious effects of such a diet have yet to be demonstrated and the proba\u00ac bility that the patient will continue to follow the prescribed diet is greatly increased by having the whole family eat from the same table.\" And finally, the same paradox is found in the report of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition9 (see paragraph 2, page 206 of the report): \"Until the results of such trials (type II hyperlipidemia) are available, the Committee does not support the Intersociety Commission's recommendations for dietary intervention for all children\" and (in paragraph 7, page 306) \"Families with no evidence of type II hyper\u00ac lipoproteinemia who request guidance (my italics) about diets to reduce coronary heart disease can be advised that no harm is known to occur from moderate dietary alteration, and conceivably, that some benefits may accrue.\u2014For these chil\u00ac dren, the diet proposed by the Intersociety Com\u00ac mission for Heart Disease Resources would be appropriate: adjust caloric intake to maintain optimal weight and reduce dietary cholesterol (for children) to 150 mg/day; less than 35% of the calories should come from fats, which essen\u00ac tially should be divided equally among satu\u00ac rated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated sources.\" The logic of the official pediatric view is apparently that the prudent diet is fine for kids and others having bad family histories, diabetes, type II high cholesterol (and per\u00ac haps for the children of Japan, Italy, Greece, and Yugoslavia), but not for most American kids who should, rather, be encouraged to continue to eat their way through the meat- and-dairy-fat rock-candy mountain. Unless of course, their parents should happen to ask for guidance about diet, in which case they should be given good advice! * The somewhat more prevention-oriented approach from Kannel and Dawber36 states that atherosclerosis, \"although uncommonly observed before age 40, has its onset in infancy and childhood.\" Their preventive approach for the pediatrician calls for: (1) prevention of obesity, (2) the early deter\u00ac mination of any lipid abnormalities and their correction by diet or other procedures if necessary, (3) careful surveillance for early evidence of hypertension and the institution of corrective measures, (4) the promotion of high-energy-output physical activity, and (5) discouragement of the cigarette smoking habit. The third, pragmatically oriented and * I am reminded of the story of the farmer who stuck his foot with a pitchfork, pitching cowpies, and reported to his doctor a little late with a festering deep wound: \"What shall I do, doc?\" he asks. \"Wash it well and put on a mustard poultice to\u00ac night, Jeb, and come back to see me if it don't go down!\" he says. Two days later, the foot no better, Jeb returns hurtin' pretty bad, and feverish, and gets the advice to soak the foot in Epsom salts and come back\u2014if need be. Two days later he drags in, ailin' somethin' awful, and says in a strained and muffled voice, through clenched teeth, \"Say doc, you don't think I'd be getting lockjaw, do ya?\" \"Good God man,\" says the doctor, \"why didn'tcha think of that sooner?!\" Epidemiology and Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease 33 social approach of the Intersociety Report,64 takes the view that: 1. CHD is largely socioculturally determined. 2. The prudent diet recommended (about 30 per cent fat; in a ratio about j saturated, j mono, and f polyunsaturated fatty acids) has been widely \"tested\" by the millions who habitually use it in other cultures, and that \"with these dietary principles, requirements for optimal nutrition can be met for all of the population, including infants, children, ado\u00ac lescents, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons.\" (The Report then proceeds to outline the individual and social approaches to attaining a more prudent American way of eating.) 3. High social priority should be given to the elimination of cigarette smoking as a na\u00ac tional habit. (The Report then proceeds to suggestions for attaining this goal on a na\u00ac tional scale.) 4. There should be a national effort to detect and control hypertension. (Again the Report gives specific recommendations for detection and management by means which are not de\u00ac pendent, as at present, on chance, which largely determines the encounters of a high- risk child or adult with a physician.) Clearly the physician must find his own compromises between the academic and the pragmatic views! THE FUTURE The thrust will surely continue toward quantitative rather than qualitative assess\u00ac ment of CHD risk and a preventive approach to its management. This development in\u00ac volves the practitioner directly and in\u00ac directly. He will have more precise and use\u00ac ful tools for evaluation of his patient's coronary risk. He will no longer regard the multiple mild and moderate risk factors and bad habits as trivialities, but as powerful combined elements of risk requiring effective action. For action he will have more posi\u00ac tive and rational programs to offer his patient at each stage to reduce the risk of complica\u00ac tions before the disease develops clinically, and during latent, mild, and overtly manifest stages. I believe it is part of the practitioner's responsibility to support the well-designed preventive efforts, such as the NHL I hyper\u00ac tensive and multiple risk-factor trials under way. These programs should produce the definitive evidence about prevention and provide techniques which he can apply in his practice. Physician support will have to include the encouragement of an occasional patient who is invited to join those NHLI- sponsored community studies and preventive trials, including those using hygienic, phar\u00ac macological and rarely perhaps surgical ap\u00ac proaches to reduce elevated major risk factors. This should be a small sacrifice for the com\u00ac mon good of knowledge and success in reduc\u00ac ing the coronary epidemic. Finally, we must recall with humility the figures on life expectancy among adult men in this country and the inability of even the most enlightened and technologically compe\u00ac tent medical profession to reduce significantly the nationwide ravages of coronary disease by therapy after the event. Prevention is still the word; it should now be given its balanced share of effort which, I hope we can now agree, involves more than just lip service. REFERENCES 1.

Carbohydrate-induced hyperlipidemia: The question of \"carbohydrate- induced hyperlipidemia\" is still a terribly confused subject. There are many valid reports about the short term elevation of serum triglycerides vdtich occur on shifting to low fat diets, and other reports about patients specially \"sensitive\" to the lipid raising effects of alcohol. However, two facts of a different import should be kept in mind: 1) Well-designed diet experiments have shown that the Prudent Diet (low fat, low saturated fat, high carbohydrate) plus weight reduction where indi\u00ac cated will result in lowering of serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides in the vast majority of the garden-variety hyperlipidemias encountered in practice (8 ) 2) The loosely used term, \"low carbohydrate diet\" really means a ,rhigh fat\" diet because protein intake is not so variable. Such a diet is rarely indicated or required for lipid lowering. Actually in countries where the serum lipid levels are generally very low (and where, incidentally, CHD is uncommon) high carbohydrate (low-fat) diets have been habitually consumed for centuries. This does not /&ubQrr/ the idea that restriction in simple sugars and alcohol calories is on-the-whole desirable in the U.S. population. Moreover, serum lipid levels will rise due to weight gain irrespective of the composition of the diet. But the \"carbohydrate sensitivity\" idea, similarly to the \"specific lipid phenotype\" idea, has inadvertently served to obscure what I believe to be the central issue: the mass U.S. population hyperlipidemia \u2014 related primarily to habitual overeating of saturated fat -16- and total calories. \"Low Carbohydrate\" and High Protein\": Needless to say, the \"Stillman- Atkins\" type \"low-carbohydrate\" (very high fat), ketosis-inducing, weight reduction schemes are totally wrong in regard to their undocumented claims that fat \"calories don't count\". When they are effective in weight reduc\u00ac tion it is due to their suppression of appetite. They are highly suspect in regard to their undocumented claims that such regimens lower serum lipid values though this may happen temporarily during the active period of negative calorie balance. They are totally incongruous with any reasonable healthful longterm eating pattern. Their dangers have been roundly and soundly declared ( i ). Similarly misleading are the \"Drinking Mayo Diet\", the \"Recommended High Protein Diets\". Most of the calories in the commonly regarded \"high protein\" foods of such diets (steak and eggs) are fat calories rather than protein! Every doctor's office (and home) would do well to keep, perhaps next to the Physician's Desk Reference, a copy of the USDA Handbook #8 on the composition, in protein,fat and carbohydrate calories, of all common foods (See Appendix). Dietary cholesterol: This remains a raging question (12,15). The relative importance of dietary cholesterol versus dietary fats, in the range of each encountered in the American Way of Eating, may best be characterized by the formula of the Minnesota group which is based on numerous experiments in man in_ calorie balance (5,12,13) : A Choi. =1.35 (2AS-AP) + 1.5AZ where AC = change in serum cholesterol, AS = change in saturated fat calories, AP = change in polyunsaturated fat calories and AZ = the square root of change -17- in dietary cholesterol intake. Translated, this means that saturated fats raise serum cholesterol (monosaturated fats are neutral) and polyunsaturated fats lower serum cholesterol. It means that the saturated fats are twice as powerful and efficient in cholesterol-raising as are the \"polys\" in cholesterol\u00ac lowering. Diet cholesterol within the usual range of U.S. intake raises serum cholesterol by a function of the square root of the amount of cholesterol added. The effect of eating cholesterol itself is strongest at the low end of the range of cholesterol consumption (15). In our heavily meat and dairy- consuming culture, diet cholesterol effect on serum cholesterol is important but is largely overwhelmed by the saturated fat influence. Nevertheless, the Minnesota \"2S-P\" formula shows simply and clearly that the most efficient way of reducing serum lipid levels among men in calorie balance is to a) reduce the total consumption of saturated fats, b) reduce dietary cholesterol, and c) to add polyunsaturated fats. In actual practice, and in \"natural\" diets around the world, a) and b) generally go together automatically and c) is not necessary for a significant cholesterol lowering effect in those having the usual high fat American Way of Eating. Polyunsaturated fats: The Minnesota group considers that the significant addition of polyunsaturated fats to the U.S. diet, that is, the major replace\u00ac ment of saturated fat calories by polyunsaturated, is neither necessary nor desirable, despite the fact that a somewhat greater serum cholesterol-lowering effect might be anticipated therefrom in U.S. people. Why? Fig. 3 shows that 1) the primary difference in fat composition of natural diets in working populations lies in the proportion of saturated fat calories; this in turn is strongly correlated with serum cholesterol -18- levels and CHD incidence in these entire populations; 2) there is little difference between these cultures in the proportion or in the total amount of polyunsaturated fat calories consumed. There is no correlation of \"poly\" intake with serum cholesterol levels or with CHD incidence in these general populations; 3) no natural diet studied contains over 8-10% of calories as polyunsaturated fat (14). The conclusion of the Minnesota Group, which we are happy to suggest to all, is that reduced saturated fat consumption is the \"natural experiment\" which has been thoroughly demonstrated by centuries of use to be safe, effective and salubrious. Consequently, there appears to be no indication now to greatly increase the polyunsaturated fat consumption of the American Way of Eating. However, partial replacement is reasonable of the common saturated fats by polyunsaturated, for purposes of palatability and where fat is appropriate to food preparation, along the lines of the American Heart Association Prudent Diet (30-35% fat calories, made up 1/3 each of saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids). -19- From the National Office Published by the American Heart Association, 44 East 23rd Street, New York, N.Y. 10010 Vol. 1, No. 26 August 7, 1974 ORIENTATION COURSES Because of the unusually heavy planning load and preparations needed for the move to Dallas by the National Office, it has be\u00ac come necessary to cancel the Orientation Course for Professional Staff of Heart Associations which was scheduled for Sept. 9-13, 1974, in New York. The next Orientation Course will be held from Dec. 2-6, 1974, in New York. The Western Affiliate Services Office has scheduled a pre-Orientation Course for new staff from the Southwest and Northwest-Rocky Mountain Regions. It will be held in San Mateo, Calif., Sept. 15-20, 1974.

Public Relations 'READER'S DIGEST' STORY \"The to Recog- 25 LIVES nize and Survive - a Heart Attack,\" which appeared in the November, 1973, issue, has been credited with saving at least 25 lives. \"The Reader's Digest\" reported in its July, 1974, issue that \"at this writing 25 individuals have written us, each one giving the article direct credit for saving either his own life or that of a relative or friend. \" One letter was from a 38-year old man in British Columbia who had read the article just a few days before his heart attack. \"Half an hour after my attack started, I suddenly realized that the pain I was experiencing in my chest, arms and neck was exactly what those pictures in \"The Reader's Digest\" had so graphically portrayed,\" he said. \"Had I not read the article I would have assumed that my heart attack was merely the aches and pains of indigestion \u2014 and I might well have become just another write-up in the obituary column.\" Page 3 THE PUBLIC BEAT (News of Public Policy and Government Affairs of Interest to AHA) by Dolph Chianchiano EGGS AND HEART DISEASE On August 1, 1974, the Federal Trade Commis\u00ac sion issued a formal complaint based on the advertisements of the National Commission on Egg Nutrition, as requested in the Heart Association petition of Dec. 19, 1973. Also on August 1, the Commis\u00ac sion filed papers in the U. S. District Court in Chicago to seek an injunction against future dissemination of NCEN's ads. PROGRAM EVALUATION The confluence of scientific management principles and the explosion of government , support for social service activities has resulted in a major emphasis on pro- ^ gram evaluation. Many federal agencies now require that an evaluation system ^ be built into the design of any projects funded by them . In addition, evaluation of this type is often stated as the basis for deciding whether to renew or supple\u00ac ment financial assistance. A good example of program evaluation can be found in the Evaluation Standards published for federally-supported Rehabilitation programs in the July 2, 1974, issue of the \"Federal Register^!!\u2014Under \"Methodology\" these Standards list four separate issues which must be addressed: 1- the degree to which the entire target population is reached and affected; 2- the degree of change experienced toward the goal of gainful activities which occurs as a result of reha\u00ac bilitation services; 3- performance of the program in meeting the priority for providing services to the severely handicapped; and 4- the efficiency with which a program utilizes avail\u00ac able resources to accomplish its ultimate function. Nine general standards for evaluation are also set forth. Copies of this publication are available on request. Page 4 ANTIVIVISECTIONISTS Senator Robert Dole (R., Kansas) had AGAIN? introduced a bill to prohibit the use of dogs in research and experiments conducted by departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States when such use is likely to result in \"needless or excessive suffering\" by such dogs. The bill number is S. 3559. HEART ACT OF 1975 There is debate about the terms under which the Heart Act will be renewed. (The Heart Act of 1972 expires on June 30, 1975.) On fiscal questions, the National Heart and Lung Institute has indicated that it will need $520 million for fiscal year 1976 to carry out the program already assigned to it. Furthermore, it states that by 1980 the Institute will need $680 million to fulfill its mission. The Public Policy and Government Affairs Working Group will meet on Sept. 12, 1974, to discuss the renewal of the Heart Act. PRESIDENT'S BIOMEDICAL A Senate amendment to the renewal of the RESEARCH PANEL Cancer Act called for a permanent Presidential Panel to oversee the entire federal biomedical research effort. (For our position on this proposal see the March 13, 1974 \"Weekly Report\" .) As signed by the President, the new Cancer Act provides for only an 18-month Panel which would have an advisory rather than \"whistle blowing\" responsibility. It is clear, however, that the Panel's jurisdiction includes all health-related investigation, not only cancer research. 21366 RULES AND REGULATIONS ^J0r tjour information award, the grantee may copyright with\u00ac out prior approval any publications, films, or similar materials developed or resulting from a project supported by a grant under this part, subject, however, to a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and ir\u00ac revocable license or right in the Govern\u00ac ment to reproduce, translate, publish, use, disseminate, and dispose of such materials and to authorize others to do so. ij 55*1.16 Crunlcc nocouiitabilily.

L. 93-112). Section 401(b) of the Act states, in part, that \"effective July 1, 1974, before funds for the programs and projects covered by this Act are released, the Secretary shall develop and publish general standards for evaluation of the program and project effectiveness in achieving the objectives of this Act\". Further, it declares that the Secretary \"shall consider the extent to which such standards have been met in deciding * whether to renew or supplement financial assistance authorized under any section of this Act.\" The standards set forth in this interim regulation will be used in evaluating programs and proj\u00ac ects assisted under the Act. This regulation shall become effective July 1, 1974, because immediate imple\u00ac mentation of the standards is required by the Act. Amendment or revision will bo made if, after due consideration of comments, suggestions, or .objectives to the interim regulations, received in writ\u00ac ing by the Administrator, Social and Re\u00ac habilitation Service, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, P.O. Box 2382, Washington, D.C. 20013, with\u00ac in 30 days of the date of such publica\u00ac tion, it is determined sucli amendment or revision is required. Comments re\u00ac ceived will be available for public inspec\u00ac tion in Room 5324 of the Department's offices at 330 C Street SW., Washington, D.C. on Monday through Friday of each week from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Area Code 202/245-0950). Chapter II of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended by add\u00ac ing a new Part 410 to read as follows: See. 410.1 Purpose of standards. 410.2 Definitions. 410.3 Methodology. 410.4 Objectives of the rehabilitation pro\u00ac gram. 410.5 General standards for evaluation. Authority: Stal. 300 t29 U.S.C. 780(b)). \u00a7 410.1 Purpose of standards. (a) The general standards represent those measures of program performance which, in the aggregate, are adoqatc to estimate program impact and to il\u00ac lustrate the effectiveness of certain pro\u00ac gram elements. Federal personnel will assess State evaluations and work witit State agencies and others to improve the standards and the methods by which these standards are applied. It is hoped that the structure of these Standards will be specific enough to give guidance as to desired performance levels, but broad enough to allow individual States to augment this document by adding greater dimensions from their own evaluation experience not addressed by this document. (b) The purposes of these standards are: (1) To establish criteria for the evaluation of program effectiveness, i.e.. the degree to which the rehabilitation system is accomplishing its stated objectives; (2) To increase program account\u00ac ability by focusing on those demon\u00ac strated processes generally agreed to in\u00ac crease program effectiveness; (3) To encourage States to begin n more comprehensive evaluation of their programs to determine if the program goals are being achieved within resource capabilities and if not, the reasons therefor. (c) Data collected from the general standards will be used to make relative comparisons of programs and projects which will be considered by the Secre\u00ac tary in deciding whether to renew or supplement financial assistance pursu\u00ac ant to section 401(b) of the Rehabilita\u00ac tion Act of 1973. Information obtained 4 FEDERAL REGISTER, VOL. 39, NO. 128\u2014TUESDAY, JULY 2, 1974 from the 1975 data, as well as that data already in existence, will be used to help formulate minimal performance levels of programs and projects. The Department will work with Congress and others to develop regulations embodying specific performance levels to be published by the end of fiscal year 1975. \u00a7410.2 Definitions. (a) Program. A program means any continuing activity which is funded by the Rehabilitation Services Administra\u00ac tion (RSA). (b) Project. A project means a dis\u00ac crete activity with a finite termination date. (c) Statistical Reporting System Caseload Statuses (as defined in the Na\u00ac tional Center for Social Statistics Statis\u00ac tical Manual RSA) (1) Status OO. Referral. This status represents entrance into the vocational rehabilitation process. A referral is de\u00ac fined as any individual who has applied to or been referred to the vocational re\u00ac habilitation agency by letter, by tele\u00ac phone, by direct contact, or by any other means; and for whom the following minimum information has been fur\u00ac nished: name and address, disability, age and sex, date of referral, and source of referral; (2) Status 02. Applicant. As soon as the referred individual (Status 00) signs a document requesting vocational rehabil\u00ac itation services, he is placed into Status 02 and is designated as an applicant. Generally, the document will be an agency application form, but a letter signed by an individual who provides the minimum basic referral information and requests service should also be considered as a basis for placing the individual in Status 02. This is important, since the applicant must be notified in writing if his request for Vocational Rehabilitation services has been denied, and the only certain. basis for determining that the individual has knowledge of having been referred is by the existence of a docu\u00ac ment signed by the individual; (3) Status 08. Closed From Referral, Applicant, or Extended Evaluation Sta\u00ac tuses. This status has been provided to furnish a means for identifying all per\u00ac sons not accepted for vocational rehabil\u00ac itation services, whether closed from re\u00ac ferral status (00), applicant status (02), or extended evaluation (06). All persons processed through referral, applicant, and/or extended evaluation, and not ac\u00ac cepted into the active caseload for voca\u00ac tional rehabilitation services, will be closed in this status. A Certificate of in\u00ac eligibility is required for a closure in Status 08, except w'hen the client be\u00ac comes unavailable for services. A copy of the Form SRS-RSA-300, properly com\u00ac pleted, dated, and signed, is sufficient certification of ineligibility for these cases, provided case documentation In\u00ac cludes specific detailed reasons for the closure action; (4) Status 10. Individualized Written Rehabilitation Program Development. While a client is in this status, the case RULES AND REGULATIONS study and diagnosis is completed to pro\u00ac vide a basis for the formulation of the. individualized written rehabilitation pro\u00ac gram. A comprehensive case study is basic to determining the nature and scope of services to be provided in order to ac\u00ac complish the vocational rehabilitation objective of the individual. The counselor and client formulate and plan the re\u00ac habilitation services necessary to the solution of the client's problem, and those services are clearly outlined to him. The individual remains in this Sta\u00ac tus until his rehabilitation program is written and approved; (5) Status 26. Closed Rehabilitated. Cases closed as rehabilitated must as a minimum have been declared eligible, have received appropriate diagnostic and related services, have had a program for vocational rehabilitation services formu\u00ac lated, have completed the program inso\u00ac far as possible, have been provided coun\u00ac seling as an essential rehabilitation serv\u00ac ice, and have been determined to be suitably employed for a minimum of 30 days; (6) Status 28. Closed Other Reasons After Individualized Written Rehabilita\u00ac tion Program Initiated. Cases closed in this category must have been declared eligible, have received appropriate diag\u00ac nostic and related services and have had a program for vocational rehabilitation services formulated, but have not com\u00ac pleted the program and/or hart; not been provided counseling, and/or have not been determined to be suitably em\u00ac ployed for a minimum of 30 days; (7) Status 30. Closed Other Reasons Before Individualized Written Rehabili\u00ac tation Program Initiated. Cases closed in this category are those cases which, al\u00ac though accepted for rehabilitation serv\u00ac ices, did not progress to the point that rehabilitation services were actually in\u00ac itiated under a rehabilitation plan. \u00a7410.3 Methodology. (a) Implementation of the General Standards is both a State and Federal responsibility; (b) When evaluating the performance of a program, four separate issues must be addressed: the degree to which. the,, entire target population is reached ancl TfiTectcdr the- degree' as a result of rehabill-~ tation\u2014services//performance of the progrant in meeting the priority for pro- vidlng^services-to~the severly handi\u00ac capped; and the efficiency with which a program utilizes available resources to/ accomplish its ultimate function. An\u00ac nually, each'StaTe will be asked to re\u00ac port on a self-evaluation of the specific data items described under each general standard (based on most recent infor\u00ac mation) as well as any other evaluation effort the State may have undertaken in these areas. Some of the specific data items may not be readily available to States: follow-up information, detailed reasons for not accepting clients or for unsuccessful closures as well as accept- tance rates, etc. It is not required that 2 r.r.7 such information be collected on all clients. Rather, statistically significant sampling studies are periodically re\u00ac quired. Periodicity will be specified in guidelines. Projects are to be judged by the extent to which the normal program performance, as measured by the evalua\u00ac tions standards, would be improved as a result of the project. Projects are to be evaluated by the following criteria: (1) specificity of goals (before project is approved), (2) the extent to which they benefit the program, and (3) feasibility of transferring knowledge acquired from project to thp program. \u00a7410.4 Objectives of the rehabilitation program. The principal objectives of the Re\u00ac habilitation Act of 1073 are: (a) To maintain and improve State- Federal programs of quality vocational rehabilitation services and to redirect the public rehabilitation program to\u00ac wards the expansion of services to the severly handicapped; (b) To provide the opportunity t..r active participation by the client in the development of client's individualized written rehabilitation program; (c) To provide special attention to target groups whose rehabilitation prob\u00ac lems are known to be riifTic:'.:: (d) To promote the elh.uu'djon :.f barriers in the environment wlnoh im\u00ac pede the handicapped in employment, housing, and transportation: <e) To utilize to the fullest possible extent community, State, Federal re\u00ac sources in the rehabilitation of the client and the extent to which those funds are marshalled to increase and Improve: (1) The supply of trained rehabilita\u00ac tion manpower: (2) Rehabilitation knowledge and techniques; (3) Rehabilitation facilities; (f) To promote and expand employ\u00ac ment opportunities in the public and private sectors for handicapped individ\u00ac uals and to place such individuals in gainful activities: (g) To provide education to the gen\u00ac eral public and handicapped population about the rehabilitation of the handi\u00ac capped and to disseminate information pertaining to rehabilitation; (h) To develop a process of evaluation .as to the effectiveness of present pro\u00ac gramming on different disability groups. \u00a7 410.5 General standards for oval na\u00ac tion.

The American Egg Board, promotional arm of the in\u00ac dustry and funded by eg\" producers and allied busi\u00ac nesses, is about to hatch its first big-city advertising cam\u00ac paign. Its theme is \"The Incredible Edible Egg.\" The program gets under way on Sept. 2 in the Chicago area, where the egg board has its headquarters. During , the last four months of the year, television and radio spots coupled with newspa- ~~j per advertisements will pro\u00ac claim the virtues of eggs. . Breaking at about the same time as the new ads is a re\u00ac newed controversy over egg ads that ran between No\" vember, 1973, and last June. Those ads, which gave the egg producers' side of the continuing cholesterol dis\u00ac pute, were criticized by the Federal Trade Commission last week. And they will be the subject of a Federal Dis\u00ac trict Court proceeding in Chicago at the end of this . month. I Tiie cholesterol ads, how- I ever, were run by the Na\u00ac tional Commission on Egg Nutrition, a separate organi\u00ac zation even though most of its revenues come from the American Egg Board. There\u00ac fore tlie board is taking pains to differentiate-itself through its own advertising approach. * ffl This approach, developed by Campbell-Mithun, Inc., highlights the occasions when eggs can be considered a suitable food for the table. \"The basic idea is to pre\u00ac sent eggs in the many ways they can be used in the home, whether for meals, Selling Paper Products Without Any Squeezing When Colin C. MacLennan, advertising and sales promo\u00ac tion manager of the Georgia Pacific Corporation's con\u00ac sumer products division, be\u00ac gan planning a new television ad campaign for its house- hold paper products, he de\u00ac cided there would bo no shots of women squeezing the mer\u00ac chandise. There's been too much of that, he thought. Thus the spots for Coronet bath tissues, facial tissues, kitchen towels and napkins that will run on the three networks and in 32 markets beginning this month haven't a squeezer among them. In\u00ac stead they have such situa\u00ac tions as two 8-year-old girls , pretending to be their own ! mothers, four babies speaking with the dubbed-in voices of adults and a champion weight- lifter struggling to lift twice his weight in water. Venet Advertising, Inc., is the agency. but it has not been accented yet. The aim of the new ads is obviously to reverse the de\u00ac cline in per capita egg con\u00ac sumption, which had fallen to 292 last year from 389 in 1950. Mr. Kathe is predicting that egg consumption will be slightly more than 300 per capita this year. \"Egg dishes aire particular\u00ac ly appealing to the consumer, considering the present high- cost-of-living level,\" he noted.

Similarly the one-minute radio commercials Will have jingles in > which . characters sing about the benefits of eating eggs at dif\u00ac ferent times of the day. The newspaper ads are scheduled to run prior to the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. They will promote eggs not as a substitute for 1 turkeys and cranberry sauce but as a complementary item. : \"Our research shows us ; that housewives feel at a loss : when they don't have eggs,\" .' Mr. Kathe said. \"So we're j going to keep reminding them to keep enough on hand.\" The egg board (which was known as the Poultry and Egg National Board until May, 1973) has an annual ..ad budget, of about $750,000. t.To.stretch those dollars, the'- board is offering to provide all of the creative work and : split the cost of. space and I time with regional egg-pro- ; ducing^groups. Egg producers in the Mid\u00ac west were the first to accept the board's offer, which ac\u00ac counts for the forthcoming push in Chicago.
