Reviews I just finished reading Toxic Jesus tonight. Wow. So much of what the author describes feeling and going through I feel like I've been working through myself the past few years, especially recognizing these oppressive Jesuses that were easy to cling to because they were what was familiar. To Marc-Henri: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences; I am thankful for your vulnerability and honesty. His writing and journey is inspiring and I wish I'd had this book (and many other resources) when I was growing up. - Charles Like other reviewers, I had preconceived notions about where this book would lead. In fact, I had hopes of how it would culminate. But I have to admit to being surprised by the undulating story of struggle and spirituality that Toxic Jesus offered. I liked, and I bet subsequent readers will like as well, the framing of incarnations of Jesus in the author's mind and journey. There was a necessary and gripping process that he needed to experience to find what god really is to him. This is a great, unique and moving book to read. - Eric I must say that the book wasn't exactly what I was expecting, as the title initially led me to believe that the author may have abandoned his spirituality. Instead we are led on a journey to a renewed and revised spirituality and connection with the divine. I applaud the author for taking us on an intensely personal walk through time with him as he develops new and meaningful connections with himself and the world around him. - David I found the title of this book to be quite provocative, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I half expected an anti Christian tirade, but this book is far from that. Marc-Henri has written a very personal and painful account of the influence of toxic spirituality on his life and how he started questioning very deeply held beliefs to find inner peace. It is a sincere attempt at smashing through religious dogma to find the essence of what it means to be a Christian with a free and curious mind. It is both courageous and very moving and I highly recommend it. - Ian About the Author Marc-Henri Sandoz Paradella, therapist and spiritual mentor, writer, theologist, sociologist, and former pastor who freed himself from "}
