It was discovered in 1976, but it remained largely unknown until 1995, when it reemerged in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The hemorrhagic fevers caused by this virus are associated with a high and rapid mortality (up to 88% of infected individuals). Dr. Gary Nabel[ [1](javascript:void(0);)] of the Vaccine Research Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in Bethesda, Maryland, reported on the development of a preventive vaccine against Ebola, based on adenoviral vectors. In the Ebola virus, envelope glycoproteins (GP) mediate entry into the target cells by facilitating membrane fusion.[ [2](javascript:void(0);)] The cytopathic effect of Ebola GP has been mapped, using deletion mutants, to the mucin-like domain, which mediates detachment of cells grown in monolayers and subsequent cell death. It has also been observed that deletion of the transmembrane domain of these GPs abolishes cellular toxicity. Mucin-domain deletion-mutants of Ebola GP are not good candidates for the development of a vaccine, because the mucin domain contains important antigenic sites, while TM deletion mutants seem to be a better choice. The toxicity of these viral GPs plays a significant role in the human disease as full-length GPs induce toxic effects in vivo by affecting blood vessels. Deletion mutants either in the mucin domain or in the TM domain lose the ability to mediate these toxic effects. The damage seems to be induced by loss of adhesion of endothelial cells to the underlying basal membrane, related to a reduction in alpha v-integrin expression. Ebola toxicity starts with infection and subsequent spreading to the reticuloendothelial system.[ [2](javascript:void(0);)] Infected monocytes release a \"cytokine storm\" in the liver, where further liver damage occurs. The spread of the virus continues through the endothelium, where it causes vascular instability and shock. The challenges in trying to control Ebola reside in the fact that: (1) the reservoir of infection is unknown; (2) there is no effective treatment after infection occurs; and (3) no vaccine is available yet. In addition, no evidence of protective immunity has been seen during the natural infection. Passive transfer of antibodies failed to induce protection, and no neutralization by antibodies has been observed in viral replication assays in vitro. A promising strategy toward development of an Ebola vaccine has been reported recently.[ [3](javascript:void(0);)] It is based on DNA vaccination with a plasmid-encoding Zaire-subtype virion glycoprotein (GP(Z)) followed by boosting with an adenoviral vector expressing the same protein (Ad-GP(Z)). The naked DNA plasmid was give to cynomolgus macaques 3 times, at week 0, 4, and 8, followed by the Ad GP(Z) boost at week 20 and a final challenge with the virus at week 32. Antigen-specific antibody responses were detected at week 12, and boosting increased the antibody titer by 10- to 20-fold. Only vaccinated monkeys did not display increase in hepatic enzymes or sign of liver damage after challenge with a lethal dose of the virus. No increase in viral load was observed in vaccinated animals, contrary to what was seen in control animals, and all the vaccinated animals survived the infection. Despite this success, the length of the vaccination regimen makes it unpractical in case of an acute outbreak. Thus, efforts have been made to develop an accelerated vaccination approach.[ [4](javascript:void(0);)] On the basis of the observation that the adenoviral boost induced a rapid increase in antibody titer, the initial vaccination with naked plasmid DNA was omitted, and at week 0 only, Ad-GP(Z) was administered. In 1 experimental protocol, a second administration of Ad-GP(Z) followed at week 9, and the animals were challenged with Ebola at week 10. In a shorter protocol, only 1 vaccination at week 0 was followed 4 weeks later by challenge with the virus. Protection from lethal challenge was achieved with both protocols, and the development of a strong T cell-mediated immune response (both CD4- and CD8-dependent) was observed. Antibody titers reached with the 2 shorter protocols remained, however, lower than with the longer, naked DNA-based approach. It seems, then, conceivable to apply the different strategies to different settings: the complete vaccination protocol (plasmid + Ad-GP(Z)) would be more effective for preventive vaccination (eg, of hospital workers) as is more potent immunologically, while single adenoviral vaccine administration could be useful in case of an acute outbreak, when a quick development of an immune response is desired. In view of the success of this approach, Dr. Nabel noted that the same strategy could be followed for the development of a vaccine against the SARS virus.[ [1](javascript:void(0);)] \u00a9 2003 Medscape Cite this: Conference Report - I.
