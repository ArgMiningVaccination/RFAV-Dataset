I'm copy-pasting everything here and providing the original links at the bottom, as well as a link to a PDF for your own personal use. This list was compiled by Liz Ditz over at the blog I Speak of Dreams. Ginger Baker, who, from what I've heard, is paid to be an anti-vaccine activist (not suspicious at all), had released a [Facebook note](https://www.facebook.com/notes/ginger-taylor/76-research-papers-showing-that-vaccines-can-cause-autism/10151550806568920) back in July that cited 81 (originally 76) studies that supposedly support a link between autism and vaccines. Ever since, science- and autism-bloggers have ripped into the list and have managed to debunk the first 72 studies on the list (as for the remaining nine, I'm not sure what the status is). They have a done a far better job than I could hope to have done myself. I originally said in my only [other vaccine-themed post](https://angryautie.wordpress.com/2013/08/29/because-avoiding-autism-is-totally-worth-risking-your-health-an-unintended-lesson-in-vaccines-and-irony-from-a-ridiculous-pastor/) that I never wrote about vaccines on this blog before and will never do it again. This guide, however, was far too good and thorough to pass up. I think that this would be a good point to just fucking end this conversation already.

Not (as you might expect) the aluminium exposure for the ASD cases themselves, according to the pediatric schedules of 6 to 21 years previously, but no, that same year. In effect they are looking for a correlation between the number of people who developed ASD decades earlier, and the number of vaccinations given to other children, in the current year. This is an interesting model of causality! 3.

Reduced levels of mercury in first baby haircuts of autistic children. Int J Toxicol. 2003 Jul-Aug;22(4):277-85. The fatally flawed baby-hair study. The first flaw in the study is the authors' acceptance of the idea of \"excretion into the hair\". It doesn't happen. Blood mercury does not equal hair mercury. The second flaw is the data collection methods (the hair used in the study). The third flaw is that the study found that the autistic children had lower hair mercury levels than the neurotypical controls. Rather than accepting that data, the authors went on to spin \"tooth fairy tales\" to explain why that might be so (the idea that autistic children had impaired mercury excretion). The fourth flaw in the study involves the hair analyzed: the samples had been in storage under unknown conditions for a median of five and a half years. Do I really need to go on why Holmes et al. is a broken reed? It was, when published, a footling study. But wait: One more thing you should know: Holmes et al. 2003 authors' affiliations are given as Safeminds.

Consider these questions: 1) Why aren't they reporting a high autism prevalence in the people who had very high mercury exposures and who showed signs of pink disease? If there is a genetic susceptibility, why isn't it seen in those with the greatest exposures? 2) Why isn't there a report of high autism prevalence in the children, just the grandchildren? My guess is that the response from some will be that the grandchildren received higher doses of mercury in vaccines than did their parents. Which again would beg the question of where is the high rate of autism in those exposed to the teething powders, especially those who developed pink disease. The conclusions of this paper have some major logical hurdles to overcome, to say the least. And this is even before the methods are addressed. For example, this all hinges on reports by the grandparents. Not on an actual prevalence measure of the descendants.\" Does this paper \"demonstrate that vaccines can cause autism\"? No. 57.

From what I've been able to tell, ASIA is basically a made-up syndrome that isn't generally accepted....Even more dubious are the clinical criteria, four major and four minor, that are used to \"diagnose\" ASIA. The idea is that either two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria are required for a diagnosis of ASIA. Out of curiosity, I went back to what appears to be the original article in which ASIA was defined by Yehuda Shoenfeld, who is known for testifying for \"vaccine injury\" victims and running a journal sympathetic to antivaccine views, even publishing works by quacks like Mark and David Geier. The \"syndrome\" appears to have been made up of whole cloth based on unfounded assumptions. Does this paper \"demonstrate that vaccines can cause autism\"? No. 69. [Thimerosal and autism?
