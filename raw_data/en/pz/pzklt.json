She is a senior student and teacher in the Para Yoga tradition and a Certified Ayurvedic Yoga Specialist through the Himalayan Institute, with additional trainings in Restorative Yoga and Trauma Informed Yoga. Yoga, Yoga Therapy and Ayurveda are ancient, rich sciences of self-exploration and self-development that incorporate a broad range of practices and techniques which can be tailored to suit any age, experience and individual needs. Anyone can \"do\" yoga and every body is a yoga body. Yoga can be an effective method to reduce stress and anxiety and unlock pain and tension. Yoga was originally taught one-on-one. Whether you are looking for therapeutic work, a customized home practice, a beginner wanting to learn the fundamentals or an experienced student looking to explore specific ares of interest. This more traditional approach provides the perfect setting to address individual needs. Private sessions can be virtual or in-person. Marilyn also creates programs and presentations for organizations, businesses and groups.
