In 1967, Dr. Starzl performed the first successful liver transplant and almost 40 years later, with new advances in medical technology and organ allocation, liver transplantation has now become a \"routine\" life-saving procedure. Encouraging Trends Perhaps the most marked progress in the United States over the past decade has been the sharp drop in the number of people chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) who need a liver transplant. As more effective anti-HBV drugs have become available, the number of individuals with HBV progressing to liver failure is significantly decreasing in the country. This good news is reflected in the numbers from the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS). Among the people waitlisted for a liver transplant, there has been a nearly 30% reduction since 2001 in those with end-stage liver disease related to HBV . And while the number of those waiting for a liver transplant due to HBV-related liver cancer is rising, the increase is not as great as with other causes of liver cancer (eg, hepatitis C and fatty liver disease) and is projected to decrease over the next few decades. This indicates HBV is being better managed with the current treatments and that liver cancer surveillance is identifying liver cancer earlier. Impact of HBV Drug Therapies These encouraging trends are largely thanks to the widespread use of oral antiviral therapy for HBV . \"Pre-transplant regimens with a single first-line drug, such as tenofovir or entecavir, are wiping out end-stage liver disease due to HBV , \" noted Dr. Robert Gish, the newly appointed medical director of the Hepatitis B Foundation. \"If the patient is treated appropriately, the virus is successfully suppressed and the liver disease does not progress\u2014 and reverses in many patients. This underscores the need for not only aggressive treatment but also long-term care and surveillance, \" he added.

Hepatitis B and Liver TransplantationFrom the Editor's Desk Hepatitis B in the Spotlight A lot is going on in the world of hepatitis B, and it's gratifying to see the growing momentum with new hepatitis B screening recommendations (see In the News below), exciting advances in research (see p. 5), and successful public health initiatives (see p. 5). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force announced its draft recommendations that approve hepatitis B screening of high-risk communities, which will significantly increase screening efforts and improve care to those affected. And Hep B United, the national coalition established by the Hepatitis B Foundation and AAPCHO, continues to energize hepatitis B coalitions across the country as they work to eliminate hepatitis B through community-based programs that increase awareness, screening, vaccination and linkage to care for high-risk populations. On the research front, with hepatitis C now curable, companies are re-focusing on hepatitis B (see In the News). The effectiveness of current HBV treatments has meant a sharp drop in the number of patients progressing to end-stage liver disease (see front page). The approved treatments, however, are only effective in about 50% of patients; thus, there is still a tremendous need to find a cure. Finding a cure takes on new urgency as the World Health Organization announced that liver cancer, which is due primarily to HBV , has moved up to being the 2 nd deadliest cancer in the world (see p. 8). In the U.S., liver cancer is the fastest growing cancer in incidence with a 5-year survival rate of less than 15% and is devastating to patients and their families (see p. 7). So while we celebrate the advances and progress being made, we must keep up the pressure to sustain the momentum. Hepatitis B is now back in the spotlight, and the Hepatitis B Foundation and its many partners intend to make sure it stays there until a cure is finally found.The Hepatitis B Foundation is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure and improving the quality of life for those affected by hepatitis B worldwide through research, education and patient advocacy.

Hepatitis B Screening Makes the Grade In March, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a \"B\" grade recommendation for HBV screening in persons at high risk, including Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. These communities make up 5% of the total U.S. population, but account for more than 50% of Americans living with chronic hepatitis B. The draft recommendation applies to asymptomatic, nonpregnant adolescents and adults who have not been vaccinated and other individuals at high risk for HBV infection. A \"B\" grade recommendation means screening may be covered by private and government insurance plans. And HBV screenings can be included in the list of preventive services of the Affordable Care Act. Read the complete recommendations at www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/ uspshepb.htmOnCore for Hepatitis B! Hepatitis C is now curable, thanks to newly developed antiviral agents. Chief among them is sofosbuvir, the drug named after its inventor, Mike Sofia, PhD. Sofosbuvir (approved to be sold as \"Sovaldi\") was developed by Dr. Sofia and his team only seven years ago. It is the first HCV treatment that does not require interferon injections and can be taken as a pill with other drugs. This is a revolutionary oral treatment with few side effects that promises a cure for hepatitis C in 12 weeks! Dr. Sofia, a faculty member of the HBF's Baruch S. Blumberg Institute, has started OnCore BioPharma to develop new hepatitis B therapies. The HBF wishes Dr. Sofia and his group success as they set their sights on an encore performance...this time, a cure for hepatitis B! 2 Hepatitis B Foundation | B Informed | Spring 2014 hepb.orgIN THE NEWS Thanks for your donations! The Hepatitis B Foundation thanks everyone who contributed to our 2013 Annual Fund Appeal. w e sincerely appreciate your support and donations to help us continue our valuable work in research, outreach, public health and patient advocacy.HEPATITIS B FOUNDATION 3805 Old (215) info@hepb.org Joan M. Block, Co-Founder and Executive DirectorPreventing Transplant Rejection The anti-HBV drug therapies are also preventing infection of the new graft after transplantation (often incorrectly termed \"recurrence\"). The chance of new graft infection (about 5%) in transplant recipients with HBV is low enough that success is now considered to be routine. HBV-infected patients have one of the highest post-liver transplant survival rates. Currently, the picture is not so upbeat for transplant candidates infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the leading cause of liver transplants in the U.S., which is due to a greater number of HCV-infected Americans. HCV infection of the new graft is almost 100% and graft loss is about 50%. But with HCV now potentially curable (see \"In the News, \" p. 2), the transplant community is very optimistic that graft infection and organ loss can be dramatically reduced in people with HCV . Recently an all-oral regimen containing sofosbuvir for chronic HCV in waitlisted patients with liver cancer had a very high cure rate after liver transplant. Raising the Bar With the availability of effective anti-HBV therapies and optimal surgical and medical care, the average 1-year survival rate after liver transplantation at U.S. transplant centers is now at least 93%, with rejection and infection rates at one month being under 15% and 7%, respectively. \"Post-transplant care has been refined to exceptional levels, \" Dr. Gish observed, adding, \"We are raising the bar higher. \"Moreover, the processes for selecting transplant candidates and for distributing the donated organs have also been improved. The revised UNOS policy for liver allocation aims to give candidates broader access to available organs. And centers are adopting regional sharing for patients with MELD scores over 15 and over 35 to help reduce the marked disparity in organ distribution across the country. (The \"Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, \" or MELD score, is a reliable measure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease and is used to help prioritize allocation of organs for transplant.) Focus of the Future Addressing the disparity in organ allocation has never been more urgent. In 2012, over 6,000 people received a liver transplant, but about 16,000 were on the waiting list. And the number of people waiting is expected to increase further as the incidence of liver cancer continues to rise, putting further strain on the already limited donor pool. Up to 80,000 patients are dying of liver failure each year in the U.S. The focus is now on increasing the number of available organs by enhanced donation and removing the geographic disparity in distribution. Efforts are ongoing to reduce the cost of transporting and processing the organs because these factors affect transplant success. But perhaps the biggest impact will come from reducing the need for transplants in the first place. Chronic viral hepatitis infections are among the primary reasons for liver transplantation in the U.S. Now that HCV can be cured, the nation must redouble its efforts to find a cure for HBV . Hepatitis B Foundation | B Informed | Spring 2014 hepb.org 3In Loving Memory of Arline Loh Hepatitis B Advocate and HBF Friend Ms. Arline Loh, a passionate hepatitis B advocate who was also a founding member of the Hepatitis B Foundation's One Hundred Chinese Families & Friends campaign and recognized as a \"Champion of Change\" by the White House, lost her courageous battle to liver cancer on October 15, 2013. A former banking information technology expert, Arline was forced into early retirement because of advancing liver disease caused by chronic hepatitis B, which she acquired at birth. Arline spent her life dedicated to educating and informing people about hepatitis B and how to prevent and manage this serious liver disease. The founder of two hepatitis B support groups in New York City, as well as the co-founder of H+EAL (Health and Education for Asian Livers), her advocacy efforts focused on HBV screening, vaccination, and treatment. Arline will be remembered for her strength, determination, generosity and unwavering love of family. Her dedication to the cause of hepatitis B will live on to inspire the continuing work of the Hepatitis B Foundation as it seeks to eliminate hepatitis B through research, outreach and patient advocacy.

This reflects the importance of hepatitis B in Asia, and the growing interest internationally. Plenary speaker Prof. Wenhui Li, Chinese National Institute of Biological Sciences, generated a lot of excitement as he discussed identification of sodium taurocholate transporting peptide (NTCP) as the liver HBV \"receptor. \" The virus binds to this molecule to enter the liver cell. Its identification had eluded scientists for decades. The new knowledge is expected to advance basic science and antiviral drug discovery research. A provocative report from Dr. Dieter Glebe, Justus-Liebig University, on isolating a hepadnavirus (closely related to HBV) from bats raised questions about HBV origins and transmission. HBV therapeutics-specific highlights: HBV replication may be dependent on autophagy, whereby the infected cell \"self digests. \" Another target for HBV antivirals? (Dr. Tian, USC, Los Angeles, CA). cccDNA can be formed in immortalized mice hepatocytes (Dr. Cui, Penn State U, Hershey, PA) and HBV cccDNA establishment is regulated by core protein (Dr. Fournier et al, INSERM, Lyon, France). Host (cellular) factors and DNA repair enzymes were also reported to regulate cccDNA (Dr. Koeniger et al, University Hospital, Freiburg, Germany). Rare cutting endonuclease such as Transcription Activator Like Effector proteins may be designed to attack cccDNA (Dr. Arbouthnot, U. Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa and Dr. Jerome, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA). Might HBV core protein be immunosuppressive, even affecting interferon response bi-specific antibody (Dr. Bohne, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). Treatment of macrophages with STING agonists induced a robust cytokine response that efficiently suppresses HBV replication in hepatocytes (Dr. Chang, Drexel University, with Blumberg Institute scientists).Hep B United Rolls Out National Plan Entering its 3rd year, the Hep B United national coalition - established by the Hepatitis B Foundation in partnership with the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO) - is making huge strides to leverage the success of local hepatitis B coalitions across the country to increase awareness, screening, vaccination and linkage to care for high-risk populations. At the inaugural summit in August 2012 with its 18 community coalition members and federal partners, Hep B United developed the first national community plan to advance the key HBV priorities of the U.S. Health and Human Services Viral Hepatitis Action Plan. The Hepatitis B Foundation received a timely boost to its resources in Oct. 2013 with a 3-year cooperative agreement from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to help Hep B United implement its national action plan. Major components of the Hep B United plan are to build the infrastructure of the national coalition and provide technical assistance and training to its coalition members through monthly conference calls and e-newsletters, training webinars, \"Hep B Hangouts\" (live video chats), a mini-grants program to fund local coalition activities, and an Annual Summit to bring all of the partners together (May 21-23, 2014 in Washington, DC). With assistance from its federal partners, Hep B United aims to improve HBV screening and linkage to care nationwide. Visit www.HepBUnited.org to learn more and join the coalition!

The Hepatitis B Foundation's Crystal Ball, which took place on April 11, 2014, at the Warrington Country Club, Warrington, Pa., attracted hundreds of leaders from the community, academic institutions, and government, as well as healthcare and biotech company executives. This year's event, the \"Cherry Blossom Extravaganza, \" raised a record-breaking $102,000 to help support the Foundation's mission of finding a cure and improving the lives of those affected by hepatitis B. Thomas Starzl, MD, PhD, was the 2014 recipient of the Baruch S. Blumberg Prize, the HBF's highest scientific honor, for his pioneering work in creating a new field of medicine - organ transplantation, especially of the liver. Dr. Timothy Block, HBF president, noted, \"Tonight we honor a giant, a living legend. Liver transplantation saves many thousands of lives each year in the U.S. and [around] the world. This is all due to the vision and persistence of Dr. Starzl, whose contributions continue to inspire all of us as we push toward the discovery of a cure. \"In his acceptance speech, Dr. Starzl remarked, \"If we had known then what we know now, we would never have attempted to pursue the concept of liver transplantation... because we would have thought it would be too complicated. \" He graciously thanked all the attending guests for their support of the Hepatitis B Foundation, \"which is doing invaluable work to eliminate a terrible disease. \" U.S. Senator Bob Casey sent his personal congratulations to Dr. Starzl, noting in his letter, \"My father, Governor Robert P . Casey, suffered from a liver-based disorder and Dr. Starzl predicted that a liver transplant would halt progression of his disease. In 1993 [he] underwent a successful combined liver and heart transplant at the University of Pittsburgh. After surgery, my father was able to return to work and enacted important transplant legislation that Dr. Starzl consulted on. \" The Foundation thanks presenting sponsor, Univest, platinum sponsors Gilead Sciences and SigmaPharm, and emerald sponsors Allure West, deArt Folio, Bugajewski OnCore Biopharma, Furia Rubel, High Swartz LLP , and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with media sponsor Bucks County Herald.Dr. Thomas Starzl (center), recipient of the 2014 Baruch S.

Jeffrey Schweitzer, president of Univest, the presenting sponsor of the Crystal Ball. My life as a parent started in 1994 when my eight-year-old sister Adrienne visited me for Christmas. Adrienne's two-week vacation became permanent when our mother told me she was ill, tired and no longer capable of being a mother. At 22-years-old, I had little money or job stability, but it never occurred to me to say no. The initial years were challenging for both of us, as we struggled to define our new relationship. The rules were that I was her parent first, then her sister and eventually her friend. I had high expectations of Adrienne, and she always exceeded them. She maintained a 4.0 GPA during her first year at Burbank High School and participated in the Gifted and Talented program. Aside from her educational achievements, she was a talented artist. Three galleries displayed her artwork in Los Angeles. On May 16, 2001, I discovered Adrienne curled up in fetal position and saying she couldn't breathe. Six hours later, our lives changed forever when an ER doctor said, \"She has tumors in her liver and lungs.\" Tests revealed that Adrienne had hepatitis B and hepatitis C, which the doctors determined she had acquired from our mother during childbirth. A biopsy confirmed that Adrienne had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as primary liver cancer. When I told her the news, Adrienne asked, \"What's next, chemo? Hey, I'm not going to die.\" Throughout the summer, Adrienne endured four rounds of chemotherapy \u2014 without an ounce of self-pity. Her spirit was infectious. She was determined to make the most of her situation. When her blood counts were up, we did everything she had ever wanted to do: meet her favorite musician on The Tonight Show, attend her first ballet, eat our first set of crab legs, and walk through the mall searching for the perfect dress for her Make-a-Wish day. By October, her health quickly deteriorated. She slurred her speech and lost track of time. Her brain was not getting enough oxygen because the tumors in her lungs grew larger every day. Though she could not see the yellow in her eyes, I could. She had developed jaundice; her liver was dying. Within days, Adrienne died at home in her own bed surrounded by people who loved her. Her last words were, \"I love you, Sissy.\" I could not save Adrienne from liver cancer, but I have made it my mission to tell her story and to help others suffering from this devastating disease. I founded Blue Faery: the Adrienne Wilson Liver Cancer Association to help prevent, treat and cure primary liver cancer, specifically HCC, through research, education and advocacy. We are the only nonprofit in the United States solely devoted to fighting liver cancer. In 2003, we created our liver cancer patient education brochure, the first of its kind, which we distribute free to patients, families and healthcare providers. We have also developed research and advocacy programs for doctors and patients, respectively. In November 2013, Blue Faery participated in the Liver Cancer Roundtable \u2014 the first ever national discussion about liver cancer. Organized by the Caring Ambassadors Program in collaboration with the Hepatitis B Foundation, the Liver Cancer Roundtable brought together leading experts in liver cancer, including doctors, government agencies, pharmaceutical representatives and advocacy groups to create a liver cancer action plan. In January 2014, I lobbied with other groups on Capitol Hill for the Viral Hepatitis Testing Act. This bill changes the Public Health Service Act \"to revise and extend the program for viral hepatitis surveillance, education and testing to prevent deaths from chronic liver diseases and liver cancer.\" With our numerous partners, Blue Faery will continue to advocate for families facing HCC. Together we can fight and win the war against liver cancer. For more information, please visit www.bluefaery.org.SPEAKING PERSONALLY Liver Cancer Killed My 15-Year-Old Sister YES!

The World Report emphasizes the need for urgent implementation of efficient prevention strategies to curb the disease, because treatments alone cannot solve the problem of cancer. \"The rise of cancer worldwide is a major obstacle to human development and well-being. These new figures and projections send a strong signal that immediate action is needed to confront this human disaster, which touches every community worldwide, without exception, \" declared Dr. Christopher Wild, director of WHO's special agency on cancer. He urged governments to implement prevention and early detection strategies to complement improved treatments because \"[they] are an investment rather than a cost. \" The Report specifically recommends the greater implementation of preventive measures, including greater use of the hepatitis B vaccine (the world's first anti-cancer vaccine) to reduce the incidence of liver cancer.
