Revenues (+/ -): Expenditures (+/ -): Other Explanation: STATEMENT OF EMERGENCY 301 KAR 1:152E This emergency administrativ e regulation establishes the requirements for the harvest and sale of Asian carp beyond the requirements of 301 KAR 1:155. Asian carp continue to proliferate and negatively impact Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley in western Kentucky. They consume the base of the aquatic food chain necessary for recruitment of important sportfish, such as bass and crappie. The department's Asian Carp and Scaled Rough Fish Harvest Program was created to help control the population of these invasive, exotic species. The current program prohibits commercial fishermen from fishing on a Saturday or prior to sunset on a Sunday from April 1 through September 30, as well as Memorial Day, Labor Day, and July 4. The original intent was to minimize conflicts with recreational anglers and boaters. However, both of these user groups, as well as the local tourism industry, and KDFWR biologists now realize that there is an escalated need to remove as many Asian carp from Kentucky and Barkley lakes as soon as possible. This emergency regulation needs to be placed into effect immediately in order to put commercial fishermen on the water for as many days as possible to increase the harvest of these invasive fish species. This emergency administrative regulation will be replaced by an ordinary admi nistrative regulation. The ordinary administrative regulation is identical to this emergency administrative regulation.

Revenues (+/ -): Expenditures (+/ -): Other Explanation: VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 12 STATEMENT OF EMERGENCY 902 KAR 45:090E This emergency administrative regulation is being promulgated to address the regulatory changes necessary as a result of the passage of House bill 468 during the 2019 legislative session. House bill 468 modified the definition of a home -based processor by adding nonpotentially hazardous foods to the list of allowable items, and revised the definition of a home -based micropro cessor to include the statement \"included but not limited to\", which allows a home -based microprocessor to produce a broader range of food products. The bill modifies the authorizing statute by adding the authority for the cabinet to further delineate whic h food products may be produced by a home -based processor and home -based microprocessor through the promulgation of administrative regulations. House bill 468 contained an emergency clause. An ordinary administrative regulation would not allow the agency sufficient time to have an administrative regulation in place for the 2019 farmers market season. This emergency administrative regulation will be replaced by an ordinary administrative regulation. The ordinary administrative regulation is identical to the emergency administrative regulation.

VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 18 STATEMENT OF EMERGENCY 907 KAR 3:170E This emergency administrative regulation is being promulgated to implement comprehensive telehealth policy changes that will allow for a provider to receive Medicaid reimbursement for any appropriate telehealth service that is within the provider's scope of practice and licensure. This emergency administrative regulation is needed pursuant to KRS 13A.190(1)(a)2. to prevent a loss of federal and state funds and pursuant to KRS 13A.190(1 )(a)4. to protect human health. This emergency administrative regulation shall be replaced by an ordinary administrative regulation. This emergency administrative regulation has the same number as an administrative regulation filed within the previous nine (9) months. This administrative regulation differs from the administrative regulation filed within the previous nine (9) months by including a new definition for \"place of service\"; excluding asynchronous store and forward technology from the definition o f telehealth; requiring that telehealth services provided be within a provider's scope of professional licensure and practice; allowing store and forward transfers only for radiology services; removing overly broad references to \"other healthcare activity\" as allowable for telehealth service reimbursement; clarifying referral requirements for telehealth services; clarifying certain medical record documenting requirements; implementing a telehealth service reimbursement requirement that is at least 100 perce nt of the amount paid for a comparable in -person service; clarifying that telehealth services are subject to cost -sharing; ensuring that medical record requirements comply with existing Medicaid law; making drafting and formatting changes to comply with KR S Chapter 13A; and establishing an implementation date of July 1, 2019. The amendments were necessary to incorporate changes requested by multiple stakeholders, and to ensure that Kentucky's provider networks are capable of meeting anticipated recipient ne ed following the implementation of an SUD 1115 Waiver that is part of the Kentucky HEALTH 1115 Waiver project and ongoing substance use disorder treatment standard enhancements required by the 2018 Regular Session's HB 124. The ordinary administrative regu lation is not identical to this emergency administrative regulation, as this emergency administrative regulation includes an additional Section 7 to establish an implementation date of July 1, 2019.

If a Final Utilization Review Decision is rendered denying authorization for a prescribed drug after an award has been entered by or agreement approved by an administrative law judge, the employer shall file a medical dispute pursuant to 803 KAR 25:012. (8) Pursuant to KRS 342.285(1), a decision of an administrative law judge on a medical dispute is subject to review by the workers' compensation board under the procedures set out in 803 KAR 25:010, Section 22.

Fuel adjustment clause. RELATES TO: KRS Chapter 278 STATUTORY , AND CONFORMITY: 278.040(3) provides that the Public Service Commission may promulgate administrative regulations to implement the provisions of KRS Chapter 278. KRS 278.030(1) provides that all rates received by an electric utility subject to the jur isdiction of the Public Service Commission shall be fair, just, and reasonable. KRS 278.030(2) provides that every utility shall furnish adequate, efficient, and reasonable service. This administrative regulation prescribes the requirements with respect to the implementation of automatic fuel adjustment clauses by which electric utilities may immediately recover increases in fuel costs subjected [subject ] to later scrutiny by the Public Service Commission Section 1. Fuel Adjustment Clause. Fuel adjustment clauses which are not in conformity with the principles set out below are not in the public interest and may result in suspension of those parts of such rate schedules: (1) The fuel adjustment clause shall provide for periodic adjustment per KWH of sales equal to the difference between the fuel costs per KWH sale in the base period and in the current period according to the following formula: F(m) F(b) Adjustment Factor = ------ - ------ S(m) S(b) Where F (b) is the cost[expense ] of[fossil ] fuel in the base period, F(m) is the cost of fuel in the current period, S(b) is sales in the base period, and S(m) is sales in the current period [(b) and Current (m) periods; and S is sales in the base (b) and current (m) periods ], all as defined below. (2) F (b)[B]/S(b)[B] shall be so determined that on the effective date of the commission's approval of the utility's application of the formula, the resultant adjustment will be equal to zero. (3) Fuel costs (F) shall be the most recent actual monthly cost , based on weighted average inventory costing, of: (a) Fossil fuel consumed in the utility's own plants, and the utility's share of fossil and nuclear fuel consumed in jointly owned or leased plants, plus the cost of fuel which would have been used in plants suff ering forced generation or transmission outages, but less the cost of fuel related to substitute generation; plus (b) The actual identifiable fossil and nuclear fuel costs associated with energy purchased for reasons other than identified in paragraph (c) of this subsection, but excluding the cost of fuel related to purchases to substitute for the forced outages; plus (c) The net energy cost of energy purchases ,[irrespective of the designation assigned to such transaction and ] exclusive of capacity or dem and charges irrespective of the designation assigned to such transaction ,[(irrespective of the designation assigned to such transaction )] when such energy is purchased on an economic dispatch basis. Included therein may be such costs as the charges for eco nomy energy purchases and the charges as a result of scheduled outage, all such kinds of energy being purchased by the buyer to substitute for its own higher cost energy; and less (d) The cost of fossil fuel recovered through intersystem sales including t he fuel costs related to economy energy sales and other energy sold on an economic dispatch basis.[ (e) All fuel costs shall be based on weighted average inventory costing. ] (4) Forced outages are all nonscheduled losses of generation or transmission which require substitute power for a continuous period in excess of six (6) hours. Where forced outages are not[ as] the[a] result of faulty equipment, faulty manufacture, faulty design, faulty installations, faulty operation, or faulty maintenance, but are Acts of God, riot, insurrection or acts of the public enemy, then the utility may, upon proper showing, with the approval of the commission, include the fuel cost of substitute energy in the adjustment.[U ntil such approval is obtained, ] In making the calculati ons of fuel cost (F) in subsection (3)(a) and (b) of this section , the forced outage costs to be subtracted shall be no less than the fuel cost related to the lost generation until such approval is obtained . (5) Sales (S) shall be all KWH's sold, excludin g intersystem sales. Utility used energy shall not be excluded in the determination of sales (S). Where, for any reason, billed system sales cannot be coordinated with fuel costs for the billing period, sales may be equated to[ the sum of ]: (a) Generation; plus (b) Purchases; plus (c) Interchange -in; less (d) Energy associated with pumped storage operations; less (e) Intersystem sales referred to in subsection (3)(d) above; less (f) Total system losses.[ Utility used energy shall not be excluded in the determination of sales (S). ] (6) The cost of fossil fuel shall only include the cost of the fuel itself and necessary charges for transportation of the fuel from the point of acquisition to the unloading point, as listed in Account 151 of FERC Uniform Sys tem of Accounts for Public Utilities and Licensees, [include no items other than the invoice price of fuel ]less any cash or other discounts.[ The invoice price of fuel includes the cost of the fuel itself and necessary charges for transportation of the fuel from the point of acquisition to the unloading point, as listed in Account 151 of FERC Uniform System of Accounts for Public Utilities and Licensees. ] Section 2. Filing Requirements. (1) [(7) At the time the fuel clause is initially filed, ] If a utility i nitially proposes a fuel adjustment clause [or proposes to reset the base period fuel costs used in a fuel adjustment clause ], the utility shall submit copies of each fossil fuel purchase contract not otherwise on file with the commission and all other agre ements, options , amendments, modifications, and [or] similar such documents[ , and all amendments and modifications thereof ] related to the procurement of fuel supply[ and] or purchased power [in addition to any other documents and information required by 807 KAR 5:001 and 807 KAR 5:011 ].[Incorporation by reference is permissible. ] (2) Any changes in the contracts or other documents filed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section , including price escalations, and[or] any new agreements entered into after the initial submission, shall be submitted at the time they are entered into. (3) Where fuel is purchased from utility -owned or controlled sources, or the contract contains a price escalation clause, those facts shall be noted , and the utility shall explain and justify them in writing.[ Fuel charges which are unreasonable shall be disallowed and may result in the suspension of the fuel adjustment clause. The commission on its own motion may investigate any aspect of fuel purchasing activities covered by this a dministrative regulation. (8) Any tariff filing which contains a fuel clause shall conform that clause with this administrative regulation within three (3) months of the effective date of this administrative regulation. The tariff filing shall contain a d escription of the fuel clause with detailed cost support. ] (4)[(9)] The monthly fuel adjustment shall be filed with the commission ten (10) days before it is scheduled to go into effect, along with all the necessary supporting data to justify the amount of the adjustment[ which shall include data and information as may be required by the commission ]. (5)[(10)] Copies of all documents required to be filed with the commission under this administrative regulation shall be open and made available for public in spection at the office of the Public Service Commission pursuant to the provisions of KRS 61.870 to 61.884. Section 3. Review of Fuel Adjustment Clauses (1) Fuel charges which are unreasonable shall be disallowed and may result in the suspension of the f uel adjustment clause. (2) The commission on its own motion may investigate any aspect of fuel purchasing activities covered by this administrative regulation. (3)[(11)] At six (6) month intervals, the commission will conduct VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 42 a formal review and may cond uct public hearings on a utility's past fuel adjustments. The commission will order a utility to charge off and amortize, by means of a temporary decrease of rates, any adjustments it finds unjustified due to improper calculation or application of the char ge or improper fuel procurement practices. (4)[(12)] Every two (2) years following the initial effective date of each utility's fuel clause , the commission will conduct a formal [in a public hearing will ] review and evaluate past operations of the clause, disallow improper expenses and , to the extent appropriate , reestablish the fuel clause charge in accordance with Section 1[subsection ] (2) of this administrative regulation [section ]. The commission may conduct a public hearing if it finds that a hearing is necessary for the protection of a substantial interest or is in the public interest. (5) For any contracts entered into [Beginning ] three (3) months or more after the effective date of this regulation, the commission shall, in determining the reasonablene ss of fuel costs in procurement contracts and fuel procurement practices, evaluate the reasonableness of fuel costs in contracts and competing bids based on the cost of the fuel less any coal severance tax imposed by any jurisdiction upon coal physically r emoved from the earth [any tax collected under KRS 143.020 ]. This is to certify that the Public Service Commission approved promulgation of this administrative regulation, as amended after comment, pursuant to KRS 278.040(3), on June 14, 2019. GWEN R. PI NSON, Executive Director MICHAEL J. SCHMITT, Chairman APPROVED BY AGENCY: June 14, 2019 FILED WITH LRC: June 14, 2019 at noon CONTACT PERSON: John E.B. Pinney, Acting General Counsel, Kentucky Public Service Commission, 211 Sower Boulevard, Frankfort, K entucky 40601, TATEMENT Contact Person: John E.B. Pinney (1) Provide a brief summary of: (a) What this a dministrative regulation does: This regulation prescribes the requirements with respect to the implementation of automatic fuel adjustment clauses by which electric utilities may immediately recover increases in fuel costs subject to later scrutiny by the Kentucky Public Service Commission. (b) The necessity of this administrative regulation: This regulation promotes reliable electric service at reasonable rates by creating a mechanism by which fluctuations in fuel costs, which are a significant and volati le cost in electric generation, may be reflected in customer bills in a timely manner, subject to commission oversight, without a more burdensome general rate adjustment proceeding. (c) How this administrative regulation conforms to the content of the aut horizing statutes: KRS 278.040(3) provides that the commission may promulgate administrative regulations to implement the provisions of KRS Chapter 278. KRS 278.030(1) provides that all rates received by an electric utility subject to the jurisdiction of t he commission shall be fair, just, and reasonable. KRS 278.030(2) provides that every utility shall furnish adequate, efficient, and reasonable service. Administrative regulation number, 807 KAR 5:056, limits regulatory lag by prescribing a mechanism by wh ich fluctuations in fuel prices, which are a significant and volatile cost in electric generation, may be reflected in customer bills in a timely manner, subject to commission oversight, without a more burdensome general rate adjustment proceeding. (d) Ho w this administrative regulation currently assists or will assist in the effective administration of the statutes: This regulation limits regulatory lag by prescribing a mechanism by which fluctuations in fuel prices, which are a significant and volatile c ost in electric generation, may be reflected in customer bills in a timely manner, subject to commission oversight, without a more burdensome general rate adjustment proceeding. (2) If this is an amendment to an existing administrative regulation, provide a brief summary of: (a) How the amendment will change this existing administrative regulation: The proposed amendments after comments: (1) keep the original language of the regulation in Section 1(3)(c); (2) clarifies the language in Section 2(1) regardi ng the filing requirements for utilities; (3) clarify that the proposed amendments in Section 3(5) will only apply to contracts entered into three (3) months or more after the effective date of the regulation; and (4) clarify that the proposed amendments i n Section 3(5) will apply to coal severance taxes or other similar taxes imposed by all jurisdictions. (b) The necessity of the amendments after comment to this administrative regulation: (1) the original proposed changes to Section 1(3)(c) inadvertently changed the meaning of the section, and, in response to several comments, the Commission will keep the original language of the section. (2) Some of the proposed changes to Section 1(7) [Re -codified as Section 2(1)], according to some of the comments, may inadvertently cause some confusion regarding what documents need to be filed. The amendments after comment clarify the filing requirements. (3) The original proposed amendment to Section 3(5) caused concern among the commenters that the regulation, once ef fective, would apply to fuel contracts into which the utility had already entered. The first proposed amendment after comment in Section 3(5) clarifies that the regulation, once effective, will only apply to fuel contracts entered into three (3) or more mo nths after the effective date of the amended regulation. (4) The second proposed amendment after comment in Section 3(5) is made to address several concerns of the commenters. The proposed amendment after comment will remove the coal severance or similar t ax collected by the state from which the coal originates and is being made to ensure that the reasonableness of fuel costs are reviewed on a more level basis regardless of the state of origin. (c) How the amendment conforms to the content of the authorizi ng statutes: Administrative regulation number, 807 KAR 5:056, continues to limit regulatory lag by prescribing a mechanism by which fluctuations in fuel prices, whether up or down, may be reflected in customer bills in a timely manner, subject to commissio n oversight, without a more burdensome general rate adjustment proceeding. The amendments clarify the application of 807 KAR 5:056, remove unnecessary regulatory burdens in its application, and ensure customers continue to receive adequate, efficient, and reasonable service through the utilities' timely recovery of volatile costs for fuel from diverse sources. The proposed amendments after comment are consistent with the content of the authorizing statutes. (d) How the amendment will assist in the effectiv e administration of the statutes: The proposed amendments after comment further clarify the application of 807 KAR 5:056, remove the uncertainty of some of the original proposed amendments, remove unnecessary regulatory burdens in its application, and ensu re customers continue to receive adequate, efficient, and reasonable service through the utilities' timely recovery of volatile costs for fuel from diverse sources. (3) List the type and number of individuals, businesses, organizations, or state and local governments affected by this administrative regulation: The regulation will affect regulated electric generation and distribution utilities in the Commonwealth of which there are approximately 25. (4) Provide an analysis of how the entities identified in question (3) will be impacted by either the implementation of this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change, if it is an amendment, including: (a) List the actions that each of the regulated entities identified in question (3) will have to tak e to comply with this administrative regulation or amendment: The amendments will allow the commission to review fuel adjustment clauses without a hearing and should thereby ease the burden on regulated entities. The commission does not anticipate the regu lated entities having to take additional actions to comply with the amendments. (b) In complying with this administrative regulation or amendment, how much will it cost each of the entities identified in question (3): Zero Dollars; no fiscal impact. (c) As a result of compliance, what benefits will accrue to the VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 43 entities identified in question (3): The amendment clarifies potential ambiguous provisions in the regulation and thereby should ease compliance, and it eliminates the requirement that hearings be conducted, which should ease the burden on the regulated entities while allowing the commission to maintain its oversight of fuel adjustment clauses. (5) Provide an estimate of how much it will cost the administrative body to implement this administrativ e regulation: (a) Initially: Zero Dollars; no fiscal impact. (b) On a continuing basis: Zero Dollars; no fiscal impact. (6) What is the source of the funding to be used for the implementation and enforcement of this administrative regulation: The commis sion does not anticipate this amendment increasing its enforcement cost. The amendment should, if anything, nominally reduce the number of hearings the commission conducts each year. The commission currently funds enforcement of this regulation through its general operating budget funded through annual assessments paid by regulated utilities pursuant to KRS 278.130, et. seq ., and this amendment has no effect on that funding. (7) Provide an assessment of whether an increase in fees or funding will be necess ary to implement this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change if it is an amendment: No fiscal impact. (8) State whether or not this administrative regulation established any fees or directly or indirectly increased any fees: No new fees are e stablished and existing fees will not be affected. (9) TIERING: Is tiering applied? Tiering is not applied to this regulation, because it would not be appropriate. This regulation simply creates a mechanism by which fluctuations in fuel costs incurred by each utility may be passed through to customer bills in a timely manner. Although the utilities to which this regulation applies vary in size and location, they function in a similar manner. Moreover, the amounts that are flowed through the fuel adjustment clauses, whether they result in increases or decreases in customer bills, will vary based on the size of the utility. The commission's review of the fuel adjustment clauses of smaller utilities will be less burdensome by virtue of the fact that there is l ess to review. However, while the total amounts flowed through the fuel adjustment clauses vary based on the size of the utility, the fuel costs will make up approximately the same percentage of the utilities expense and their customer bills regardless of the size of the utility, so there would be no basis for reviewing the amounts passed through fuel adjustment clauses more or less frequently based on the size of the utility. FISCAL NOTE ON STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (1) What units, parts or divisions of state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) will be impacted by this administrative regulation? No impact. (2) Identify each state or federal statute or federal regulation that requires or authorizes the action taken by the administrative regulation. KRS 278.040 (3) Estimate the effect of this administrative regulation on the expenditures and revenues of a state or local government agency (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for the first full year the administrative regulation is to be in effect. Zero Dollars; no fiscal impact. (a) How much revenue will this administrative regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, o r school districts) for the first year? Zero Dollars; no fiscal impact. (b) How much revenue will this administrative regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for subsequent years? Zero Dollars; no fiscal impact. (c) How much will it cost to administer this program for the first year? Zero Dollars; no fiscal impact. (d) How much will it cost to administer this program for subsequent years? Zero Dollars; no fiscal impact. Note: If specific dollar estimates cannot be determined, provide a brief narrative to explain the fiscal impact of the administrative regulation.

(1) Combined group filers, elec tive consolidated filers, and separate return filers shall compute net operating loss for Kentucky VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 61 purposes in the following manner: (a) For elective consolidated filers, the net operating loss shall be multiplied by the group's apportionment factor provi ded by KRS 141.120 or 141.121; (b) For combined group filers, the net operating loss of each taxpayer member shall be computed in accordance with KRS 141.202(5)(c); (c) For separate returns filers, the net operating loss shall be multiplied by the apport ionment factor provided by KRS 141.120 or KRS 141.121; and (d) The apportioned net operating loss shall be available for carryforward. [For combined group returns and elective consolidated returns, the net operating loss shall be multiplied by the group's apportionment factor provided by KRS 141.120 or 141.121; (b) For separate returns, the net operating loss shall be multiplied by the apportionment factor provided by KRS 141.120 or KRS 141.121; and (c) The apportioned net operating loss shall be availabl e for carryforward. ] (2) Elective consolidated filer net operating loss carryforward to a combined group return or separate returns. This subsection shall apply if an elective consolidated filer who has incurred net operating losses as a consolidated grou p will now be filing combined group returns or separate[ entity ] returns, and establishes how those elective consolidated net operating losses shall be treated for purposes of the combined group returns or separate [entity ]returns. (a) An elective consoli dated filer having a net operating loss carryforward on the last elective consolidated return may carry that loss forward to combined group returns or separate returns. The following requirements shall apply to this situation: 1. Determine the post -apport ioned elective consolidated group net operating loss carryforward. The elective consolidated group's apportionment KRS 141.121, or 141.901 shall be used to determine the post -apportioned net operating loss. 2. Determine the years that are in the post -apportioned elective consolidated group net operating loss carryforward. All post - apportioned net operating loss carryforwards shall be used on a first-in-first-out basis (i.e., most recent losses remain). 3. Determine each loss corporation's share of the net operating loss for each year in the following manner: a. Allocate the post -apportioned elective consolidated group net operating loss carryforward by year to each loss corporation in each year. For a year in which the total loss generated exceeds the carryforward allocated to that year, the post -apportioned net operating loss shall be prorated for that year proportionally based on the loss generated by each member; b. Add together each loss corporation's allocated shar e of the losses for each year it was a member of an elective consolidated group; and c. Carry the separate entity net operating loss carryforward computed in clauses a. and b. of this subparagraph to the first combined group return or separate return due after the elective consolidated return.

(a) If a nexus consolidated filer ceases to exist or a member leaves the group and a consolidated net operating loss carryforward exists, that net operating loss carryforward may be carried forward to the combined group return, the elective consolidated return, or the separate returns. The following requirements shall apply to this situation: 1. Determine the pre -apportioned nexus consolidated group net oper ating loss carryforward. 2. Determine the years that are in the pre -apportioned nexus consolidated group net operating loss carryforward. All pre - apportioned net operating loss carryforwards shall be used on a first-in-first-out basis (i.e., most recent l osses remain). 3. Determine each loss corporation's share of the net operating loss for each year in the following manner: a. Allocate the pre -apportioned nexus consolidated group net operating loss carryforward by year to each loss corporation in each y ear. For a year in which the total loss generated exceeds the carryforward allocated to that year, the pre -apportioned net operating loss shall be prorated for that year proportionally based on the loss generated by each member in that year; b. Multiply t he pre -apportioned net operating loss carryforward amounts as allocated [assigned ] to the members by the nexus consolidated group's apportionment factor for each year a net operating loss exists to determine the post -apportioned net operating loss carryforw ard that member may carry forward to[in] the future. The apportionment factor calculation is provided by KRS 141.120, 141.121, or 141.901; c. Add together the post -apportioned losses generated for each loss corporation during the time in which it was incl uded in a nexus consolidated return; and d. Carry the separate entity net operating loss carryforward computed in clauses a. to c. of this subparagraph to the first combined group return, elective consolidated return, or separate return due after the nexu s consolidated group ceases to exist or after the member leaves the nexus consolidated group .

The deduction for losses generated for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, shall be limited to eighty (80) percent of the taxable net income as allowed by Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code. (2) Nexus consolidated returns shall be subject to the fifty (50) percent limitation as required in KRS 141.200(11)(c). (3) Taxpayer members of a combined group return that utilize the net operating loss of another taxp ayer member that was not a member of the same combined group return in the year in which the net operating loss was originally incurred shall be subject to the fifty (50) percent limitation as required in KRS 141.202 (5)(c)3. or 4. Section 4. Net operati ng losses by corporations included in a combined group return shall be determined in accordance with KRS 141.202(5)(c).

The total post - apportioned NOLs carried forward to Year 5 is $13,167 (see Figure 4- 2).] (5) Example 5: Sharing of Kentucky Net Operating Losses within a Combined Group. (a) Parent Corporation and its three subsidiaries, Sub A, Sub B, and Sub C , file a combined return in 2019, the first year in which a combined return is required. All entities have nexus in Kentucky and are taxpayer members of the combined group. The combined group has apportionable group net income of $50,000 in 2019. The 2019 apportionment factors for the members of the group are shown in Figure 5 -1 below. The members also report the following apportioned NOL carryforwards from 2017 and 2018 (Figure 5 -1). Figure 5 -1 Parent Sub A Sub B Sub C 2019 Group Income $50,000 2017 (and earlier years) NOL can be applied against 100 percent of taxable income. 2018 (and later years) NOL is limited to eighty (80) percent of net income. The following calculation determines the maximum allowable NOL deduction available to each entity (See Figure 5 -2). This amount may exceed (or be les s than) the actual amount of prior year NOL available within the group. The maximum allowable NOL deduction available to each entity is the sum of: 1. NOLs generated by the entity in 2017 and previous years; plus 2. NOLs generated by the entity in 2018, up to a maximum of eighty (80) percent of the entity's 2019 taxable income; plus 3. NOLs generated by other taxpayer members of the group in years before a combined return was required, up to a maximum of fifty (50) percent of the 2019 taxable income of t he entity that is utilizing the NOL. (Note that losses from years in which a combined report was required may be shared between taxpayer members of the combined group without reference to the fifty (50) percent limitation, provided that the entities sharin g the losses were members of the combined group in the year the loss was generated). Figure 5 -2 NOL Limitations Parent Sub A Sub B Sub C 2017 and Prior NOLs (Up to 100% of 2019 taxable income) $ 10,000 $5,000 $5,000 $2,500 Max Amount of Allowable 2018 NO L (Up to 80% of 2019 Taxable Income) $ 8,000 $ 4,000 $4,000 $2,000 Max of Allowable Shared Amount (Up to 50% of 2019 Taxable Income) $ 5,000 $ 2,500 $2,500 $1,250 The following steps determine the utilization of the available NOL by each entity and each entity's resulting taxable income and NOL carryforward to 2020 (See Figure 5 -3). Subtract the entity's available 2017 (and earlier) NOL amount from the entity's 2019 taxable income on a first -in-first-out basis (i.e. most recent losses remain), up to 100 percent[ 100% ] of 2019 taxable income; Subtract the entity's 2018 NOL up to the maximum allowable 2018 NOL (eighty (80) percent of 2019 taxable income) from the amount remaining after Step 1; Subtract the NOL amounts available to be shared from other taxpay er members of the combined group up to the maximum allowable shared amount (50% of 2019 taxable income) from the amount remaining after Step 2. In no case can the utilization of NOLs reduce taxable income below zero (0). If group NOLs exceed available inco me, the remaining NOL may be carried forward.

(1) Par ent Corporation and its three subsidiaries, Sub A, Sub B, and Sub C, file a combined return in 2020. Sub A does not have nexus in Kentucky and is included in the group under the unitary principle. The combined group has apportionable group net income of $5 0,000 in 2020. The 2020 apportionment factors for the members of the group are shown below. The members also report the following post -apportioned NOL carryforwards from 2018, a year in which each entity filed separately, and 2019, a year in which the grou p filed a combined return (Figure 6 -1). Figure 6 -1 Parent Sub A Sub B Sub C 2020 Group Income $50,000 The maximum allowable NOL deduction available to each entity is equal to eighty (80) percent of its taxable income (See Figure 6 -2). Figure 6 -2 NOL Limitations Parent Sub B Sub C 80% of 2020 Taxable Income $8,000 $4,000 $2,000 Figure 6 -3 shows the utilization of the available NOL deduction by each entity and each entity's resulting taxable income and NOL carryforward to 2021. As the 2019 NOLs were generated in a year in which a combined report was required, t hey can be shared among taxpayer members of the group, subject to the eighty (80) percent limitation. Since Sub A does not have Kentucky nexus in 2020, it is not a taxpayer member and therefore its 2018 NOLs cannot be utilized by other group members. Sub A cannot utilize its 2018 losses until it has Kentucky source income. Figure 6 -3 Parent Sub A Sub B Sub C 2019 Taxable Income $10,000 $0 $5,000 $2,500 Income Remaining $ 2,500 $0 $1,000 $1,500 Less: Shared NOL ($ 500) N/A $ 0 ($ 500) Taxable Income Remaining $ 2,000 $0 $1,000 $1,000 2018 NOL -4 shows how Sub B's NOLs were shared among the group.

Sales and purchases for 131.130(1) authorizes the Department of Revenue to promulgate administrative regulations necessary for the administration and enforcement of all tax laws in Kentucky. This administrative regulation establishes requirements to consolidate and clarify various provisions of the sales and use tax law as they relate to the authorized issuance of resale certificates by purchasers and acceptance thereof by retailers and sellers. Section 1. A resale certificate shall either be a \"single purchase certificate\" or a \"blanket certificate\". (1) A \"Single purchase certificate\" sha ll include an itemization by the purchaser of the tangible personal property, digital property, or services specifically numerated in KRS 139.200(g) through (q) according to the provisions of KRS 139.260(3) [property ] to be purchased. A single purchase cert ificate may only be used for a single purchase of applicable property and services [tangible personal property or digital property ] for resale and shall not be used for subsequent purchases. (2) A \"Blanket certificate\" shall include a general description b y the purchaser of the kind of tangible personal property, digital property, or services specifically numerated in KRS 139.200(g) through (q) according to the provisions of KRS 139.260(3) property to be purchased for resale in the regular course of busines s. A purchaser who has executed a blanket certificate shall not be required to execute additional certificates of resale for individual purchases if: (a) There is no change in the character of the purchaser's operation; and (b) The purchases are of appli cable property and services [tangible personal property or digital property ] of the kind usually purchased by the purchaser for resale. Section 2. The resale certificate issued by the purchaser shall be in the form of either the \"Resale Certificate\", Form 51A105, the \"Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement - Certificate of Exemption\", Revenue Form 51A260, or the Multistate Tax Commission's \"Uniform Sales and Use Tax Exemption/Resale Certificate - Multijurisdiction\". Section 3. If the purchaser is not re quired to hold a permit because the purchaser is a nonresident purchaser not required to register in Kentucky, the purchaser may issue a fully completed: (1) Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement - Certificate of Exemption (Revenue Form 51A260); or (2) Resale Certificate (Revenue Form 51A105). If the purchaser issues a \"Resale Certificate\", Form 51A105, the purchaser shall note on the face of the certificate that the purchaser is a nonresident purchaser not required to register and obtain a permit in Ke ntucky. The certificate shall bear the purchaser's signature, name, address, and any other information requested on the form. The purchaser shall clearly mark on the certificate whether it is a single purchase certificate or a blanket certificate. Sectio n 4. (1) If the retailer or seller has not obtained a completed resale certificate in a timely manner according to the provisions of KRS 139.270, the burden of proving that a sale is exempt as a sale for resale shall be upon the retailer or seller. The retailer or seller may offer proof to the department that the sale in question is not subject to tax in accordance with 103 KAR 1:010. (2)(a) For example, if a retailer or seller only receives a completed resale certificate from a restaurant business for silverware [ and other table settings only ]after the 120 day period required under KRS 139.270, the burden of proof shall be considered \"not met\" and the retailer or seller shall remain liable for the tax. The items in this example are for use within the resta urant business rather than for resale. (b) If the retailer or seller receives a completed resale certificate in the course of a department audit for purchases of disposable utensils [cups ] from the same restaurant business, the burden of proof shall be con sidered \"met\" because the product is of the type resold in the normal course of the restaurant business.

VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 112 FEDERAL MANDATE ANALYSIS COMPARISON (1) Federal statute or regulation constituting the federal mandate. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3347. (2) State compliance standards. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3347 requires the Appraisal Subcommittee to monitor each state with a licensing or certification process for appraisers and appraisal management companies to determine whether the state processes complaints and completes investigations in a reasonable time period and whether t he state reports complaints and disciplinary actions on a timely basis to the national registries for appraisers and appraisal management companies. While this federal provision does not explicitly require the Real Estate Appraisers Board to develop any particular complaint and disciplinary process, the result of non - compliance is removal of credential holders and registrants from their respective national registry, which would prohibit those individuals or entities from performing appraisal services on federally related transactions. While the Kentucky appraiser program currently has an excellent review, non -compliance or poor compliance or supervision could result in suspension or derecognition of the program. (3) Minimum or uniform standards contained in the federal mandate. The federal mandate does require the Board to receive and process grievances. However, the federal mandate does not contain minimum or uniform standards; the manner of compliance is entirely within the state licensing agency's discret ion. However, as mentioned above, non -compliance or poor compliance could carry a severe penalty. (4) Will this administrative regulation impose stricter requirements, or additional or different responsibilities or requirements, than those required by the federal mandate? Yes. The federal mandate does not contain minimum or uniform standards; the manner of compliance is entirely within the state licensing agency's discretion. However, as mentioned above, non - compliance or poor compliance could carry a seve re penalty. The grievance filing and review process established by this administrative regulation clearly informs consumers, credential holders and registrants, and Appraisal Subcommittee of the Board's grievance filing and review process. (5) Justificati on for the imposition of the stricter standard, or additional or different responsibilities or requirements. The federal mandate does not contain minimum or uniform standards; the manner of compliance is entirely within the state licensing agency's discret ion. However, as mentioned above, non -compliance or poor compliance could carry a severe penalty.

(9) TIERING: Is tiering applied? No. Tiering is not applied as all regulated entities are treated the same. FEDERAL MANDATE ANALYSIS COMPARISON (1) Federal statute or regulation constituting the federal mandate. 15 U.S.C. 1639e(i) requires lenders and their agents to compensat e fee appraisers at a rate that is customary and reasonable for appraisal services performed in the market area of the property being appraised. 12 C.F.R. 226.42(f) is a federal regulation promulgated pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 1639e(i), which reiterates the re quirement that appraisers be paid a customary and reasonable fee for appraisal services performed. 12 C.F.R. 34.210 - 216 is a series of federal regulations promulgated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency under 12 U.S.C. 93a and Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA), as amended by the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd -Frank Act) (Pub.L. 111 -VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 131 203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010)), 12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq. Additionally, the Apprai sal Subcommittee published its Final Rule, pursuant to its authority in 12 C.F.R. 34 -216, which applies to states and appraisal management companies providing appraisal management services in connection with consumer credit transactions secured by a consum er's principal dwelling or securitizations of those transactions. The Final Rule requires states to implement regulations to govern appraisal management companies, including annual National AMC Registry reporting requirements to the Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Counsel, a Congressional subcommittee. (2) State compliance standards. The Kentucky Real Estate Appraisers Board does not impose or opine what a customary and reasonable fee for appraisal services might be in any given market. However, the Board's regulation does require compensation to be made within 45 days of the service being rendered. This proposed administrative regulation also brings the Board into compliance with the National AMC Registry reporting requirements. (3) Minimum or uniform standards contained in the federal mandate. In order for appraisal management companies to continue to providing appraisal management services in connection with consumer credit transactions secured by a consumer's pri ncipal dwelling or securitizations of those transactions, a state must adopt regulations and elect to register appraisal management companies on the Appraisal Subcommittee's National AMC Registry. At a minimum, a state electing to register appraisal manage ment companies shall: 1) review and approve or deny registration applications; 2) review and renew or deny registrations; 3) examine the books and records of operating registrants and require submission of reports, information, and documents; 4) verify tha t appraisers rostered with an appraisal management company are appropriately credentialed; 5) investigate appraisal management companies to assess potential violations; 6) discipline appraisal management companies as appropriate consistent with appraisal -related laws; 7) report violations and discipline of an appraisal management company to the Appraisal Subcommittee. (4) Will this administrative regulation impose stricter requirements, or additional or different responsibilities or requirements, than thos e required by the federal mandate? No. The Final Rule simply requires registered appraisal management companies to submit a report of the number of appraisers on the company's roster and the number of covered transactions completed in the required reportin g period. (5) Justification for the imposition of the stricter standard, or additional or different responsibilities or requirements. The additional responsibilities imposed by the Board will assist the Board in regulating the conduct of registrants to en sure appraisers are treated fairly and in evaluating complaints and potential licensing law violations by registrants, relating to other administrative regulations promulgated by the Board in addition to that which is required for compliance with the Natio nal AMC Registry.

FISCAL NOTE ON STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (1) What units, parts, or divisions of state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) will be impacted by this administrative regulation? Kentucky 911 Services Board, 115 Board -certified public safety answering points, approximately 45 non -certified PSAPs. (2) Identify each state or federal statute or federal regulation that requires or authorizes the action taken by the administrative regulation. KRS 65.7631, 65.7633 (3) Estimate the effect of this administrative regulation on the expenditures and revenues of a state or local government agency (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for the first full year the administrative regulation is to be in effect. An indeterminable amount of staff time on behalf of the public safety answering point seeking 911 Services Board certification, and an indeterminable amount of equipment necessary to meet the requirement guidelines. The cost to a local government to achieve Board certification is based on the equipment a lready owned by the public safety answering point. (a) How much revenue will this administrative regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for the first year? This will depend on how many residents the newly certified PSAP has as a significant portion of certified dispersals are based on call volume. Each Board -certified PSAP currently receives approximately $130,000 per year in wireless 911 fees collected by the Board. (b) Ho w much revenue will this administrative regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for subsequent years? The amount of revenue received by certified PSAPs is based on a statutor y formula per KRS 65.7631. (c) How much will it cost to administer this program for the first year? $800,000 for all operational facets of the 911 Services Board, based on current 911 fee collections using the statutory formula in KRS 65.7631(2) to admini ster 202 KAR 6:010 to 6:100. Two-and-a-half percent of all CMRS funds collected on behalf of wireless telecommunications subscribers are retained by the 911 Services Board to pay the administrative costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Board in carrying out the functions and duties set forth in KRS 65.7621 to 65.7643. However, this regulation is already in place and the proposed amendments have no new fiscal impact. (d) How much will it cost to administer this program for subsequent years? $8 00,000 for all operational facets of the 911 Services Board, based on current 911 fee collections using the statutory formula in KRS 65.7631(2) to administer 202 KAR 6:010 to 6:100. Two -and-a-half percent of all CMRS funds collected on behalf of wireless t elecommunications subscribers are retained by the 911 Services Board to pay the administrative costs and expenses incurred in the operation of the Board in carrying out the functions and duties set forth in KRS 65.7621 to 65.7643. As the funding formula is set in statute, the amount of funding directed to Board operations fluctuates based on overall 911 fee collections. The enhanced GIS mapping requirements of this regulation will place an additional burden on 911 Services Board staff in the areas of compli ance and administration but the amount is indeterminable.

Designation of uses of surface waters. RELATES 224.10 - 100 requires the cabinet to develop and conduct a comprehensive program for the management of water resources and to provide for the prevention, abatement, and control of pollution. This administrative regulation and 401 KAR 10:001, 10:029, 10:030, and 10:031 establish procedures to protect the surface waters of the Commonwealth, and thus protect water resources. This administrative r egulation applies the designated uses described in 401 KAR 10:031 to the surface waters of the Commonwealth. This administrative regulation also establishes that all surface waters shall be subject to the general criteria specified in 401 KAR 10:031, Secti on 2. Section 1. Scope of Designation. (1) All surface waters of the commonwealth listed in this administrative regulation shall be designated for all legitimate uses contained in KRS 224.70 -100(1) : (a) Except as specified in 401 KAR 10:031, Sections 5 and 8[ ,] and listed in Tables B and C of this administrative regulation; or (b) Unless[ until] redesignated in accordance with the procedures established in Section 2 of this administrative regulation and listed in Table D of this administrative regulation .

(b) Before redesignating a surface water, the cabinet shall provide notice and an opportunity for a public hearing. (2) In redesignating a surface water, the cabinet shall ensure that its water quality standards provide for the[ attainment an d] maintenance of downstream [the] water quality and do not preclude the attainment of designated uses [standards ] of downstream surface waters. (3) A designated use shall not be removed for a surface water if: (a) That use is an existing use; or (b) The use may be attained by implementing effluent limitations required under Sections 301(b) and 306 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1311(b) and 1316, and by implementing cost - effective best management practices for nonpoint source control. (4) If a surface water is designated for a use that is not an existing use, the cabinet shall redesignate the surface water upon demonstration and consistent with 40 C.F.R. 131.10(g) that the designated use is unattainable because: (a) Naturally occurring pollutant concen trations prevent the attainment of the use; (b) Natural, ephemeral, intermittent, or low flow conditions or water levels prevent the attainment of the use, unless these conditions may be compensated for by the discharge of sufficient volume of effluent di scharges; (c) Human caused conditions or sources of pollution prevent the attainment of the use and cannot be remedied or would cause more environmental damage to correct than to leave in place; (d) Dams, diversions, or other types of hydrologic modifica tions preclude the attainment of the use, and it is not feasible to restore the surface water to its original condition or to operate the modification in a way that would result in the attainment of the use; (e) Physical conditions related to the natural features of the surface water, but unrelated to water quality, preclude attainment of the aquatic life use, such as the lack of a proper substrate, cover, flow, depth, pools, or riffles; or (f) Controls more stringent than those required by Sections 301(b ) and 306 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1311(b) and 1316, would result in substantial and widespread economic and social impact as determined by : 1.

Catalfo, Internal Pol icy Analyst, RPPS, Division of Water, 3rd Floor, 300 Sower Boulevard, Frankfort, Kentucky 40601, phone (502) 564 9003, email water@ky.gov IMPACT ANALYSIS AND TIERING STATEMENT Contact Pe rson: Carole J. Catalfo (1) Provide a brief summary of: VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 198 (a) What this administrative regulation does: This administrative regulation lists the types of designated uses for surface waters of the Commonwealth, provides and describes the process of redesign ation of surface waters, and lists designated uses for specific surface waters of the Commonwealth that have been assigned. (b) The necessity of this administrative regulation: This administrative regulation is necessary to inform the public of the types of and provisions for redesignation of, and lists the designated uses assigned, to surface waters of the Commonwealth. The list of designated uses is a reference tool necessary for the public to identify which designated uses apply to specific surface wate rs of the Commonwealth. Additionally, in order for Kentucky to maintain its delegation authority over the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit program, the Clean Water Act requires that Kentucky review its water quality standards every t hree years (known as the \"Triennial Review\") and comply with the programmatic requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 131, including implementing the antidegradation policy. (c) How this administrative regulation conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes : KRS 224.10 -100 requires the cabinet to develop and conduct a comprehensive program for the management of water resources and to provide for the prevention, abatement, and control of pollution. This administrative regulation and 401 KAR 10:001, 10:029, 10 :030, and 10:031 establish procedures to protect the surface waters of the Commonwealth, and thus protect water resources. This administrative regulation applies the designated uses described in 401 KAR 10:031 to the surface waters of the Commonwealth. Thi s administrative regulation also establishes that all surface waters shall be subject to the general criteria specified in 401 KAR 10:031, Section 2. Additionally, in order for Kentucky to maintain its delegation authority over the National Pollution Disch arge Elimination System permit program, the Clean Water Act requires that Kentucky review its water quality standards every three years (known as the \"Triennial Review\") and comply with the programmatic requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 131, including impleme nting the antidegradation policy. (d) How this administrative regulation currently assists or will assist in the effective administration of the statutes: This administrative regulation assists in the administration of the statutes by providing for redesi gnation of surface waters and by listing those uses assigned to specific waters of the Commonwealth. This enables the public to know which regulatory criteria relate to specific waters and supports compliance with the administrative regulations. (2) If th is is an amendment to an existing administrative regulation, provide a brief summary of: (a) How the amendment will change this existing administrative regulation: This amendment revises Sections 2(1)(a) and 2(4) to be consistent with 40 C.F.R. 131.10(g). The amendment adds a requirement for re -examination of waters with uses removed every three years in Section 2(5) to be consistent with 40 C.F.R. 131.20(a). This amendment adds designated uses for 57 basins, streams, or stream segments. The latter change s are being made pursuant to Section 3(2) of this regulation, and the automatic inclusion clause of 401 KAR 10:031 Section 8(1)(a)3, based on the presence of threatened or endangered species. The amendment revises Table B - Surface Water Intakes for Domest ic Water Supply Use - by updating the table to reflect the current locations of domestic water intakes, removing the \"Description\" column, and adding columns for Wastewater and Public Water System permit identification numbers, as well as location by latit ude and longitude, to more accurately identify intake locations. The amendment revises Table C by adding waterbodies and receiving waters, boundary description, and latitude and longitude, to more accurately identify locations, and removes waters with a re moved use or exception to criteria in a new Table D. Table D also corrects a previous error that references 401 KAR 10:031, Section 2(2) instead of Section 2(3). The amendment adds re -examination of waterbodies that do not include specified uses every 5 ye ars to determine if new information is available, adds references to C.F.R. regarding affirmative findings for redesignation to align with federal requirements, and add alternatives for examining economic and social impacts of unattainable uses. The amend ment newly incorporates by reference the \"Combined Sewer Overflows - Guidance for Financial Capability Assessment and Schedule Development\", EPA, February 1997 which is used to evaluate and consider economics during the process of establishing or revising water quality standards. The amendment also newly incorporates by reference the CSO Control Policy of April 1994 which is used, in part, to develop and update CSO alternatives analyses. The amendment clarifies that documentation listed in Section 3(3) is not required for proposed Outstanding State Resource Waters due to supporting federally -listed threatened or endangered species. Section 1 already specifies the designated uses applicable to all waters, the amendment removes redundancy in Sections 5(2) and 5(3). (b) The necessity of the amendment to this administrative regulation: These amendments are necessary to protect the Commonwealth's Outstanding State Resource Waters. Additionally, in order for Kentucky to maintain its delegation authority over the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit program, the Clean Water Act requires that Kentucky review its water quality standards every three years (known as the \"Triennial Review\") and comply with the programmatic requirements of 40 C.F.R. Par t 131, including implementing the antidegradation policy. (c) How this administrative regulation conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes: KRS 224.10 -100 requires the cabinet to develop and conduct a comprehensive program for the management of water resources and to provide for the prevention, abatement, and control of pollution. This administrative regulation and 401 KAR 10:001, 10:029, 10:030, and 10:031 establish procedures to protect the surface waters of the Commonwealth, and thus protect w ater resources. This administrative regulation applies the designated uses described in 401 KAR 10:031 to the surface waters of the Commonwealth. This administrative regulation also establishes that all surface waters shall be subject to the general criter ia specified in 401 KAR 10:031, Section 2. Additionally, in order for Kentucky to maintain its delegation authority over the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit program, the Clean Water Act requires that Kentucky review its water qualit y standards every three years (known as the \"Triennial Review\") and comply with the programmatic requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 131, including implementing the antidegradation policy. (d) How the amendment will assist in the effective administration of th e statutes: The amendment will assist in effective administration of the statutes by adding designated uses for 57 basins, streams or stream segments, more accurate identification of intake locations, aligning compliance with federal regulations, and incor porating by reference a document used to consider economics during the process of establishing or revising water quality standards. (3) List the type and number of individuals, businesses, organizations, or state and local governments affected by this administrative regulation: This administrative regulation applies to designated uses of the surface waters of the Commonwealth. All individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments that use the Commonwealth's surface waters for residential, commercial, industrial, or recreational purposes could be impacted by this regulation. (4) Provide an analysis of how the entities identified in question (3) will be impacted by either the implementation of this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change, i f it is an amendment, including: (a) List the actions that each of the regulated entities identified in question (3) will have to take to comply with this administrative regulation or amendment: If a regulated entity applies for a KPDES permit for a new o r expanded discharge into s surface water of the commonwealth, or submits an application for the renewal of an existing permit to discharge to a surface water of the commonwealth, the permit conditions may result in additional treatment outlays, training c osts, or operational changes. The VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 199 permit conditions will depend on the nature of the discharge. (b) In complying with this administrative regulation or amendment, how much will it cost each of the entities identified in question (3): The costs to comply w ith this administrative regulation will vary considerably depending on the site location, type of activity, and other factors. (c) As a result of compliance, what benefits will accrue to the entities identified in question (3): Direct and indirect savings may be realized through reduced drinking water treatment costs, maintenance of good agricultural water, maintenance of fisheries, and healthy recreational waters. (5) Provide an estimate of how much it will cost the administrative body to implement this administrative regulation: (a) Initially: This administrative regulation will not result in additional costs. (b) On a continuing basis: This administrative regulation will not result in additional costs. (6) What is the source of the funding to be used for the implementation and enforcement of this administrative regulation: The sources of revenue are a combination of General Funds appropriated by the Kentucky General Assembly, and federal funds from the US EPA. (7) Provide an assessment of whether an increase in fees or funding will be necessary to implement this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change if it is an amendment: An increase in fees will not be necessary to implement these amendments. (8) State whether or not this administrativ e regulation established any fees or directly or indirectly increased any fees: This administrative regulation does not directly or indirectly establish or increase fees. (9) TIERING: Is tiering applied? Yes, tiering is applied in this administrative regu lation. The discharge requirements of 401 KAR 10:031 into a water designated as a cold water aquatic habitat are more stringent that those designated for warm water aquatic habitats. 401 KAR 10:031 also establishes special requirements for any discharge in to a designated OSRW under this regulation. Waters listed in Table B that have a surface water intake are subject to the Domestic Water Supply criteria of 401 KAR 10:031. FISCAL NOTE ON STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (1) What units, parts, or divisions of st ate or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) will be impacted by this administrative regulation? This administrative regulation applies to designated uses of the surface waters of the Commonwealth. All governm ents that use those waters for residential, commercial, industrial, or recreational purposes could be impacted by this regulation. This administrative regulation may affect the wastewater treatment operations of local governments if they discharge into sur face waters of the Commonwealth that have been redesignated by this administrative regulation. (2) Identify each state or federal statute or federal regulation that requires or authorizes the action taken by the administrative regulation. KRS effect of this administrative regula tion on the expenditures and revenues of a state or local government agency (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for the first full year the administrative regulation is to be in effect. (a) How much revenue will this admini strative regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for the first year? This administrative regulation will not generate any revenue. (b) How much revenue will this administrat ive regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for subsequent years?

This administrative regulation will not result in additional costs. (d) How much will it cost to administer this program for subsequent years? This administrative regulation will not result in additional costs. Note: If specif ic dollar estimates cannot be determined, provide a brief narrative to explain the fiscal impact of the administrative regulation. Revenues (+/ -): NA Expenditures (+/ -): NA Other Explanation: This amended administrative regulation establishes instream u ses designated by the cabinet that, in combination with the criteria of 401 KAR 10:031, provide for the protection of water quality in the Commonwealth. Local governments will be required to discharge effluents that assure attainment of the receiving surfa ce water's designated uses. Criteria that apply to these redesignations will be implemented when a permit is issued. Local governments withdrawing drinking water from these waters may have lower treatment costs because of lower pollutant loads. Additional costs may be incurred where criteria are more stringent or when new criteria are established, and fewer costs may be incurred when criteria are less stringent or have been eliminated. FEDERAL MANDATE ANALYSIS COMPARISON 1. Federal statute or regulation c onstituting the federal mandate. There is no federal mandate to implement a water pollution control program. For Kentucky to maintain its delegation authority over the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit program, the Clean Water Act requ ires that Kentucky review its water quality standards every three years (known as the \"Triennial Review\") and comply with the programmatic requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 131, including implementing the antidegradation policy. 2. uniform standards contained in the federal mandate. 40 C.F.R. Part 131, 16 Will this administrative regulation impose stricter requirements, or additional or different responsibilities or requirements than those required by the federal mandate? No. 5. Justification for the imposition of the stri cter standard, or additional or different responsibilities or requirements. There are no stricter standards or additional or different responsibilities or requirements. ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT CABINET Department for Environmental Protection Division of Wa ter (Amendment) 401 KAR 10:029. General provisions. RELATES TO: KRS KRS 224.10 - 100 requires the cabinet to develop and conduct a comprehensive program for the management of water resources and to provide for the prevention, abatement, and control of water pollution. This administrative regulation and 401 KAR 10:001, 10:026, 10:030, and 10:031 establish procedures to protect the surface waters of the commonwealth, and thus protect water resources. This VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 200 administrative regulation establishes the commonwealth's surface water antidegradation policy, provides for wi thdrawals of waters not meeting water quality standards, and addresses sample collection and analytical methodology and mixing zones.

ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT CABINET Department for Environmental Protection Division of Water (Amendment) 401 KAR 10:030. Antidegradation policy implementation methodology. RELATES 224.10 - 100 requires the cabinet to develop and conduct a compr ehensive program for the management of water resources and to provide for the prevention, abatement, and control of all water pollution. KRS 224.70 -100 authorizes the policy of the commonwealth to conserve its waters for legitimate uses, safeguard from pol lution the uncontaminated waters of the commonwealth, prevent the creation of any new pollution in the waters of the commonwealth, and abate any existing pollution. This administrative regulation and 401 KAR 10:001, 10:026, 10:029, and 10:031 establish pro cedures to protect the surface waters of the Commonwealth, and thus protect water resources. This administrative regulation establishes a methodology to implement the antidegradation policy contained in 401 KAR 10:029 by establishing procedures to control water pollution in waters affected by that policy. Section 1. Categorization and Implementation. The antidegradation procedures established in this administrative regulation shall not preempt the power or authority of a local government to provide by ord inance for a higher level of protection through antidegradation implementation for a discharger located within that local government's jurisdiction to a surface water of the commonwealth. The procedures established in this section shall govern implementati on of the antidegradation policy of 401 KAR 10:029, Section 1, for a point source discharge. Surface waters shall be placed into one (1) of four (4) categories listed in this section and each category shall have a corresponding implementation procedure.

REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS AND TIERING STATEMENT Contact Person: Carole J. Catalfo (1) Provide a brief summary of: (a) What this administrative regulation does: This administrative regulation implements the ant idegradation policy of 401 KAR 10:029 by establishing procedures to control water pollution in waters affected by that policy. This administrative regulation provides categorization criteria, lists many surface waters assigned to specific categories, and p rovides for recategorization of water. (b) The necessity of this administrative regulation: This administrative regulation is necessary to manage water resources and to provide for the prevention, abatement, and control of water pollution. (c) How this a dministrative regulation conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes: KRS 224.10 -100 requires the cabinet to develop and conduct a comprehensive program for the management of water resources and to provide for the prevention, abatement, and control of all water pollution. KRS 224.70 -100 authorizes the policy of the commonwealth to conserve its waters for legitimate uses, safeguard from pollution the uncontaminated waters of the commonwealth, prevent the creation of any new pollution in the waters of the commonwealth, and abate any existing pollution. This administrative regulation and 401 KAR 10:001, 10:026, 10:029, and 10:031 establish procedures to protect the surface waters of the Commonwealth, and thus protect water resources. This administrative regulation establishes a methodology to implement the antidegradation policy contained in 401 KAR 10:029 by establishing procedures to control water pollution in waters affected by that policy. (d) How this administrative regulation currently assists or will assist in the effective administration of the statutes: This administrative regulation implements the antidegradation policy to protect surface waters of the Commonwealth required by the authorizing statutes. (2) If this is an amendment to an existin g administrative regulation, provide a brief summary of: (a) How the amendment will change this existing administrative regulation: This amendment revises Table 1 to include waterbodies and receiving waters, latitude and longitude instead of river miles, and boundary descriptions for more accurate location of streams VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 221 and stream segments. Table 2 was similarly revised. This amendment includes 29 additional streams or stream segments comprising approximately 114.35 miles of surface waters newly categorized a s Exceptional Waters as a result of routine watershed monitoring and investigations of potential waters affected by permitted activities since the revisions to this administrative regulation in 2015. The amendment also clarifies that surface waters that do not fully support any designated use shall be categorized as impaired, except for outstanding or exceptional waters, or those that are impaired only for mercury or methylmercury as it applies to fish consumption. (b) The necessity of the amendment to thi s administrative regulation: The amendment is necessary to provide more accurate location information in the form of latitude and longitude, add waters that meet the criteria for Exceptional Waters since the 2015 revisions to this administrative regulation , and to clarify that a surface water shall not be categorized as impaired for the purposes of this administrative regulation if it is listed as an OSRW or Exceptional Water. (c) How this administrative regulation conforms to the content of the authorizin g statutes: KRS 224.10 -100 requires the cabinet to develop and conduct a comprehensive program for the management of water resources and to provide for the prevention, abatement, and control of all water pollution. KRS 224.70 -100 authorizes the policy of t he commonwealth to conserve its waters for legitimate uses, safeguard from pollution the uncontaminated waters of the commonwealth, prevent the creation of any new pollution in the waters of the commonwealth, and abate any existing pollution. This administ rative regulation and 401 KAR 10:001, 10:026, 10:029, and 10:031 establish procedures to protect the surface waters of the Commonwealth, and thus protect water resources. This administrative regulation establishes a methodology to implement the antidegrada tion policy contained in 401 KAR 10:029 by establishing procedures to control water pollution in waters affected by that policy. (d) How the amendment will assist in the effective administration of the statutes: The amendments will assist in the administr ation of the statutes by listing surface waters newly categorized as Exceptional, and provide clarification that OSRWs and Exceptional Waters shall not be categorized as impaired for the purposes of this administrative regulation. (3) List the type and nu mber of individuals, businesses, organizations, or state and local governments affected by this administrative regulation: Individuals, businesses, organizations, and state and local governments that will have new or expanded wastewater discharges into str eams could be affected by either stricter discharge limits or the requirement to perform an alternatives analysis and socioeconomic demonstration. (4) Provide an analysis of how the entities identified in question (3) will be impacted by either the implem entation of this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change, if it is an amendment, including: (a) List the actions that each of the regulated entities identified in question (3) will have to take to comply with this administrative regulation or amendment: Potential permit limits imposed on new or expanded point source discharges could result in additional treatment outlays, training costs, or operational changes. New or expanded point source dischargers covered under the KPDES permitting system m ay incur costs of alternatives, pollution prevention, and socioeconomic analyses. These requirements already exist in state and federal law. (b) In complying with this administrative regulation or amendment, how much will it cost each of the entities iden tified in question (3): The costs to comply with this administrative regulation will vary considerably depending on the location, type of activity, and other factors. Costs cannot be determined until an applicant applies for a KPDES permit for a new or exp anded discharge which is regulated under 401 KAR Chapter 5. (c) As a result of compliance, what benefits will accrue to the entities identified in question (3): Direct and indirect savings will be realized through reduced drinking water treatment costs, maintenance of good agricultural water and fisheries, and healthy recreational waters. (5) Provide an estimate of how much it will cost the administrative body to implement this administrative regulation: (a) Initially: The amendment to this administrativ e regulation will not result in additional costs. (b) On a continuing basis: The amendment to this administrative regulation will not result in additional costs. (6) What is the source of the funding to be used for the implementation and enforcement of t his administrative regulation: Funding sources are a combination of general funds appropriated by the Kentucky General Assembly and federal funds from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. (7) Provide an assessment of whether an increase in fees or funding will be necessary to implement this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change if it is an amendment: The amendments to this administrative regulation will not require a change in funding. (8) State whether or not this administrative regula tion established any fees or directly or indirectly increased any fees: This administrative regulation does not establish any fees directly or indirectly. (9) TIERING: Is tiering applied? Yes, tiering is applied, however, the amendments do not change how the regulation is tiered. This regulation tiers the requirements of the antidegradation policy based on the water quality where the applicant proposed to discharge. The tiers are based on whether the receiving waters are categorized as Exceptional Waters, Outstanding National Resource Waters, High Quality Waters, or Impaired Waters. FISCAL NOTE ON STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (1) What units, parts, or divisions of state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) will be impacted by this administrative regulation? The amendments may affect the wastewater treatment divisions of local government if they have new or expanded discharges into Exceptional Waters. (2) Identify each state or federal statute or federal reg ulation that requires or authorizes the action taken by the the effect of this administrative regulation on the expenditures and revenues of a state or local government agency (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school di stricts) for the first full year the administrative regulation is to be in effect. (a) How much revenue will this administrative regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for the first year? This administrative regulation will not generate any revenue. (b) How much revenue will this administrative regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for subse quent years? This administrative regulation will not generate any revenue. (c) How much will it cost to administer this program for the first year? This administrative regulation will not result in additional costs. (d) How much will it cost to administe r this program for subsequent years? This administrative regulation will not result in additional costs. Note: If specific dollar estimates cannot be determined, provide a brief narrative to explain the fiscal impact of the administrative regulation. Revenues (+/ -): NA Expenditures (+/ -): NA Other Explanation: Wastewater treatment costs may increase for those local governments requesting new or expanded discharges into Exceptional Waters. Local governments withdrawing drinking water from these waters ma y have lower treatment costs because the waters should have lower pollutant loads. FEDERAL MANDATE ANALYSIS COMPARISON 1. Federal statute or regulation constituting the federal VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 222 mandate. There is no federal mandate to implement a water pollution control program. For Kentucky to maintain its delegation authority over the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit program, the Clean Water Act requires that Kentucky review its water quality standards every three years (known as the \"Triennial Rev iew\") and comply with the programmatic requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 131, including implementing the antidegradation policy. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provides guidance to the states, but individual decisions regarding water quality program s are left to the states. 2. State compliance Minimum or uniform standards contained in the federal mandate. 40 C.F.R. 130, 131, 16 this administrative regulation impose stricter requirements, or additional or different responsibilities or requirements than those require d by the federal mandate? No. 5. Justification for the imposition of the stricter standard, or additional or different responsibilities or requirements. This administrative regulation does not contain stricter standards or additional or different responsi bilities or requirements. ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT CABINET Department for Environmental Protection Division of Water (Amendment) 401 KAR 10:031. Surface water standards. RELATES TO: KRS -1287 CONFORMITY: KRS 224.10 - 100 requires the cabinet to develop and conduct a comprehensive program for the management of water resources and to provide for the prevention, abatement, and control of water pollution. This administrative regulation and 401 KAR 10:001, 10:026, 10:029, and 10:030 establish procedures to protect the surface waters of the Commonwealth, and thus protect water resources. This adminis trative regulation establishes water quality standards that consist of designated legitimate uses of the surface waters of the Commonwealth and the associated water quality criteria necessary to protect those uses. These water quality criteria [standards ] are minimum requirements that apply to all surface waters in the Commonwealth of Kentucky in order to maintain and protect them for designated uses. These water quality standards are subject to periodic review and revision in accordance with the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 -1387, 40 C.F.R. 131, and KRS Chapter 224. Section 1. Nutrients Criterion. Nutrients shall not be elevated in a surface water to a level that results in a eutrophication problem. Section 2. Minimum Criteria Applicable to All Surface Waters. (1) The minimum water quality criteria established in this administrative regulation shall be applicable to all surface waters including mixing zones, with the exception that toxicity to aquatic life in mixing zones shall be subject to the provisi ons of 401 KAR 10:029, Section 4. Surface waters shall not be aesthetically or otherwise degraded by substances that: (a) Settle to form objectionable deposits; (b) Float as debris, scum, oil, or other matter to form a nuisance; (c) Produce objectionabl e color, odor, taste, or turbidity; (d) Injure or are chronically or acutely toxic to or produce adverse physiological or behavioral responses in humans, animals, fish, and other aquatic life; (e) Produce undesirable aquatic life or result in the dominan ce of nuisance species; or (f) Cause fish flesh tainting.

(a) The criteria are established to protect human health regardi ng the consumption of fish tissue and shall not be exceeded. (b) For those substances associated with a cancer risk, an acceptable risk level of not more than one (1) additional cancer case in a population of 1,000,000 people, or 1 x 10-6 shall be utilize d to establish the allowable concentration. Section 3. Use Designations and Associated Criteria. (1) Surface waters may be designated as having one (1) or more legitimate uses established in 401 KAR 10:026 and associated criteria protective of those uses . Nothing in this administrative regulation shall be construed to prohibit or impair the legitimate beneficial uses of these waters. The criteria in Sections 2, 4, 6, and 7 of this administrative regulation represent minimum conditions necessary to: (a) P rotect surface waters for the indicated designated use; and (b) Protect human health regarding fish consumption. (2) On occasion, surface water quality may be outside of the limits established to protect designated uses because of natural conditions. If this occurs during periods when stream flows are below the flow that is used by the cabinet to establish effluent limitations for wastewater treatment facilities, a discharger shall not be considered a contributor to instream violations of water quality standards, if treatment results in compliance with permit requirements. (3) Stream flows for water quality -based permits. The following stream flows shall be utilized if deriving KPDES permit limitations to protect surface waters for the listed uses and pur poses: (a) Aquatic life protection shall be 7Q 10; (b) Water -based recreation protection shall be 7Q 10; (c) Domestic water supply protection shall be determined at points of withdrawal as: 1. The harmonic mean for cancer -linked substances; and 2. 7Q 10 for noncancer -linked substances; (d) Human health protection regarding fish consumption and for changes in radionuclides shall be the harmonic mean; and (e) Protection of aesthetics shall be 7Q 10.

(b) The necessity of this administrative regulation: This administrative regulation is necessary for the protection of public health, aquatic habitat, and designated uses of the surface waters of the Commonwealth. (c) How this administrative regulation conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes: KRS 224.10 -100 requires the cabinet to develop and conduct a comprehensive program for the management of water resources and to provide for the prevention, abatement, and control of water pollution. This administrative regulation a nd 401 KAR 10:001, 10:026, 10:029, and 10:030 establish procedures to protect the surface waters of the Commonwealth, and thus protect water resources. This administrative regulation establishes water quality standards that consist of designated legitimate uses of the surface waters of the Commonwealth and the associated water quality criteria necessary to protect those uses. These water quality standards are minimum requirements that apply to all surface waters in the Commonwealth of Kentucky in order to m aintain and protect them for designated uses. These water quality standards are subject to periodic review and revision in accordance with the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 -1387, 40 C.F.R. 131, and KRS Chapter 224. (d) How this administrative regulation currently assists or will assist in the effective administration of the statutes: This administrative regulation assists in the administration of the statutes by providing specific criteria and water quality standards for the protection of surface waters of the Commonwealth as required by the authorizing statutes. (2) If this is an amendment to an existing administrative regulation, provide a brief summary of: (a) How the amendment will change this existing administrative regulation: The amendment update s the cadmium aquatic life criteria, establishes aquatic life criteria for carbaryl, establishes aquatic life criteria for selenium in fish tissue for specified fish, and allows application of the Copper Biotic Ligand Model for site - specific copper aquatic life criteria. The amendment removes the surface water temperature guideline table, removes the aquatic life selenium egg/ovary tissue criteria, removes the fecal coliform criteria for the primary contact recreation use, and removes the nitrite -nitrogen h uman health criterion for the main stem of the Ohio River. The amendment corrects Table 1 Chemical Abstracts Service number and formatting errors in hardness -based Warm Water Aquatic Habitat criteria equations, corrects an error for chronic toxicity referr ing to the LC 25 instead of the IC 25, clarifies the protections for OSRWs and clarifies that the human health methylmercury fish or shellfish tissue criteria is based on wet weight . The amendment adds a statement allowing the suspension of PCR and SCR crite ria during CSO events for a specified time and duration, adds compliance schedule availability that aligns with federal NPDES requirements, aligns exceptions to criteria requirements with federal requirements, and updates the Water Quality Standards Handbo ok-Chapter 3 (EPA) to its 2017 version. (b) The necessity of the amendment to this administrative regulation: The amendment is necessary to clarify and update water quality standards, which are minimum requirements that apply to all surface waters in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, in order to maintain and protect them for designated uses . (c) How this administrative regulation conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes: KRS 224.10 -100 requires the cabinet to develop and conduct a comprehensive pro gram for the management of water resources and to provide for the prevention, abatement, and control of water pollution. This administrative regulation and 401 KAR 10:001, 10:026, 10:029, and 10:030 establish procedures to protect the surface waters of the Commonwealth, and thus protect water resources. This administrative regulation establishes water quality standards that consist of designated legitimate uses of the surface waters of the Commonwealth and the associated water quality criteria necessary to protect those uses. These water quality standards are minimum requirements that apply to all surface waters in the Commonwealth of Kentucky in order to maintain and protect them for designated uses. These water quality standards are subject to periodic rev iew and revision in accordance with the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 -1387, 40 C.F.R. 131, and KRS Chapter 224. (d) How the amendment will assist in the effective administration of the statutes: The amendment clarifies and updates water quality standard s, which are minimum requirements that apply to all surface waters in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, in order to maintain and protect them for designated uses . (3) List the type and number of individuals, businesses, organizations, or state and local gover nments affected by this administrative regulation: This administrative regulation applies to the surface waters of the Commonwealth. All individuals, businesses, organizations, and governments that use the Commonwealth's surface waters for residential, com mercial, industrial, or recreational purposes could be impacted by this regulation. (4) Provide an analysis of how the entities identified in question (3) will be impacted by either the implementation of this administrative regulation, if new, or by the c hange, if it is an amendment, including: (a) List the actions that each of the regulated entities identified in question (3) will have to take to comply with this administrative regulation or amendment: If an entity applies for a KPDES permit for a new or expanded discharge into a Surface Water of the Commonwealth, or submits application for the renewal of an existing permit for a discharge to a Surface Water of the Commonwealth, the permit conditions may result in additional treatment outlays, training co sts, or operational changes. The permit conditions will depend on the nature of the discharge. (b) In complying with this administrative regulation or amendment, how much will it cost each of the entities identified in question (3): The costs to comply wi th this administrative regulation vary considerably depending on the site location, type of activity, and other factors. Therefore, it is not possible to quantify costs to implement this administrative regulation. (c) As a result of compliance, what benef its will accrue to the entities identified in question (3): Fewer costs may be incurred when criteria are less stringent. Direct and indirect savings will be realized through reduced drinking water treatment costs, maintenance of good agricultural water an d fisheries, and healthy recreational waters. (5) Provide an estimate of how much it will cost the administrative body to implement this administrative regulation: (a) Initially: The amendments to this administrative regulation will not result in additio nal costs. (b) On a continuing basis: The amendments to this administrative regulation will not result in additional costs. (6) What is the source of the funding to be used for the implementation and enforcement of this administrative regulation: The sou rces of funding are a combination of general funds appropriated by the Kentucky General Assembly and federal funds from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. (7) Provide an assessment of whether an increase in fees or funding will be necessary to impl ement this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change if it is an amendment: The amendments to this administrative regulation will not require an increase in fees or funding. (8) State whether or not this administrative regulation established any fees or directly or indirectly increased any fees: This administrative regulation does not establish fees or directly or indirectly. (9) TIERING: Is tiering applied? Yes, tiering is applied in this administrative regulation. Water quality standards and a ssociated criteria vary based on the designated use of the surface water. FISCAL NOTE ON STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT (1) What units, parts, or divisions of state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) will be impacted by this administrative regulation? This administrative regulation will affect the wastewater treatment operations of local government if it applies for a KPDES permit for a new or expanded discharge into a Surface Water of the Commonwealth, or submits an application for the renewal of an existing permit for a discharge to a Surface Water of the Commonwealth. VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 230 (2) Identify each state or federal statute or federal regulation that requires or authorizes the action taken by the Estimate the effect of this admin istrative regulation on the expenditures and revenues of a state or local government agency (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for the first full year the administrative regulation is to be in effect. (a) How much revenue will this administrative regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for the first year? This administrative regulation will not generate any revenue. (b) How much revenue will this administrative regulation generate for the state or local government (including cities, counties, fire departments, or school districts) for subsequent years? This administrative regulation will not generate any revenue. (c) How much will it cost to administer this program for the first year? This administrative regulation will not result in additional costs. (d) How much will it cost to administer this program for subsequent years? This administrative regulation will not result in additional costs. Note: If specific dollar estimates cannot be determined, provide a brief narrative to explain the fiscal impact of the administrative regulation. Revenues (+/ -): NA Expenditures (+/ -): NA Other Explanation: Wastewater treatment costs may increase for those local governments that have discharges into surface waters of the Commonwealth. Local governments withdrawing drinking water from these waters may have lower treatment costs because these waters should have lower pollutant loads. FEDERAL MANDATE ANAL YSIS COMPARISON 1. Federal statute or regulation constituting the federal mandate. There is no federal mandate to implement a water pollution control program. For Kentucky to maintain its delegation authority over the National Pollution Discharge Elimina tion System permit program, the Clean Water Act requires that Kentucky review its water quality standards every three years (known as the \"Triennial Review\") and comply with the programmatic requirements of 40 C.F.R. Part 131, including the requirement for reviewing water quality criteria for appropriate revisions. 2. State compliance Minimum or uniform standards contained in the federal mandate. 40 C.F.R. Part 131, 16 4. Will this administrative regulation impose stricter requirements, or additional or different responsibilities or requirements than th ose required by the federal mandate? No. 5. Justification for the imposition of the stricter standard, or additional or different responsibilities or requirements. This administrative regulation does not impose stricter or additional or different responsi bilities or requirements.

(6) If the employees to be trained have no colle ctive bargaining agent, an apprenticeship program may be proposed for registration by an employer or group of employers. Section 3. The standards established in this section shall apply to an apprenticeship program. (1) The program shall be an organized, written plan embodying the terms and conditions of qualification, recruitment, selection, employment, training, and supervision of one (1) or more apprentices in an apprenticeable occupation and subscribed to by a sponsor who has undertaken to carry out t he apprentice training program. (2) The standards shall contain the equal opportunity pledge prescribed in the Kentucky State Plan for equal employment opportunity in apprenticeship and, if applicable, an affirmative action plan and a selection method in accordance with the Kentucky State Plan for equal employment opportunity in apprenticeship, and provisions concerning the following: (a) The employment and training of the apprentice in a skilled occupation; (b) A term of apprenticeship, which for an ind ividual apprentice shall be measured either through the completion of the business or industry standard for on -the-job learning (at least 2,000 hours) (time -based approach), the attainment of competency (competency -based approach), or a blend of the time -based and competency -based approaches (hybrid approach). 1. The time -based approach measures skill acquisition through the individual apprentice's completion of at least 2,000 hours of on - the-job learning as described in a work process schedule. 2. The co mpetency -based approach measures skill acquisition through the individual apprentice's successful demonstration of acquired skills and knowledge, throughout the apprenticeship program and as verified by the program sponsor. Programs utilizing this approach shall still require apprentices to complete a paid[an] on -the-job learning component of registered apprenticeship. The program standards shall address how on -the- job learning will be integrated into the program, describe competencies, and identify an appr opriate means of testing and evaluation for the competencies. 3. The hybrid approach measures the individual apprentice's skill acquisition through a combination of specified minimum number of hours of on -the-job learning and the successful demonstration of competency as described in a work process schedule. 4. The determination of the appropriate approach for the program standards is made by the program sponsor, subject to approval by the registration agency of the determination as appropriate to the app renticeable occupation for which the program standards are registered; (c) An outline of the work processes in which the apprentice will receive supervised work experience and training on the job, and the allocation of the approximate time to be spent in each major process; (d) Provision for organized related and supplemental instruction in technical subjects related to the occupation. A minimum of 144 hours for each year of apprenticeship shall be required. This instruction in technical subjects may be VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 260 accomplished through teaching modalities [media ] such as classroom, occupational, or industry courses, electronic media, or other instruction approved by the registration agency , or a combination thereof . Every apprenticeship instructor shall: 1. Meet the s tate Department of Education's requirements for a vocational -technical instructor in the state of registration, or be a subject matter expert, which is an individual, such as a journeyworker, who is recognized within a business or [an] industry as having ex pertise in a specific occupation; and 2. Demonstrate mastery [Have training ] in teaching techniques and adult learning styles prior to providing [, which may occur before or after the apprenticeship instructor has started to provide ] the related technical i nstruction; (e) A progressively increasing schedule of wages to be paid the apprentice consistent with the skill acquired and whether the required school time shall be compensated. The entry wage shall not be less than forty (40) percent of the establishe d journeyworker [journeyman ] rate or not less than the minimum wage prescribed by federal or state law, whichever is greater. On projects where the wage rate has been established by law, the apprentice's rate of pay shall be based upon the established journ eyworker [journeyman ] rate; (f) Periodic review and evaluation of the apprentice's progress in job performance and related instruction and maintenance of appropriate progress records; (g) The ratio of apprentices shall be one apprentice to one journeywork er. In the event that an apprentice has completed 2.000 hours of on -the-job training, the apprentice may be permitted to work alone and a second apprentice may be added to the 1:1 ratio. An apprentice sponsor or an employer may request in writing to modify the ratio in a medium or low risk occupation, as those terms are defined by the United States Occupational Safety Health Administration. The Commissioner will review the request, and respond within ninety (90) days of receipt of the request. In evaluating any such request, the Commissioner may modify a ratio upon a determination that the new ratio: 1. Will not endanger the safety of apprentices or the journeyworker; and 2. Will not materially impair the quality of training. The decision to authorize the modification of the ratio in medium and low risk occupations rests solely within the discretion of the Commissioner. There is no right to appeal any denial of a request to modify the ratio. [to journeymen consistent with proper supervision, training, and co ntinuity of employment, and applicable provisions in collective bargaining agreements, but in a ratio of not more than one (1) apprentice for the first journeyman, and one (1) apprentice for each additional three (3) journeymen; unless approval is granted by the supervisor in cooperation with the commissioner and Apprenticeship and Training Council ]; (h) A probationary period of reasonable duration in relation to the full apprenticeship term, during which the apprenticeship agreement may be terminated by e ither party, with full credit for this period toward completion of apprenticeship. The probationary period shall not exceed twenty -five (25) percent of the term of the apprenticeship or one (1) year, whichever is shorter; (i) Adequate and safe equipment a nd facilities for training and supervision, and safety training for apprentices on the job and in related instruction; (j) Grant of advance standing or credit , up to fifty (50) percent, for previously acquired experience, training skills, or aptitude for all applicants equally, with commensurate wages for any accorded progression step; (k) The transfer of an apprentice between apprenticeship programs and within an apprenticeship program shall be based on agreement between the apprentice and the affected j oint apprenticeship committees or nonjoint apprenticeship program sponsors, and shall comply with the following requirements: 1. The transferring apprentice shall be provided a transcript of related instruction and on -the-job learning by the joint apprent iceship committee or nonjoint apprenticeship program sponsor; 2. Transfer shall be to the same occupation; and 3. A new apprenticeship agreement shall be executed when the transfer occurs between program sponsors; (l) Assurance of qualified training per sonnel and adequate supervision on the job; (m) The placement of an apprentice under an apprenticeship agreement as required by KRS Chapter 343 and 803 KAR Chapter 1.

CONTACT PERSON: Lana Gordon, Commissioner, 275 E. Main Street, 2nd Floor, Frankfort, Kentucky 40621, email lana.gordon@ky.gov . REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS AND TIERING STATEMENT Contact person: Lana Gordon (1) Provide a brief summary of: (a) What this administrative regulation does: Promulgates administrative regulations to carr y out the provisions and purposes of KRS Chapter 343. This administrative regulation establishes standards required by 29 C.F.R. Parts 29 and 30 to safeguard the welfare of apprentices, promote apprenticeship opportunities, and to extend the application of those standards by prescribing policies and procedures concerning the registration of acceptable apprenticeship programs with the Office of Employer and Apprenticeship Services, Kentucky Registered Apprenticeship Program. These regulations cover the regis tration, programmatic review, cancellation, and deregistration of apprenticeship programs and of apprenticeship agreements. (b) The necessity of this administrative regulation: The State Apprenticeship Agency must submit a State apprenticeship law, whethe r instituted through statute, Executive Order, regulation, or other means, that conforms to the requirements of 29 C.F.R. parts 29 and 30. (c) How this administrative regulation conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes: The regulations are bein g modified to comply with the Governor's Executive Order 2018 -586 transitioning the apprenticeship program from the Labor Cabinet to the Education and Workforce Development Cabinet. (d) How this administrative regulation currently assists or will assist i n the effective administration of the statutes: The regulation assists in the effective administration of the apprenticeship program by setting forth the controlling administrative processes that enable compliance with the federal regulations found at 29 C.F.R. Parts 29 and 30. It sets forth the specifics on how the apprenticeship program is to be administered within the Education and Workforce Development Cabinet. (2) If this is an amendment to an existing administrative regulation, provide a brief summar y of: (a) How the amendment will change this existing administrative regulation: This amendment names the Commissioner of the Department of Workforce Investment as Chair of the Apprenticeship Council, and modifies the journeyworker to apprentice ratio in line with national standards, as well as safety standards following OSHA. (b) The necessity of the amendment to this administrative regulation: This amendment is necessary to align with the Executive Order and the ratio change is being made to allow great er flexibility by industry in implementing apprenticeship programs while being cognizant of safety requirements and quality training. The change will promote efforts to provide quality training VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 262 for workers and to increase Kentucky's qualified workforce. (c) How the amendment conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes: The amendment conforms to the Executive Order by making changes that reflect the organizational shift from the Labor Cabinet to the Education and Workforce Development Cabinet. Moreo ver, the change to the ratio is consistent with the limits placed by the federal statute. (d) How the amendment will assist in the effective administration of the statutes: As Registered Apprenticeship Coordinators must perform employer apprenticeship pro gram reviews, the regulation ensures that the Office of Apprenticeship and Employer Services is adhering to objective, measurable processes set forth by the law and regulations. In the absence of these guiding documents, reviews assume a subjective tone an d diminish impartiality. (3) List the type and number of individuals, businesses, organizations, or state and local governments affected by this administrative regulation: There are 280 businesses and nearly 4,000 apprentices participating in the program. (4) Provide an analysis of how the entities identified in the previous question will be impacted by either the implementation of this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change, if it is an amendment, including: (a) List the actions each of the regulated entities have to take to comply with this regulation or amendment: Businesses must adhere to the journeyworker to apprentice ratios for safety and training purposes. Businesses and the Registered Apprenticeship Program Coordinators must assess r atios for compliance. If a business exceeds the ratios, they must be willing to either hire additional journeyworkers, or limit the number of apprentices working at a site until they conform to the ratio. (b) In complying with this administrative regulati on or amendment, how much will it cost each of the entities: The cost is difficult to assess due to the sheer volume of occupations, in excess of 1,300. (c) As a result of compliance, what benefits will accrue to the entities: Continuity of the Registered Apprenticeship Programs as specified by the U.S. Department of Labor. After five years of investment in the program, research demonstrates that the return on investment is $1.53 to every $1.00 invested. (5) Provide an estimate of how much it will cost th e administrative body to implement this administrative regulation: (a) Initially: There is no cost initially to implement this administrative regulation. (b) On a continuing basis: There is no cost on a continuing basis. (6) What is the source of the fu nding to be used for the implementation and enforcement of this administrative regulation: The program is funded both by general state funds and federal funding. (7) Provide an assessment of whether an increase in fees or funding will be necessary to impl ement this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change if it is an amendment: These regulations have been in effect and these changes will only have a negligible increase in costs that should be able to be handled by the current administrative staf f. (8) State whether or not this administrative regulation established any fees or directly or indirectly increased any fees: The amendment to this regulation does not establish any fees or directly or indirectly increase any fees. (9) TIERING: Is tierin g applied? The amendment will be applied uniformly to all employers with apprenticeship programs and tiering is not applicable.

Othe r Explanation: NA PUBLIC PROTECTION CABINET Department Of Insurance (Amendment) 806 KAR 13:120. Workers' 304.2 - 110 authorizes the commissioner to make reasonable administrative regulations necessary for or as an aid to the effectuation of any provision of the Kentucky Insurance Code, KRS 304.1 -010. KRS 304.13 -410 requi res the commissioner to promulgate administrative regulations concerning calculations for premium reductions for deductible workers' compensation insurance policies. This administrative regulation establishes the method of calculating premium discount and premium rates [reductions ] for workers' compensation insurance policies with deductibles. Section 1. Deductibles and Premium Rates. (1) [Definition. \"Commissioner\" is defined in KRS 304.1 -050(1). Section 2. All ] Insurers authorized to write workers' compen sation insurance in Kentucky[ , when establishing the premium for a workers' compensation insurance policy ] with a deductible ranging from $100 to $10,000 shall use may offer a workers' compensation insurance policy with a deductible over $10,000. (3) An insurer offering a workers' compensation insurance policy with any deductible shall calculate and prepare workers' compensation pr emium and experience modification rates on a net experience basis after application of the deductible amount in accordance with KRS 304.13 -410(3). Section 2. Scope. [Section 3. Application of this Administrative Regulation. ](1) General. (a) This adminis trative regulation shall apply to all insurers and licensed advisory organizations introducing or revising workers' compensation insurance deductible discounts for policies[ with deductibles of $100 to $10,000 or their application in Kentucky ]. (b) A licen sed advisory organization filing shall be self -VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 263 contained and fully documented and shall not simply adopt the deductible plan or factors of another filing. (c) An insurer may: 1. File a self -contained and fully documented deductible discount plan; or 2. Adopt the filed deductible plan and discounts of a licensed advisory organization or another insurer. (2) Form of[ the ]deductible. The deductible discounts shall be determined by the multiplication of the deductible discount factors by the manual premiums . Separate deductible discounts for each deductible option shall be applicable for each hazard group as defined by the advisory organization designated by the commissioner pursuant to KRS 304.13 -167. (3) Experience and retrospective rating. Experience rat ing modifications shall be based on net experience [losses net of deductibles ] and manual premiums less the deductible discount. The parameters of the experience rating plan shall also be adjusted to account for the deductible. (4) Premium discount program s. For insurers that have a premium discount program based on the standard premium of a policy, the deductible discounts shall be applied prior to the application of premium discounts. The deductible discount shall be calculated by multiplying the discount factor by the manual premium. Premium discounts then are calculated based on the standard premium, after deductibles. Section 3[4]. Deductible Discount Provisions. The deductible discount shall recognize the reduction in losses borne by the insurer as a result of the insured's selection of a deductible. The deductible discount shall be calculated based on a loss elimination ratio and shall include the following adjustments: (1) The size of loss distribution including distribution including an analysis o f historical data which shall determine a mathematical function or a discrete empirical distribution table; (2) Recognition of factors which imply additional costs or savings associated with the deductible including: (a) Credit risks that the insured wil l not repay the insurer for the deductible amount; (b) Changes in insurer cash flow: 1. Deductibles paid by an insurer in accordance with KRS 304.13 -400(3)(a) shall be considered a loan, the effects of which may be recognized in the filing; and 2. This factor shall be equal to the amount or proportion of dollars that are eliminated [eliminative ] by the deductible times a reasonable interest rate to account for the loss in investment income (c) Adverse selection and higher levels of risk. 1. Loss elimina tion ratios may be reduced for adverse selection by up to five (5) percent. 2. Filings which include greater reductions shall be clearly supported by actuarial evidence of higher loss ratios by deductible and class to clearly show that the deductible disc ounts are consistently high across classes and time. 3. For the initial filing, data from other states with deductibles may be used to support the selection of this factor; and (3) Recognition that many insurer operating expenses are not reduced by the i ntroduction of deductibles including: (a) Loss adjustment expenses including allocated and unallocated expenses; (b) Overhead expenses; and (c) General expenses including all expenses incurred other than loss adjustment expense, commissions, other acqui sition expenses, premium taxes, licenses, and fees. Section 4[5]. Effect on Rate Making. (1) Data. The designated advisory organization's statistical plan shall include a field indicating the deductible on the policy. Financial data calls shall segregate data by deductible. (2) Gross versus net data. Adjustments to net data shall be made in the rate -making process to account for the presence of deductibles. Losses shall be loaded by the loss elimination ratio, adjusted for anti -selection to a gross basis prior to the rate -making process. The loss elimination ratio and antiselection factor shall be the same as in the current approved filing. (3) Methodology. Rate -making methods shall be modified to account for the presence of deductibles. An adjustment sh all be made in classification rate making for differences in the distribution of exposures by deductible among classes , and [.] in the trending procedure for the presence of a shift in the distribution by deductible.

CONTACT PERSON: Patrick O'Connor II, Deputy Commissioner, Policy, 215 W. Main Street, Frankfort, Kentucky 40602, pho ne 502 -564-6026, fax 502 -564-1453, email patrick.oconnor@ky.gov . REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS AND TIERING STATEMENT Contact person: Patrick O'Connor II (1) Provide a brief summary of: (a) What this administra tive regulation does: The administrative regulation establishes the method for determining premium rates and premium discounts where an insurer or advisory organization issues a workers' compensation insurance policy with a deductible. (b) The necessity o f this administrative regulation: The administrative regulation is necessary to clarify that insurers may offer both large and small workers' compensation deductible policies and the application of \"net experience\" requirements included within KRS 304.13 -410 when calculating the premium rates and discounts for workers' compensation insurance policies with deductibles. (c) How this administrative regulation conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes: The administrative regulation stipulates only th e net experience of an employer policyholder shall be used by the insurer or advisory organization in the calculation and preparation of workers' compensation rates. This conforms to the mandate of KRS 304.13 -410 to use net experience to calculate premium rates for a workers' compensation insurance policy with any size deductible. (d) How this administrative regulation currently assists or will assist in the effective administration of the statutes: The administrative regulation clarifies the application o f the statutory requirements and establishes one standard to be used for all workers' compensation insurance policies with deductibles, regardless of the size of the deductible. (2) If this is an amendment to an existing administrative regulation, provide a brief summary of: (a) How the amendment will change this existing administrative regulation: The amendment clarifies the application of the existing administrative regulation. First, it confirms that insurers may offer both small and large deductibles. Large deductibles in Kentucky, for workers' compensation insurance policies, are generally considered over $10,000. Secondly, it establishes one standard for calculation of premium rates where an employer has selected and paid a deductible. KRS 304.13 -410, although passed by the legislature in conjunction with KRS 304.13 -400 mandating insurers offer small deductible policies, mandates only the use of net VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 264 experience where an employer has selected a policy with a deductible. KRS 304.13 -410 does not different iate between a small and large deductible policy. The amendment clarifies this application and will increase efficient rate making procedures through the elimination of multiple standards. (b) The necessity of the amendment to this administrative regulati on: The amendment is necessary to rectify the application of multiple standards in the calculation of premium rates and discounts including the use of net experience or gross experience varying by the size of the deductible. (c) How the amendment conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes: The amendment adopts the language used in KRS 304.13 -410 to clarify the application of the administrative regulation and the calculation of the premium rates. (d) How the amendment will assist in the effective administration of the statutes: The amendment establishes one standard to be used, net experience, in the calculation of premium rates for workers' compensation insurance policies with a deductible. (3) List the type and number of individuals, businesses, organizations, or state and local governments affected by this administrative regulation: The administrative regulation will impact insurers issuing workers' compensation insurance policies with deductibles in Kentucky, and the employers throughout the Commonwealth that select a large deductible workers' compensation insurance policy. (4) Provide an analysis of how the entities identified in the previous question will be impacted by either the implementation of this administrative regulation, if new, or b y the change, if it is an amendment, including: (a) List the actions each of the regulated entities have to take to comply with this regulation or amendment: The insurers and advisory organizations offering small and large deductible workers' compensation insurance policies in Kentucky will be required to review their filings and ensure net experience is used to calculate premium rates for all workers' compensation insurance policies with a deductible. (b) In complying with this administrative regulation or amendment, how much will it cost each of the entities: The cost of compliance with the amendment is unknown, but any cost will only be expended to make initial changes. (c) As a result of compliance, what benefits will accrue to the entities: The clari fication provided by the amendment allows regulated entities to use one standard to calculate premium rates across all potential deductibles. The use of net experience allows those employers with large deductibles to obtain credit for amounts they have pai d directly for claims and potentially receive premium relief for the selection of a deductible. (5) Provide an estimate of how much it will cost the administrative body to implement this administrative regulation: (a) Initially: The regulated entities wi ll initially be required to adjust their systems to account for the clarification regarding premium rate calculations. The adjustment will permit an easier experience reporting and premium calculation process for the insurers, and eliminate the potential a pplication of multiple rules and standards. (b) On a continuing basis: The regulated entities and employers will share in the benefit of the efficient experience reporting and premium calculation process. (6) What is the source of the funding to be used for the implementation and enforcement of this administrative regulation: No funding is necessary for the implementation and enforcement of this administrative regulation.

This administrative regulation specifies the form to be used for reporting contributions by a contributing organization and incorporates this form by reference. KRS 121.120(4 ) requires the Registry to promulgate administrative regulations and prescribe forms for the making of reports under KRS Chapter 121. The Registry must repeal 32 KAR 1:060 in order to affect the merger of the permanent committee and contributing organizati on reports into one form and thereby reduce the number of forms required for submission.

Revenues (+/ -): Expenditures (+/ -): Other Explanation: FINANCE AND A DMINISTRATION CABINET Department of Revenue (New Administrative Regulation) 103 KAR 16:400. Combined Unitary Kentucky corporation income tax return. KRS 141.202 sets forth the general rules for combined unitary reporting in Kentucky. KRS 131.130(1) authorizes the Department of Revenue to promulgate administrative regulations necessary to administer and enforce Kentucky's tax l aws. KRS 141.050(4) requires the Department of Revenue to promulgate administrative regulations and rules necessary for the proper administration of KRS Chapter 141. This administrative regulation establishes terms and procedures required for the implement ation of combined unitary reporting in KRS 141.202. Section 1. Definitions. (1) \"Combined group\" is defined 141.202 by KRS 141.202(2)(b). (3) \"Designated Filer\" means the taxpayer member of the combined group annually designated per KRS 141.202(9) to file the return. (4) \"Doing business in this state\" is defined by KRS 141.010(7). (5) \"Person\" is defined by KRS by \"Waters -edge basis\" means the corporations required to be included in the combined group pursuant to KRS 141.202(8). Section 2. Fifty (50) Percent Ownership Test. (1) Separate corporations can be part of a combined group only if they meet the fifty (50) percent ownership test in KRS 141.202(2)(a). (a) The fifty (50) percent test is satisfied in the following circumstances: 1. A parent corporation and one (1) or more corporations or chains of corporations which are connected t hrough voting stock ownership with the parent, whether such ownership is direct or indirect, but only if: a. The parent owns more than fifty (50) percent of the outstanding voting stock of at least one (1) corporation, and, if applicable, b. More than fi fty (50) percent of the outstanding voting stock of each of the corporations, other than the parent, is owned by the parent, one (1) or more corporations owned by the parent as described in subparagraph (a) above, or one (1) or more corporations that satis fy the conditions of this subparagraph. 2. Any two (2) or more corporations, if over fifty (50) percent of the outstanding voting stock of each of the corporations is owned, or indirectly owned, by the same person. 3. Any two (2) or more corporations, ov er fifty (50) percent of whose voting stock is cumulatively owned (without regard to the indirect ownership rules described below in paragraph (b)1. by, or for the benefit of, members of the same family. Members of the same family are limited to an individ ual, his or her spouse, parents, brothers or sisters, grandparents, children and grandchildren, and their respective spouses. (b) Except as otherwise provided, voting stock is \"owned\" when title to the stock is directly held or if the voting stock is indirectly owned. The stock attribution rules of Section 318(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 318, shall be used to determine if the voting stock is indirectly owned except when a person has an option to acquire stock or other ownership interests in an entity, the stock or ownership interests are not considered owned by the person unless the department determines it to be necessary to prevent tax avoidance. (c) In determining ownership, effective control over election of the board of directors shall be considered. For example, a group of shareholders acting in concert who collectively own over fifty (50) percent of the voting stock of each of two (2) or more corporations shall be considered to be common owners of more than fifty (50) percent of the vo ting stock of each of those corporations. \"Voting stock\" refers only to those shares of voting stock having the power to elect the corporation's board of directors. If the power otherwise held in corporate stock to vote the membership of the board is trans ferred to another, other than a transfer of proxy only, the holder of that power shall be considered to be the owner of that stock to the exclusion of the transferor of such power. (d) In addition to the tests in paragraph (a), the department may consider any other circumstance that tends to demonstrate that the fifty (50) percent direct or indirect common ownership test VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 287 was met, or was not met. (e) Membership in a combined group shall be treated as terminated in any year, or fraction thereof, in which th e conditions of paragraph (a) are not met, except as follows: 1. When stock of a corporation is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, the membership of a corporation in a combined group shall not be terminated if the requirements of paragraph (a) are again met immediately after the sale, exchange, or disposition. 2. The department may treat the combined group as remaining in place if the conditions of paragraph (a) are again met within a period not to exceed two (2) years. Section 3. Unitary Busine ss Principle. (1) The concept of a Unitary Business. (a) The flow of value to an entity located in this state that comes from being part of a unitary business conducted both within and without this state is what provides the constitutional due process \"de finite link and minimum connection\" necessary for this state to apportion apportionable income of the unitary business, even if that income arises in part from activities conducted outside the state. (b) This sharing or exchange of value may also be descr ibed as requiring that the operation of one part of the business be dependent upon, or contribute to, the operation of another part of the business. Phrased in the disjunctive, the foregoing means that if the activities of one business either contributes t o the activities of another business or are dependent upon the activities of another business, those businesses are part of a unitary business. (2) Constitutional requirement for a Unitary Business. (a) The sharing or exchange of value described in KRS 141.202(2)(f) and subsection 1 that defines the scope of a unitary business requires more than the mere flow of funds arising out of a passive investment or from the financial strength contributed by a distinct business undertaking that has no operational relationship to the unitary business. (b) In this state, the unitary business principle shall be applied to the full extent allowed by the U.S. Constitution. The unitary business principle shall not be applied to result in the combination of business activ ities or entities under circumstances where, if it were adverse to the taxpayer, the combination of such activities or entities would not be allowed by the U.S. Constitution. (3) Separate trades or businesses conducted within a single entity. A single ent ity may have more than one (1) unitary business. In such cases, it is necessary to determine the apportionable income attributable to each separate unitary business as well as its non -apportionable income, which is specifically allocated. The apportionable income of each unitary business is then apportioned by a formula that takes into consideration the in -state and the out -of-state factors that relate to the respective unitary business whose income is being apportioned. (4) Unitary Business unaffected by formal business organization. A unitary business may exist within a single entity or among a group of entities meeting the fifty (50) percent ownership test in KRS 141.202(2)(a) and in Section 2 of this administrative regulation. Section 4. Determination of a Unitary Business. (1) A unitary business is characterized by significant flows of value evidenced by factors such as functional integration, centralization of management, and economies of scale. These factors provide evidence of whether the business activities operate as an integrated whole or exhibit substantial mutual interdependence. Facts suggesting the presence of the factors mentioned above should be analyzed in combination for their cumulative effect and not in isolation. A particular business operation may be suggestive of one (1) or more of the factors mentioned above. (2) Description and illustration of functional integration, centralization of management and economies of scale. (a) Functional integration: Functional integration refers to transfers between, or pooling among, business activities that significantly affect the operation of the business activities. Functional integration includes, but is not limited to, transfers or pooling with respect to the unitary business's products or serv ices, technical information, marketing information, distribution systems, purchasing, and intangibles such as patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets, know -how, formulas, and processes. There is no specific type of functional integrat ion that must be present. The following is a list of examples of business operations that can support the finding of functional integration. The order of the list does not establish a hierarchy of importance. 1. Sales, exchanges, or transfers (collectivel y \"sales\") of products, services, or intangibles between business activities provide evidence of functional integration. The significance of the intercompany sales to the finding of functional integration shall be affected by the character of what is sold or the percentage of total sales or purchases represented by the intercompany sales. For example, sales among entities that are part of a vertically integrated unitary business are indicative of functional integration. Functional integration is not negated by the use of a readily determinable market price to effect the intercompany sales, because such sales can represent an assured market for the seller or an assured source of supply for the purchaser. 2. Common Marketing. The sharing of common marketing features among entities is an indication of functional integration when such marketing results in significant mutual advantage. Common marketing exists when a substantial portion of the entities' products, services, or intangibles are distributed or sold to a common customer, when the entities use a common trade name or other common identification, or when the entities seek to identify themselves to their customers as a member of the same enterprise. The use of a common advertising agency or a commonly owned or controlled in -house advertising office does not by itself establish common marketing that is suggestive of functional integration. Such activity, however, is relevant to determining the existence of economies of scale or centralization of management. 3. Transfer or Pooling of Technical Information or Intellectual Property. Transfers or pooling of technical information or intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, trade secrets, processes or formulas, know -how, research, or development, provide evidence of functional integration when the matter transferred is significant to the businesses' operations. 4. Common Distribution System. Use of a common distribution system by the entities, under which inventory control a nd accounting, storage, trafficking, or transportation are controlled through a common network provides evidence of functional integration. 5. Common Purchasing. Common purchasing of substantial quantities of products, services, or intangibles from the sa me source by the entities, particularly where the purchasing results in significant cost savings or where the products, services or intangibles are not readily available from other sources and are significant to each entity's operations or sales, provides evidence of functional integration. 6. Common or Intercompany Financing. Significant common or intercompany financing, including the guarantee by, or the pledging of the credit of, one (1) or more entities for the benefit of another entity or entities pro vides evidence of functional integration, if the financing activity serves an operational purpose of both borrower and lender. Lending which serves an investment purpose of the lender does not necessarily provide evidence of functional integration. (b) Ce ntralization of Management. Centralization of management exists when directors, officers, or other management employees jointly participate in the management decisions that affect the respective business activities and that may also operate to the benefit of the entire economic enterprise. Centralization of management can exist whether the centralization is effected from a parent entity to a subsidiary entity, from a subsidiary entity to a parent entity, from one (1) subsidiary entity to another, from one ( 1) division within a single entity to another division within an entity, or from any combination of the foregoing. Centralization of management may exist even when day -to-day management responsibility and accountability has been decentralized, so long as the management has an ongoing operational role with respect VOLUME 46, NUMBER 1 - JULY 1, 2019 288 to the business activities. An operational role can be effected through mandates, consensus building, or an overall operational strategy of the business, or any other mechanism that establishes joint management. 1. Facts Providing Evidence of Centralization of Management. Evidence of centralization of management is provided when common officers participate in the decisions relating to the business operations of the different segments. Centralizatio n of management may exist when management shares or applies knowledge and expertise among the parts of the business. Existence of common officers and directors, while relevant to a showing of centralization of management, does not alone provide evidence of centralization of management. Common officers are more likely to provide evidence of centralization of management than are common directors. 2. Stewardship Distinguished. Centralized efforts to fulfill stewardship oversight are not evidence of centraliza tion of management. Stewardship oversight consists of those activities that any owner would take to review the performance of or safeguard an investment. Stewardship oversight is distinguished from those activities that an owner may take to enhance value b y integrating one (1) or more significant operating aspects of one business activity with the other business activities of the owner. For example, implementing reporting requirements or mere approval of capital expenditures may evidence only stewardship ov ersight. (c) Economies of Scale. Economies of scale refer to a relation among and between business activities resulting in a significant decrease in the average per unit cost of operational or administrative functions due to the increase in operational si ze. Economies of scale may exist from the inherent cost savings that arise from the presence of functional integration or centralization of management. The following are examples of business operations that can support the finding of economies of scale. Th e order of the list does not establish a hierarchy of importance. 1. Centralized Purchasing. Centralized purchasing designed to achieve savings due to the volume of purchases, the timing of purchases, or the interchangeability of purchased items among the parts of the business engaging in the purchasing provides evidence of economies of scale. 2. Centralized Administrative Functions. The performance of traditional corporate administrative functions in common, such as legal services, payroll services, pens ion and other employee benefit administration, among the parts of the business may result in some degree of economies of scale. An entity that secures savings in the performance of corporate administrative services due to its affiliation with other entitie s that it would not otherwise reasonably be able to secure on its own because of its size, financial resources, or available market, provides evidence of economies of scale. Section 5. Indicators of a Unitary Business. (1) same type of business. Business activities that are in the same general line of business generally constitute a single unitary business, as, for example, a multistate grocery chain. (2) Steps in a vertical process. Business activities that are part of different steps in a vertically st ructured business almost always constitute a single unitary business. For example, a business engaged in the exploration, development, extraction, and processing of a natural resource and the subsequent sale of a product based upon the extracted natural re source, is engaged in a single unitary business, regardless of the fact that the various steps in the process are operated substantially independently of each other with only general supervision from the business's executive offices. (3) Strong centralize d management. Business activities which might otherwise be considered as part of more than one (1) unitary business may constitute one (1) unitary business when there is a strong central management, coupled with the existence of centralized departments for such functions as financing, advertising, research, or purchasing. Strong centralized management exists when a central manager or group of managers makes substantially all of the operational decisions of the business. For example, some businesses conducti ng diverse lines of business may properly be considered as engaged in only one (1) unitary business when the central executive officers are actively involved in the operations of the various business activities and there are centralized offices which perfo rm for the business activities the normal matters which a truly independent business would perform for itself, such as personnel, purchasing, advertising, or financing. Section 6. Taxable Year of the Combined Group. (1) The combined group's taxable year is determined as follows: (a) If two (2) or more members of a group file a federal consolidated return, the combined group's taxable year is the taxable year of the federal consolidated group; or (b) In all other cases, the taxable year is the taxable ye ar of the designated filer.

REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS AND TIERING STATEMENT Contact person: Patrick O'Connor II (1) Provide a brief summary of: (a) What this administrative regulation does: The administrative regulation elaborates on the required disclosures included in the corporate governance annual disclosure form, and incorporates the actual form to be submitted by insurers and i nsurance groups to the Department. (b) The necessity of this administrative regulation: The administrative regulation is required by 19 RS HB 220 and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\"NAIC\") as a department accreditation standard. It i s also necessary to elaborate on the corporate governance annual disclosure requirements, and provide an actual form to be used by reporting entities. (c) How this administrative regulation conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes: The administ rative regulation elaborates on the required board of director and management committee reporting requirements, and it incorporates a form to be used with the content as dictated by the authorizing statute. (d) How this administrative regulation currently assists or will assist in the effective administration of the statutes: The administrative regulation provides additional reporting details and the actual form to simplify the reporting process and diminish chances of errors. (2) If this is an amendment to an existing administrative regulation, provide a brief summary of: (a) How the amendment will change this existing administrative regulation: This is a new administrative regulation. (b) The necessity of the amendment to this administrative regulation : This is a new administrative regulation. (c) How the amendment conforms to the content of the authorizing statutes: This is a new administrative regulation. (d) How the amendment will assist in the effective administration of the statutes: This is a ne w administrative regulation. (3) List the type and number of individuals, businesses, organizations, or state and local governments affected by this administrative regulation: The administrative regulation will impact domestic insurers. (4) Provide an an alysis of how the entities identified in the previous question will be impacted by either the implementation of this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change, if it is an amendment, including: (a) List the actions each of the regulated entities have to take to comply with this regulation or amendment: Insurers and insurance groups will need to complete the required corporate governance annual disclosure form. In the event insurers or insurance groups do not have the requested policies, they may be required to develop any missing or deficient oversight policies. (b) In complying with this administrative regulation or amendment, how much will it cost each of the entities: Insurers and insurance groups will be required to compile the information requested into one form and submission. However, insurers and insurance groups should already have most of the information, so the cost and resources used to complete the form is anticipated to be minimal. (c) As a result of compliance, what benefits will a ccrue to the entities: The entities will have undertaken a thorough review of their corporate governance policies to ensure all areas are adequately addressed. The form will provide important information to the Department, and provide the entities the oppo rtunity to rectify any inadequacies. (5) Provide an estimate of how much it will cost the administrative body to implement this administrative regulation: (a) Initially: The corporate governance annual disclosure form will require the entities to expend resources on the initial submission to ensure everything is addressed. Because the entities should already have many of the oversight policies in place, the Department anticipates even the initial cost of putting together the information will be minimal. (b) On a continuing basis: Entities are required to file the form annually. If no changes are made to any of the policies, the Department anticipates that the forms will be identical, and require no meaningful resources to compile and submit. Once the init ial form is drafted and filed, the entities will be required to provide updates in the event changes are made. Thus, the primary continuing cost would only occur if policy changes are made. (6) What is the source of the funding to be used for the implemen tation and enforcement of this administrative regulation: The Department will utilize existing funding and personnel to oversee and enforce the submission and review of the corporate governance annual disclosure form. (7) Provide an assessment of whether an increase in fees or funding will be necessary to implement this administrative regulation, if new, or by the change if it is an amendment: The Department will not require an increase in fees or funding. (8) State whether or not this administrative regu lation established any fees or directly or indirectly increased any fees: The administrative regulation does not establish any fees.

Preadmission Screening an d Resident Review Program. In response to questions by Co -Chair West, Mr. Scott stated that the Preadmission Screening and Resident Review Program (PASRR) administrative regulation included MAP form 409, which was incorporated by reference. The division r eceived public comments that expressed concerns that MAP form 409 was confusing and did not conform to federal requirements. The division agreed that a person might have substantial functional limitations as a qualifying characteristic without an intellect ual ability and vice versa, or a person might have both. Ms. Schissler stated that PASRR was a federal requirement for any Medicaid - certified nursing facility. Before each person was admitted to a Medicaid -certified nursing facility, the screening would be used to determine if the person had any mental illness or intellectual disability or related condition. Kentucky Protection and Advocacy was concerned that MAP form 409 did not accurately reflect federal screening requirements because of the way in which the factors were conjoined. Ms. Schissler requested that the form be amended to more accurately reflect the federal screening requirements. Misunderstanding of the requirements as paraphrased on the form led to at least two (2) patients with cerebral palsy not getting necessary specialized services, having their conditions deteriorate, and being admitted to nursing homes. Ms. Guice stated that the PASRR Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC) determined that the current version of MAP form 409 was adequate. PTA C allowed the form to use lay language for ease of interpretation and use, which was the intention regarding how the factors were conjoined on the form. Mr. Scott stated that the amended administrative regulation intended to add flexibility and make the fo rm easier to interpret and use. Ms. Schissler stated that the federal definition itself had remained constant for many years. In response to questions by Co -Chair Hale, Ms. Schissler requested that the MAP form 409, incorporated by reference in this admin istrative regulation, be amended to more accurately reflect the federal screening requirements. Mr. Scott stated that PTAC found the current language in the MAP form 409 adequate. In response to questions by Representative Marzian, Ms. Guice stated that i t was not possible to determine if patients other than the two (2) cited had specialized services denied due to misinterpretation of the form. Each month, approximately 1,200 Medicaid recipients applied for long -term care services. Ms. Schissler stated tha t the form could be amended to more accurately reflect federal requirements while still using easy to interpret, lay language. The federal government contracted with PTAC to provide guidance on PASRR issues. Representative Marzian requested that the divisi on work with Kentucky Protection and Advocacy to consider developing an amendment for consideration once this administrative regulation was referred to the Interim Joint Committee on Health, Welfare, and Family Services. Co -Chair West reiterated Representa tive Marzian's request, and Mr. Scott and Ms. Guice agreed to consider an amendment for the Interim Joint Committee on Health, Welfare, and Family Services.
