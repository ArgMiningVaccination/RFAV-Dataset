Often users are unaware of the ongoing research in these areas, the creativity and work that keeps these institutions open or ensure to develop a cure. The FondsGoetheanum aims to create the basis for an effective and direct promotion of this research. FondsGoetheanum is a movement committed to human values in a sustainable way and with a cultural meaning. The legal basis is the not-for-profit Swiss Anthroposophical Society, which transparently administers the funds in trus. A supplement in a Sunday newspaper regularly provides extensive information on work and research in these different fields: concrete examples publicly report on the state of affairs, results, challenges and prospects. The donations received are divided: half is intended for applied research and development in the various fields in Switzerland, the other half is intended for the respective section of the Goetheanum, in Dornach, for general basic research and development.
