Like other phospholipids, PS is a critical component of cell membranes, and it is found in high concentrations in the brain and nervous tissues, primarily in the cell membranes of neurons. Research shows that phosphatidylserine supplementation can: - Promote cognitive function and mental sharpness* - Support a healthy endocrine response to mental stress* - Help improve exercise capacity* Unlike other forms of PS, Integrative Therapeutics's Phosphatidylserine is derived from sunflower oil and is 100% soy-free. While most of the clinical research has utilized either soybean-derived or bovine-sourced phosphatidylserine, PS from sunflower oil is chemically indistinguishable from soy or bovine-sourced oils. This makes it an ideal option for those who wish to avoid soy-based or bovine-derived PS alternatives.
