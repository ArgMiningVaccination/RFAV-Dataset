WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES DURING TIMES OF WAR Distinct gender roles and gender-specic needs result in women's experiences during and after times of warfare being qualitatively different from those of men. As a result oftheir marginalization and relative lack of power, women are not only often victims ofgender-based violence during and after times of war, but they have specic needs and experiences postwar that are gender influenced (Cockburn, of women impacted by war across the globe, this represents asignicant social problem.

During times of war, civilians are often routinely targeted for violence. In recent wars as many as 90% of all casualties have been civilians, the majority of whom werewomen and children (McKay, 1998; Okazawa-Rey, 2002). In developing nations inparticular, civilian women's duties place them under duress and differentially exposethem to both the threat and reality of violence. For example, women may be lessmobile than men are as they take care of children and elderly family members. Womenmay also be more vulnerable to encountering enemy combatants when they work inagricultural elds or walk long distances to gather water or rewood (Cockburn, 2001). The social consequences of war also have signicant and distinct implications for women. First, levels of social violence are often elevated in the wake of warfare, placingwomen and girls at greater risk of sexual assault. Second, in developing nationswomen and girls are often disproportionately responsible for agricultural labor, andare more likely to step on unexploded landmines buried in agricultural elds. Finally,the violence of war often erodes reciprocal relationships upon which women rely foraccess to resources (Cockburn, 2001; Moser, 2001). Warfare thus has substantial gendered implications for women and girls. These impacts are rendered even more signicant by the fact that women and girls often donot receive adequate services and supports that can facilitate their recovery from war.To address this gap in the literature and to make a contribution to both science andpractice, an in-depth qualitative investigation of factors facilitating Mozambicanwomen's postwar attainment of wellbeing was conducted. Mozambique was an idealsite within which to examine civilian women's experiences of postwar adjustment. Notonly have Mozambican women survived a particularly brutal war (e.g., Igreja, 2003; Sideris, 2003), but the 14 years that have elapsed between the end of the war and the time when this investigation was conducted also ensured that these women had aperiod of postwar adjustment upon which to reflect. THE WAR IN MOZAMBIQUE The civil war in Mozambique lasted from 1976 to 1992. This was a war of destabilization fought between the Frente de Libertac -aode Moc -ambique Nacional Moc -cambicana (RENAMO). The South African goal was to undermine the socialist FRELIMOgovernment, which it perceived as a threat to its then Apartheid government. As aresult, RENAMO deliberately targeted civilians by destroying infrastructure andemploying tactics designed to instill fear (e.g., nighttime attacks, torture, and publicrapes; addition, women and girls were often kidnapped to perform both domestic and sexual labor for combatants (deAbreu, 1998; Igreja, 2003). During the war, approximately 600,000 Mozambicans were killed, 1.7 million fled to neighboring countries, and 4.5 million became internally displaced (Peltzer &Chongo, 1996). It is estimated that virtually every Mozambican family had at least onemember killed, mutilated, or who went missing (deAbreu, 1998; Turshen, 2001).In addition, although it is not known exactly how many women were raped during thewar, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands were injured (deAbreu, 1998). Finally,116 /C15 Journal of Community Psychology, January 2010 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcopit is believed that at the end of the war approximately 2 million landmines remained unexploded throughout the country (Peltzer & Chongo, 1996). Mozambican women suffered multiple consequences as a result of their wartime experiences. These included physical and psychological impacts as well as con-sequences brought about by the sociocultural meaning attached to their experiencesby their larger Igreja, 2003, 2004a; Nordstrom, 1997;Sideris, 2003; Turshen, 2001). In many cases, an injury to an individual was perceivedto also be an injury to the larger community (Honwana, 1998). As a result, somewomen who were raped, and in particular, women who became pregnant as a result,were ostracized by their families or rejected by their husbands. This was particularly true in the patrilineal South of these factors, many communities across Mozambique sought to rebuild social structures and relationships that were dest royed by the war (Igreja, 2004a,b; Igreja, Kleijn, & Richters, 2006). Some authors have documented the ways in which war-affectedcommunities drew upon traditional healers to perform ceremonies intended to cleansevictims of wartime violence of their experiences and to remove the individual and socialconsequences of these experiences. In this way, these individuals could be accepted back into their communities (Green & Honwana, 1999; Honwana, 1998; Igreja et al., 2006; Nordstrom, 1997). Finally, for some wo men the postwar environment provided opportunities for economic participation and access to freedoms that they did not havebefore or during the war. For example, to recover from the economic devastation of thewar and to supplement their families' postwar incomes, many women became employedin the informal industry. This provided them with access to greater economicindependence and related freedoms (e.g., Sideris, 2003). However, individuals and communities sought to recover from the war within a context where they had access to few resources or formal supportive structures. Medical care is particularly limited in rural areas of Mozambique, and resourcesfor psychiatric and psychological care are virtually inaccessible to lower income andrural inhabitants. As a result, the majority of Mozambicans recovering from warhave had no choice but to rely largely upon local spiritual and traditional healers tofacilitate their postwar healing (Igreja, 2004b). In addition, structural adjustmentpolicies imposed upon Mozambique as it made its postwar transition from a socialistto a capitalist economy signicantly restricted individuals' access to various supportive services such as childcare and education (Cliff, 1991; Marshall, 1990; Roesch, 1994; Sheldon, 2002). This placed a particular burden on women, who were forcedto perform additional labor to care for their families after the war (Cliff, 1991;Roesch, 1994). Notably, at the time of independence Mozambique was one of the poorest nations in the world. Although it has made signicant strides since then, the majority of thepopulation still lives below the poverty line. Women, in particular, face signicantdisadvantage. Mozambican women have lower life expectancy than do men (40.44 years as opposed to 41.62 years for men). Literacy rates for women are also low. In 2003, it was estimated that only 32.7% of women were literate (as compared to63.5% of men). Of those women who attend school, the average number of years ofschooling is eight (Central Intelligence Agency, 2009). Mozambican women have thus sought to recover from the gendered impacts of the recent war that was fought in that nation within a context that was not alwayssupportive of this process. However, despite this, women have actively worked toPostwar Recovery in Mozambique /C15117 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcoprestore their own and their communities' postwar health, seeking to attain wellbeing in the wake of the war. THE ATTAINMENT OF WELLBEING IN THE WAKE OF WAR As is the case in Mozambique, communities worldwide strive to attain wellbeing after warfare (Last, 2000). However, to date women's gendered experiences of wellbeing and distress have not been adequately considered and have often been pathologized (Cosgrove & McHugh, 2000). In addition, women's voices are not often heard whenthe effect of the violence of war on civilians is considered (Sideris, 2003). As a result,not enough is known about factors that support civilian women's recovery fromwarfare and their attainment of postwar wellbeing. Wellbeing can be dened as an individual's ability to withstand and recover from difculties and strive towards health (Lorion, 2000). However, wellbeing is not just afunction of individual characteristics, but consists of individuals' interaction with their environment (Kelly, 2000; Lorion, 2000). The attainment of wellbeing thus results from a combination of individual characteristics and ecological contexts The goal of the current investigation was to identify factors at various levels of the socioecological system that have facilitated Mozambican women's attainment ofpostwar wellbeing. In addition, understanding factors that have impacted Mozambicanwomen's attainment of postwar wellbeing in the absence of many of the formalresources conventionally considered important to facilitate recovery from trauma (e.g., psychological counseling; deVries, 1996; Hiegel, 1994) can elucidate factors signicant to women in other developing nations' recovery from warfare. Such anunderstanding can inform programming and policies aimed at women in otherunderresourced communities experiencing or recovering from warfare. METHOD Preliminary Research Activities Before beginning data collection, it was important to ensure that the researcher's understanding of ''wellbeing'' was appropriate within the Mozambican context. Key informant interviews were, therefore, rst conducted with 10 diverse stakeholders(seven women and three men) representing a cross-section of Mozambican society (e.g.,NGO employees, professionals, students, and women employed in the informal sector).These informants were able to speak to interpretations of wellbeing as they relate towomen residing in various sociocultural contexts (e.g., the difference between rural andurban residents' interpretations of wellbeing). Overall, there was strong agreementacross informants with regard to what it meant to be ''well'' in the Mozambican context. Location The Meconta District in rural Nampula Province was selected as the research site for this investigation because it was a site of active Renamo occupation (Jacobson, 2005),and little research has been conducted in this province. Participants lived incommunities that were located at varying distances from roads, and did not have118 /C15 Journal of Community Psychology, January 2010 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcopelectricity, running water, or any other modern amenities. Women and girls were responsible for carrying water from wells or pumps and did all cooking over open res made with wood that they collected. Families farmed their own machambas1and sold their produce according to their needs, with the majority of households subsiding onless than one U.S. dollar a day. However, these were relatively stable communities, andmany families knew one another during the war. Sample Women who were 25 or older were purposively selected for participation as they would have been teenagers or older during the war. It was expected that they would be able to remember their experiences during and after the war, and would be able to reflect on the impact that the war has had upon their lives. Only women who remainedwithin their communities during the war were recruited for participation, as it is likelythat those women who were refugees or who migrated to other communities to escapethe war had experiences that were qualitatively different from those women whoremained within their home communities. Finally, both women who were married andunmarried and women who did and did not have children during the war wererecruited for participation. Procedures The rst author gained legitimacy within the targeted communities through her association with female key stakeholders from these communities known as communityAnimators . Animators fulll important leadership roles in their communities and, for example, organize women's groups, conduct nutritional education, and keep track ofinfants' development. Data were collected through semistructured, in-depth, in-person qualitative interviews that were taped and transcribed. Additionally, all participants were interviewed in locations where they felt comfortable and had privacy. All interviews were conducted either in Portuguese (in which the rst author is fluent) or in Macua(the primary indigenous language spoken in Nampula province) with the assistance ofa Portuguese-Macua translator. Less-educated women often were not fluent inPortuguese, and it was thus necessary to interview them in Macua, their rst language. Overall, 47 interviews were conducted over a period of 6 months, until saturation was achieved (Patton, 2002). The nal sample consisted of 47 women aged 25 to 61(M540). All participants were farmers, 45 were married, and 2 were widowed. The husbands of those participants who were widowed died from causes other than the war. All except one of the participants had between one and nine children, with anaverage of ve living children per family. Interview guide. Participants were asked about their recovery after the war, how the war had changed their lives, their attainment of wellbeing after war, and factors that werepotentially signicant (positively and negatively) to their postwar recovery. Theseopen-ended questions allowed participants to reflect upon various periods of their 1Plots of land farmed by individuals and/or family groups.Postwar Recovery in Mozambique /C15119 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcoplives during and after the war. Follow-up probes allowed the rst author to explore specic aspects of these experiences with women in more detail. Translation. Given the multilingual nature of the investigation, it was necessary to ensure that all documents and interviews were accurately translated. First, a local university student veried the rst author's translation of documents from English into Portuguese. Second, community Animators were recruited to act as Portuguese-Macua translators in the eld. Given the signicant logistical problems inherent inreaching the targeted, rural communities, it was not possible to bring outsideindividuals along to act as translators during interviews. In addition, discussions withservice providers revealed that women in the targeted communities would beuncomfortable and likely unwilling to be interviewed if an outside translator was used.Hence, ve community Animators at the targeted farmers' associations were recruited to act as translators in the eld, as they were some of the only women in these communities who were fluent in both Portuguese and Macua. Finally, to ensure the accuracy of allPortuguese-Macua translations, two fully bilingual research assistants were recruited toreview all interview tapes. Data analysis. The Portuguese versions of all interviews were transcribed for analysis. All data were analyzed using Atlas.ti (Muhr, 1991), and using inductive thematiccontent analysis (Patton, 2002). As each transcript was analyzed, and new themes wereidentied, these were compared to previously identied themes in order foroverarching analytic categories to be generated. These categories were then used to construct a coding framework that was used to deductively analyze all data. Convergent and disconrming evidence for the nal framework was sought fromeach transcript (Corbin & Strauss, 1990), ensuring that the coding frameworkreflected an emergent understanding of the data and participants' perspectives. Multiple sources of data triangulation were incorporated into the process of data analysis. First, the bulk of data analysis occurred while the rst author was still inMozambique, allowing for participant input to be obtained with regard to emergentndings. This member check took the form of three informal discussion groups conducted after the completion of initial data analysis. The rst author's interpreta- tions of the data were validated through these conversations. Second, an impartialthird party reviewed all data analysis procedures and related interpretations. Additional methods to improve the trustworthiness of qualitative inquiry outlined by Guba and Lincoln (1989) were also followed. The rst author spent a number ofmonths within the research site, thereby engaging in prolonged engagement. She alsoengaged in persistent observation in order to identify characteristics of thecommunities in question most relevant to the investigation (e.g., women's roles within their communities). In addition, the rst author engaged in peer debriengs, regularly discussing her ndings and emergent conclusions with impartial others. Second,transferability was increased through the provision of thick description of thephenomenon under investigation. Finally, dependability and conrmability of thedata were ensured through the maintenance of an audit trail of all data collection andanalysis procedures, related decisions that were made, and justications of thesedecisions.120 /C15 Journal of Community Psychology, January 2010 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcopRESULTS Wellbeing in Mozambique Key informants participating in the rst phase of the research agreed that because individual denitions of what it means to be well vary and are often contextually determined (e.g., rural and urban residents may have different interpretations of what it means to be well), universal wellbeing is determined by an individual's access torights and resources that facilitate their capacity to achieve their own goals andaspirations. This additionally serves to remove gendered restrictions to women'sattainment of wellbeing (e.g., access to education and equal consideration in theworkplace can assist women in furthering their goals). Notably, participants alsoobserved that not all women have equal access to necessary rights and resources, andthat, in particular, women who lived in rural areas were frequently severely impoverished and/or did not have access to the structures necessary to ensure that their rights were adequately enforced. One key informant summed this up bysaying Women have achieved emancipation, but they are still in the process of obtaining wellbeing ythose women who study ythose who haven't studied still live in rural areas and they still experience deprivation, they still have notachieved wellbeing yshe is free, Mozambique is free, but fundamentally, she does not have wellbeing yshe does not have resources y. 2 For women in Mozambique, the attainment of wellbeing is thus not a state, but a process. This process is facilitated by individuals' access to rights and reso- urces that allow them to achieve their goals and aspirations, but this access is not universal. When asked about their attainment of postwar wellbeing, women who participated in the second phase of data collection provided similar descriptions. Notably, womenassociated their postwar attainment of wellbeing with the ability to engage freely indaily tasks and to make key decisions about their lives. The absence of sociopoliticalrestrictions on their capacity to live peaceful and meaningful lives was essential towomen's postwar sense of wellbeing. When asked to describe what it meant to her to be well, one participant provided the following response: yI sit at home, I take my hoe, I go to my machamba, 3I come back from my machamba, I get my water bucket, I go to the river, I farm without seeing anyenemies, that is how I have wellbeing y Another participant simply said, ''We are free.'' 2Quotes have been translated either from Portuguese to English or from Macua to Portugese to English. When a translator was present during an interview, quotes are in the third person as this is how the translatorpresented the information to the rst author. In order to maintain the authenticity of the data and to minimize the loss of meaning that occurs with translation, quotes that were translated from Macua into Portuguese were left in the third person. Quotes from interviews conducted in Portuguese are presented inthe rst person. 3Plot of farmland.Postwar Recovery in Mozambique /C15121 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcopThe postwar context was thus signicant both to participants' capacity to recover from the impacts of the war as well as their attainment of wellbeing in its wake. If women's recovery from the impacts of warfare is to be encouraged, it is essential to understand those characteristics of their postwar environment that may facilitate theirpostwar attainment of wellbeing. Postwar Attainment of Wellbeing All of the women who participated in this investigation had had some direct experience of violence, ranging from having their property stolen to seeing family members murdered. In addition to the loss of life and generalized violence, many women and their families also lost all of their belongings, including their stores of seedsintended for the next season's planting. Additionally, although none of the womeninterviewed for this investigation were willing to admit that they were raped (likely forfear of stigma and/or because such disclosure is considered to be taboo, as described byIgreja et al., 2006, 2008), participants did describe the fact that many women who werekidnapped were forced to ''marry'' soldiers or were otherwise sexually assaulted.Women who were kidnapped were also often forced to perform domestic labor and to act as farmers and porters for soldiers. This combined with the fact that they were provided with inadequate nutrition and were treated harshly, ensured that girls andwomen who were kidnapped often suffered severe physical and psychologicalconsequences as a result of their experiences. Overall, participants described the war as disruptive in multiple ways. In addition to the violence, fear, and hardship it wrought, the war rendered it difcult, if notimpossible, for women to engage in activities that gave meaning to their daily lives. Forexample, one participant described life during the war in the following manner: During the time of the war, all the people slept in the bush, there was no time to farm, there was no time to bathe, there was no time to fetch water, there wasno time to play or to sit and braid hair, there was no time. All the time we justfled into the bush, all the time we just fled y The war was thus a period of signicant suffering for those women who participated in this investigation. This resulted not only from their individual experiences of warfare, but also from the disruptive impact it had upon their families and larger communities. It is within this context that women's postwar recovery will beexamined. Facilitators of Women's Postwar Attainment of Wellbeing Despite facing signicant adversity, the majority of the women who participated in this investigation indicated that they had attained wellbeing since the war. Only two indicated that they were not well, and of these two women, one had recently been widowed and one was suffering from a grave illness. Given that women largely feltthat they had recovered from the war, regardless of the signicant and negativeimpact it had had upon their lives, it was important to understand those factors thatfacilitated their postwar attainment of wellbeing. Notably, factors that supportedwomen's attainment of postwar wellbeing existed at all levels of the socioecologicalsystem.122 /C15 Journal of Community Psychology, January 2010 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcopFacilitators of Mozambican women's wellbeing at the micro level. At this level of analysis, women's attainment of postwar wellbeing was supported by the ways in which their families responded to them and assisted them during and after the war. Family members assisted one another with material needs as well as with their recovery fromthe experience of violence. First, the material support that family members provided to one another assisted women to recover from economic losses. As the following participant explained,''yduring that time those who had some food offered it to others, they said 'come help me in my machamba, and then I will give you some to eat.'' Another participantdescribed the assistance that she received from her family after combatants burned down her house, '' ywhen they burnt my house down I received help from my family, they took beans and corn and gave it to me; I built my house and until now I am livingwithout problems in my life.'' In addition, many women who were kidnapped during the war remained with soldiers for extended periods, even years. They often lost everything as a result anddepended upon their family members to assist them to get back on their feet. Forexample, the following participant described the assistance family members providedto one another: ''When those who were kidnapped returned home, they [the family members] took some food and gave it to them ythey came back from there and had nothingytheir family gave them what they purchased.'' What is particularly notable about this support is that family members assisted women and girls who returned from being kidnapped, even when they may have beenraped. This stands in contrast to literature documenting cases where women wereostracized from their communities after being raped. When asked about thisdifference, one participant stated, '' yit was not the same here like there, when these people came back they were received by their families.'' In fact, participants indicated that they were happy to have their female family members return to them after being kidnapped. This was further illustrated by the fact that women who hadbeen kidnapped were still living within their communities and were married withfamilies. Family members additionally ensured that women and girls had access to care, as was available, to assist them in recovering from the physical and psychologicalconsequences of their wartime experiences. Family members took their wives anddaughters to medical professionals, if these were available. In addition, women and girls were taken to see curandeiros (traditional healers) to receive treatment for the physical and psychological consequences of their wartime experiences. One womanwho had been kidnapped during the war relayed the following regarding herexperiences upon returning to her family: ''When I arrived here ywhen they brought me back from there, my family arranged for me to be treated by a curandeiro. I wasn'ta compete person, I was like a 'bandito' 4from the bush.'' This participant indicated that after treatment she was a person again and managed to recover from herexperiences during kidnapping. Facilitators of women's wellbeing at the meso level. At this level of the socioecological system, women's wellbeing was facilitated by the resources available to them within theircommunities. First, as noted above, women who experienced violence during the warwere often treated by curandeiros who cleansed them of their experiences, providing 4Participants often referred to soldiers as 'banditos', or bandits.Postwar Recovery in Mozambique /C15123 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcopthem with an opportunity to be reintegrated into their communities. In addition to receiving treatment for their physical health concerns, women were often ritually washed by curandeiros. This ritual bathing broke the link between what happened to them and their current and future lives. The ceremony also cleansed women of theirexperiences during the war and allowed them to once more become part of theircommunities. This served as a form of renewal for women, symbolically breaking theconnection between them and their experiences and allowing them to be acceptedback by their communities. Participants described the results of these treatments in the following ways: ''ythere weren't problems when these people came back here [those who were kidnapped], at home they arranged for them to see a curandeiro, they were treated, and they lived like they lived before the war.'' Other participants said the following about returnees' recovery after being treated by a curandeiro, also emphasizing the secrecy that surrounds these experiences:''ythese people who were captured felt better [after they were treated].'' And ''y[after being treated] other people were free, they just can't speak about what happened in the bush y.'' Participants additionally had access to various other resources, including member- ship in farmers' associations, programs provided by nongovernmental organizations (e.g., women's savings groups), and government-sponsored adult education programs.Participants credited their memberships in farmers' associations and women's savingsgroups with providing them with material resources that facilitated daily living (e.g.,seeds to plant and additional nancial resources). Participants also particularlyappreciated the fact that savings groups would allow them to have money to pay fortheir children's health care and to purchase additional material resources for theirfamilies. These savings groups thus had the potential to facilitate wellbeing. In addition, participants identied the ability to obtain an education as a facilitating factor in their attainment of postwar wellbeing. Obtaining an educationallowed women to strive for larger life goals and could also facilitate their ability to earnan income and to assist their families in better meeting their needs. One participantdescribed how an education would allow her to have more options given thedevelopment that was occurring in northern Mozambique: ''I go to school so I canlearn to write. These [aid] organizations are always arriving, I want employment, so Ican also be in the group that they will hire from y'' Facilitators of Mozambican women's wellbeing at the macro level. At this level of analysis, recent postwar changes to the larger social system have allowed women to access rightsand resources to which they did not previously have access. This included facilitatingwomen's access to meso-level resources. These postwar changes to the governmentand the social system in Mozambique have awarded women greater access to legalrights as well as increased access to liberties and resources that were previously denied to them for gendered reasons. Participants were aware of the rights that they now had access to and were able to take advantage of some of these new opportunities. The following participantdiscussed some of the changes to the social system that she had observed since the war:''Because of democracy we are recovering, and men are feeling this difference. Theyare discovering that they cannot treat their wives badly. We can also not treat ourhusbands badly, we are equal.''124 /C15 Journal of Community Psychology, January 2010 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcopAnother woman said the following about her perception of her changing rights: ''I always think 'from where we came, today is about moving forward, we are moving forward. My rights are changing' y'' Participants were also aware of the fact that these societal changes provided them with access to new resources, such as the opportunity to obtain an education and accessto opportunities for greater political participation. ythe difference I noticed is that today women are studying and have jobs, yes, because back then women didn't work, only the men worked, but today womenwork as well, like men; if someone says 'that woman over there, she is a[government] minister,' she really is a minister, while before it wasn't like that y. These changes to the social system have thus broken down some of the gendered barriers that women experienced to their attainment of wellbeing and have provided a context within which they have achieved postwar wellbeing. One participant summed this up well by saying: ywe are recovering, now, today, we are moving forward, we really are moving forward; women are already studying, because before the war, and during thewar, it was before we moved forward, but today women are studying and aregoing to work. Factors That Have Inhibited Mozambican Women's Postwar Attainment of Wellbeing Women identied two factors that negatively impacted their postwar attainment of wellbeing. First, at the time of this investigation, the Meconta region was sufferingfrom delayed annual rainfall made worse by a short rainy season the previous year.Although the rainy season did eventually start, families were forced to deplete theirfood stores and they were not able to plant and harvest as expected. Many participantsspoke of experiencing signicant hunger. However, despite this, participants still con sidered themselves to have attained overall wellbeing. Although women felt the impact of the period of hunger, they described it as a transient time that did not change their overal l attainment of wellbeing. As the following participant describes, '' ythe difference is that during the war they killed people like animals, while today, if it wasn't for this hunger, we could sit and play without any worries y.'' Another participant echoed this sentiment by saying, '' ythis time is a good, the only bad is this hunger, if it wasn't for this hunger I could sit there and say 'now I am free' y.'' Participants additionally identied postwar crime levels as an impediment to their capacity to live well after the war. This is signicant as women are often particularlyvulnerable to criminal activity. Their gender roles may expose them to threats as they spend time in machambas, or when they are walking to and from water collection sites. Participants indicated that crime levels interfered with their daily activities. Theydescribed this obstacle in the following way, '' ythe war is over, yes, but it is not over because of the thieves, the war of the knives has ended, of the weapons, but the warstill exists in the 'Corridor. 5'' ' 5The thoroughfare between two major cities along which the targeted communities were located.Postwar Recovery in Mozambique /C15125 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcopThus, although women felt themselves recovered from the war, their lives were not without hardship and continuing challenges. DISCUSSION Previous studies have documented the negative impacts that unsupportive postwar contexts can have upon women. For example, others have noted cases in whichwomen who had been raped during war were rejected by their families and communities, resulting in their loss of social and economic resources necessary for their postwar recovery (Igreja, 2003; Peltzer & Chongo, 1996; Turshen, 2001). Inaddition, it has been argued that the absence of resources that are conventionally thoughtto support postwar healing, such as counseling and culturally appropriate treatments fortrauma, can be detrimental to individuals' recovery after war (Igreja, 2004b; Peltzer &Chongo, 1996). Finally, researchers have argued that postwar contexts that do notsupport women's attainment of economic wellbeing exacerbate the economic difcultiesgenerated by war (Cliff, 1991; Roesch, 1994; Marshall, 1990; Sheldon, 2002). The current study, in contrast, focused on women's attainment of wellbeing after war. The women who participated in this study spoke about the various ways in whichthe postwar context (at the micro, meso and macro levels) supported their recoveryfrom the impacts of the war. At the micro level, women's access to family and socialsupport networks were particularly signicant to their postwar recovery deVries, King, King, Keane, Fairbank, & Adams, 1998;Shalev et al., 2004). These networks not only allowed women to mitigate some of thenegative economic impacts of war, but also contributed to their psychosocial recovery. Notably, as was mentioned earlier, this nding stands in contrast to those of authors such as Sideris (2003), Igreja, Kleijn, and Richters (2006), and Turshen (2000)who found that in the patrilineal south of Mozambique, women who were raped werefrequently ostracized from their communities. This nding thus needs to be placedwithin a sociocultural context. The acceptance of women who may have been rapedback into their families and communities likely resulted from the fact that the Macuaare matrilineal. In matrilineal communities, where bloodlines are traced throughwomen, female sexuality is not as closely guarded as in patrilineal communities. Women in matrilineal communities consequently have greater reproductive freedom and more signicant access to social result, although it is possible that victimswere stigmatized, they did not face the same consequences as women have inpatrilineal communities such as those in the south of Mozambique (e.g., Igreja et al.,2006; Sideris, 2003; Turshen, 2000). At the meso level, women had access to culturally appropriate resources designed to minimize the impact of their wartime experiences (e.g., treatment by curandeiros), which facilitated their capacity to recover from war. The importance of traditional healers such as curandeiros to individuals' capacity to attain wellbeing has been well documented inthe literature on warfare (e.g., deVries, 1996; Hiegel, 1994; Igreja et al., 2006; Krippner,Johnson, & Friedman, in press). In fact, it is argued that such treatment has the effect ofbringing about a complete psychological recovery for war-affected individuals and ismore appropriate to contexts such as Mozambique where individualistic Western modelsof health and trauma do not apply (Green & Honwana, 1999; Honwana, 1998).126 /C15 Journal of Community Psychology, January 2010 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcopChanges postwar at the macro level also served to increase participants' access to resources necessary for their postwar emp owerment. Notably, women had increased postwar access to resources that improved their capacity to make choices about their lives, including increased economic, educational, and political power. This not only contributed to the postwar redress of power considered by many to be necessary for true postwar recovery and the prevention of future wars (C omas-Dias, & but it also increased women's capacity for self-determination an d wellbeing (Nelson, Lord, & Ochocka, 2001; Prilleltensky, Nelson, & Piers on, 2001; Zimmerman, 2001). This is particularly signicant given the established conne ction between empowerment and wellbeing (Cowen, 1991; Rappaport, 1995). Findings from this investigation thus suggest that empowerment theory provides a useful framework within which to examine women's attainment of postwar wellbeing.This is especially true if a denition of empowerment that focuses on individuals'capacity to exercise control over their lives and related choices as a route to wellbeing isemployed (Nelson et al., 2001; Prilleltensky et al., 2001). However, notably, participants were still vulnerable to economic setbacks, as they did not have sufcient buffers (e.g., long-term savings) in place to protect themselves against natural disasters and other phenomena that impacted their levels of agricultural production and related access to income. During the time that thisinvestigation was being conducted, women's savings groups were being started in thetargeted communities. It is possible that over time such savings groups will serve tobuffer women against events such as drought or crop blight; however, at the time ofthis investigation it was not possible to assess the impact of these groups. However,participants understood the potential importance of such groups and noted these as apositive aspect of their membership in farmers' associations. Limitations Study ndings should be considered within the context of the investigation's methodological limitations. Given the signicant methodological challenges inherent inconducting cross-cultural research in multiple languages, it is possible that importantaspects of women's postwar recovery process were overlooked or incorrectly interpreted(e.g., meaning may have been lost in translation and participants may not have fullytrusted the rst author). Multiple strategies were put in place to minimize suchmethodological concerns (e.g., persiste nt observation, member checks, and key informant interviews); however, these challenges are complex and it is possible that the measures taken were not sufcient. In addition, the investigation focused upon factorsthat facilitated women's recovery from warfare. Although this is an important source ofinquiry, more negative aspects of women's postwar experiences may not have beenadequately explored or portrayed. CONCLUSION This study illustrates the importance of considering the socioecological context within which women recover from warfare, including the availability of indigenous supportstructures and resources that support their empowerment. The availability of suchresources and supports not only has implications for women's postwar recovery, butshould also inform service provision to women in war zones. It is thus essential to tailorPostwar Recovery in Mozambique /C15127 Journal of Community Psychology DOI: 10.1002/jcoppostwar interventions to the particular postwar context within which women reside and to evaluate the availability of indigenous support structures and resources that may facilitate women's recovery. Additionally, the importance of considering factors such as the kinship structures of communities impacted by warfare has also beenillustrated. These structures may have signicant implications for the ways in whichcommunities respond to war survivors as well as for the supports that are both neededby and available to women following war. The signicance of these implications shouldbe further explored in future inquiries. REFERENCES Addai, I. (1999). Ethnicity and sexual behavior in Ghana. Social Biology, 46(1-2), 17-32.
