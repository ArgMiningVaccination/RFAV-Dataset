Using a specially formulated combination of nutrients, our [IV treatments](https://www.drstemcell.com/contents/services/iv-treatment) deliver nutrients that are vital to the immune system directly to your system through the bloodstream, bypassing your digestive system. [Bruce Fishman, MD](https://www.drstemcell.com/contents/about/meet-dr-f), and our team here at [Dr. Stem Cell](https://www.drstemcell.com/about) in Encino, California, provide custom IV nutrient therapy to match your needs. Whether you require rehydration to recover from rigorous sports training, or a combination of nutrients to boost energy, we can help you stay one step ahead. If your goal is to support the immune system, our immune-boosting IV therapy can help. Here are some of the nutrients commonly used in IV therapy to give your immune system a leg up. Vitamin C Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that's essential to your health. Your body can't produce vitamin C, so you must get it from your diet. In the body, this vitamin acts as a powerful antioxidant that, in addition to helping your immune system stay healthy, plays a role in energy production. Ornithine, arginine, and citrulline Ornithine, arginine, and citrulline are three essential amino acids known to have antioxidant properties. Among other things, your immune system uses these amino acids to support wound healing. When you're injured, the immune system sends substances that start the healing process, and these amino acids help your body create and repair tissue. Glutathione Known as the \"master antioxidant,\" [glutathione](https://www.healthline.com/health/glutathione-benefits) helps increase the activity of other antioxidants like vitamin C and vitamin E. Every cell in your body needs glutathione, and your immune system needs it to maintain its strength and fight infections. Glutathione assists in safeguarding your immune system in two crucial ways: First, it influences T-cell lymphocytes' ability to function properly. These frontline soldiers need glutathione to multiply. Second, your natural killer (NK) cells are both activated and stimulated by glutathione. This increases the effectiveness of your immune system and functions as an immune system antioxidant. Keeping your glutathione levels high is essential for maintaining a strong immune system, preventing disease, and improving performance. It's critical for maintaining immune health and controlling inflammation. Trace minerals Your immune system uses the trace minerals zinc, copper, manganese, selenium, and chromium to do its job, and these minerals are easily depleted when you're bouncing back from an illness or training hard. Topping up these minerals helps to give your immune system what it needs to stay strong. L-lysine The amino acid lysine, or L-lysine, is crucial to your immune system because it helps the system produce antibodies that identify and neutralize foreign invaders. Once antibodies identify something as foreign, your immune system mounts a defense. Vitamin B-12 Vitamin B-12 is well known for its role in transforming food to energy, helping your body produce red blood cells, and helping nerves function properly. However, your body also uses B-12 in immune function. Vitamin B-12 can alter immune function and inhibit immune cells when necessary. This nutrient activates certain immune cells when a foreign object is identified, playing a role in [cellular immunity](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10209501/).
