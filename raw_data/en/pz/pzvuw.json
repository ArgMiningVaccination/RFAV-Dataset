Hair Mineral analysis is a laboratory test that measures this mineral content in the hair. In most cases, the test results reflect how much of these elements are in your tissues and provide a vivid picture of your internal environment. With this information, a world of metabolic events can be interpreted. Not only can your nutritional status be viewed, but we can also learn much about how efficiently your body is working. We also offer Nutritional Consultations, Neuro-reflex muscle testing, Chinese Medicine, and Clinical Hypnotherapy. Please contact us for more information. "}
