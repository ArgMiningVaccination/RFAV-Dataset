Testimonials Bradley H I have tried beef liver products, and bison is by far the best. It's rich in iron, and also very high in vitamin B12, which helps with energy production. Michael My wife and I have been taking the capsules for about a month. Both of us feel much, much better. We had been trying to get more iron in our diets, but it was difficult to figure out how to do it in a way that we could actually tolerate. The capsules are very easy to take, and they give us all the benefits of bison liver without any of the trouble of eating/chewing/preparing bison liver.

LGS Bison Liver capsules are a convenient way to get a dose of B12 and iron while also providing a powerful protein source that can be taken any time of day.

I love Bison liver so much, I decided to share it with the world! Talk about your brand Ten years ago, I became a grandfather. Within the following four years I was a grandfather 6 times over. I grew up in the Potawatomi Tribe, proud, and humble. Understanding firsthand what it truly means when people say, \"it takes a tribe to raise a child\". As I evaluated what my grandchildren were consuming and realized the difficulties they were having physically and mentally were directly tied to the lack of natural unadulterated core foods that I had growing up. It was a no brainer to reintroduce myself and my family to what my ancestors had known all along. If I look back just two generations, we don't see many of the things that plague us today: anemia, cholesterol, chronic inflammation, kidney disease, blood pressure, diabetes, waist circumference, psychological problems, etc. Now, the latest generation is faced with easy options for food that leaves them unconnected, unfulfilled, overfed, unhealthy, and unwell. I think back to mealtime when I was a child my mother would make pan fry liver and onions every Wednesday night. She would soak the liver in milk to make it more palatable for us young kids. I poured over research only to be confronted with knowledge that I had known along, we are missing out on the natural vitamins and minerals organ meat provides and our bodies have evolved to require. I set out to find a consistent way to feed myself, my family, and my tribe organ meats daily. I tried beef organ supplements, only to find that most come from end-of-life dairy cows that have been given a steady dose of hormones their entire lives. The answer was right in front of me: Bison! Bison has been a staple in my tribe for millennia, providing everything, the actual Life Giving Spirit. Bison require vast prairies existing in a symbiotic relationship with the natural ecology. I made my own, for my friends and family. Realizing the benefits were astounding, I decided to create Life Giving Spirit Supplements with my two partners. We launched the product on Amazon and haven't looked back. The feedback from customers and friends has been amazing, people love it! We are excited to bring LGS Supplements Bison liver to the world and share the knowledge and American cultural heritage that Bison provides. LGS Bison Liver is So Easy to Take and Packed Full of Vital Nutrients Liver is also one of the few food sources of the other fat-soluble nutrients such as Vitamins D and K. CoQ10: Beef liver (and heart) are the richest sources of CoQ10, important for cardiovascular health, fertility and endurance. It also reduces inflammation and the damaging effects of free-radicals and stress. Iron: Heme Helps carry oxygen around the body. Vitamin A is also crucial for the production of the youth-associated hormones, namely Pregnenolone , Progesterone and DHEA. Three key substances are required for the production of these hormones, and they are: T3 (active thyroid hormone), Cholesterol, and Vitamin A. If any of these are lacking, we cannot produce these protective, anti-stress hormones, and instead resort to a stressed metabolism where the opposing hormones dominate, estrogen in particular. Estrogen in excess in turn blocks thyroid production so active T3 decreases, further impeding the production of pregnenolone ... it's a vicious cycle.
