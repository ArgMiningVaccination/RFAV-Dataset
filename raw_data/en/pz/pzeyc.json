Atrium Health became the first health system in the region to begin providing mass vaccinations to a group of patients who are at least 75 years of age, following guidance from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. As North Carolina moves [into this next phase of vaccinations](https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/ncdhhs-shares-updated-rollout-plan-covid-19-vaccinations), over 160,000 Atrium Health patients who are 75-years-old and older started receiving communications on Monday, Jan. 4 with details on how to schedule their vaccination appointment. Hundreds have already taken advantage and scheduled their appointments with ease through their existing [MyAtriumHealth account](https://my.atriumhealth.org/MyAtriumHealth/Authentication/Login?). Those who don't have a MyAtriumHealth account can create one or schedule a vaccination appointment by phone, if assistance is needed. Vaccination appointments are required due to current vaccine supply and storage requirements of the Pfizer-manufactured vaccine. \"Makingthis vaccine available to the many diverse communities thatAtrium Health serves is a crucialstep closer to defeating this virus,\" said Dr. Gary Little, chief medical officer at Atrium Health. \"We're working to ensure the distribution of the vaccine isinclusive and with as few barriers as possible. Scheduling andreceiving the vaccine when it's available is the best way we can all take part in ending this pandemic, while saving many lives in the process.\" Getting a COVID-19 vaccine can help protect individuals, as it creates an antibody response in the body without having to become sick with the virus. If enough people get vaccinated, a large part of the population of an area will be immune to COVID-19, called \"herd immunity.\"Herd immunity makes it possible to protect the population from a disease, including those who can't be vaccinated, such as some pregnant women, children and newborns. Experts say that more than 70% of the population will have to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity. As Atrium Health continues to administer the vaccine to the healthcare workers it employs, the ability to offer it to the public is a welcome opportunity to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus, end the pandemic and return hospital capacity rates to normal. The first COVID-19 vaccines weregiven to Atrium Health teammates on Monday, Dec. 14. In just three weeks,more than20,250 teammates have received their initial doseacross the Atrium Health enterprise in the Carolinas and in Georgia, with over 10,750 in the Charlotte region alone.
