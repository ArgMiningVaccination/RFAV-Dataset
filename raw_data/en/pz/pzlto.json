Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) looks at the energetic balance of paired organs with the meridian system. Using particular tastes found in food and herbs, we can maintain balance and tonification in these areas. Combining TCM with breath work, meditation, and gentle yoga poses, we can create an environment that supports our system and provides harmony in how we live. The workshop has 5 sessions each tailored to a particular season. Participants can attend as many as they wish. Working through all five provides seasonal practices that act as a blueprint for optimal health and well-being. Each session includes: discussion, acupuncture or acupressure, breath work, simple yoga poses, meditation tools, and more. Session Four: Fall Focus: Lung and Large Intestine Date: October 26, 2019 Time: 11:00-1:00 Location: Breath by Breath Yoga Price: $40 The Lungs and Large Intestine are responsible for helping us let go of whatever we don't need (emotionally and physically). Sadness and grief are associated with the energy of these organs. Imbalances in these areas include: difficulty processing grief and loss, a weak immune system, allergies, asthma, shortness of breath, constipation, or dampness in the body, as well as weight gain. It can also show up as physical weakness, irritability, discouragement, and apathy. A healthy, balanced system provides clear thinking, openness to new ideas, and good communication, the ability to organize and go internal as well as a strong immune system. The taste that supports this metal energy of this season is spicy. Elizabeth and Sandy will guide you through practices to help keep these meridians balanced. During meditation and savasana, acupuncture needles will be used. We also provide tips and practices that can be helpful throughout the season. Come with comfortable, loose clothing and a notebook/pen.
