Through diet and exercise, she had once trimmed 90 pounds from her 260-pound frame. But Ms. Kuney, a Silverdale, Wash., resident, had gradually regained two-thirds of the weight. So she decided to take herbal weight-loss pills, which she bought at a natural-foods store. The pills contained several ingredients, including ma-huang, an ancient Chinese plant better known in this country as ephedra. Over the next few months, Ms. Kuney, 46, says, the pills helped her lose 25 pounds, though she developed dry mouth and frequent headaches. Still, she kept taking the pills. ''I was afraid to get off them,'' she said, ''or else I'd gain the weight back.'' Although it's hard to say what portion of the $12 billion dietary supplement market is made up of weight-loss aids, Metabolife International, maker of the ephedra-based product Metabolife 356, is projecting sales of $900 million this year. Such herbal diet products are not only easy to obtain, but also have the appeal of natural ingredients, leading many consumers to believe that they are taking milder medicine. But are they? Are all-natural slenderizers, which are not tested in advance by the Food and Drug Administration, safe? And do they work? Ephedra is probably the most widely used ingredient in herbal products to fight obesity. It is in most formulas promoted as ''herbal phen-fen,'' an allusion to the now-banned phentermine-fenfluramine drug combination once prescribed for weight loss. Ephedra sinica, used in Chinese medicine for more than 5,000 years, contains alkaloids, including ephedrine, which is used in different forms in nasal decongestants and prescription asthma medications. Scientists have known that ephedrine can act as a diet aid since the 1970's, when Danish doctors noticed that asthmatic patients taking it lost weight. Ephedrine, which is structurally similar to the drugs known as amphetamines, increases metabolism, which causes a person at rest to burn more calories. Ephedrine also appears to suppress appetite. Dr. Steven Heymsfield, an obesity specialist at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, has tested ephedra on several groups of overweight patients who were also instructed to eat a low-calorie diet. ''It definitely works,'' he said. In Dr. Heymsfield's research, patients who took enough ephedra to consume the equivalent of 100 milligrams of ephedrine alkaloid every day for two months lost a pound or two a week. No one taking the prescribed amounts in his study became seriously ill, though reports of unpleasant side effects were common, including headaches, heart palpitations, dry mouth and insomnia. The problem, explained Bill J. Gurley, a pharmacologist at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock, is that some ephedra users develop a tolerance to small doses and require more pills to control their appetites. ''The more you take,'' he said, ''the greater your chances of developing some type of adverse side effect,'' since ephedrine increases blood pressure and heart rate. The F.D.A. lists more than 1,000 people who fell ill after using ephedra; the reports included heart attacks, seizures, strokes and at least 35 deaths. DR. GURLEY said most ephedra users who become ill can blame ''their own stupidity, for going well over the recommendations on labels.'' But he and his colleagues have tested the potency of a dozen ephedra products and found that the amount of active ingredient in some brands varied by as much as 130 percent. Most contained less ephedrine than the labels claimed, but Dr. Gurley is still troubled. ''As a consumer and a pharmaceutical scientist, it was an eye-opening experience,'' he said. ''You can't trust what's on the label.'' Although the F.D.A. says only that ephedra may be linked to the reports of adverse events it has compiled, it wants to restrict the herb's use. Agency officials have proposed a law requiring ephedra products to bear labels warning consumers to take no more than 24 milligrams of ephedrine alkaloids a day, for no more than a week. The dietary supplements industry has opposed the F.D.A. proposal. But even supplement manufacturers concede that certain people should not use ephedra, or should speak with a doctor first. They include pregnant women, anyone with a history of high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes or prostate problems, and those taking the antidepressants known as MAO (monoamine oxidase) inhibitors. Dr. Heymsfield recommends starting with a daily dose of no more than 24 milligrams of ephedrine, the amount in two Metabolife pills. Blood pressure should be checked before increasing the dose, he said, adding that it's unwise to take ephedra for more than three or four months. Some supplement sellers have begun promoting ''ephedra-free'' weight-loss products. One common substitute is garcinia cambogia extract, derived from a citrus fruit grown in Southeast Asia. Also known as hydroxycitric acid, or HCA, it is frequently identified as ''Citrimax'' on labels. Studies on rats and dogs have shown that HCA can block an enzyme necessary to form fat in the body. But when Dr. Heymsfield gave a daily dose of 1,500 milligrams of HCA to 66 overweight men and women for three months, ''we found absolutely nothing,'' he said. Another widely available weight-loss nostrum, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, stirred debate last year. Better known as 5-HTP, this naturally occurring amino acid is chemically similar to L-tryptophan, a compound found in some foods and produced by the body. Both are precursors of serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in mood regulation and appetite. A 1992 Italian study involving 20 obese women found that 900 milligrams a day of 5-HTP helped reduce food cravings, especially for carbohydrates. The women cut their calorie intake by nearly a third. Sales of dietary supplements containing L-tryptophan, often used to treat insomnia, were prohibited in the United States after a 1989 outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or E.M.S., a potentially fatal disease of the immune system. According to the F.D.A., approximately 1,500 cases of E.M.S., including 38 deaths, were linked to L-tryptophan tainted with toxic chemicals that were byproducts of processing. Last fall, researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., reported in the journal Nature Medicine that they had tested eight batches of 5-HTP and detected in each impurities similar to those in L-tryptophan. Stephen Naylor, an analytical chemist and a co-author of the study, conceded that some products contained only small amounts of the deadly contaminants, but added, ''The issue is not how much is there, it's the fact that it's present.'' After six months on ephedra pills, Deb Kuney was fed up with the side effects and worried that the supplement might damage her heart. She threw out the pills and returned to Tops, or Take Off Pounds Sensibly, a support group she had joined when she first tried to lose weight. ''I feel great,'' she said. Ms. Kuney now weighs 200 pounds, but would like to get back to 170. She also started working for Tops, which has a nationwide network. The organization encourages its members to lose weight the old-fashioned way: through diet and exercise. A recent survey by the National Weight-Loss Registry suggests that Tops may be on to something: of 800 Americans who have kept off 30 pounds or more for at least one year, just 4 percent have used some form of diet pill. Regular Folks' Food Can Actually Be Healthful MEDICAL authorities are forever scolding Americans for their wicked ways at the dinner table. A growing body of scientific evidence, however, argues that some staples of the American diet -- regular-guy grub usually chosen for economy and convenience -- can enhance your health, too. Consider these nutritional overachievers: * Ketchup: The condiment of choice for fast-food diners is rich in lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that fights the degenerative effects of free radicals, highly reactive molecules that are byproducts of metabolism. Raw tomatoes contain lycopene, too, but cooking them makes it easier to absorb. Tomato sauce and tomato juice are also loaded with the compound. According to the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, people who eat a lot of tomato-based foods can reduce their risk of developing cancer by 40 percent. And a 1996 study at the University of Kentucky in Lexington involving 88 elderly nuns found that those who had the highest blood levels of the antioxidant required the least living assistance. * Beans: Lowly beans are often ridiculed for the gastrointestinal chaos they can cause. But diet experts praise them. ''All beans are nutritional powerhouses,'' proclaimed a recent article in Nutrition Action Healthletter. The article noted that a half cup of cooked and drained kidney beans provides 30 percent of the daily value recommended for folate, or folic acid, and 25 percent for fiber. Folate helps prevent certain types of birth defects and may reduce heart disease. * Peanut Butter: Heart-friendly olive oil may be the cornerstone of the famously healthful Mediterranean diet, but an equally rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids can be found in virtually every American home. In addition to these cholesterol-lowering acids, peanut butter is rich in folate and vitamin E, both good for cardiovascular health. A study at Loma Linda University in California, involving 31,000 Seventh-day Adventists, determined that people who eat peanuts and other nuts five times a week cut their heart disease risk in half.
