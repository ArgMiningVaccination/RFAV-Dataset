OBIIMH with DNNDSA as a co-extractant showed a lack a related bidentate aromatic ligand, 2,2-pyridylimidazole, which showed preference for Ni(II) ions. The nickel(II) specificity, through stereochemical \"tailor-making\", was not achieved as expected and the extracted species were isolated to study the underlying chemistry. The homemade metal sulfonate salts, M(RSO3 )2 \u00b76H2 ), used precursors of the metal complexes of BIIMH2 using toluene-4-sulfonic acid as the representative sulfonate. Spectroscopic analysis and single-crystal X-ray analysis supported the formation of similar neutral distorted octahedral sulfonato complexes through the bis coordination of BIIMH2 and two sulfonate ions rather than the formation of cationic complex species with anion coordination of sulfonates. We attributed the observation of similar complex species and the similar stability constants of the bis -complexes in solution as the cause for the lack of pH-metric separation of the later "}
