I realize you are giving your expertise to those who need you so much. You are brave, faithful, hardworking, have a beautiful soul and love is the answer. You are showing your love in a desperate time for your patients. There are so many people working including maintenance staff, delivery persons getting patients to X-ray, MRI, CT scans, CNAs, RNs, Doctors and all those who are doing the scans. In addition, there must be a need for receptionists and clerks. The stress of not knowing if you will have all the things you need like masks, gowns, hats, gloves, etc. must weigh on you also.

You are all appreciated beyond words.\" - Robyn Z. \"Thank you for all your amazing work through this trying time - you are the real SUPERHEROES.\" - Rosemary B. \"Thanking you is not enough. I don't know if anything could be \"enough\" to thank you for all that you do. Yes, I know you have families.... just like I do. Yes, I know that you are worried about your families...just like I am. And that is where the similarities end. I am not as brave as you are, nor as selfless. I don't know if I could be as strong as you are and continue every day seeing things that I probably will never see in my lifetime. Sure, I hear about it. But I don't see it first hand, as you do. I don't know that on top of everything you do.... you also become a family member.... the liaison between the living and the dying. It takes my breath away to think of that. I am humbled. I don't know if I could come home bone tried to my own family and be there for them....and then return the next day with renewed strength to be there for other people's families. I don't know how you do it.... where that extra store of energy comes from.... but I thank you for it from the bottom of my heart. You are the HEROES in this battle. You are the rock stars!!! When this is over (perhaps that is a naive statement), but when this is over enough for you to fully recharge.... I hope you are given the opportunity to do just that. I hope the opportunity comes soon when you can be with your families and not be afraid of infecting them. I know the opportunity will come when you can fully give to your families without worrying about those in your charge. If wishes were riches, I would buy an island somewhere where it is warm and calm and beautiful ONLY for health care professionals and their families to relax, have your every whim catered to and not have to wear all those protective clothes and to finally be worry free. I feel helpless compared to you. Perhaps I should be doing more. How can I help others (besides giving away rolls of toilet paper and paper towels!)? How can I do my part? Yes, the scales are tipped, and you guys are the ones that are doing the brunt of all the work. You guys are the ones. I don't know how you do it.... but you do. Every single day. And I am profoundly grateful to you for what you do. It doesn't seem enough to say, \"be well\" or \"stay strong\". I wish I knew the words, the perfect words to let you know how much I admire, respect and appreciate you. Love to you and your families. Thank you.\" - Ethelinn B. \"Thank you for all your hard work.

Thank you.\" - Wade \"Thank you for your efforts, thank you for your compassion, thank you for your toughness, and thank you for your dedication to care for and heal the sick. Without you and your sisters and brothers across this great country of ours, this would be a much scarier place and a much scarier time. With you in place and us working hard to remain socially distanced and staying at home this too shall pass. Together we shall overcome. Thank You and God Bless. Stay Healthy.\" - Bob S. \"I want to say I appreciate all that you're doing to keep people safe, keep them alive, and protect yourselves as well. I am sure it is increasingly difficult to work so hard for so many hours and then go home and have to keep your distance from your loved ones. I want you to know that your efforts have not gone unnoticed or unappreciated. I hope that I never have the need to meet any of you during this crisis, but you're in my thoughts and prayers.

Our society would be lost without you.\" - Mark S. \"In these exhausting, trying times we grapple with the \"whys?\" and \"how can this be happening?\". It is with my deepest gratitude that every one of YOU all have been chosen as caregivers of the highest rank. Indeed, you've known your calling, but it is in CRISIS that your purpose is revealed, and your strength and resilience is honed and exposed. You are being chiseled into your very greatest self. Your hands, your knowledge, your compassion is being sculpted into a perfect example of your Creator's hand. You are earning your angel's wings. Author Dennis Orteman reveals that suffering \"opens our hearts to a fuller life, if it is embraced in hope.\" You are experiencing personal suffering and represent hope each day you show up for work, sacrificing family time, holding a patient's hands and guiding absent family members through diagnosis and treatments. You display the fullest extent of your purpose on earth when you sit with a patient who will lose this battle but be fully glorified in heaven. You learn in this time, the very intentional, and perfect being you were created to become and the contribution to the greatest purpose of LOVE that you serve. There is no job, or task greater than the next. As a health serving community, you are equal. May you feel the gratitude of the world. May you know the prayers focused on you for strength. May you feel so very much appreciated! May you know that you are warriors of HOPE. Bless you.\" - Becky N. \"My family is forever grateful for your willingness to work tirelessly on the front lines as we battle this pandemic.

There is no way that we could make it without you. It really takes a strong, comforting, hardworking, faithful group of people like you.

Many thanks in advance for all that you do.\" - Ingrid H. \"My wife and I want to say a GREAT BIG THANK YOU for all your terrific work and sacrifice to care for all the needy during this terrible time.

No words can express what you are doing for me and the public. In turn, if I can help reduce the spread by following guidelines and taking care not to expose myself or if I am a carrier to expose others, I will stay home, keep social distancing, clean, clean and clean all I can to help reduce contamination. I can do that while you do what you are doing. May God be with you all through this crisis and may he reward you a thousand-fold for your service to humanity.

Nurses are the soul of the hospital\" - Dave W. \"Dearest doctors, nurses, medical assistants of every kind, house cleaning crews, food service crews. All of you who have put your hand to the job needed to maintain our hospitals, emergency-care facilities, clinics and other medical support units. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You are commended for your commitment, faithfulness, bravery and willingness to put yourself in possible, even probable harm's way to see patients have your help, care and your skills that are needed.

Thanks to the job you do every day. You move the country forward.\" - Michele M. \"Thank you for being there to take care of us. This must be a most difficult time for you with perhaps the most dangerous conditions you have ever faced. Caring for your patients is now overshadowed by the harm that very care may do to yourself or, by extension, your family. The selflessness inherent in your job under normal conditions is now raised to the level of those occupations that face life-threatening circumstances daily. Please take good care of yourselves, your family and your co-workers, and with our most sincere best wishes we pray this will all be over soon.\" - John & Lani M. \"Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the care you provided to me personally in the past but more recently for your courage, stamina and love that you provide for your entire community in these trying times. It is the faith you provide just by showing up every day that keeps the hope alive that we shall survive this pandemic. My family and I believe that love will conquer all and the love you show for your responsibilities, your institution, your professions, your patients, your communities and your performance under the most trying of circumstances earns our love and respect for you. We pray on that you stay safe and healthy so that we can all put our families back together someday soon. We also pray that somehow the deniers will wake up and pay attention so that they will not be a continuing to endanger you and the rest of us. Thank you\" - Charles H. \"From one nurse to my sister & brother nurses on the front lines: I've spent over 25 years in the operating room with a lot of that time in the Banner system, so have also seen and worked around a lot of infectious disease myself. I pray for all of you often. I know what it's like to walk into a room to work with an aids patient back in the 1980's before Science even knew how it spread we had no idea if we would get it by touching them, worked with necrotizing fasciitis when it first came out and doctors were consulting each other & trying whatever antibiotic cocktails they could experiment with to save lives and then there was MRSA....... This seems to never end, but it does. Sometimes I sweated in places I didn't even know could sweat, just out of fear. I remember stuffing it back down, kept on moving, doing my job. I understand how you are feeling. I had also had a decontam place in my garage/laundry room, then went straight to the shower after getting home from work; all before holding my baby boy each night. I just need you to know that what I see here in Phoenix is a whole lot of good going on. People are kinder, people are staying in, People are standing patiently in lines 6 feet apart and not short tempered with others, people are wearing face masks and latex gloves. Sometimes it feels like I'm back in the hospital working for all the face masks and latex gloves I see on others. I've never seen people pull together and work towards a common cause like this before in my whole life. One morning this week I opened my front door, and, on my porch, mat was a bottle of hand sanitizer with a stickie note on it stating, \"Hello Neighbor, this is for you please stay safe\". Personally, I'm spending my extra time now sewing face masks for family, neighbors and friends to keep them safe. Phoenix will flatten this curve for you sooner than the news predicts. I know they will. For myself, I've aged out of being able to work in the hospital now, too old to push oversized patients around a corner in a gurney, lift those heavy ortho trays, or put up with ornery surgeons. But I can pray for you all and I do. I made it, and you and your family will make it also. Oh, and I can also bequeath you my only son. He grew up 6' 2\" nice & healthy and is now heading into nursing school himself next semester! ((Proud mama here)). Remember, God loves you, trust in Him and go with God. With all my love.\" - An old Nurse \"We are so very grateful for all the doctors, nurses and staff at all the Banner Hospitals for their faithful service to the public during this pandemic. Hang in there for hopefully, this will all be over soon. God bless all of you and keep you safe. Very respectfully,\" - Mr. and Mrs. Raymond H. \"All of you are amazing and brave for performing assistance that so many of us need. I have wondered how you feel, considering many of you can't stay home with your families. Your calmness, friendliness, and caring creates a positive atmosphere when I come in for appointments. I want to thank you for being there when I needed you.\" - Nancy E. \"I just wanted to send you all my gratitude and respect for the work you are doing for our community and the world. You inspire me, and I hope you know how much your work means to everyone around you.

Thank you \" - Adelle M. \"There are not enough words to tell you all how much we appreciate what you do. Not just during this crisis, but every hour of every day.

We feel that you are our guardian angels.\" - Peggy B. \"I personally want to thank you Doctors, Nurses, Administrative Staff and Technicians for your constant care for all that have this done and are doing for your patients during this horrible COVID-19 disease. I pray for all of you daily, and recognize you are all gracious to not bow out and leave us (patients) to our own problems no matter what our sickness is - COVID-19 or otherwise. In my heart I call you the brave, the kind and above all HEROES to sacrifice yourself at this time and to not shy away when I know all of you have family and you own lives to go home to and also to make sure that you don't go home to infect them. God Bless you.\" - Virginia S. \"Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all you do! Whenever I get bored staying home, I consider how trivial is such a problem, compared to what you face all day long. Stay well, stay strong, and God be with you.\" - Janice B. \"A heartfelt thank you to all the medical professionals and the staff members of Banner Health for safeguarding our community and providing medical assistance to the individuals who are admitted to the hospital. You have put your lives on the line, and you are all to be commended for your service to us all. You are true HEROES!\" - Diane S. \"A \"thank you\" hardly expresses enough how much you have done for all of us! You risk your health and lives for strangers every day, at the very front lines of this deadly virus! Under hard conditions without all the PPE that you needed to help keep you safe! I don't think anyone can even imagine all that you risk each day and the fear of carrying the virus home to your family. The love and caring that you show to your dying patients. You stay by their sides, so they don't die alone. You give, when possible, families last moments to speak to their loved ones. Nothing we could say or do, could ever thank you enough! I have remained home, and I hope most of the population has done the same! I truly believe this is the only solution that might help prevent the spread. For all you've done and continue to do, God bless you and keep you safe!\" - Linda T. \"Thank you all for what you do! Your chosen field is a challenging one, made much more so by the current conditions, but you all seem to take it in stride and do what needs to be done. We all owe our lives to you!\" - Craig L. \"While most of us are sitting at home complaining about the huge disruption to our lives you are leaving the safety of your home every day fighting the fight, not only dealing with tragic and intolerable situations, but also putting your own health/life on the line. There is no question that each one of you is a HERO and because of your sacrifices we will get through this. I know I speak for all of us when I say thank you is not enough.\" - Nancy S. \"I am trying to find the words to convey my admiration and appreciation for all you are doing for mankind. What a loving sacrifice you are making to care for those who contract the virus and to stem the rise of the virus. You are making the ultimate sacrifice of endangering your own life to ease the pain and treat others and saving many lives. I am so saddened that you do this with great sacrifice to your own health and the worry and concern of your families. You are true HEROES and greatly appreciated. But words don't seem like enough. It seems like such a little contribution, such a little sacrifice to just stay home and take care of ourselves. It feels so selfish, but I do understand and believe that it is what stops the spread and will lighten your load in the long term. So, I am doing that. I try to think of ways I can help others from my home, and do what I can, but it doesn't compare to what you are doing.\" - Marlene M. \"I brought my husband into the emergency department and he was admitted for three days. I deeply appreciate your care and dedication to the patients during this dangerous time. I couldn't be with him, which was very hard, but both doctors and nurses were great and talked to me on the phone while they were with him. I also liked having the messages sent to me regarding the status of his care. God bless you all and keep you safe.\" - Maurine S. \"I am sending this email to all the Nurses, Technical Staff, Doctors, Maintenance Staff, Clerical Staff and volunteers working not only at Banner Health, but at all Hospitals. I am having a difficult time conveying in words the feelings of thanks and gratitude I am feeling for all you dedicated and fearless medical professionals and support staff. Even though my wife and I have been very lucky (so far) to have not been affected by the coronavirus, we see from all the news coverage the dedication and sacrifice you and your families are all making in order to give those afflicted with this horrible virus a fighting chance to survive. You are literally jumping into the fire to save those that cannot fend for themselves. I believe with all my heart that there is a special place in Heaven for brave, dedicated, selfless people like you. As I write this, \"Thank You\" seems to have too little a meaning during times like these. But that's all our language has. So again, thank you, thank you from the depths of our souls. May God bless you, guide you and protect you today, tomorrow and all the days of your lives. From our hearts to yours.\" - Steve and Judy T. \"We have been practicing social distancing and wearing masks so hopefully will never need to see you in these trying times, but wonderful to know that you are there- taking care of those that need YOU. Thank you for all you do. My daughter is a Physician in Wisconsin, so I know some of what you are going thru. HUGS to all.\" - Marie and Rodney \"I prayed today for all the medical men & women that are constantly helping all of us right now on the frontlines. I prayed that God would give them wisdom on how to help each & every patient they meet. I also prayed that God would give them wisdom on how to care for themselves during this craziness we are now calling life. Prayed blessings over each & every one of them! I cannot thank all of you enough! Make sure you get the rest you need so you can keep being the strong super HEROES you already are! God bless!\" - Teah \"Dear angels of mercy who put your lives on the line each day for us at home, you deserve many blessings of courage and bravery. Stay strong during these tough times and trust in the Lord. I'm proud of you all. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\" - Barb P. \"No one can describe the exhaustion you must feel, grabbing a 15-minute rest, then back at it, missing your families. You chose this field to help people. I wonder if you realized how back-breaking this could 'really' be. How thankful we are that you did. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for making this sacrifice to help people you don't know. Each person you help you may not always remember, but rest assured, they will always remember you.\" - Pamela G. \"My heart and all that it encompasses goes out to you and your loved ones that worry about you. If there was a way to put a bundle of protection around you, I would give up any treasure that I own just so that you would be safe. God bless you and give you strength.\" - Carol P. \"Thank you doesn't seem like enough but it's all I've got! In my 79 years I thought I'd seen HEROES, but I hadn't by a long shot! Your courage and bravery raise you up to unknown levels. Thank you for all you are doing and the grace with which you do it. You represent the best of us. Thank you, thank you!! Be safe and know that you are loved.\" - Karen A. \"My prayer for you: Dear Lord, we pray for your special protection to all medical staff and those people who are directly dealing with the patients. Protect them at all costs. Sustain them Lord during these very difficult and demanding times. Amen.\" Anonymous submission \"Thank you \"all\" for what you are doing through this very difficult and turbulent times. Our society has a new appreciation for the people in the front lines of the medical field, from office personnel - to the nurses and doctors - to the security personnel people - to all the hospital staff that keep the areas clean and the people fed, I \"thank you all\" from every part of my heart. God Bless and may you all be safe while giving your best.\" - C.S. \"Dear friends, words alone could never express the love and gratitude we have for your valiant efforts. Please know that we hold you all in prayers of safety and continuing strength and health. You truly are angels sent from God and although you can't see us, we are with you in spirit. Peace and blessings to you all!\" - Debbie & James G. "}
