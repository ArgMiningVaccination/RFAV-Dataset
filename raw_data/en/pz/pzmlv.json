Osteopathy Can your friends or loved ones tell if they're subluxated? A. Yes B. No C. Sometimes, but not usually Answers: c b b e b b f c c c Too many people believe that chiropractic is only for neck or back pain. Think for a minute. The nerves from your brain and spinal cord go to every part of your body. If there is a problem in the spine that causes a nerve interference it could affect just about anything. A patient told me a few months ago that she had to get up 3 or 4 times during the night to use the bathroom for as long as she can remember. A few adjustments to remove a nerve interference enabled her to sleep most of the night for the first time in years! Another patient complained of body aches and pains, depression and anxiety. One nutritional supplement made her feel better than she's felt in 15 years! The average person sees 180,000 commercials telling them to take some kind of over-the-counter or prescription drug by the time they're 25 years old! The drug industry spends BILLIONS of dollars a year advertising their products that kill over 100,000 Americans each year. If chiropractic had just a quarter of that money we wouldn't have to educate our patients every day on what true health is. This is the only way I can make my community healthy because I don't have the money to advertise like drug companies do. Subluxations are bad for your health. And health will NEVER be found by taking ANY drug! The ONLY thing a drug does is cover up a symptom! A drug never corrects the source of a problem. Get a checkup today!
