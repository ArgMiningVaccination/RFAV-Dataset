What is the importance of the lymphatic system? Our lymphatic system is amazing! It is essentially the waste removal service for the entire body. The lymphatic system removes toxins, excess water, protein, and wastes that are a natural byproduct of cell metabolism. It removes large-chain fat molecules, cell debris, bacteria, viruses, cancer cells, and inorganic materials that have made their way into our body structure. The lymphatic system works in concert with the blood circulatory system. It is a one-way transit that collects wastes from the area between the cells and moves them to the lymph nodes for processing. Eventually, the lymph is returned to blood circulation where it is further processed and excreted. Lymphocytes are immune cells that are transported by the lymphatic systemThe lymphatic system is powered only by your breathing and muscular movements!. If your lymphatic circulation is not functioning effectively, wastes and toxins will accumulate and immune cells will not be sent throughout the body. Thus you could experience achy joints, pains, allergies, and swelling. This can also weaken your body's ability to fight infection and disease. With the rising spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), there's no doubt that you need to focus on building a healthy, strong immune system to ward off infections. 6 ways to cleanse your lymphatic system and boost immunity - Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) is a wonderfully nurturing, comforting, and relaxing way to stimulate the lymph system. MLD is a type of massage that utilizes light, exacting strokes to move the lymph in a specific direction. It thoroughly addresses the body parts it treats and provides a forum for the body to rest, restore, and rejuvenate. The MLD hand technique calms nerve endings and is therefore effective in soothing painful, stressed tissues. - Dry skin brushing is a simple technique that can make a significant difference in the functioning of your lymphatic system. Dry brushing with a natural bristle brush in the direction of lymph flow causes the superficial lymphatics in the surface of the skin to contract and move fluid along the normal pathway. This results in the decongestion of the body, ridding the body of toxins, invader cells, and excess water. - Deep diaphragmatic breathing Deep diaphragmatic breathing is the best way of circulating the lymph. Breathe in slowly and deeply pushing the belly out and then let the breath go slowly and completely. Deep, slow diaphragmatic breathing for 10 minutes a day will oxygenate the blood and also circulate the lymph. Deep breathing effectively improves lymph flow, especially assisting those with lipedema and lymphedema. It helps eliminate toxins, improves metabolism, assists the intestinal lymph nodes to absorb fat, and also boosts the body's immune system. Deep breathing promotes health and healing because it helps to reduce lymphatic stasis. - Rebounding on a mini-trampoline is an extremely effective activity for circulating lymph fluid throughout the body. Rebounding is very effective at improving lymph system circulation as rhythmic gravitational force caused by jumping on a trampoline stimulates one-way valves in the vessels, thus increasing lymph flow. It is recommended to do deep breathing as you are on the rebounder. A gentle bouncing motion maintained for up to two minutes is also effective to move lymphocytes, the white blood cells, through the body via one-way valves. After rebounding white blood cells of the immune system triple in number and remain elevated for an hour. These specialized cells play a major role in the body's defense against illness and disease. - Whole-body vibration (WBV) Advocates of WBV say that as little as 15 minutes a day of whole-body vibration three times a week may aid weight loss, burn fat, improve flexibility, enhance blood flow, reduce muscle soreness after exercise, build strength and decrease the stress hormone cortisol. Studies have shown that just one session of whole-body vibration training improves circulation. A study published in Medical Science Monitor suggests that short duration WBV vibration in individuals with healthy microcirculation significantly increases skin blood flow for a minimum of 10 minutes. The researchers found that \"Five minutes of 30 Hz or 50 Hz vibration produced significant increases in skin blood flow.\" Whole-body vibration (WBV) has been shown to induce improvements in muscular strength and performance, as well as effect changes in peripheral circulation - Immune building diet It is crucial to eat a healthy diet with leafy green vegetables, fruit, and healthy fats to boost immunity. Avoid white refined products and sugars. This will help you to have a healthy gut microbiome and boost immunity. Eat a rainbow diet with mushrooms, garlic, Tumeric and ginger root, cruciferous vegetables such as cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussel sprouts, and vitamin C rich foods like guavas, kiwi, bell pepper strawberries, and papaya.
