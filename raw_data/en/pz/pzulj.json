YFhas largely been controlled bywidespread national vaccination campaigns.

Thus, isanurgent need togain better understanding ofthetrans- mission pattern ofYF. Model The present study provides arefined mathematical model, combined with modern likeli- hood-based statistical inference toassess andreconstruct andhypothetical strategies, andtheimpacts ofpossible human reactive behaviors (e.g., response tomedia precautions). Findings While there were 73deaths reported over thestudy period, themodel indicates thatthevac- cination campaign saved 5.1-fold more from illness 5.6-fold of theobserved 941cases.

Association between thespread ofYFand local climatic that and rainfall arepotential factors that consistently influence thelong-term transmission dynamics. Temperature wasfound tohave nosignificant effect while theeffects ofrainfall were significant butquantitatively mild inafirst analysis. The possible reasons could be:i) local precipitation isrelatively (control measures and human reaction) played amore prominent role. Nevertheless, in what follows, weconsider thepossibility that theMarch ElNi\u00f1o rainfall patterns played on Fine and Clarkson's [57] effective and well known methodology. Fine and Clarkson plotted w(i) =1i+1/1i(i.e., next week's reported cases divided diseases), forvector-borne diseases. InFig4,wefind strong waves inw(i) (the solid green line) that match theoscillations observed inR0 i\u0086(the dashed blue line). This suggests that thewaves observed inR0aremost likely afeature embedded isseen March. Unusually, theepidemic does notrapidly crash toextinction astheusual (SIR) epidemic curve would predict.

Since theoretically, R0 byvaccination, wesuppose thechanges inR0arelikely dueto changes inother factors (e.g., control measures and behavior, orpossibly weather patterns) that may influence thevector population and reaction could disease control strategies. control efforts on mosquito-eradication increased because (orfollows) thenumber ofYFcases and deaths increased. After thenational vaccination campaign began inthefirst week ofFebruary, 2016, and reported death decreased, themosquito control effort may have also slowed down (possi- blyduetolimited funding and resources). This isbiologically reasonable, and could bedueto protective behavioral changes such asusage ofinsecticide, mosquito repellent, movement restrictions, cordon sanitaire and general vector control. Thus, wehypothesize that thehuman behaviour (e.g., usage ofmosquito insecticides, repellents and nets) inresponse tocases and deaths were witnessed during Luanda's YFepidemic, ofwhich reduced disease transmission followed high mortality and vice versa. Such aprocess would drive theYFcase numbers tofol- lowdynamics that differ substantially from thestandard SIRepidemic curve, and possibly even induce waves. Similar phenomena were reported previously forthe1918 influenza pan- demic [58, 59]. Therefore, asimple based When wedothis, almost identical results areobtained (see S5Text). This simply means that thedeath data areanexcellent proxy forR0(since(i) directly drives R0(see Eq6). finally, toYFdeaths.

Precisely, thelifeofadult (female) mosquito includes three infectious period. Inthiswork, The sum oflatent and infectious periods of human is4+4=8days. Thus, theGTofYFis23days, thetime wasanElNi\u00f1o year and itbrought dramatic and unpredictable flooding events especially intheMarch-April period, thereby inmost were enhancing mosquito breeding conditions. Itissurprising that simultaneously oneofLuanda's largest malaria wave model and there isapossibility that geographic waves generated from sur- rounding provinces could play some part intheappearance ofmultiple YFwaves inLuanda province. Hence future work and more comprehensive data areneeded toexamine these possibilities. Vaccination There aremany possible ways toevaluate theeffects ofadelayed vaccination campaign when compared tothebaseline scenario that inpractice inLuanda. The approach followed (interms ofdoses theobservation confidence intervals results of60,120, ofthevaccination campaign forthe2016 yellow fever outbreak arepresented inFig5forthescenario 1(b=0.1). The total reported cases and total deaths arecalculated forfour vaccination scenarios (including thebaseline) vaccination isunavailable, vaccination or0-delay) results there were novaccination campaign inLuanda uptoAugust 2016. Allofthese results show that delaying thevaccination campaign would have greatly enhanced theepidemic interms of infectious cases and mortality.

This feature becomes even more prominent inasituation ofnovaccination (see Fig5eand 5f).Returning toFig1,we time series ofYFinLuanda, that theoutbreak may have indeed occurred over twowaves. Hence, large-scale vaccination cam- paign, implies fluctuations inthedriving force (R0)orother factors. Vaccine usage. Asdiscussed inthemain sizeof6,543,000, with 38% of thepopulation having immunity before theepidemic (November 2015). The baseline scenario characterized what happened inpractice between December 2015 and August 2016. ByAugust 2016, thevaccine-dose usages aresummarized different vaccination scenario. A180-day isconsidered When taking into account theextra 20days required tobeeffective, anyone vaccinated 180days thevaccination vation 200days. The impact goes beyond thestudy period. Anyone vaccinated inthelasttwenty days willchange their status from susceptible to recovered after 15August 2016 (i.e., theend ofthestudy period).

Delay Vaccinated popula tion since While there were inreality 73deaths reported over the37-week study period, themodel showed that thevaccination campaign saved from death 5.1-fold ofobserved deaths andprevented from illness 5.8-fold ofobserved andno many more by thepossibility that the outbreak occurred intwowaves over the37-week study period. The modelling and sensitivity analysis demonstrated that thisisarobust feature (see S5Text), which would have become far more prominent hadthevaccination campaign been reduced inintensity. The appearance of waves implies thatR0must oscillate tosome degree Reconstruction mortality, sothatR0decreases when thenumber ofdeaths increase, and vice versa. Thus wehypothesize that thehigh death rates and number ofcases influenced Luanda's population behavioral response which inturn ledto some reduction ofdisease transmission during theyears ofhigh mortality. Behavioral responses may typically involve using more insecticide, mosquito repellent, insecticide-treated bednets and theaim ofreducing transmission through thewider [66]. 1918 influenza pandemic with afatality rate (per infection) 2%and an attack rate 1/3) [58, 59]butnever inmosquito-borne disease number (panel (a)) and total (panel (b)) with respect to model param eters.IY.0denotes theinitial susceptible 19/24typically low. Moreover, asimpler model that explicitly incorporated human behavior reproduces theobserved data inFig1(see S5Text). This may bethefirst example of mortality-driven basic reproduction number inamosquito-borne disease outbreak. While this which inturn could influence mosquito population numbers. Such aprocess could occur even ifthere isno visible long-term correlation between climate (rainfall) and thevector dynamics.
