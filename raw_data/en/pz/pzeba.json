Tongue and pulse diagnosis, Chinese herbs, nutrition, and acupuncture comprise the ancient practices of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Although this medical system dates back some 3,000 years, it was only introduced to North America at the turn of the century. TCM has even more recently become a respected alternative therapy in the West during the last decade. A TCM diagnosis is holistic in nature. The practitioner trained in Traditional Chinese Medicine will take into consideration all the aspects of the individual, including special observation of the tongue and the wrist pulses. These two areas (among others), according to TCM, tell the practitioner about certain characteristics of the person regarding their overall constitution. These findings tell the practitioner what treatment is needed. Acupuncture Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine needles through the skin and tissue at specific points on the body. There is no injection of any substances, and the treatment itself causes minimal discomfort. Acupuncture has been found to be effective in treating a variety of painful disorders, both acute and chronic. The World Health Organization in 1979 drew up the following provisional list of disorders that lend themselves to acupuncture treatment. The list is based on clinical experience and not necessarily controlled clinical research: - Digestive disorders such as gastritis, hyperacidity, spastic bowl, constipation, and diarrhea. - Respiratory disorders such as sinusitis, bronchitis, asthma. - Neurological and muscular disorders such as headaches, neck and back pain, neuralgia, frozen shoulder, tennis elbow, sciatica, and arthritis. - Urinary, menstrual, and reproductive disorders. - Addiction and substance abuse. - Sleep disorders such as insomnia and sleep apnea. According to TCM, acupuncture works due to its effect on the essential substance that makes up the human body and enables it to sustain life activities and functions. This \"substance,\" for a lack of a better word, is known as Chi or Qi (pronounced \"chee\"). Western biomedical research has learned that acupuncture works in certain situations by stimulating the body to produce endorphins, a morphine-like chemical that helps block pathways that relay pain messages. The result is relief from pain, general relaxation, and restoring the body's own internal regulatory system KUNA CHIROPRACTIC DR.

I was referred to Dr. Rosenlund because of how well he treated me after I was involved in an auto accident and sustained whiplash injuries. I met Dr. Rosenlund several years ago after he successfully treated one of my high school baseball players for an elbow and shoulder injury. I've sent several of my athletes to see him over the years as I have the utmost confidence in his abilities and know that they will receive the best care possible for a wide range of sports injuries. After getting hurt on the job, I was referred to Kuna Chiropractic for neck and back pain so I could feel better and get back to work quickly. "}
