Diet is intrinsically linked to your sense of well-being, and what you consume can aid your physical and mental systems in numerous ways. Certain foods, for example, support your immune system and natural defenses. Rather than acting as a treatment or cure of any kind, they infuse your body with the right nutrients to prevent and fight off colds, the flu, and other illnesses. Your body needs a wide variety of different foods, vitamins, and nutrients to be at its best. Here is a look at seven foods that can help keep your [immune system strong](https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/features/enhance-immunity/index.html): In general, berries are a beneficial part of your diet because they are low in calories but high in antioxidants, vitamin C, and fiber. Elderberry and acai berries, in particular, are loaded with antioxidants. Elderberries can help fight inflammation, as well.

Raw garlic\u2014not garlic powder\u2014can help fight bacteria, viruses, and fungi and boost your immunity, thanks to a heavy concentration of sulfur-containing compounds. Additionally, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, garlic may help lower your blood pressure and cholesterol. Spinach contains fiber and vitamin C, as well as folate, a vitamin that can assist your body in creating new cells and repairing DNA. It's also rich in antioxidants and beta carotene that can boost your immune system's infection-fighting ability. To maximize the nutritious benefits of spinach, it's best to consume the vegetable raw or only lightly cooked. Broccoli is also rich in vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, C, and E, and glutathione, an antioxidant that can prevent damage to important cellular components in your body. Like spinach, you should eat broccoli raw to get most of its immune-boosting potential. Mushrooms can do a lot for your body, from supporting strong immunity to alleviating stress and anxiety. Some of the best mushroom varieties to consider adding to your diet include reishi, lion's mane, chaga, shiitake, and turkey tail mushrooms. Button mushrooms also contain the mineral selenium and the B vitamins niacin and riboflavin. In addition to alleviating nausea, ginger contains antioxidants and other nutrients that can help prevent or treat inflammation, arthritis, and other types of infection and chronic pain. Ginger also has cholesterol-lowering properties. The best ways to consume ginger are in tea or sliced up in stir-fries or other dishes. Citrus has a reputation for helping people fight colds. That's because citrus fruits are rich in vitamin C, which is believed to support the production of white blood cells that are critical to fighting infections. The human body doesn't produce vitamin C, which is why it is essential to get it from an alternative source, such as grapefruits, oranges, lemons, limes, and tangerines.
