WaQi to Boost Immune Function In a wait-list control trial at the University of Illinois we found that the WaQi curriculum can help enhance high risk individuals' immune response to flu vaccine. We hypothesize that the positive effect was due to enhanced autonomic nervous system function derived from the combination of standing and sitting qigong and the gentle t'ai chi movements. About WaQi WaQi is a powerful, scientifically supported practice for improving physical, spiritual and mental health (including immune response). Combining carefully selected elements of qigong, t'ai chi, and meditation, WaQi works to develop strength, resilience and mental calmness and composure in the face of real-life challenges. What is WaQi for Stress, Mood, and Sleep? This program involves standing, sitting and moving meditation. Guided sitting meditation focuses on changing the mental and spiritual \"set\" in the face of crisis to produce a sense of peace and tranquility. The standing and moving meditations focus on building internal energy, core strength, deep relaxation and coordinated movement. About Master Yang Yang, PhD. This course is developed and taught by an internationally renowned teacher, Dr. Yang, who was trained in classic Chinese martial and healing arts by famous masters in China. He is also a trained researcher (PhD, University of Illinois) whose randomized controlled studies of the positive effects of qigong and t'ai chi are noteworthy in this field of research. He has refined and distilled his teaching methods through experience and long years of practice. Effectiveness The effectiveness of this program is underscored by our NIH funded, randomized controlled study that found that these methods reduced anxiety and improved sleep quality. It is also supported by an earlier study that found improved immune response among participants in a 5- month trial of this program. Practicality The online program involves seven daily 15-minute easily managed lessons. These can be taken with you and practiced at any time and in any place.
