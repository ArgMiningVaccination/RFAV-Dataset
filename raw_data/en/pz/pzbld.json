This Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP) establishes policies and procedures to ensure the safe use of hazardous chemicals w ithin all University -owned laboratories . The purpose of this plan is to protect laboratory worker health and ensure that chemical exposures are minimized. I t also defines roles and responsibilities for working with hazardous chemicals, details provisions for lab worker training, outlines emergency proc edures, and establishes a number of safe ty practices that must be observed when handling hazardous chemicals . SCOPE This plan applies to all laboratory personnel employed by the university who work with, use, store, or handle hazardous chemicals. This document is discussed and made available to students working in all science laboratories during laboratory safety training and is available at all times on the AU website. It is intended to provide overarching structure and guidance to all science research laboratories. REGULATIONS This CHP complies with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations contained in 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.1450, the \"Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in the Laboratory\" standard and 29 CFP 1910 Subpart Z, \"Toxic and Hazardous Substances .\" ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES Successful implementation of the CHP is dependent on clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The roles and responsibilities of laboratory personnel are described below. EH&S AND CHEMICAL HYGIENE OFFICER (CHO) The CHO is responsible for administering the CHP and minimizing the health hazards of potentially hazardous chemicals used in the laboratories. This position is located within the Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) office and e nsure s that regulatory and university requirements for hazardous ch emicals are met.

ALL PERSONNEL WHO HANDLE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS All personnel who handle potentially hazardous chemicals are required to: Plan and conduct each laboratory operation in accordance with the requirements of the CHP, good laboratory practices , and as described in the appropriate SOPs ; Apply all recommended exposure controls (e.g., laboratory hoods or other engineered controls, PPE, o r safety equipment provided); Participate in all required training programs ; Respond appropriately to emergencies as directed ; Report all accidents resulting in personal injury or property damage to the laboratory supervisor ; and Report all hazardous condi tions and safety concerns to their supervisor . Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 4 CHAPTER 2: HAZARD COMMUNICATION INVENTORY University policy requires each individual in control of hazardous chemicals to maintain an accurate chemical inventory in order to minimize waste, track reporting limits, and comply with hazard communication laws. The College of Arts and Sciences uses the external ChemInventory site to manage their chemical inventory. Researchers barcode each chemical container and upload to the site prior to storing on American University property. CHEMICAL LABELS Labeling requirements for all hazardous substances are summarized as follows: All containers of haz ardous materials must be labeled with the identity of the hazardous substance. The chemical name must be spelled out; no chemical nomenclature or shorthand . The label must contain all applicable hazard warning statements . The name and address of the chemical manufacturer or other responsible party must be present. Manufacturer's product labels must remain on all containers and must not be defaced in anyway as long as it still holds the original chemical. Labels must be legible and in English. Secondary containers (such as spray bottles) must be labeled with the identity of the substance and appropriate hazard warnings. Newly s ynthesized compounds (compounds made within the lab) must be labeled with the appropriate hazard warnings based on the knowledge of the chemical and physic al properties of that substance . Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 5 SAFETY DATA SHEETS Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) must be maintaine d for each hazardous chemical used or stored on university - owned property. SDSs that comply with the Globally Harmonized System, or GHS, are preferred. The format for the GHS SDS is as follows: Section No. Heading Components 1 Identification of substance and supplier GHS product identifier Recommended use of the chemical and restrictions on use Supplier 's details (name, address, phone number) Emergency phone number 2 Hazards identification GHS classification of the substance GHS elements, including precautionary statements 3 Composition/information on ingredients Chemical identity Common name, synonyms, etc. CAS number, EC number, etc. Impurities and additives that contribute to the classification of the substance 4 First aid measures Description of necessary measures, subdivided according to different routes of exposure Most important symptoms/effects Indication of immediate medical attention and special treatment needed 5 Firefighting measures Suitable extinguishin g media Specific hazards arising from the chemical Special protective equipment and precautions for firefighters 6 Accidental release measures Personal precautions, protective equipment, and emergency procedures Environmental precautions Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up 7 Handling and storage Precautions for safe handling and storage 8 Exposure controls/personal protection Control parameters Appropriate engineering controls Individual protection measures, such as PPE 9 Physical and chemical properties Appearance, odor, odor threshold, pH, melting point/freezing point, boiling point and range, flash point, evaporation rate, flammability, vapor pressure, vapor density, relative density, solubilities, partition coefficient, autoignition temperature, decomposition temperature 10 Stability and reactivity Chemical stability Possibility of hazardous reactions Conditions to avoid Incompatible materials Hazardous decomposition products 11 Toxological information The likely routes of exposure Symptoms Delayed and immediate effects Measure of toxicity 12 Ecological toxicity Ecotoxicity, degradability, bioaccumulative potential 13 Disposal considerations Description of waste residues and information on their safe handling and disposal, including contaminated packaging 14 Transport information UN Number, UN proper shipping name, transport hazard classes, packing group, special transport precautions 15 Regulatory information Safety, health, and environmental regulations specific to the product in question 16 Other information Preparation and revision dates of the SDS Existing SDSs can be viewed on AU' s chemical inventory platform, ChemInventory . Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 6 GHS PICTOGRAMS Pictograms are used on all GHS- compliant Safety Data Sheets and chemical labels to characterize the most prominent hazards associated with that chemical. The nine pictograms and their meanings are summarized below. Acute toxicity (fatal or toxic) Carcinogen Respiratory sensitizer Reproductive toxicity Target organ toxicity Mutagenicity Aspiration toxicity Flammable Self-reactive Pyrophoric Self-heating Emits flammable gas Organic peroxide Corrosive Oxidizer Explosive Self-reactive Organic peroxide Gas under pressure Environmental toxicity Irritant Dermal sensitizer Acute toxicity (harmful) Narcotic effects Respiratory tract irritation SIGNS AND PLACARDS LABORATORY ENTRY SIGNS PURPOSE Laboratory entry signs at American University help visitors and first responders quickly identify science laboratory spaces, which typically have restricted entry requirements and may contain unique hazards . They also convey precautions that should be observed upon e ntering the space and provide emergency contact information. Researchers, Public Safety, and Facilities Management are trained to understand the information on the entry signs so that they can make the best use of the information should they need to refer ence it. DESCRIPTION Signs are 8.5\" x 11\" prints placed either directly on or adjacent to the hallway access point (door) of the laboratory. Each sign is composed of six sections, each of which presents important safety information to lab workers, visitor s, and first responders. The signs do not convey all hazards that may be present in the lab at any given time but are meant to be a good starting point in case of an emergency. The entry requirements and hazards sections contain symbols, which are adop ted from OSHA, ANSI, and ISO 3864 -2 standards. Each symbol and section are described in further detail below. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 7 HAZARD WARNING SYMBOLS Exposure to items may cause immediate and possibly serious health problems or death . Biological materials present, which may cause disease or infection in humans . Area used to store large volume of chemicals (>10 gallons of flammable liquids or >55 gallons total hazardous chem icals) Gas under pressure present Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 8 Acidic or basic chemicals present that can severely damage the skin or eyes Items may cause severe damage or impact if released into the environment Items may react violently when exposed to heat, friction, or physical shock Items have a liquid flash point below 199.4\u00b0F (93\u00b0C) ( i.e., will ignite when exposed to 199.4\u00b0F or above) Limited exposure to these items can cause serious health effects, including cancer, cellular mutations, and/or damage to an embryo or fetus Potentially cancer -causing radioactive materials present Exposure to items may cause inflammation or irritation, especially involving the respiratory system Any level of laser present, may be contained within equipment or un shielded Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 9 Equipment may exceed 85 dB when running Microwave producing equipment present Non -cancer -causing radiation present, such as ultraviolet light, radiofrequency, microwave sources, or lasers Oxidizing materials that may cause other materials to ignite and/or explode PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT SYMBOLS A splash or chemical resistant apron is requ ired. A dust mask, N -95, or other particle -filtering facepiece is required. A face shield is required to protect from splashes or aerosols. Foot protection is required. Minimally, this means close d-toe shoes. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 10 A half -face respirator is required to be worn. (These are typically cartridge - filtered respirators, not to be confused with dust masks/N -95s). Some form of hand protection is required - typically this is for thermal or chemical protection ( e.g., nitrile, latex, temperature -resistant mitts). Hearing protection is required. Laboratory coats must be worn while in the lab. Impact -resistant safety glasses must be worn . Splash protection feature not required. Safety goggles (typically indirect vent, splash guard) must be worn. Entrants should wash hands with soap and water prior to exiting the lab. WARNING STATEMENTS This section contains customized statements for items present in the lab and are meant to expand on the information provided in the Hazards section. This typically includes specific information on compressed gas cylinder contents, the kinds of biological material(s) present, laser class descriptions, etc. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 11 SAFETY EQUIPMENT This section lists the safety equipment present in the laboratory space, such as: safety showers and eyewash stations, first aid kits, spill kits, fire extinguishers, etc. DATE AND LOCATION The Date and Location section includes information on the building, room number, and department to which the sign refers. It also includes the date the sign was posted. EMERGENCY CONTACT INFORMATION This section contains phone numbers for the primary contact (typically the Princip al Investigator) and an alternate contact (graduate assistant or other knowledgeable person designated by the primary contact). SIGN REQUEST AND INFORMATION CHANGES Lab entry signs are updated annually by the EH&S office. Si gns are based on the Principal Investigator's responses to the Annual Lab Use Survey, which collects information regarding the scope of research occurring in each laboratory space. To request an updated sign between Lab Use Surveys (typically for major edi ts or lab changes), contact the Environmental Health & Safety office. NFPA DIAMONDS An NFPA diamond may be placed on the exterior door of a space containing hazardous chemicals. This information is meant to aid emergency response personnel in the case of a fire or other emergency incident. OTHER HAZARD SYMBOLS The biohazard symbol is used to denote areas or objects that either contain or come into contact with biological agents. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 12 The radiation symbol is used to denote areas or objects that either contain or come into contact with radioactive materials or radiation- producing equipment. This typically includes items such as radio chemicals and x -ray machines. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 13 CHAPTER 3: CLASSES OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS Whenever feasible, less hazardous chemicals should be substituted for all select carcinogens, reproductive toxins, or acutely toxic chemicals . Individuals working with hazardous chemicals should consult SDSs, warning labels, and/or other sources of chemical information to become knowledgeable about the chemical's hazards prior to working with it. C hemicals that may easily become airborne (e.g., gases, volatiles, powders) should be dispensed and handled in a chemical fume hood. SELECT CARCINOGENS Select carcinogens are those substances recognized by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and/or the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). OSHA has also identified carcinogens in 29 CFR 1910.1003. IARC has evaluated over 850 chemicals, mixtures , and exposures (agents ). IARC classifies agents as: Group 1 - The agent is carcinogenic to humans. Group 2A - The agent is probably carcinogenic to humans. Group 2B - The agent is possibly carcinogenic to humans. Group 3 - The agent is unclassifiable as to carcinogenicity in humans. Group 4 - The agent is probably not carcinogenic to humans. The IARC database is available on the internet at www.iarc.fr. Laboratory supervisors should consider the need for and, as appropriate, require use of the following exposure controls for car cinogens on an as -needed basis: Work should be conducted in a \"designated area\" such as a laboratory fume hood, gl ove box, or designated portion of the laboratory where all personnel with access know the potential hazards. Plans must be prepared to include details on personal protection, area equipment, decontamination, and appropriate PPE. Plans for using and disposing of these substances should be prepared and approved by the Department Chair prior to initiation of activities. Disposal shall be in accordance with federal EPA and District regulations and should be coordinated with the university Environmental Safety Coordinator. REPRODUCTIVE TOXINS Reproductive toxins may affect both or either gender; therefore, the same recommendations previously listed for work with select carcinogens are to be applied when working with reproductive toxins. Often, this inform ation is identified on the chemical's SDS. OSHA has specific standards for lead (1910.1025), dibromochloropropane (1910.1044), 1,3- butadiene (1910.1051) and ethylene oxide (1910.1047), and they are specifically identified as reproductive toxins. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 14 Various links for reproductive toxins can be found on OSH A's web page at www.osha.gov . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also publishes lists of known toxins, which can be found http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/rtecs/ . ORGANIC PEROXIDES AND PEROXIDE FORMERS Organic peroxides (see list below) are low -power explosives that are extremely sensitive to shock, sparks, or other forms of accidental ignition. They are also sensitive to heat, friction, impact, and light as well as to strong oxidizing and reducing agents. Their slow decomposition may auto -accelerate into a violent explosion. Therefore, their shelf lives are limited . All organic peroxides are extremely flammable, and fires involving bulk quantities of peroxides should be approached wit h extreme caution. Peroxide formers should be stored away from heat and light in closed vessels. Refrigerati on is recommended. Precautions for handling peroxides include: Clearly label all containers of peroxides or peroxide -formers with BOTH the date of receipt and the date of opening. Store peroxides at the minimum safe temperature to reduce the rates of decomposition. Do not refrigerate liquid or solutions of peroxides at or below the temperature at which the peroxide freezes or precipitates. Peroxide s in these forms are extremely sensitive to shock and heat. Follow the manufacturer's recommendation for shelf life. Limit the quantity of peroxide to be handled to the minimum amount required. Do not use glass containers with screw -cap lids or glass stoppers . Use polyethylene bottles instead. Do not return unused solvent to the container. Avoid exposure to the vapor. Clean -up incidental spills immediately. Do not use solutions of peroxides or peroxide -formers in volatile solvents under conditions in which the solvent will be vaporized, thereby increasing the peroxide concentration in the solution. Never use a metal spatula with peroxides --contamination by metals can lead to explosive decompositions. Use ceramic or wooden spatulas. If a peroxide forming material has an expiration date, it must be properly labeled for disposal and moved to a waste accumulation area p rior to that expiration date. If crystal formation or precipitation is observable in a peroxide forming material, do not move it. EH&S must be notified immediately, and a deactivation scheduled. Organic peroxides must be monitored in accordance with the f ollowing procedures: Eye protection, lab coat, closed toe shoes, and gloves must be worn at all times. Without being moved , the peroxide forming material in question will be visually inspected for crystal formation. If no crystals are visible, the containe r will be moved to the nearest fume hood. The sash will be adjusted to the lowest possible height that allows free manipulation of a pipe tte. A pipet te will be used to transfer a drop of sample to a 0 -100 ppm peroxide test strip. The results of the test strip will be interpreted as follows: <25 ppm is considered safe for use Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 15 25-100 ppm is not suitable for laboratory processes, especially those involving heat, distillation, or concentration >100 ppm is considered an immediate hazard If the peroxide test strip indicates a peroxide concentration less than 25 ppm, the material will be labeled with a sticker indicating that a test for peroxides has been perfor med with the date. The material will then be returned to its original location. For peroxide concentrations between 20-100 ppm, the material will be places on a cart inside a lidded plastic bin and moved to the fume hood in the waste accumulation area. The peroxide former will be stored away from other chemicals until a deactivation and stabilization can be performed. For peroxide concentrations greater than 100 ppm, the material will not be moved, but stored in the fume hood separate from other chemicals and away for heat sources unti l a deactivation is scheduled. List of peroxide -forming chemicals Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 16 Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 17 PICRIC ACID Dry picric acid is highly explosive. Commercially supplied picric acid con tains ten to fifteen percent water . When the moisture content is less than ten percent, picric acid must be handled with extreme care because it is sensitive to shock, heat, and sparks. Avoid ing additional drying is critical. Salts of picric acid are sensitive to shock and friction in either wet or dry cond itions. To maintain ten percent or more moisture in a container of picric acid, weigh the container upon receipt from the supplier and record the weight . Before opening, weigh the container again . If there has been a weight loss, assume it contains less than ten percent water and do not open the container. Immediately contact the CHO to arrange for appropriate disposal. Old bottles of picric acid may contain crystalline deposits under the cap that may be destabilized (explode) by opening the bottle. IF IN DOUBT, DO NOT OPEN. Do not attempt to open any bottles with evidence of crystal formation . Contact the CHO to arrange for deactivation and disposal. PERCHLORIC ACID Perchloric acid is a powerful oxidizing agent that may react explosively with reducing agents and organic compounds. It may only be used in a specially constructed water wash -down fume hood that is inspected f requent ly. Bottles of perchloric acid should be kept on glass or ceramic trays that have enough volume to hold all of the acid in case the bottle breaks. FORMALDEHYDE Formaldehyde is powerful irritant and potential carcinogen . Formaldehyde vapors are irritants and can cause burning of the upper respiratory tract and eyes. The recognition of formaldehyde vapors by odor and eye irritation becomes less sensitive with time as one adapts to formaldehyde. This desensitization can quickly lead to overexposure. Skin contact with formaldehyde should be avoided because it m ay ca use irritation and allergic contact dermatitis. OSHA has established a specific standard for worker exposures to formaldehyde in 29 CFR 1910.1048 . FLAMMABLE AND COMBUSTIBLE LIQUIDS Flammable and combustible liquids shall be stored in compliance with OSHA requirements as outlined in 29 CFR 1910.106 and the DC Fire Code. In general, flammable and combustible liquids will be stored in appropriate containers inside metal storage cabinets designed and constructed in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.106(d)(3). Flammable materials shall not be stored in refrigerators or freezers that are not designed for this purpose. Flammable storage cabinets must be clearly marked and remain closed when not in use. Container size limitations for flammable and combustible liquids are summarized in Appendix C . When a flammable liquid is withdrawn from a drum, or when a drum is filled, both the drum and other equipment should be individually electrically grounded and bonded to each other. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 18 Flammable liquids must never be used in the vicinity of an open flame. When flammable liquids are used in the fume hood with electrical equipment, the equipment must be spark -proof. COMPRESSED GASES Compressed gases are hazardous because of the potenti al energy of compression and because the gas may be toxic, flammable and/or act as an asphyxiant if released in a confined area. Compressed gas cylinders must be used and stored in accordance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) guidelines and in accordance with Compressed Gas Association, Inc. (CGA) Handbook for Handling Compressed Gases. Written procedures must be developed and implem ented for each compressed gas used. The procedures must describe allowable use , engineering and administrativ e controls, and required PPE, as applicable . Toxic gasses may not be used without prior submission of written procedures to the CHO and Department Chair. Examples of toxic gases include: Boron trifluoride, Carbon monoxide Chlorine, Chlorine trifluoride, Dimethylamine, Ethylene oxide, Fluorine, Hydrogen bromide (hydrobromic acid), dioxide, Nitrogen chloride, Phosgene, Silicon tetrafluoride, and Sulfur dioxide. Cylinder size of flammable gases is limited to 200 cubic feet. Valves of flammable gas cylinders must be closed before the l aboratory is vacated at the end of the workday. If a cylinder of toxic or flammable gas is leaking the area should be ev acuated and public safety must be contacted to determine the proper course of ac tion. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 19 PRE-ACCEPTANCE REQUIREMENTS Prior to acceptance of cylinder gases from vendors, the cylinders shall be visually inspected to determine if they meet the following requirements: The contents of the cylinder(s) must be identified with decals, stencils, glue, or wired -on tags. Color codes alone or tags hung around the necks of cylinders are not acceptable. Cylinders must not be accepted unless the valve safety covers are in place and properly tightened. Vendors moving cylinders in university buildings must use hand trucks, carts, or dollies. Cylinders must remain secured at all times and may not be rolled for distances greater than three feet. Compressed gas cylinders should never be dragged. STORAGE REQUIREMENTS The following handling and storage requirements will be followed for compressed gases: Laboratory personnel must receive training on storage, handling, and hazard precautions prior to use of compressed gases. This train ing must be documented. Compressed gas cylinders shall not be moved unless the protective valve cover is securely in place. The valve safety covers must remain in place until the cylinder is secured to a wall, bench, or other stable structures. Compressed gas cylinders shall be moved on cylinder carts, hand trucks, or dollies specifically designed for this purpose. The valve safety covers must be in place and the cylinder secured to the cart during transport. Compressed gas cylinders shall not be rolled a distance greater than three feet. Compressed gas cylinders shall never be dragged. Compressed gas cylinders shall be secured at all times to prevent them from falling. They may be secured with a chain , canvas strap(s) , or a floor stand . Piping and mani folds must be constructed of materials compatible with gas in the cylinder. The main valve cylinder shall be opened only as far as necessary to produce the required gas flow and closed when the gas is not required. Cylinders shall be checked for leaks wh en received in the laboratory and before and after attachment of the regulator. Reserve cylinders shall not be stored in the laboratory. Cylinders shall be stored outside or in a separate room designed to meet NFPA standards for storage of compressed gas . Cylinders stored outside must be protected from the weather and tampering by a covered and enclosed area providing safe access and adequate security. Laboratories with toxic gases shall be equipped with proper escape respirators. Detection alarms may additionally be appropriate. Employees using these gases must be part of the University's Respiratory Safety Program. Empty cylinders shall be labeled as such as promptly removed. A small amount of gas should be left in the cylinder and the valve closed t o prevent contamination of the inside of the cylinder. Never attempt to refill an empty cylinder. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 20 RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS Any work involving radioactive materials shall b e conducted in accordance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) rules and regulations an d procedures and practices established in the university's Radiation Safety Manual. Some minimum practices to be observed include: All areas where there is a radiation hazard shall be physically isolated and appropriate signs posted to prevent persons from entering the area without being aware of the radiological hazard. Signs having the radiation symbol will be the standard for radiation hazards. The symbol will also be used to distinguish radioactive source containers. Individuals approved to procure and use radioisotopes are responsible for ensuring radioactive materials in their laboratories are properly used and secured. All r equired surveys will be conducted and documented. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 21 CHAPTER 4: REDUCING EXPOSURE TO HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS Engineering controls (such as local exhaust ventilation), administrative controls , and personal protective equipment are used to control employee exposure to chemicals. It is AU's policy to conduct personal exposure monitoring whenever there is reason to believe that chemical exposure levels for a substance exce ed the OSHA action level or Permissible Exposure Level ( PEL). Should occupational exposures exceed OSHA action limits (typically 50 percent of the OSHA PEL), monitoring will be conducted periodically in order to accurately assess personnel exposure. The activity that the employ ee is conducting that generates the exposure will also be reviewed to find methods that limit the exposure. Periodic m onitoring will be discontinued in accordance with OSHA standards when monitoring reveals exposures below OSHA limits. Employees will be notified by the CHO of monitoring results within 15 working days following receipt of any monitoring results. ENGINEERING CONTROLS Engineering controls employ the use of mechanical devices to alleviate vapors and fumes that personnel might get exposed to. They include: GENERAL VENTILATION The air pressure in laboratories should be negative relative to adjacent areas and corridors. Laboratory exhaust should provide 4 to 12 air changes per hour to maintain good ventilation and make -up air. All exit ports from spectrometer units should be connected to an efficient hood if the possibility of toxic substances being released from the spectrometer exists. FUME HOODS The chemical fume hood will help prevent the workers from exposing themselves and other coworkers to toxic chemicals. The fume hood sash shall be closed at all times unless work is being conducted inside. Employees should use chemical fume hoods whenever their work could expose them or their coworkers to hazardous chemicals, and whenever feasible. Hoods shall not be used to dispose of volatile chemicals via evaporation and should not be used for chemical storage, except for small quantities of highly toxic chemicals. Only essential equipment should be stored inside the hood and should not block vents or restrict airflow inside the hood. All attempts should be made to ensure that the airflow within the hood is not obstructed, as this decreases the efficiency of the hood. All work in the hood should take place at least six inches back from the front sash. Fume hoods shall be spot -checked by the employee for airflow before each use (a spot -check can be made by holding a tissue up to the hood opening to see if it is drawing air). If the fume hood does not draw air, the employee shall not use the hood and should contact the building equipment manager for repair. Adequate airflow is typically defined as a face velocity of 60 to 100 linear feet per minute (lfpm) with the sash open to a workable height. The sash height must be maintain ed below the breathing height of the laboratory worker. Procedures involving the use of acutely hazardous chemicals, potentially volatile liquids, finely divided solid chemicals, or where there is the potential for explosion shall be conducted in a laboratory hood or Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 22 other suitable containment. Volatile radioactive material must be used in appropriately filtered fume hoods. Laboratory fume hoods should be equipped with a continuous monitoring device to allow convenient confirmation of adequate hood performance before use, such as a pressure gauge (e.g., magnehelic gauge) or electronic air flow meter. If the monitoring device is not functioning properly, please submit a 2Fix ticket. Laboratory personnel should understand and follow these guidelines: A fume hood is a safety device that collects vapors and fumes. It is not to be used to dispose of chemicals by evaporation. Any apparatus inside the hood shall be placed six inches back away from the sash bottom edge. The fume hood sash shall be closed at all times unless work is being conducted inside. The hood fan shall be on at all times. In the event of a power failure, all work activity in the hood shall cease and the sash should be closed. Inspect hood vents and fans frequently for cleanliness and to see that they are clear of obstructions. If any problems are found, contact the CHO. ANNUAL TESTING AND CERTIFICATION The CHO is responsible for making sure that annual quantitative evaluations of all laboratory fume hoods are performed by an external vendor. Average acceptable face velocities range between 80 and 120 linear feet per minute (lfp m). The sash is lowered to a point where optimal average face velocity read ings are obtained (e.g., 100 lfp m). Laboratory personnel must ensure that the fume hood is uncluttered for the annual test. Results of this quantitative inspection are posted on a sticker on the fume hood, dated and initialed by the inspector. Hood t est data is kept on file by the CHO. The presence of adequate make- up air in the laboratory fume hood room is evaluated on an as -needed basis. M ake-up air needs to be provided to compensate for the air exhausted out of the fume hood. In order to prevent excessive cross -drafts and ensure the validity of the fume hood face velocity readings, the background air velocity (measured with the fume hood fan off) from the make -up/sup ply air should not exceed 25 lf pm in front of the fume hood. BIOSAFETY CABINETS Biosafety cabinets protect the user and surrounding environment from pathogens by moving air from the front of the fume hood and filtering the air through a HEPA filter prior to exhausting the air back into the room. A HEPA filter does not protect against most chemical vapors and therefore should only be used when working with biological agents. ANNUAL TESTING AND CERTIFICATION The CHO is responsible for the annual evaluation of all laboratory biosafety cabinets. The inflow (100 - 120 lf pm) and downflow (50 -60 lf pm) velocities are measured and fan speeds are adjusted accordingly. Lab personnel must ensure that the cabinet is decontaminated and uncluttered for the annual test. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 23 Results of this quantitative inspection are posted on a sticker on the face of the cabinet. Test certifications are kept on file by the CHO. LAMINAR FLOW/CLEAN BENCHES Clean benches filter air from the room and move it down and out the front, toward the user. The clean bench is used when the researchers wish to protect the sample from contamination but offers no prot ection to the user. ANNUAL TESTING AND CERTIFICATION The CHO is responsible for the annual evaluation of all clean benches. The downflow velocity (80 -120 lfpm) is measured and fan speeds are adjusted accordingly. Lab personnel must ensure that the bench is decontaminated and uncluttered for the annual test. Results of this quantitative inspection are posted on a sticker on the face of the bench. Test certifications are kept on file by the CHO. LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION Local exhaust ventilation is use d when ventilation for a small- scale process is needed. They can be either ducted or filtered and are often found in animal research facilities where anesthesia and other gases may be administered on a benchtop. If you are using a filtered local exhaust ve ntilation system, make sure you understand the limitations of the filter(s) installed in the device. ANNUAL TESTING AND CERTIFICATION Snorkels are monitored annually by an external vendor . There is no set airflow standard for local exhaust ventilation; airflow is compared across years to ensure continued performance. Test results are kept on file by the CHO. ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS Policies, or administrative controls , have been set in place to ensure personnel protection when engineering controls alone are not adequate. These measures are described below. GENERAL PROCEDURES The following minimum general safety rules will be followed in all university laboratories: No running, jumping, or horseplay will be tolerated. No employee shall work alone in a laboratory or chemical storage area when performing a task that is considered unusually hazardous by the Department Chair. No laboratory worker shall work alone outside of normal business hours without proper notification and/or the use of personal panic alarms. Spills shall be immediately addressed in accordance with the Emergency Response guidelines in this document . Small spills on bench tops shall be cleaned immediately to prevent con tact with skin or clothing. Lifting of heavy items should be performed in the proper fashion (using legs to lift and not the back). Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 24 Minors may not enter laboratories unless they are part of a university -recognized program (see Children on Campus and Working with Minors Policy www.american.edu/policies/ ) Animals (except for research animals) are not allowed in laboratories. No sandals or open -toed shoes shall be allowed in laboratories. PERSONAL HYGIENE Workers should promptly wash the skin after contact with chemicals. If special cleaning agents are required, they should be on -hand prior to working with the chemical. Clothing worn in the laboratory shall offer protection from splashes and spills, shall be easily removable in case of an accident, and shall be fire resistant. Nonflammable, nonporous aprons typically offer the most satisfactory and least expensive protection. Lab jackets or coats should have fasteners (either snaps or buttons) that can be readily removed. These coats shall be fastened closed when working in the laboratory and removed prior to exiting the laboratory. If lab coats are not used in the laboratory, then long sleeves and long pants must be worn when students, staff or faculty are using hazardous materials. Disposable gloves and safety eyewear must be worn when manipulating hazardous materials. Laboratory clothing should be kept clean and replaced when necessary. Clothing should be replaced or laundered using appropriate decontamination procedures whenever contamination is suspected. Lab coats and gloves are not to be worn outside the laboratory, especially in rest room or break facilities. Any lab coats, respirators, or other protective gear must be left in the lab areas. Employees are responsible for washing their personal protective equipment. Typically, this should be performed with soap and water. Solvents should not be used. Inhalation is one of the four modes of entry for chemical exposure. \"Sniff testing\" should not be performed. Remove jewelry, bracelets, and watches if the y may interfere with the experiments, become a hazard, or be contaminated by the experiments. Long hair should be tied back, preventing it from falling into the eyes or face. Do not eat, drink, smoke, or apply cosmetics or lotions in the laboratory or chemical storage areas. HOUSEKEEPING The laboratory must be kept as clean as the work allows. Each laboratory employee shall be responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the laboratory. Reagents and equipment shall be returned to their proper place af ter use. Contaminated or dirty glassware shall be placed in specific cleaning areas and not allowed to accumulate. Chemicals (especially liquids) shall never be stored on the floor, except in closed -door cabinets suitable for the materials being stored. Large bottles (2.5 liters or larger) shall not be stored above the bench top. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 25 Reagents, solutions, glassware, or other apparatus shall not be stored in hoods. Besides reducing the available workspace, they may interfere with the proper airflow patterns an d reduce the effectiveness of the hood as a safety device. Counter tops shall be kept neat and clean. Bench tops shall not be used for chemical storage. All work done in fume hoods should be performed in the \"Safety Zone\" (6 inch minimum from the sash). Stored items and equipment should not project beyond the fr ont shelf or counter limits. Shelves used to store chemicals outside of cabinets must have lips or guards. Stored items shall never block access to fire extinguishers, safety showers/eyewashes, safety equipment, or other emergency equipment. Stairways, h allways, passageways/aisles and access to emergency equipment and/or exits must be maintained in a dry condition and not be obstructed in any fashion, including storage, equipment, and wiring. All working surfaces and floor should be cleaned regularly. All containers must be labeled with the identity of their contents and the hazards associated with those chemicals, including chemicals in non -original containers. All chemicals in waste containers must be identified and the relative quantities of each ide ntified. All chemical containers, including hazardous waste bottles, must be capped when not in use. Parafilm and foil cove rs are not appropriate for long -term storage. All hazardous waste containers must be labeled using the University's Hazardous Waste label and stored within secondary containment. STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES Supervisors shall prepare Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for operations within their laboratories that involve hazardous chemicals. These SOPs shall address all safety con siderations, such as but not limited to, the area in which the work will be performed (e.g., fume hood, glove box), safety equipment to be used, precautions to be observed , and the PPE necessary. SOPs shall be available to all employees and shall be used in conducting the task described. Personnel must be trained in the SOPs and this training must be documented. A format template for SOPs is attached as Appendix B . Before performing laboratory work, the laboratory user must: Review research protocols and/or SOPs carefully. Be familiar with the location and use of safety facilities such as first aid, fire extinguishers, showers, eyewash fountains, and exits. Ensure that safety equipment is readily available and in good condition . Be familiar with safety precautions specified in the SDSs of the chemicals to be handled, and Plan for emergency situations. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 26 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) PPE is used after all administrative and engineering controls have been applied and will be provided by the depar tments. Personnel must adhere to the following guidelines regarding PPE use in the laboratories: Selection of appropriate PPE depends on the work to be performed; Chemical, biological, physical, and environmental factors; Expected duration of exposure; Temperature; and Other factors. LABORATORY COATS All laboratory workers at AU are required to have laboratory coats. These coats are to be worn in the laboratory and removed when the employee does not need the protection they provide, that is, when the employee leaves the laboratory. Lab coats shall have fasteners (either snaps or buttons) so that they can be readily removed and shall be fastened closed when working in the laboratory. Employees must understand that laboratory coats are used to prevent contamination of their personal clothing and, in performing their function, may become contaminated. Wearing potentially contaminated laboratory coats outside of the laboratory could expose others unnecessarily to hazardous chemicals. Lab coats may only be cleaned by an appropriate laundry provid er. Lab coats may not be taken home or to public laundry facilities. If lab coats are gr ossly contaminated with hazardous materials, th ey must be disposed of as ha zardous waste. GLOVES Proper protective gloves shall be worn whenever there is a potential for contact with toxic, corrosive , or infectious materials and materials of unknown toxicity. Where available, the manufacturer's guidance on the SDS should be consulted to aid in determining the need and type of protective gloves. No single material is resistant to all chemicals and the appropriate glove material must be based upon the chemical(s) to be handled and the chemical resistance (or permeability) of the glove. Permeation rates will vary, and the allowable time that a glove may be used should be based on the permeation characte ristics of the glove material and the relative toxicity (or hazard) of the chemical(s) being used. This information may be obtained from the manufacturer of the glove. Before each use, gloves should be inspected for discoloration, punctures, and tears. For especially toxic materials, only new gloves should be used and the gloves should be pressure tested prior to use. Double layering of gloves with an inner and outer layer provides additional protection. Both layers should be resistant to the chemical(s) being used. Disposal frequency of reusable gloves should be determined in advance of use based upon contamination encountered, time of exposure, and length of use. Disposable gloves should not be washed and reused. Gloves must be worn whenever it is necessary to handle sharp -edged objects or exposure to very hot or very cold materials. Leather gloves or heavy cotton gloves must be used for handling broken glassware, Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 27 for inserting glass tube into rubber stoppers and for similar operations where protect ion from chemicals in not needed. Insulated gloves should be worn when working at temperature extremes. Various synthetic materials such as Nomex\u00ae or Kevlar\u00ae can be used briefly up to 1,000\u00b0 F and may be used in combination with other materials such as leather. Asbestos gloves shall not be used. EYE PROTECTION Protective eye and face protection are required whenever there is a reasonable probability of injury to the eye or face that could be prevented by such equipment. Therefore, eye protection is req uired whenever there are potential hazards including flying objects, liquids, injurious radiation , or combination of these hazards. Safety glasses must be ANSI -approved (ANSI Z87.1) and have protective side shields. As a general rule, safety glasses are required to be worn by any person in a laboratory where active operations are occurring. Safety goggles should be worn in situations where a splash of liquid or the presence of airborne particulates may cause potential injury to the eye. Face shields are required whenever there is a potential of exposure to materials that may cause injury to the face (such as corrosives, toxic liquids, or exploding glass). The use of a face shield does not alleviate the requirement to wear appropriate safety glasses or g oggles beneath the face shield. RESPIRATORS Respirators have not been issued at AU because there is no reason to suspect that exposure levels exceed the OSHA action levels or PELs. However, any laboratory worker that desires additional protection for ce rtain unusual operations should contact the CHO to enroll in the Respiratory Protection Program. The employee must be trained in respiratory protection, undergo medical evaluation, and be fit -tested before being issued a respirator. Due to the quantitie s and properties of chemicals used, and the availability of engineered exposure controls, the likelihood of inhalation exposure is judged to be small. Therefore, no respirators have been issued for personal protection. General PPE Selection Guide PPE to be Considered Use Considerations ACID/BASE EXPOSURE HAZARDS Face Shields Butyl Rubber Gloves Neoprene Gloves Face shields offer optimum facial protection (including eyes) from accidental acid splashes. Safety goggles or glasses will not adequately protect facial skin. Gloves Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 28 Tyvek Coveralls Safety Glasses Goggles Laboratory Coat Splash Apron should be used to protect hands and arms when manually handling acids. Butyl rubber and neoprene are appropriate for many acids, but the product material must be determined based on the specific chemical. Workers should be trained in emergency procedures (e.g., spill response, clean -up, use of emergency eye wash station). CHEMICAL EXPOSURE HAZARDS Latex Gloves Nitrile Gloves Half-face Splash Apron Eye Protection Face shields offer optimum facial protection (including eyes) from accidental splashes. Safety goggles or glasses will not adequately protect facial skin. Latex gloves can protect against most biological dermal exposures but may result in subsequent latex sensitivity to certain susceptible workers. Nitrile gloves will protect against many chemical hazards, but material compatibility and permeation rates must be reviewed to ensure the appropriate glove material is selected. Although respirator use is not anticipated, half -face respirators, equipped with proper chemical cartridges, may be used only if splash hazards are minimal. Full- face respirators protect against facial skin and eye exposure and increase the level of respiratory protection. Aprons, and laboratory coats will help minimize dermal exposures and contamination migration. EYE/FACE HAZARDS Safety Glasses Safety Goggles Face Shield Depending on construction, goggles with impact - resistant lenses can protect against large particles and projectiles as well as vaporized chemicals and splashes. Safety glasses also afford protection against large particles and projectiles, although somewhat more limited. Note that face shields, although often suitable for splashes, are typically not adequat e for projectiles. Areas where eye hazards from chemicals exist typically require the installation of emergency eye wash stations. CHAPTER 5: CHEMICAL EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT MEDICAL CONSULTATIONS AND EXAMINATIONS Medical examinations and consultations shal l be made available to employees, arranged by the university's Risk Management and Environmental Health and Safety department, and will be provided to employees under the following conditions: Whenever an employee develops signs or symptoms of overexposure associated with a hazardous chemical to which the worker may have contacted in the laboratory. Where exposure monitoring reveals an exposure level routinely above the action level (or in the absence of an action level, the PEL) for an OSHA -regulated subs tance for which there are exposure monitoring and medical surveillance requirements. Whenever an event takes place in the work area such as a spill, leak, explosion or other occurrence resulting in the likelihood of a hazardous exposure. The CHO will provide the following information to the physician : Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 29 The identity of the hazardous chemical(s) to which the worker may have been exposed. A description of the conditions under which the exposure occurred, including quantitative exposure data, if available. A description of the signs and symptoms of exposure that the employee is experiencing. After the medical consultation and/or examination, the doctor will issue a written opinion to the employee, which includes: Any recommendation for further medical follow -up; The results of the medical examination and any associated tests; The presence o f a medical condition which could place the employee at increased risk as a result of exposure to a hazardous chemical found in the laboratory; and A statement that the doctor has informed the employee of the results of the consultation or medical examination and any medical condition that may require further examination or treatment. After the medical consultation and/or examination, the medical officer will issue a written opinion to AU that includes: The result of the medical examination (pass/fail); and The presence of any medical condition that would place the employee at an increased risk. All findings unrelated to occupational exposure shall remain confidential between the physician and the employee and shall not be included in the written opinio n. The written opinion will be available to the CHO upon request. This information will be considered confidential and will be discussed only for the purposes of avoiding similar exposures in the future and for improving hazard controls in the workplace. RECORDS AND RECORDKEEPING Accurate records shall be maintained for any measurement taken to monitor employee exposures and any medical consultation and examinations including tests or written opinions required by the laboratory standard. Exposure records shall be maintained by the Risk Management and Environmental Health and Safety department. AU's contracted medical doctor will maintain the medical records. These records shall be kept during the worker's employment at AU and for a period of at least 30 years thereafter. All records concerning laboratory hoods and biosafety cabinets shall be kept by the CHO . These records include performance testing and maintenance. It is also the Risk Management and Environmental Health and Safety department's responsibility to compile the OSHA Form 300 of recordable occupational injuries and illnesses for laboratory personnel. This log must contain a separate entry that identifies the employee and describes the injury or illness. The employer is required to record th is information within six working days after notification of the injury or illness. The notice of first report will be generated by the Risk Management and Environmental Health and Safety department and recorded on the OSHA Form 101, Supplementary Record of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, for each recordable occupational injury or illness. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 30 CHAPTER 6: CHEMICAL STORAGE AND TRANSPORT CHEMICAL LABELING Each chemical in the laboratory must be properly labeled. Most chemicals are shipped with a manufacturer's label, which contains all necessary information. These labels should not be removed or damaged as long as they accurately reflect the contents of the container . Each chemical bottle, including diluted chem ical solutions, must be labeled with its contents and its associated hazards. It is also recommended that each bottle be dated when received and when opened to assist in determining which chemicals are expired. When new chemicals and compounds are generated by laboratory operations, they must be labeled with the name, date, and hazard information. The owner of the chemical should also be listed in case questions arise about the container's contents. Peroxide forming chemicals (e.g., ethers) can degrade to form shock sensitive, highly reactive compounds and must be labeled with the date of receipt and on first opening the bottle. These chemicals are only allowed a one-year shelf life before they must be either be tested for peroxides or disposed of. The most recent test date must be listed on the label. CHEMICAL STORAGE AND SEGREGATION CLASS OF CHEMICAL RECOMMENDED STORAGE METHOD EXAMPLES INCOMPATIBILITIES (SEE SDS) Compressed gas, flammable Store in a cool, dry area away from oxidizing gases. Strap or chain cylinders to a wall or benchtop. Methane, acetylene, propane Oxidizing and toxic compressed gases, oxidizing solids Compressed gas, oxidizer Store in a cool, dry area, away from flammable gases and liquids. Strap or chain cylinders to a wall or benc htop. Oxygen, chlorine, bromine Flammable gases Compressed gas, poison Store in a cool, dry area away from flammable gases and liquids.

Although the University's laboratories typically hold chemicals in small quantities, chemical hazards are not always proportional to the volume of the chemical. Therefore, access to chemicals, chemical processes, and associated equipment is strictly limited to individuals trained in their safe use, storage, and disposal. Access control measures are in place to provide physical locks and electronic monitoring of entrance and exit- ways. Doors to laboratory spaces must be secured when individuals responsible for the lab are not immediately prese nt. Laboratory supervisors are expected to make reasonable efforts to secure ha zardous chemicals from loss, theft, and use by unintended or untrained individuals. All laboratory personnel are expected to abide by all laboratory security requirements set by their supervisors and the University. ON-CAMPUS DISTRIBUTION OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS Precautions must be taken when transporting hazardous substances between laboratories. Chemicals must be transported between stockrooms and laboratories in break -resista nt, secondary containers such as bottle carriers made of rubber, metal, or plastic, that include carrying handle(s) and which are large enough to hold the contents of the chemical container in the event of breakage. Compressed gas cylinders must be strap ped down with a rope or chain during transfer. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 32 Only individuals trained to handle hazardous materials and knowledgeable about the hazards associated with the materials they are handling may transfer hazardous chemicals between buildings. At no time are chemicals permitted to be transferred in personally owned vehicles. OFF-CAMPUS DISTRIBUTION OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS The transportation of hazardous chemicals and compressed gases over public roads, or by air, is strictly governed by international, federal, and state regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Any person who prepares and/or ships hazardous materials must comply with pertinent regul ations regarding training, quantity, packaging, and labeling. Without proper training, it is illegal to ship hazardous materials. Those who violate the hazardous materials shipment regulations are subject to criminal investigation and penalties. Univer sity personnel who sign hazardous materials manifests, shipping papers, or those who package hazardous material for shipment, must be trained and certified by EH&S. Individuals who wish to ship or transport hazardous materials off-campus must contact EH&S for assistance prior to transporting the materials . At no time are chemicals permitted to be transferred in personally owned vehicles. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 33 CHAPTER 7: TRAINING All chemical users including employees will be provided with information and training by the CHO (or designee). Training shall be provided at the time of an employee's initial assignment to a work area where hazardous chemicals are present and prior to assignments involving new exposure situations. The frequency of refresher information and training shall be determined by the employer. Topics shall include: The contents and availability of this document; The names and phone numbers of the of the CHO and Department Chair; The location of Hazardous Substance Inventories and SDSs for their area; Utility of SDSs; Awareness regarding the release or presence of a hazardous chemical; General laboratory safety procedures; Proper use of fume hoods; Available equipment for protection from the hazards of chemicals; Policies and procedures regarding the disposal of hazardous wastes; Emergency procedures; and These training requirements. Laboratory -specific training must be provided to all new personnel by the PI/Laboratory Supervisor. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 34 CHAP TER 8 : REGULATED WASTE MANAGEMENT WHAT IS REGULATED WASTE? Regulated waste is any waste stream other than municipal solid waste that is regulated by at least one of the following agencies: EPA, OSHA, DOT, NRC, DEA. Examples of regulated waste includ e blood/other potentially infectious materials , radioactive materials, hazardous chemicals, biological agents, and controlled substances. Because these waste streams have varying legal restrictions on storage, transportation, and disposal, it is important to understand the specific requirements of the waste materials you generate. If you have questions or are unsure about the proper methods of disposal for your waste, contact the Environmental Health & Safety office for guidance. CHEMICAL WASTE CHARACTERIST IC HAZARDOUS WASTE CHEMICALS (FLAMMABLE, REACTIVE, CORROSIVE , TOXIC), SUCH AS SOLVENTS, ACIDS, BASES, WATER/AIR SENSITIVE MATERIALS, AND HEAVY METALS. Chemical waste must be managed in accordance with U. S. EPA Hazardous Waste Regulations (40 CFR, Parts 26 0 through 272) and District of Columbia Hazardous Waste Regulations. All researchers are responsible for proper management of chemical waste accumulation in their labs. In these areas, the waste must be managed as follows: Chemical waste containers must have an AU hazardous waste label affixed to them and include an \"accumulation start date\" denoting the date that wastes were first put into the container. The contents of the container must be written on the label. The chemical cons tituents must be spelled out (no chemical nomenclature or shorthand) in the \"Chemical Composition\" column. All hazardous waste containers must be kept closed except when adding or removing wastes (this also applies to containers holding instrument effluents). This requirement minimizes waste evaporation. Containers used for waste must be in good conditi on and made of material compatible with the waste it contains . Hazardous wast e containers must be placed in chemically compatible secondary containment (e.g. , a tub) of suitab le capacity to contain the chemical should the primary container leak . Wastes should be segregated by compatibility for safety purposes and to allow for economic waste disposal. Some examples of incompatible chemicals are provided in Appendix D . Note: Absolutely no hazardous chemicals shall be poured down the drain or placed in the ordinary, non-hazardous trash containers. Broken and contaminated glassware must be placed in puncture - resistant receptacles. Any questions concerning waste management should be directed to the Risk Management and Environmental Health and Safety department or the CHO. SCREENING FOR CONTAMINATION OR FORMATION OF HAZARDOUS BYPRODUCTS Chemicals likely to contain contaminants (e.g. , PCBs) or form hazardous bypr oducts over time (e.g. , peroxide -formers ) require precautionary testing prior to disposal. Waste chemicals suspect ed of Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 35 contamination or hazardous byproducts must be designated as such by checking the \"Other\" option and providing relevant details in the blank space provided. TRANSFER OF CHEMICAL WASTE TO A SATELLITE ACCUMULATION AREA When a waste cont ainer is at capacity or the waste generation process has come to an end, the container should be securely capped or closed and transferred to the satellite accumulation area in Hall of Science T04 . Prior to transfer, verify that the label is completely filled out. Note: Uncapped waste containers or containers that have been closed using Parafilm or foil will not be accepted into the waste stream. Departments are responsible for providing secure waste storage containers to store and transfer their waste to the satellite accumulation area. SHARPS BROKEN GLASS, SHARP PLASTIC, PLATE GLASS, PYREX. If not contaminated with an infectious agent, dispose of material in a glass waste box. When full, close it securely and bring it to the designated waste accumulation area for pick -up. GLASS PIPETTES, NEEDLES, SYRINGES, SCALPEL BLADES, RAZOR BLADES, GLASS MICROSCOPE SLIDES AND COVERSLIPS. These items must be disposed of in a sharps container. When a container is 3/4 full, close it and place it in a medical waste box p rovided by EH&S. Prior to the scheduled medical waste pick -up, tape the medical waste box closed and label it \"sharps .\" Sharps waste and other pathological waste must be in separate boxes and may not be mixed. No box may exceed 40 pounds. ANIMAL BEDDING SOILED ANIMAL BEDDING GENERATED FROM IACUC -APPROVED RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. Soiled animal bedding that is non -infectious (Biosafety Level 1) should be double bagged , knotted or taped closed, and placed in the designated waste bin to be disposed of via the regul ar trash. No bag should exceed 40 pounds. Biosafety Level 2+ labs must dispose of all animal bedding waste as medical waste, with red bags and biohazard boxes. Biohazard boxes are picked up by EH&S at pre -arranged times and upon request. BIOLOGICAL WASTE EXPERIMENTALLY CULTURED STOCKS, PLATES, ETHIDIUM BROMIDE GELS, (NON -SHARPS) MATERIALS CONTAMINATED WITH BLOOD OR OTHER POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS MATERIALS, MATERIALS CONTAMINATED WITH HUMAN MUTAGENS, TERATOGENS, CARCINOGENS, OR FEDERAL LISTED SELECT AGENTS. Place medical waste in red bags only. When full, close bags and place in cardboard medical waste box provided by EH&S. Contact EH&S to schedule pick -up. Prior to a scheduled medical waste pick -up, tape boxes shut. Boxes must be under 40 pounds apiece. Boxes exceeding 40 pounds will not be picked up. If material can be autoclaved or otherwise sterilized so that it no longer presents a biological or sharps hazard, it may be disposed of as regular waste. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 36 PATHOLOGICAL WASTE ANIMAL CARCASSES, TISSUES, AND ORGANS GENERATED FROM IACUC- APPROVED RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. Bag and store all animal carcasses in the designated freezer only. Within 6 hours of a scheduled medical waste pick -up, pack bags in the biohazard boxes provided b y EH&S and tape shut. Boxes must be under 40 pounds each . Boxes exceeding 40 pounds will not be accepted . RESEARCH EQUIPMENT ANY APPARATUS USED IN THE LABORATORY FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES, SUCH AS LIQUID SCINTILLATION COUNTERS, GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY INSTRUMENTS, REFRIGERATORS, INCUBATORS, AND CHEMICALS STORAGE CABINETS. THIS INCLUDES FILTERS FROM BIOSAFETY CABINETS, DUCTLESS FUME HOODS, AIR PURIFICATIONS UNITS, ETC. Research equipment contaminated with any hazardous material must be decontaminated by a qualified individual prior to recycling or disposal. If the equipment cannot be decontaminated, it must be disposed of as the hazardous waste in contains. RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS ALL WASTE CONTAINING MATERIALS THAT EMIT IONIZING RADIATION. No amount of radioactive mate rial may be discharged into the sewage system (including all drains and toilets) or otherwise released into the environment. Store in the restricted laboratory's waste accumulation area and segregate by the isotope's half -life. For isotopes with half-lives less than 125 days, the Radiation Safety Officer will transfer waste to the decay -in-storage area at quarterly intervals and upon request. Isotopes with half -lives greater than 125 days cannot decay in storage. The Radiation Safety Officer will transfer w aste to the waste storage area on a quarterly basis and upon request. Do not mix solid/dry waste products with liquid waste regardless of the isotopes involved. Waste containers will be provided by the University's Environmental Health and Safety office or must meet the specifications set by the Radiation Safety Officer. CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES SUBSTANCES AND CHEMICALS CONTROLLED BY THE U .S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION . Controlled substances not dispensed and rendered irretrievable during the course of r esearch may be disposed of through Environmental Health and Safety. Contact the Chemical Hygiene Officer to schedule a time to bring the waste to the hazardous waste storage area. Per DEA regulations, t wo employees of the license holder (registrant) mus t be present to observe the handling of the controlled substance until it is rendered non -retrievable. If the substance is transported from the laboratory to the waste storage location prior to destruction, both registrant employees must Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 37 be with the subst ance at all times during the transport. The substance will be rendered non -retrievable in collaboration with an external waste vendor. A DEA Form 41 (Appendix F ) must be generated to document destruction . The original copy will be provided to the license holder and a duplicate will be kept on file with EH&S. The license holde r is not required to send the completed Form 41 to the DEA but must keep the paperwork on file for at least two years. More information on DEA disposal regulations can be found on the ECFR website . Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 38 CHAPTER 9 : EMERGENCY RESPONSE EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT SAFETY SHOWERS Drench -type safety showers are present in each chemical laboratory and readily available to all employees and students who work with injurious corrosive materials or other chemicals that may require an immediate response to a chemical emergency resulting in a significant exposure to the body. The valve handle of safety showers should be rigidly fixed and plainly labeled. Chain pulls are difficult to grasp in an emergency, unless provided with a large ring. The valve should open readily in either directio n and remain open until intentionally closed. Water flow must be sufficient to drench the employee rapidly. All employees shall ensure that access to the showers is not impeded by storage of equipment or materials. Each shower will be flushed and inspected annually by the EH&S department. If the shower does not operate properly upon inspection, the department shall immediately submit a 2Fix request. All employees who work in the area shall be informed that this equipment is temporarily not operational (a prominent sign will suffice). A log will be kept of these monthly inspections and include the initials of the inspector and the date of inspection. EYE WASH FOUNTAINS Eye wash fountains are present in each chemical laboratory and shall be readily available to all employees who work with injurious corrosive materials or other chemicals that may require an immediate response to a chemical emergency resulting in a significant exposure to the body. Eye wash fountains shall provide a gentle flow of aerated water for an extended period of at least 15 minutes. Use of hands shall not be required to maintain the water flow. All employees shall ensure that access to the eye wash fountain is not impeded by storage of equipment or materials. Each eye wash fount ain will be flushed and inspected annually by the EH&S department. If the eyewash does not function properly upon inspection, the employee shall submit a 2Fix request immediately . All employees who work in this area shall be informed that this equipment i s temporarily not operational (a prominent sign will suffice). A log of the monthly inspections will be kept and a summary tag shall be attached to the eye wash fountain that includes the inspection date and initials of the inspector. FIRE EXTINGUISHERS Fire extinguishers are in each chemical laboratory and readily accessible to trained employees who attempt to put out a small incipient fire. Fire extinguishers are required by the District of Columbia fire code and employees and students are not require d to use the fire extinguisher to put out a fire. Employees must be trained on the use and limitation of portable fire extinguishers before they use a fire extinguisher and should be familiar with the proper type of extinguisher for each type of fire. The four basic types of fires are summarized below. Class A - Ordinary combustible fires such as paper and wood fires. Typical extinguishing agents include water and multipurpose dry chemicals. Class B - Flammable liquid and gas fires. Extinguishing agents are dry chemicals, carbon dioxide, and foam. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 39 Class C - Electrical fires. Extinguishing agents include dry chemicals and carbon dioxide. Class D - Metal fires. The extinguishing agents are special po wders. FIRE ALARMS AND SMOKE DETECTORS Fire alarms and smoke detectors are present in each laboratory. In the event of a fire, the fire alarm should be activated for immediate response by emergency campus responders. Nothing should be stored near the a larms or detectors. MISCELLANEOUS Other emergency equipment may be present in laboratories including fire blankets, first aid kits , and emergency stretchers. EMERGENCY RESPONSE A list of emergency phone numbers shall be posted near each entry door in the laboratory(s). This list will include the phone number of the university health clinic, the Public Safety dispatcher, the \"2FIX' system and outside emergency services. Each laboratory shall have the name and phone number of a primary emergency contact an d an alternate emergency contact for the room posted on an outside door. These individuals should be knowledgeable of the contents, layout, and operations of that room. Home phone numbers of these emergency contacts shall be maintained in a secure intern al SharePoint site (AU login required) for consultation during emergency situations. In situations of personal health emergencies, employees shall use their best discretion to summon the appropriate aid. In other emergencies, such as fires, employees mus t be aware beforehand of the locations of the nearest exits, fire alarms, and fire extinguishers. Employees shall be familiar with the use and inspection of emergency equipment. All inspections must be recorded and these logs kept with the equipment. Th e following emergency equipment is available and inspected at the stated frequency. Portable fire extinguishers - inspected monthly; Safety showers - inspected and flushed annually ; and Eyewash fountains - inspected and flushed annually . A brief summary of emergency procedures is provided below. FIRE In the event of a fire, employees should pull the nearest fire alarm, notify other employees, evacuate the building according to the evacuation plan, and call AU's Public Safety office (extension 3636) once safely outside. CHEMICAL SPILL Only small spills shall be handled by employees knowledgeable about the contents of the spilled material. Appropriate spill kits available in the laboratories must be used. The Environmental Safety Coordinator, C HO, and Public Safety should be contacted for other spills to determine the appropriate response. If the spill cannot be cleaned by the university staff, a contractor and/or the fire department may need to be called. See Appendix E for detailed spill res ponse instructions. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 40 CHEMICAL SPLASH Eye wash fountains and showers should be used as necessary. Emergency aid should be summoned as needed by calling Public Safety. All workers who use the fountains and/or showers must be seen by medical personnel. Emp loyees shall be familiar with operations of the eye was and emergency showers. FIRST AID AND ACCIDENT REPORTING AU staff that are trained and designated as responsible for rendering first aid or medical assistance as part of their job duties are covered under the BBP standard. However, OSHA will consider it a \"de minimis\" violation (a technical violation carrying no penalties) if university staff who administer first aid as a collateral duty to their routine work assignments, are not offered the pre -expo sure hepatitis B vaccination. All such incidents must be immediately, or as soon as feasible, reported to the employee's supervisor. Under no circumstances should incidents be reported later than the employee's work shift. The Risk Management and Enviro nmental Health and Safety department must then be notified to file an internal report of the accident and to determine if an exposure has occurred and if post exposure evaluation and follow -up is required. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 41 APPENDIX A: GLOSSARY The following definitions are adapted from the OSHA laboratory standard (29 CFR 1910.1450). Action Level - A concentration in air designated in 29 CFR Part 1910.1000, subpart Z, for a specific substance, calculated as an eight -hour time -weighted average (TWA), which, if exposure levels exceed this value, initiates certain required activities such as exposure monitoring and medical surveillance. Carcinogen - See \"select carcinogen.\" Chemical Hygiene Officer (CHO) - An employee who is designated by the employer and is qualified by training or experience to provide technical guidance in the development and imp lementation of the provisions of the Chemical Hygiene Plan.

Compressed Gas - A gas or mixture of gases having, in a container, an absolute pressure exceeding 40 pounds per square inch (psi) at 70\u00b0F (21.1\u00b0C); or a gas or mixture of gases having, in a container, an absolute pressure exceeding 104 psi at 130\u00b0F (54.4\u00b0C) regardless of the pressure at 70\u00b0F (21.1\u00b0C); or a liquid having a vapor pressure exceeding 40 psi at 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C) as determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) publication ASTM D -323-72. Designated Area - An area, which may be used for work with \"select carcinogens,\" reproductive toxins, or substances, which have a high degree of acute toxicity. A designated area may be the entire laboratory, an area of a laboratory, or a device such as a laboratory hood. Emergency - Any occurrence such as, but not limited to, equipment failure, rupture of c ontainers, or failure of control equipment, which results in an uncontrolled release of a hazardous chemical into the workplace. Employee - An individual employed in a laboratory workplace who may be exposed to hazardous chemicals in the course of his or her assignments. Explosive - A chemical that causes a sudden, almost instantaneous release of pressure, gas, and heat when subjected to sudden shock, pressure, or high temperature. Flammable - A chemical that falls into one of the following categories: Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 42 Flammable aerosol - An aerosol that, when tested by the method described in 16 CFR 1500.45, yields a flame projection exceeding 18 inches at full valve opening, or a flashback (a flame extending back to the valve) at any degree of valve opening. Flammable gas - A gas that, at ambient temperature and pressure, forms a flammable mixture with air at a concentration of 13 percent by volume or less; or a gas that, at ambient temperature and pressure, forms a range of flammable mixtures with air wider than 12 pe rcent by volume, regardless of the lower limit.

This document supports American University Chemical Hygiene Plan and Hazard Communication Program. SCOPE This procedure covers all laboratory spills and applies to all American University laboratories unless where exceptions are noted. DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS CHP: Chemical Hygiene Plan CHO: Chemical Hygiene Officer EH&S: Environmental Health and Safety EPA: Environmental Protection Agency HEPA: High Efficiency Particulate Air IRCT: Ignitable, Reactive, Corrosive, Toxic SDS: Safety Data Sheet PPE: Personal Protective Equipment RCRA: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act SOP: Standard Operating Procedure MATERIALS REQUIRED Chemically resistant gloves, laboratory coat or apron, safety eyewear; Spill kit: sorbent materials (sorbent pads, pillows) and acid and caustic neutralizing agents; Detergent amended distilled deionized water. SKILLS REQUIRED Hazard Communication Training Laboratory Safe Practice Training PROCEDURE Don all routine personal protective equipment: gloves, laboratory coat, safety glasses , and close d-toe shoes; Hazard recognition: all laboratory personnel should be familiar with the hazards presented by the reagents and chemical processes in the laboratory ; Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 50 Do not store chemical reagents, sample preparations , or waste with incompatible chemicals or materials (see Appendix D) ; Notify the CHO or EH &S office in the event of a spill or leak requiring assistance. After hours and on weekends, notify Public Safet y; Each laboratory should have a spill kit appropriate for the chemicals and materials in use. Contact EH &S for spill kit acquisition or replenishment; Spills frequently involve broken glass. Do not gather glass shards by hand. If glass is intermingled with spilled chemicals, do not attempt to separate the glass; All secondary chemical containers must be labeled with the appropriate label; All chemical waste containers must be labeled with a hazardous waste label. SPILL PREVENTION Laboratory personnel must take precautions to always work with chemicals and particulates on stable surfaces; Large volume reagent containers should be transported by cart; All reagent transfer should occur in the appropriate chemical fume hood; Reagent, s ample preparation, and waste containers must have appropriate closure mechanisms to secure against spills and leaks; All reagent, sample preparation, and waste containers must be closed when not in use; Waste containers should reside within a catchment basin sufficient for spill containment; Reagents and waste containers should not be stored in chemical f ume hoods or biosafety cabinets . SPILL CLEAN -UP Laboratory person nel are responsible for samples and chemicals with which they work and are required to app ropriately respond to any spill. Laboratory technicians must not attempt to clean a spill if the nature of the material spilled is unknown or if the employee is unsure of how to proceed. Under these circumstances, the employee must immediately contact th e Departmental Chair and/or CHO. Consult the SDS for chemicals in involved in the spill for safety precautions and spill cleanup. Notify the CHO of all spills involving ignitable, reactive, caustic, toxic (IRCT) materials, and all spills greater than 1 liter in volume . Cleanup guidelines are intended for small volume spills and are general procedures only. They are superseded by information contained in an SDS or other specific directions. If the hood ventilation should fail evacuate the area and notify Public Safety. CLEANUP OF MINOR (< ONE LITER ) LIQUID SPILLS, EXCLUDING CONCENTRATED ACIDS AND BASES Note: If a spill is contained on bench paper or lab wipes, dispose of the paper/wipes in accordance with appropriate waste procedures for the absorbed material(s). Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 51 If the spill contaminates the hood, floor or bench, clean as follows: Take all precautions to avoid personal exposure or contamination, then contain the spill using spill pillows, sorbents or spill slabs. If a toxic volatile compound is involved and a substantial spill is outside the hood, notify others to evacuate as you leave the area and call Public Safety; All spills/leaks must first be contained to keep the contaminated area as small as can be. Contain the spill by surrounding it with a berm of appropriate absorbent material, and then apply the material to the spill from the contained edges toward the center of the spill; If a spill occurs within a hood, maintain hood air exchange and work with the hood sash closed to the greatest extent possible. Do not lean into the hood to reach the spill; If the spill is outside of a hood, open the sash for maximum air exchange. The employee should not obstruct the flow in between the hood and the spill \u2014this position will interfere with the flow of any vapors away from the employee's breathing zone; Once contained, spills should be cleaned from the area of least contamination towards the area of greatest contaminatio n to avoid spreading the spill; Solvent spills: If the volume of solvent is larger than what can be absorbed with lab toweling (> 500 mL), and the solvent is minimally hazardous, use spill pillows, spill slabs , or other solvent absorbent material in the spill kit to contain the spill. If the spill is large or is in a poorly ventilated area, or is of a hazardous nature ( e.g., benzene, methylene chloride, ethyl ether) vacate the area and notify the CHO and EH &S; Dispose of solid sorbents in accordance with disposal of the sorbed material; Allow solven t vapors to clear the area before returning to work; Dilute acid and base spills: Consult the SDS. Use neutralizing sorbents to contain liquid spills. Sweep up the sorbent and dispose as corrosive waste. Wash the affected area until a clean water rinse shows a neutral reaction to pH paper . Sewage sludge or other biologically active samples: Wear double gloves. Contain and absorb the spill with spill pillows or other absorptive material. Dispose of the sorbed material as you would the sample. Wash th e area three times with soap and water, then apply an EPA registered disinfectant. Finally, rinse three times with water. Other materials: Clean up according to the nature of hazard the sample represents. Absorb liquids and sweep up solids. Dispose of t he sorbent or sweepings as you would the samples . Concentrated solutions of analytes or pure compounds: Clean up first as you would for the hazard involved. The entire area must then be decontaminated to prevent contamination of future samples and lab wa re. Triple washing and triple rinsing is the minimum cleanup expected. Consult the CHO or EH&S regarding the need to take wipes for analysis in confirmation of adequate cleanup. Other materials: Wear appropriate protective equipment, clean and decontami nate the area , and dispos e of material according to the SDS. If a broom is used on spilled materials, decontaminate or dispose of the broom. Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 52 CLEAN -UP OF CONCENTRATED ACID OR BASE SPILLS Concentrated acid or base spills present serious hazards. Notify the CHO and EH &S in the event of this type of spill; Be cautious of adverse reactions with other reagents/materials in the vicinity of the spill; Do not attempt to absorb concentrated acid/base spills with laboratory toweling; Contain the spill with the appropriate sorbent material; The absorbent material should be scooped/swept into an appropriate waste container. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO GATHER THE MATERIAL BY HAND; Once the spill is removed, wash the affected area with DI water until a pH paper indica tes neutrality. CLEAN -UP OF PARTICULATE OR DRY REAGENT SPILLS All spills of fine -grained particulate matter must be wetted with amended water prior to sweeping; Once the gross debris is contained, vacuum only with a HEPA filtered vacuum or sweep into a sco op or pan. If HEPA vacuuming is not available, wipe with amended water until no visible residue is apparent; If the particulate spill involves asbestos and/or nanoparticulate matter, contact the Departmental Chair and CHO; If the spill is large in volume or area affected, respiratory protection should be used. Only American University employees participating in the respiratory protection program may don negative pressure respirators for any purpose. Immediately following spill containment and clean -up, doff all disposable PPE and discard it in the s ame manner that the spill clean- up materials were disposed. Wash your hands and verify that you are not tracking any of the spilled substance on your shoes before exiting the spill area. Except in cases of emergency evacuation, do not exit a laboratory while wearing p ersonal protective equipment. CLEAN -UP OF MAJOR SPILLS All spills or releases beyond the minor spill volume must be reported immediately to the CHO and EH &S. Clean -up of spills that are large in volume and/or area affected may be followed by wipe and/or air monitoring of the affected area. All spills involving heavy metals or other toxic materials should be followed up with wipe and/or air monitoring. EH &S is responsible for initiating, reporting, evaluation, and retention of all wipe/air monitoring analytical reports. If contamination of any surface is suspected, the area must be labeled as \"Out of Service\" and use of the area must be restricted until sampling confirms no contamination. The CHO or EH &S will determine when the us e restriction may be rescinded. WASTE MANAGEMENT AND POLLUTION PREVENTION Excess reagents, samples , and method process wastes must be characterized and disposed of in an appropriate manner; Chemical Hygiene Plan | American University 53 The authorized person u sing this procedure is responsible for the safe collection, preparation, and proper handling of waste in accordance with waste handling procedures; All materials on t he EPA RCRA P and U lists must be disposed of in accordance with RCRA provisions. Advanc e arrangements for disposal of P and U listed materials must be made with the CHO or EH &S; RCRA P List: Materials on the P list are designated by the US EPA as acutely toxic. The material and its container as well as any materials in contact with the drug must be disposed of in a RCRA approved container; RCRA U List: Any materials that can cause waste to become ignitable, corrosive, reactive or toxic. RECORDKEEPING Large volume spills (> 1 liter), spills of IRCT materials, and spills resulting persistent contamination of a surface will be treated as accidents and reported to the CHO. The CHO will maintain accident reports on file for a period of not less than five years.
