The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the Office of the Attorney General, provid - ing for the appointment of \"a person, learned in the law, to act as attorney-general for the United States.\" By 1870, the duties of the Office of the Attorney General had expanded so much that Congress adopted \"An Act to establish the Department of Justice.\" As its head, the Attorney General is the chief litigator and the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. The Department of Justice serves to enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impar - tial administration of justice for all Americans.Goal I: Prevent Terrorism and Promote the Nation's Security Consistent with the Rule of Law Goal II: Prevent Crime, Protect the Rights of the American People, and Enforce Federal Law Goal III: Ensure and Support the Fair, Impartial, Efficient, and Transparent Administration of Justice at the Federal, State, Local, Tribal, and International Levels The Department is headquartered in Washington, DC, at the Robert F. Kennedy Building, occupying a city block bounded by 9th and 10th Streets and Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW. The Department also has field offices in all states and territories and maintains offices in over 100 countries worldwide.HIstory and EnablInG lEGIslatIon stratEGIc Goals MIssIon locatIon coMponEnt orGanIzatIons Attorney General Deputy Attorney General Associate Attorney General Antitrust Division (ATR) Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Civil Division (CIV) Civil Rights Division (CRT) Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Community Relations Service (CRS) Criminal Division (CRM) Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Environment & Natural Resources Division (ENRD) Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) Executive Office for Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) Executive Office for U.S. Trustees (UST) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (FCSC) INTERPOL Washington Justice Management Division (JMD) National Security Division (NSD) Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) Office of Information Policy (OIP) Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) Office of Legal Policy (OLP) Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA)Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Office of the Pardon Attorney (OPA) Office of Justice Programs (OJP) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) Office of Public Affairs Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) Office of Tribal Justice (OTJ) Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) Professional Responsibility Advisory Office (PRAO) Tax Division (TAX) U.S. Attorneys (USAO) U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) U.S. Parole Commission (USPC) U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FY 2012 PERFORMANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT November 2012 November 9, 2012 A MESSAGE FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL On my first day as Attorney General, I promis ed that the Justice Department's top priority would be to protect the safety, righ ts, and interests of the American pe ople. More than 3 years later, that promise has been fulfilled. I'm proud to report that the Depart ment's commitment to empowering and defending our people - and to aggressively a nd fairly enforcing our laws - has never been stronger. And our approach to pr otecting the American people from na tional security threats; reducing and preventing violent crime; eradic ating financial, health care, and mortgage fraud; and safeguarding the most vulnerable among us has, quite simply, never been more effective. Defending the United States from terrorism and ot her threats to national security remains the Department's highest concern. The Department has strengthened its essential surveillance and intelligence-gathering capabilities in a manner that is not only consistent with the rule of law - but also with our most sacred values. Since 2009, the Department has convicted mo re than 100 individuals of serious federal terrorism violations. We've uncovered - and prevented - multiple plots hatched by terrorist groups abroad, as well as extremists here at home. For example, in 2012, we convicted a man in connection with his purchase of materials to make a bomb and his re search of potential U.S. targets, including the Dallas home of former President George W. Bush. We obtained a guilty verdict in the case of a former U.S. service member who planne d a bomb attack against American soldiers at a restaurant in Killeen, Texas. We also prevented U.S. military and strategic technologies from falling into the wrong hands, incl uding the disruption of a network conspi ring to illegally export to Iran U.S.- origin materials for the construction of gas centrifuges to enrich uranium. At the same time, our resolve to protect our citizens from violent crime has never been stronger. Over the last 3 years the Department has successfully fought gangs and transnational organized crime groups; prosecuted more than 55,000 de fendants for violations of firearms laws; and successfully arrested and prosecuted large numbers of dangerous fugitives, including 19 individuals who had been featured on the FBI's 15 \"Most Wa nted\" list. We also have worked to make communities safer by supporting effec tive offender reentry and reinvestment programs with more than $200 million in Second Chance Act grants. These funds are helping to provide cr itical educational and training opportunities to ensu re that individuals releas ed from jails and prisons can successfully return to their communities as produc tive, law-abiding citizens. Beyond this, the Department has taken decisive ac tion to combat a wide range of financial and health care fraud crimes. Through new initiatives such as the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enfor cement Action Team, and the Residential Mortgage- Backed Securities Working Group, we are working w ith both public and private sector partners to identify financial fraud schemes and hold accountabl e those responsible for these crimes. Working closely with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and a bipartisan group of 49 state attorneys general, we achieved the largest federal-state settlement in history - totaling $25 billion - with five of the nation's top mortgage servicers. Our health care fraud pr evention efforts recovered nearly $4.1 billion in FY 2011, a single-year record. In addition, we have worked tirelessly to safe guard the most vulnerable members of society by working to stop the abuse, neglect, trafficking, and exploitation of children, the elderly, and other populations. Over the past 3 fiscal years, we prosecuted 35 percent more hate crime cases than during the preceding 3-year period. Thanks to new prot ections included in the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act - which was signed into law in 2009 - we've strengthened our ability to achieve justice on behalf of all those who are victimized si mply because of who they are. Additionally, through t he Department's Access to Justice Initi ative, we are helping to fulfill the promise of equal justice under law by working to ensure that our just ice system can efficiently deliver outcomes that are fair and accessible to al l, irrespective of wealth or status. Furthermore, the Department remains committe d to using its resources both efficiently effectively - and to acting as a sound steward of precious taxpayer dollars. During FY 2012, the Department realigned functions of the Nationa l Drug Intelligence Center saving $19.2 million. We also saved $39.3 million by using economies of scal e to reduce administrative costs across multiple DOJ components in areas including printing, pub lications, travel and conferences. And we will continue to seek savings and find efficiencies throughout the Departme nt, while successfully executing our mission responsibilities. Prepared pursuant to the Reports Consolid ation Act of 2000 and gui dance in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars A-11, A-123, and A-136, the FY 2012 Department of Justice Performance and Accountability Report contains: our performance report, as required by the Government Performance and Results Act; our audite d consolidated financial statements, as required by the Chief Financial Officers Act and the Governme nt Management Reform Act; and a statement of assurance regarding our internal co ntrol and financial management systems, as required by the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA). In FY 2012, the Department again earned an unqualified audit opinion on our consolidated financial statements. For the sixth straight year, the auditor's report on internal control identified no material weaknesses at the consolidated level. Wh ile we continue as a De partment to demonstrate noteworthy progress, we are committed to pursuing ac tions to correct remaining areas where we have deficiencies. In addition, the Department is implementing the Unified Financial Management System (UFMS), which has allowed DOJ to retire four legacy systems and improve financial accountability. The number of user s of UFMS will double in the firs t quarter of FY 2013, and the system is an integral part of the Department's strategy and commitment to ensure transparency. The Department conducted its annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls to support effective and efficient pr ogrammatic operations and complianc e with applicable laws and regulations (FMFIA Section 2) a nd to determine whether financial management systems conform to government-wide requirements (FMFIA Section 4). Ba sed on the results of this assessment, I provide qualified assurance that the Department met the object ives of FMFIA. The assessment did not identify any systems non-conformances required to be reported under FMFIA Section 4; however, the assessment identified one material weakness required to be reported under FMFIA Section 2 related to prison crowding. In addition, I provide reasonable a ssurance that the Department's internal control over financial reporting met the objectiv es of OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A. The financial and performance data presented in this report are complete and reliable, providing timely and useful information on the Department's accomplishments for the American public. We will not rest on our achievements, but will continue to be unyielding in our efforts to prevent terrorism, fight violent crim e, prosecute financial fraud, prot ect our most vulnerable citizens, and to carry out the entire ty of our critical mission.

The Department was created to control federal law enforcement, and all criminal prosecutions and civil su its in which the United States has an interest. The structure of the Department has changed over the year s, with the addition of a Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, Assist ant Attorneys General, and the form ation of Divisions and components; however, unchanged is the commitment and response to securing equal justice for all, enhancing respect for the rule of law, and making America a safer and more secure Nation. The mission of the Department of Justice, as reflected in its new Strategic Plan for fiscal years (FY) 2012- 2016, is as follows: To enforce the law and defend the interests of th e United States according to the law, to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic, to provide federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime, to seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful behavior, and to ensure fair and impartial adm inistration of justice for all Americans.

We enforce these laws fairly and uniformly to ensure that all Americans receive equal protection and justice under the law. Honesty and Integrity. We adhere to the highest standards of ethical behavior. Commitment to Excellence. We seek to provide the highest levels of service to the American people.

We treat each other and those we serve with fairness, dignity, and compassion. We value diffe rences in people and ideas. We are committed to the well-being of our employees and to providing oppor tunities for individual growth and development. From our mission and core values stem the Depart ment's strategic and annual planning processes. The Department embraces the concepts of performance-based management. At the heart of these concepts is the understanding that improved performance is realized through greater focus on mission, agreement on goals and objectives, and timely reporting of results. In the De partment, strategic planning is the first step in an iterative planning and implementation cycle. This cycle, which is the center of the Department's efforts to implement performance-based management, involves setti ng long-term goals and objectives, translating these goals and objectives into budgets and program plans, implementing programs, monitoring performance, and Strategic Goals and Objectives Mission Section IDepartment of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report I-2evaluating results.

These statements were prepared from the accounting records of the Departme nt in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements . These principles are the standards promulgated by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB). The following information highlights the Department's fina ncial position and results of operations in FY 2012.

Liabilities: Total Department liabilities were $15.9 billion as of September 30, 2012, an increase of $2.7 billion from the previous year's total liabilities of $13.3 billion. This increase is primarily due to the reactivation of the September 11 th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 a nd the recognition of related unfunded liabilities. Net Cost of Operations: The Consolidated Statement of Net Cost presents the Department's gross and net cost by strategic goal. The net cost of the Depart ment's operations totaled $38. 2 billion for the year ended September 30, 2012, an increase of $5.6 billion (17 percent) from the previous year's net cost of operations of $32.6 billion. This increase is partially due to the r ecognition of unfunded expenses related to the reactivation of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. Brief descriptions of some of the major co sts for each Strategic Goal are as follows: Strategic Goal Description of Major Costs I Includes resources dedicated to count erterrorism initiatives for ATF, CRM, DEA, FBI, NSD, USAs, and USMS II Includes resources for the AFF, ATF, BOP, COPS, CRS, DEA, FBI, Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (FCSC), Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF), OJP, Office of Legal Counsel, Office of the Pardon Attorney (OPA), Office of the Solicit or General (OSG), OVW, USAs, USMS, INTERPOL Washington, UST, AT R, CIV, CRT, CRM, ENRD,TAX and services to America's crime victims III Includes resources for BOP, EOIR, Fees and Expenses of Witnesses, FPI, OJP, Justice Prisoner Alien Transport ation System, USMS, and U.S. Parole Commission Management and administrative costs, including the co sts for the Department's leadership offices, JMD, Wireless Management Office, and others, are allocated to each strategic goal based on full-time equivalent (FTE) employment.1 1 FTE employment means the total number of regular straight-time hours (i.e., not including overtime or holiday hours) worked by employees, divided by the number of compensable hours applicable to each fiscal year. Annual leave, sick leave, compensatory time off, and other approved leave categories are considered \"hours worked\" for purposes of defining FTE employment. Analysis of Financial Statements Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report I-9 Budgetary Resources: The Department's FY 2012 Combined St atement of Budgetary Resources shows $45.3 billion in total budgetary resources, an increase of $2.9 billion from the previous year's total budgetary resources of $42.4 billion. This increase is primarily related to deposits from the settlement of large cases. Net Outlays: The Department's FY 2012 Combined Statem ent of Budgetary Resources shows $31.6 billion in net outlays, an increase of $669 million from the prev ious year's total net out lays of $30.9 billion. The Department views data reliability and validity as critically important in the planning and assessment of its performance. As such, the Department makes every effo rt to ensure completeness and improve reliability of its performance information by performing \"data scrubs\" (r outine examination of current and historical data sets, as well as looking toward the future for trends) to ensure the data we rely on to make day-to-day management decisions are as accurate and reliable as possible and targets are ambitious enough given the resources provided. In an effort to communicate our data limitations and commitment to providing accurate data, this document includes a discussion of data validati on, verification, and any iden tified data limitations for each performance measure presented. The Department ensures each repor ting component providing data for this report meets the following criteria: At a minimum, performance data are considered reliable if transactions and other data that support reported performance measures are pr operly recorded, process ed, and summarized to permit the preparation of performance informa tion in accordance with criteria stated by management. Performance data need not be perfect to be reliable, particularly if the cost and effort to secure the best performance data po ssible will exceed the value of any data so obtained. Data Reliability and Validity Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report I-10 The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires an agency's Strategic Plan to be updated every four years and cover a period of not less than fo ur years forward from the fiscal year in which it is submitted. The Department's new FY 2012-2016 Strategic Plan, whic h contains three strategic goals, is used for this report. The Department's Plan also includes 12 ke y performance measures addressing DOJ's highest priorities toward achieving its long-term outcome goals. The pe rformance measures are included in the Department's annual Budget and Performance Summary and reported in this document. The Department's full Performance Report for these measures, including an update on our progress toward meeting the FY 2016 long-term outcome goals, is included in Section II of this document. The Department strives to present the highest-level outcome-oriented measures available and fully repo rt the accomplishments achieved during the reporting period. However, data for the 12 key measures are compiled 30 days after the end of the fiscal year and, occasionally, data for the entire year are not available at the time of publication. During FY 2012, Departmental leadership contin ued to display a clear commitment to performance management through the reliance on formal quarterly stat us reviews. Additionally, Departmental components have worked to improve the qualit y and timeliness of financial and pe rformance information that inform quarterly status reporting and operating plans. For this report, 100 percent of the performance measur es have actual data for FY 2012. The Department achieved 58 percent of its key measures in FY 2012. In certain cases, FY 2012 data have yet to be finalized and could change the final outcome. The Departme nt continues to emphasize long-term and annual performance measure development, placement of ke y performance indicators on cascading employee work plans, and Department-wide quarterly status reporting. In FY 2012, the Department successfully devel oped and implemented a new web-based performance management system. The Department will continue to examine its performance management system and implement improvements, where necessary. Additional improvement areas include developing trend reports, continuing to improve the quality and utility of perfo rmance information and continuing to work with OMB and other federal agencies to develop mechanisms to target and measure efficiency of law enforcement and regulatory programs. In addition to monitoring its annual progress, the De partment continues to monitor progress made toward achieving its FY 2016 long-term outcome goals for each of the 12 key performance measu res. As of the close of FY 2012, 11 of 12 of the Departme nt's long-term key measures are on-track for full achievement against its FY 2016 long-term outcome goals (targets). Four full years of performance remain until the Department reports against planned progress, and a number of mechanisms are in place to ensure that the current progress is maintained, including quarterly status reporting an d performance-informed budget submissions that request the resources necessary for the Department to reach its goals.

The Priority Goals should also re present critical elements of a federal agency's strategic plan. The following comprise the Department's four Priority Goals for FY 2012-2013 and are linked to the larger DOJ policy framework and strategic plan goals. Priority Goal 1, National Security : Better inform the Intelligence Community, thereby increasing the ability to protect Americans from terrorism or other threats to national security - both at home and abroad: By the end of 2013, increase the number of in telligence products shared with the U.S. Intelligence Community and state and local Law Enforcement Community partners by 6 percent By the end of 2013, increase the number of in telligence products shared with foreign government agencies by 6 percent Terrorism is the most significant national security thre at the country faces. Accordingly, the number one priority of the Department is, and will continue to be , protecting the security of this Nation's citizens. The Administration has recognized that terrorism cannot be defeated by military means alone and the Department is at the forefront of the fight against terrorism. DOJ provides a broad spectrum of tools and skills to combat terrorists. Specifically, DOJ's agents, analysts, an d prosecutors will use every available resource and appropriate tool to detect, deter, a nd disrupt terrorist plots, investigate and prosecute terrorists, and aid in developing rule of law programs in post-conflict countries to help preven t terrorism abroad. The Department will aggressively pursue emerging threats around the worl d and at home, enhance the ability to gather and analyze actionable intelligence, and engage in outreach e fforts to all communities in order to prevent terrorism before it occurs. o Status : The Department met its FY 2012 target fo r increasing the number of intelligence products shared with foreign government agencies, but miss ed its FY 2012 target for increasing the number of intelligence products shared with the U.S. In telligence Community and state and local Law Enforcement Community Partners. The number of intelligence products shared with fo reign government agencies decreased from 1,860 to 1,795 from the third to the fourth quarter of FY 2012, but exceeded its fourth quarter target by 200 percent. In comparison, intelligence products shared in FY 2011 for the third and fourth quarters were 850 and 801, respectively. Shared Counterterrori sm Division (CTD) intelligence products include a wide variety of disseminations to foreign govern ments. Coordination and cooperation with foreign partners serve the interests of FBI CTD to iden tify upcoming threats and better monitor the activities of known entities. CTD Executive Management has identified the need for increased communications with Foreign Governments, and as such, CTD has pushed for increased contact. The number of intelligence products shared with th e U.S. Intelligence Community and state and local Law Enforcement Community partners increased from 3,061 to 3,347 from the third to the fourth quarter of FY 2012, and missed its fourth quarter target by only 2%. In comparison, intelligence products shared in FY 2011 for the third and four th quarter were 3,434 and 3,642, respectively. The FBI CTD recognizes coordination and collaborati on with Other Government Agency (OGA), Intelligence Community (IC), and domestic Law Enforc ement (LE) partners is essential to mitigating FY 2012 - 2013 Priority Goals Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report I-15the domestic and international threat. CTD attributes the measure missing its fourth quarter target to lower Intelligence Information Report (IIR) producti on. Based on feedback received from OGA, IC, and LE partners, CTD emphasized the production of high-value IIRs which addressed priority intelligence gaps or provided actionable intelligence to IC and LE partners over low-value IIRs which served only to flood the system with non-actiona ble intelligence or information of little-to-no intelligence value. This change has been well-r eceived by OGA, IC, and LE partners. CTD Executive Management will continue to focus on increased in telligence sharing in the effort to combat the terrorist threat. Priority Goal 2, Reduce Gang Violence : By September 30, 2013, in conjunction with state and local law enforcement agencies, reduce the number of violent crimes attributed to gangs by achieving 5 percent increases on 3 key indicators: Youths who exhibited a change in targeted behaviors as a result of participation in DOJ gang prevention program Coordination on gang investigatio ns among federal, state, and local law enforcement resulting in gang arrests Intelligence products produced in support of fede ral, state, and local investigations that are focused on gangs posing a significant threat to communities Gangs and gun violence pose a serious threat to public safety in many communities throughout the United States. Too many youth are exposed to violence and ga ngs. Too many families continue to face substantial challenges in keeping their children saf e and free from the conditions that can lead to violence. While data shows that overall violent crime in the United States is decreasing, many communities continue to experience high levels of gun violence and gang-re lated crimes. Gang members are in creasingly migrating from urban to suburban, rural, and tribal communities and are responsib le for a growing percentage of crime and violence in many communities. The Department's efforts to protec t our citizens from violence will be carried out through collaboration with our state, local, and tribal partners . Through the United States Attorneys and our violent crime task forces, the Department will work with indivi dual jurisdictions to address the impact of gang-related crimes on communities. The federal, state, local, a nd tribal efforts will be enhanced through increased coordinated enforcement efforts and intelligence sharing. Additionally, prevention of gang violence and gang membership is a necessary element of our strategy to address violent crime. The Department will utilize a number of evidence-based programs to assist state, local, and tribal governments in their efforts to deter youths from participation in gangs through these data-drive n prevention programs, which are designed to prevent increases in gang membership and to deter youth violence. o Status : The percentage of program youth who exhi bited a change in targeted behaviors while participating in DOJ prevention programs to redu ce youth crime and violence (including gangs) is targeted annually and actual data is reported in the fi rst and third quarters due to data collection cycles. In FY 2012, the Department reported that 67% of program youth exhibited a change in targeted behaviors, exceeding the FY 2012 target of 65%. In FY 2011, 63% of program youth exhibited a change in targeted behaviors. The Department exceeded its FY 2012 target for the number of gang cases supported by the Gang Unit, and the National Gang Targeting, Enforcem ent & Coordination Center/Operations Section: Gangs (GangTECC/OSG) in FY 2012 by 169 or 22 %. In FY 2011, the Department increased the number of cases supported by 192 cases or 26%. The Department exceeded its FY 2012 target to prod uce intelligence products in support of federal, state, and local investigations that are focused on gangs posing a significant threat to communities by 7 or 16%. In FY 2012, the number of intellig ence products produced increased from FY 2011 by 8 or18%. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report I-16Priority Goal 3, Protect the American peop le from Financial and Healthcare fraud : In order to efficiently and effectively address financial fraud a nd healthcare fraud, by the end of FY 2013, increase by 5 percent over FY 2011 levels, the number of inv estigations completed per Department of Justice attorney working on financial fraud and healthcare fraud cases; additionally, institute a system for tracking compliance by corporate defendants with th e terms of judgments, consent decrees, settlements, deferred prosecution agreements, and non-prosecution agreements. The recent financial crisis, which has impacted ever y American, has resulted in fraud and deception in the finance and housing markets as well as fraudulent schem es that misuse the public's unprecedented investment in economic recovery. Criminals who commit mortga ge fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and other types of fraud relating to the response to the econom ic crisis, including the funds disbursed through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Tr oubled Asset Relief Program, victimize the American public as a whole. Similarly, those who defraud Me dicare, Medicaid, and other government health care programs defraud every American. Fr audsters take critical resources out of our health care system\u2014thus contributing to the rising cost of health care for all Americans and endangering the short-term and long-term solvency of these essential health care programs. The Department will continue to address these critical problems by vigorously investigating and prosecuting bot h health care fraud and financial fraud, in order to protect American businesses, consumers, and taxpayers. o Status : The Department did not achieve its FY 2012 goal of increasing by 2.5% the number of investigations completed per DOJ attorney worki ng on financial fraud and healthcare fraud cases. The target for FY 2012 was 11.92 investigations per atto rney. However, actual results show only 10.28 investigations per attorney. Several factors ha ve contributed to the decline in the number of investigations completed in FY 2012. Over the l ast several years, including the baseline year, FY 2011, the number of health care fraud and fi nancial fraud cases reached all-time highs. The complexity of these health care fraud and financia l fraud cases continues to increase, e.g., number of defendants and methods of fraud. As complexity in creases, more attorney effort is expended on these complex cases, thereby reducing the overall number of investigations completed. Finally, the Speedy Trial Act necessitates that priority be placed on exis ting cases. Therefore, the availability of attorneys to devote effort to new matters is further limited. Priority Goal 4, Protect those most in need of help: With special emphasis on child exploitation and civil rights. By September 30, 2013, working with state and local law enforcement agencies, protect potential victims from abuse and exploitation by achievin g a 5 percent increase for 3 sets of key indicators: open investigations concerning non-compliant sex offenders, sexual exploitation of children, and human trafficking matters/investigations resolved co ncerning sexual exploitation of children and human trafficking number of children depicted in child pornography that are identified by the FBI The abuse, neglect, exploitation, and trafficking, includ ing sexual abuse, of children, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations, causes irrevocable harm to victim s and society. Ensuring that our children, seniors, and all citizens can live without being disturbed by sexua l trauma, exploitation, or human trafficking are more than criminal justice issues, they are societal and mora l issues. Despite efforts to date, the threat of these crimes remains very real. In the broadest terms, the goal of the Department is to prevent child sexual exploitation, elder abuse, hate crimes, and human traf ficking from occurring in the first place, in order to protect every person from the physical and mental traumas associated with these crimes. o Status: Overall, DOJ is on track to achieve this goal. Five out of six performance measures for this goal exceeded their FY 2012 annual targets. At the begi nning of FY 2012, the USMS brought on-board additional full time sex offender investigative coordi nators to focus on non-compliant sex offenders, and it exceeded its FY 2012 annual target (1,305) for Open investigations concerning non-compliant sex Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report I-17offenders by 17% (1,531); this is a 19 % increase as compared to the FY 2011 activity. Open investigations concerning human trafficking exceeded its annual target of 188 by 37%t (258); this is a 41% increase compared to the FY 2011 activity. Matters/investigations resolved concerning human trafficking exceeded its annual target of 83 by 29% (107); this is a 34% increase as compared to the FY 2011 activity. Number of children depicted in child po rnography that are identified by the FBI exceeded its annual target of 175 by 37 percent (239). This is one less than identified in FY 2011. Open investigations concerning sexual exploitation of children surpassed its FY 2012 annual target (560) by 41 percent (792); this is 45% increase as compared to the FY 2011 activity. Matters/investigations resolved concerning sexual exploitation of children , reached only 87% (4,245) of its FY 2012 annual target (4,855); this is a 10% decrease as compared to the FY 2011 activity. There are three factors contributing to the slower progress in resolving matters/investigations concerning the sexual exploitation of children. First, the Criminal Division reso lved an unusually large number of matters in FY 2011 (a particularly large interna tional child pornography ring was investigated and charged in FY 2011, resulting in a large number of ma tters resolved) that produced a particularly high FY 2011 baseline. Second, due to increasing sophis tication of many offenders' use of technologies to help evade detection, it often is taking more time to investigate individual matters. Third, the difficulty in replacing experienced child exploitation prosecutors may be another reason that DOJ is slightly below expectations on this performance measure. Internal Control Program in the Department of Justice The objective of the Department of Justice's internal control program is to provi de reasonable assurance that operations are effective, efficient, and comply with applicable laws and regula tions; financial reporting is reliable; and assets are safeguarded against waste, loss , and unauthorized use. The Department identifies issues of concern through a strong network of oversight councils and internal review teams. These include the Department's Senior Assessment Team, the Jus tice Management Division's Internal Review and Evaluation Office and Quality Control and Compliance Gr oup, and Departmental component internal review teams. In addition, the Department considers reports issued by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) when assessing internal control. The Department's internal control continues to im prove through the corrective actions implemented by management. The Department's commitment to mana gement excellence, accountability, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations is evidenced in our continuing actions to establish effective controls, make sound determinations on correctiv e actions, and verify and validate the results. This commitment is further evidenced by the many control improvements and actions taken by Depa rtmental management in response to new legislation, OMB initiatives, and OIG recommendations, as discussed later in this section and in Appendix A. Departmental management continued in FY 2012 to fu rther strengthen and maximize the effectiveness of its annual assessment of internal control over financia l reporting. Examples of such actions include: refining the assessment framework, enhancing the oversight process to ensure pr ompt implementation of corrective actions, providing direct assistance to components with previously identified reportable conditions, and continuing to support and commit resources to Depa rtmental component internal review programs. Analysis of Systems, Controls, and Legal Compliance Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report I-18 Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982 The Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (F MFIA or Integrity Act) provides the statutory basis for management's responsibility for and assessment of internal accounting and administrative controls. Such controls include program, operational, and administrative areas, as well as accounting and financial management. The Integrity Act requires federal agencies to establish controls that reasonably ensure obligations and costs are in compliance with applicable law; funds, property, and other assets are safeguarded against waste, loss, unauthorized use, or misappropriation; and revenues and expenditures are properly reco rded and accounted for to maintain accountability over the assets. The Integrity Act also requires agencies to annually assess and report on the internal controls that protect the integrity of federal programs (FMFIA \u00a7 2) and whether financial management systems conform to related requirements (FMFIA \u00a7 4). Guidance for implementing the Integrity Act is provided through OMB Circular A-123, Management's Responsibility for Internal Control. In addition to requiring agencies to provide an assurance statement on the effectiveness of programmatic internal controls and conformance with financial system requirements, the Circular requires agencies to provide an assuran ce statement on the effectiveness of inte rnal control over financial reporting. FMFIA Assurance Statement Department of Justice management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls and financial management systems that meet the objectives of the FMFIA. In accordance with OMB Circular A-123, the Department conducted its annual assessment of the eff ectiveness of internal contro ls to support effective and efficient programmatic operations, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations (FMFIA \u00a7 2). The Department also assessed whether its financial management systems conform to financial system requirements (FMFIA \u00a7 4). Based on the results of the assessments, the Department can provide qualified assurance that its internal controls and financial management systems meet the objectives of the FMFIA. The assessment of systems did not identify any non-conforman ces required to be reported under FMFIA \u00a7 4; however, the assessment of internal controls identified one programmatic material weakness required to be reported under FMFIA \u00a7 2. This weakness involves the need to reduce the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) crowding rate, currently at 38 percent over the rated capacity. Details of the weakness are provided in the section Summary of Material Weakness and Corrective Actions. Other than th e exception noted, the internal controls were operating effectively as of September 30, 2012, and the assessment id entified no other material weaknesses in the design or operation of the controls. In accordance with Appendix A of OMB Circular A-123, the Department conducted its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, which included the safeguarding of assets and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Based on the results of this assessment, the Department can provide reasonable assurance that its internal control over financial reporting was operating effectively as of June 30, 2012, and the assessment identified no material weakne sses in the design or operation of the controls. The Department of Justice is committed to maintaining strong program and financial management as we continue our mission of fighting terrorism and protecting our commun ities from crime. We take our program and financial accountability seriously and are dedicated to ensuring th at funds received are expended responsibly and in a transparent manner. We will continue to strengthen controls in areas wher e we are aware of concerns identified through the Department's internal review activities or by the Office of the Inspector General and Government Accountability Office. We look forward in FY 2013 to building on our achievements as we continue the important work of the Department. Eric H. Holder, Jr. Attorney General November 9, 2012 Management Assurances Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report I-19Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA) was designed to advance federal financial management by ensuring that federal financ ial management systems provide accurate, reliable, and timely financial management information to the gove rnment's managers. Compliance with the FFMIA provides the basis for the continuing use of reliable fi nancial management informa tion by program managers, as well as by the President, Congress, and public. The FFMIA requires agencies to have financial management systems that substantially comply with federal financial manageme nt system requirements, applicable federal accounting standards, and the applica tion of the U.S. Government Standard General Ledger at the transaction level. Guidance for implementing the FFMIA is provided through OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems. FFMIA Compliance Determination During FY 2012, the Department assessed its financia l management systems for compliance with the FFMIA and determined that, when taken as a whole, they subs tantially comply with the FFMIA. This determination is based on the results of FISMA reviews and testi ng performed for OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A. Consideration was also given to issues identified dur ing the Department's financial statement audit. A summary of the Department's compliance with the sp ecific requirements of the FFMIA is provided at the end of this sub-section. Financial Management Systems Strategy, Goals, and Framework The Department's financial management systems strate gy is to ultimately replace the three remaining major non-integrated legacy accounting systems in use in the Department with the single, integrated financial management system the Department is deploying - the Unified Financial Management System (UFMS). UFMS delivers standard, core accounting processes, as we ll as the data needed for effective financial and budget management. In FYs 2009 through 2012, the Depa rtment made measurable progress in implementing UFMS. In FY 2009, the DEA successfully migrated to UFMS and, importantly, obtained an unqualified audit opinion on its financial statements produced from UFMS th at year and in every year since. As expected, the DEA project was a large, complex, and difficult migration, but one that helped to lay the foundation for the migration of the ATF, which occurred in FY 2011, an d the migrations of the USMS and FBI, which are underway and scheduled for completion in FYs 2013 and 2014, respectively. The migration of the USMS will replace one of the three major non-integrated legacy accoun ting systems, leaving two in use in the Department. The UFMS implementation goals, such as the migrations of the USMS and FBI, leverage lessons learned from previous migrations and are based on and aligned w ith operational risks and re quirements unique to each component. The Department's UFMS implementation has already enabled components to improve financial and budget management and realize increased efficiencies. Additi onal improvements and efficiencies are guaranteed to be realized as additional components fully migrate to UFMS. For example, UFMS has standardized and integrated financial processes to more effectively su pport accounting operations, provide accurate and timely financial information throughout the y ear, facilitate preparation of financ ial statements, and streamline audit processes.

The associated Corrective Action Plan is provided in Section IV of this document. As of September 30, 2012, the inmate population housed in BOP operated institutions exceeded the rated housing capacity by 38 percent. The BOP's Long Range Capacity Plan relies on multiple approaches to house the increasing federal inmate population, such as cont racting with the private sector and state and local facilities for certain groups of low-security inmates; expanding existing institutions where infrastructure permits, programmatically appropriate, a nd cost effective to do so; and ac quiring, constructing, and activating new facilities as funding permits. To address this material weakness, the BOP will con tinue implementing its Long Range Capacity Plan, making enhancements and modifications to the plan , as needed, commensurate with funding received through enacted budgets. The BOP's formal Corrective Action Plan includes utilizi ng contract facilities; expanding existing institutions; and acquiring, constructing, and activating new institutions as funding permits. The BOP will continue to validate progress on construction proj ects at new and existing facilities through on-site inspections or by reviewing monthly construction progress reports. This material weakness was first reported in 2006. Remediation of the weakness through increasing prison capacity is primarily dependent on funding. Other co rrectional reforms and alte rnatives will require policy and/or statutory changes. Other initiatives notwithstandi ng, if the acquisition, expansion, construction, and activation plans detailed in the BOP's Long Range Ca pacity Plan are funded as proposed, the over-crowding rate for FY 2018 is projected to be 44 percent. The Department's corrective action efforts are not limite d to the BOP alone. The Department continues to consider and implement an array of crime prevention, sentencing, and corrections management improvements that focus on accountability and rehabilitation, while prot ecting public safety. The Department recognizes that the BOP's capacity management efforts must be teamed with targeted programs that are proven to reduce recidivism and promote effective re-entry. The BOP will continue to work with the Department on these programs. Programmatic Material Weakness and Corrective Actions - Prison Crowding Summary of Material Weakness and Corrective Actions Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report I-23 The Department recognizes the importance of maintaini ng adequate internal controls to ensure proper payments and is committed to the continuous improvement of the overall disbursement management process. A summary of actions taken by Departmental manage ment in FY 2012 to implement the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) follow. Addi tional details, as well as th e Department's submission of the required improper payments reporting, ar e provided in Appendix A of this document. The IPERA and OMB April 2011 implementing guidance, OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, Requirements for Effective Measurement and Remediation of Improper Payments , require agencies to review all programs and activities they administer to identify those that are susceptible to significant improper payments. OMB defines significant improper payments as gross a nnual improper payments (i.e., the total amount of overpayments plus underpayments) in a program exc eeding (1) both 2.5 percent of program outlays and $10 million of all program or activity payments made during the fiscal year reported or (2) $100 million, regardless of the improper payment percentage of total program outlays. The Department's top-down approach for assessing the risk of significant improper payments allows the reporting of results by the Department's five mission-aligned programs - Law Enfo rcement; Litigation; Prisons and Detention; State, Local, Tribal, and Other Assistance; and Administrative, Technology, and Other. In accordance with the IPERA and OMB implementing guidance, the Department assessed its programs and activities for susceptibility to significant improper payments. Based on the r esults of the risk assessment for the year ended September 30, 2012, the Department concluded there were no programs susceptible to significant improper payments, i.e., improper payments exceeding the OMB thresholds of both 2.5 percent of program outlays and $10 million or $100 million. The IPERA and OMB implementing guidance require ag encies to conduct payment recapture audits (also known as recovery audits) for each program and activity that expends $1 million or more annually - including contracts, grants, and benefit payments - if conducting such audits would be cost-effective. Prior to FY 2011, payment recapture audits were only required for agenci es that entered into contracts with a total value in excess of $500 million in a fiscal year, and for certain other programs that were not applicable to the Department. The OMB implementing guidance also re quires agencies to establish annual targets for their payment recapture audit programs - based on the rate of recovery - to drive performance. Agencies have the discretion to set their own payment recovery rate target s for review and approval by OMB, but agencies are to strive to achieve an annual recovery rate target of at least 85 percent by the end of FY 2013. In FY 2011, the Department expanded the scope of its payment recapture audits to contracts, grants, and benefit and other payments as required by the IPERA a nd OMB implementing guidance. The Department also established annual payment recovery rate targets thr ough FY 2014 to drive performance. In FY 2012, the Department updated its targets and a dded an annual target for FY 2015. In accordance with the IPERA and OMB implemen ting guidance, the Department measured payment recapture performance. Based on performance through th e year ended September 30, 2012, the Department Payment Recapture Audits Risk Assessment Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report I-24achieved a payment recovery rate of 93 percent fo r the cumulative period of FYs 2004 through 2012. Additional details, to include the Department's annual payment recovery rate, are provided in Appendix A. The Department's leadership is comm itted to ensuring its programs and ac tivities will continue to be focused on meeting the dynamic demands of the changing legal, economic, and technological environments of the future. James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 DOJ workload could potentially increase resulti ng from the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. The Act provides compensation to any individual (or personal representative of a deceased individual) who suffere d physical harm as a result of the terror-related aircraft crashes of September 11, 2001, or the debr is removal efforts that took place in the immediate aftermath. Technology Advances in high-speed telecommunications, computers, and other technologies are creating new opportunities for criminals, new classes of crimes, and new challenges for law enforcement. Growing dependence on technology is creating an increasing vulnerability to illegal acts, especially white collar crime and terrorism. Economy Amount of regulation and the pace of economic growth and globalization are changing the volume and nature of anti-competitive behavior. The interconnected nature of the world's economy is increasing opportunities for criminal activity, including money laundering, white collar crime, a nd alien smuggling, as well as the complexity and scope of civil justice matters. Government Changes in the fiscal posture or policies of state and local governments could have dramatic effects on their capacity to remain effective law enforcemen t partners, e.g., the ability and willingness of these governments to allow federal use of their jail space affects achievement of detention goals. Globalization Issues of criminal and civil justice increasingly transcend national boundaries, requiring the cooperation of foreign governments and involving treaty obligations, multinational environment and trade agreements, and other foreign policy concerns. Social-Demographic The numbers of adolescents and young adults, now th e most crime-prone segment of the population, are expected to grow rapidly over the next several years. Possible Effects of Existing, Currently Known Demands, Risks, Uncertainties, Events, Conditions, and Trends Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report I-25Unpredictable Overseas Contingency Operations require continual adjustments to new conditions. The Department is determined to confront proactively new ch allenges in its efforts to protect the Nation. Responses to unanticipated natural disasters and thei r aftermath require the Department to divert resources to deter, investigate, and prosecute disast er-related federal crimes, such as charity fraud, insurance fraud and other crimes. Changes in federal laws may aff ect responsibilities and workload. Much of the litigation caseload is defensive. The De partment has little control over the number, size, and complexity of the civil lawsuits it must defend. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act The Department received $4.0 billion in funding for programs, under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In addition, $2.0 million was provided for the Department's Office of the Inspector General oversight activities related to Re covery Act funding. The Department is fully committed to ensuring that the funds received are e xpended responsibly and in a transparent manner to further job creation, economic recove ry, and other purposes of the Act.

Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-1 Performance Section - FY 2012 Performance Report (Unaudited) This section of the PAR presents to the President, the Congress, and the public a clear picture of how the Department of Justice (DOJ or the Department) is working toward accomplishing its mission. The Performance Report provides a summary discussion of the De partment's three strategic goals. It also reports on the 12 key performance measures for these goals by detailing program objectives and FY 2012 targets and actual performance, as well as whether targets were or we re not achieved. Each key performance measure also includes information related to data collection and st orage, data validation a nd verification, and data limitations. In addition, this section includes info rmation regarding the Department's progress toward achieving the FY 2016 long-term outcome goals set forth in its FYs 2012-2016 Strategic Plan. At the Department, performance planning and reporting is companion to the budget process. We recognize that performance information is vital to making resource a llocation decisions and should be an integral part of the budget. The Department provides detailed compone nt-specific annual performance plans within individual budget submissions, which also serve as th e Department's annual performance plan. In FY 2012, the Department continued to demonstrat e clear management commitment to timely and accurate financial and budget information through the use of De partment-wide quarterly status reporting. As the Department continues to develop its capacity to gather and use performance information, we will continue to communicate performance information. Quarterly status reporting has provided the Department the ability to identify problems early, take necessary corrective actions , develop more effective strategies, and allocate necessary resources. Measuring Departmental Impact For FY 2012, the Department introduced a new set of key performance measures that track the progress of the long-term performance goals. Our long- term performance goals continue to reflect results, not just workload or processes. For example, we have focused law enfo rcement efforts on disrupting and dismantling targeted criminal groups, such as major drug trafficking organi zations. In areas such as litigation, where results- oriented measurement is particularly difficult, we conti nue to reevaluate our long-term targets to ensure that we are being aggressive enough in our goals for case resolutions for all of our litigating divisions. Measuring law enforcement performance presents uni que challenges. Success for the Department is highlighted when justice is served fairly and impartially and the public is protected. In many areas, our efforts cannot be reduced to numerical counts of activities. Add itionally, isolating the effects of our work from other factors that affect outcomes over which the Depart ment has little or no control presents a formidable challenge. Many factors contribute to the rise and fall of crime rates, including federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement activities and sociological, economic, and other factors. As a result, we have focused on more targeted measures of programmatic pe rformance such as t hose described above. Section II OverviewDepartment of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-2Measure Refinement, Data Revisions, and Subsequent Year Reporting The FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report presents the highest-level outcome-oriented measures available and fully reports on the accomplishments achieved during the reporting period. Occasionally, however, data for an entire year are not available at the time of publication. Also, the Department is unable to report on a limited number of performance measures due to calendar year reporting or other limitations. In those instances, performance for those measures w ill be reported in the subsequent year's Performance and Accountability Report . For this report, ten years of data will be presented unless the performance outcome goal has less than ten years, in which case all information is then presented. For purposes of this report, the Department's new FY 2012-2016 Strategic Plan is used with key performance measures fully aligning to the Plan's priorities and goals. Therefore, the FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report highlights the key goals and performan ce measures refl ected in the FY 2012-2016 Strategic Plan. The Report also provides details on the Department's success in meeting its performance measure targets in FY 2012. Additional programma tic and performance information can be found in individual components' budget submissions, specifica lly within the Performance and Resources Tables (http://www.justice.gov/jmd/st rategic2012-2016/index.html ). Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-3 STRATEGIC GOAL 1 : Prevent Terrori sm and Promote the Nation's Security Consistent with the Rule of Law 14% of the Department's Net Costs supports this Goal. Terrorism is the most significant national security threat that faces our Nation. The Department's focus is protecting the Homeland from future te rrorist attacks. To ensure attainment of this goal, prevention is our highest priority. The Department ha s taken, and will continue to take assertive actions to prevent, disrupt, and defeat terrorist operations before they occur; investigate and prosecute those who commit or intend to commit terrorist acts; and strengthen partne rships to prevent, deter and respond to terrorist incidents. In order to have the information we need to keep our Nation safe, we are continuing to strengthen and expand our counterintelligence capabilities and to ensure th at the people that intend to do us harm come to justice. Background/Program Objectives: The FBI is committed to disrupting and preventing terrorism, from thwarting those intending to conduct a terrorist act, to inv estigating the financiers of terrorist operations. All counterterrorism investigations are managed at FBI H eadquarters by the Counterterrorism Division (CTD). The CTD provides a centralized, comprehensive, a nd intelligence-driven approach to addressing both international and domestic te rrorism-related matters. Only through broad and timely sharing of relevant information among all agencies of government with national security responsibilities, as well as our state and lo cal and foreign partners, can we effectively identify and work to prevent terrorist plots and other threats be fore they occur. As a result, the FBI disseminates intelligence products to numerous partners and stakeholders in the U.S. Intelligence Community, federal, state, municipal and tribal law enforcement co mmunity, and foreign government agencies. Performance Measure: NEW MEASURE: Number of Counterterrorism Intelligence Products Shared with the U.S. Intelligence Community, state and local la w enforcement community partners, and Foreign Government Agencies FY 2012 Target: 13,628 FY 2012 Actual: 12,445 Discussion of FY 2012 Results: The FBI missed its target for this me asure in FY 2012. Based on feedback received from Other Government Agency (OGA), IC, and law enforcement partners, CTD emphasized the production of high-value Intelligence In formation Reports (IIRs) which addr essed priority intelligence gaps or provided actionable intelligence to IC and law enforcem ent partners over low-value IIRs which served only to flood the system with non-actionable intelligence or info rmation of little-to-no intelligence value. Although the emphasis on high-value IIRs resulted in missing the FY 2012 target, the change has been well-received by OGA, IC, and law enforcement partners. CTD executiv e management will continue to focus on increased intelligence sharing in the effort to combat the terrorist threat. FY 2016 Outcome Goal: Increase by 15 percent the number of counterterrorism intelligence products shared with the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC), state and local Law Enforcement Community partners, and foreign government agencies in order to protect Americans from terrorism (baseline = 13,231) FY 2012 Progress: FY 2012 target was not met. However, the Department is on target to achieve this longterm outcome goal.

Intelligence products for domestic partners include : White Papers, Intelligence Information Reports, Intelligence Bulletins, Intelligence Ass essments, National Threat Bulletins, Current Intelligence Reports, Intel Studies, Intel Notes, meetings, and briefings. Data Collection and Storage: Data are stored on multiple platforms and collected routinely. Some data are calculated manually. Data Validation and Verification: Data are validated and verified th rough FBI reports and communications. Data Limitations: Some data are calculated manually. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-5STRATEGIC GOAL 2 : Prevent Crime, Protect the Rights of the American People, and Enforce Federal Law 50% of the Department's Net Costs supports this Goal. The heart of the Department of Justice's mission is to enforce federal laws and represent the rights and interests of the American people. Preventing and co ntrolling crime is critical to ensuring the strength and vitality of the democratic principles, rule of law, and th e administration of justice. The enforcement of federal laws keeps society safe by combating economic crime a nd reducing the threat, trafficking, and use of illegal drugs and related violence. The strengthening of partne rships between federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement will enhance our ability to prevent, solve, and control crime. Through the enforcement of our laws, we protect the rights of the vulnerable by reducing the threat, incidence, and prevalence of violent crime, including crimes against children, and upholding the civ il and constitutional rights of all Americans. The Justice Department enforces federal civil and criminal statutes, including those protecting rights, safeguarding the environment, preserving a competitive market stru cture, defending the public fisc against unwarranted claims, and preserving the integrity of the Nation's bankr uptcy system. In addition, the Department combats public and corporate corruption, fra ud, economic crime and cybercrime. Background/Program Objectives: Through the White-Collar Crime Program, the FBI investigates criminals and criminal enterprises that seek illicit gains through fra ud and guile. Illegal activities investigated include corporate, health care, securities and commodities, financial institution, mortgage, government (defense procurement and other areas), insurance, mass marketi ng, and bankruptcy fraud; environmental crimes; and money laundering. U.S. citizens and businesses lose billions of dollars each year to criminals engaged in non- violent fraudulent enterprises. The globalization of ec onomic and financial systems, technological advances, declining corporate and individual ethics, and the sophis tication of criminal organizations have resulted in annual increases in the number of illegal acts characterized by deceit, concealment, or violations of trust. These crimes contribute to a loss of confidence in fina ncial institutions, public institutions, and industry. Performance Measure: Number of Organized Criminal Enterprises Engaging in White-Collar Crimes Dismantled FY 2011 Revised Actual: 368 (Previous Actual: 340) FY 2012 Target: 360 FY 2012 Actual: 409 Discussion of FY 2012 Results: The FBI met and exceeded its target for this measure in FY 2012 through proactive investigative techniques and technological advances. Increased use of Group I Undercover Operations, Title IIIs, and other advanced techniques not commonly used in past white-collar crime (WCC) cases enabled significant inves tigative achievements against WCC threat actors. It should be noted that there is a potential lag in the reporting of the data for this measure, meaning that the final result may ultimately vary from this report. FY 2012 final results will be reflected in the FY 2014 President's budget detailed congressional justifications. FY 2016 Outcome Goal: Dismantle a cumulative total of 1,861 criminal enterprises engaging in whitecollar crime (FY 20122016) FY 2012 Progress: Department is on target to achieve this longterm outcome goal. II Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-6 Data Definition: Dismantlement means destroying the organizati on's leadership, financial base, and supply network such that the organization is incapab le of operating and/or reconstituting itself. Data Collection and Storage: The data source is the FBI's Integrated Statistical Reporting and Analysis Application database that tracks accomp lishments from inception to closure. Data Validation and Verification: Data are reviewed and approved by an FBI field manager and subsequently verified through inspection. Inspections occur at least once annually, tracing sampled data to source documents contained in FBI files. Data Limitations: FBI field personnel are required to enter acco mplishment data within 30 days of the accomplishment or a change in the status, such as those resulting from appeals. Data are compiled less than 30 days after the end of the fiscal year, and thus may not fully represent the accomplishments during the reporting period. 73 137 163 231 277 211 250 309 368 409 Crimes Dismantled Actual Target Note: FY 2011 actual number has been update d and does not reflect the number reported in the FY 2011 Performance Accountability Report. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-7 Background/Program Objectives: Gangs and gun violence pose a serious threat to public safety in many communities throughout the United States. Too many youth are exposed to violence and gangs. Too many families continue to face substantial challenges in keeping their children safe and free from the conditions that can lead to violence. Many communities continue to experience high levels of g un violence and gang-related crimes. Gang members are increasingly migrating from ur ban to suburban, rural, and tribal communities and are responsible for a growing percentage of crime a nd violence in many communities. The Department's efforts to protect our citizens from violence will be carri ed out through collaboration with our state, local, and tribal partners. Through the United States Attorneys a nd our violent crime task forces, the Department will work with individual jurisdictions to address the impact of gang-related crimes on communities. The federal, state, local, and tribal efforts will be enhanced through increased coordinated enforcement efforts and intelligence sharing. Additionally, prevention of gang violence and gang membership is a necessary element of our strategy to address violent crime. The Depart ment will utilize evidence-based , data driven prevention programs, which are designed to prevent increases in ga ng membership and to deter youth violence, to assist state, local, and tribal governments in their effo rts to deter youths from participation in gangs. Performance Measure: NEW MEASURE: Percent increase in Gang Arrests Resulting from Coordination of Gang Investigations FY 2012 Target: 2% FY 2012 Actual: - 16% Results: There are 3 contributing DOJ compone nts for this measure, namely, ATF, DEA, and FBI. The overall target for this measure wa s not met for FY 2012. While DEA met its target for the year, ATF numbers declined from FY 2011 baseline, and FBI has yet to finalize its FY 2012 data. Addressing violent crime is one of the Attorney General's FY 2012 Priority Goals, and the National Gang Targeting, Enforcement & Coordination Center (GangTECC) section /Operational Sec tion for Gangs (OSG) at DEA's Special Operations Division (S OD) has been fulfilling this priority goal. Since merging under the operational direction of SOD in FY 2010, the GangTECC section within SOD has been successfully coordinating several high impact gang operations. After supporting only approximately 100 cases in three years prior to the SOD merger, under the operational direction of SOD, the GangTECC/OSG supported over 800 cases in just its first full year at SOD. Further, in FY 2012 with a target of 2% increase in gang arrests resulting from coordination, SOD-supp orted gang cases (DEA) accounted for 891 arrests which represented a 4.4% increase from the previous year. In addition, as part of the GangTECC/OSG mission of coordinating significant local impact cases, the section also conducts outreach to state and locals, bringing them into the operations and providing support. During FY 2012, OSG conducte d 34 outreach meetings throughout the country with federal, state and local law enforcement counterparts. The FBI has yet to finalize its FY 2012 actual number. FB I expects an additional increase in the final results for this measure once field personnel submit their statisti cs into the FBI's Integrated Statistical Reporting and Analysis Application later in the calendar year. The fi nal end of year performance data for this measure will be reflected in DOJ's FY 2012 Violent Crime Priority Goal reporting process. In comparison to FY 2011, the FBI has exceeded many statistical accomplishments for FY 2012. While the FBI's Violent Gang Safe Streets Task Forces (VGSSTFs) fell short of their target of 8,531 arrests for FY 2012, VGSSTFs dismantled 123 criminal organizations - the second high est dismantlement total of the past 13 fiscal years. In addition, FBI Special Agents and task force officers posted a greater number of indictments/information, convictions, and disruptions. The FBI views indictments, convictions, disruptions, and dismantlements as relevant measures as these statistical accomplishments show a greater impact on combating violent gangs. As of September 30, FY 2016 Outcome Goal: Increase by 8 percent gang arrests resulting from coordination of gang investigations (baseline = 9,305) FY 2012 Progress: FY 2012 target was not met. However, the Department is on target to achieve this longterm outcome goal. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-82012, the and disrupted the activities of 1,557 criminal enterprises. The FBI recognizes that violent gangs are one of the biggest threats in the United St ates as 52 out of 56 FBI field offices have ranked violent gangs as a priority criminal threat. VGSSTFs are examples of the FBI's longstanding and continued commitment to address violent gang activity across the U.S. As of September 30, 2012, the FBI's safe streets and gang unit administered 164 VGSSTFs nationwide. The ATF did not meet its target for this measure in FY 2012. ATF's contribution to this measure, which is also one of DOJ's Violent Crime Priority Goal indicat ors, is 74 arrests in FY 2012, which is a 16 percent decrease from the FY 2011 baseline figure of 88 arrests. However, while the number of arrests is down, the total number of ATF cases coordinate d through GangTECC has increased from 22 in FY 2011 to 108 in FY 2012. Approximately 70 percent of these cases were initiated during the 3rd and 4th quarters of FY 2012, and will result in arrests and referrals for prosecution during FY 2013. Inclusive of the cases coordinated through GangTECC, in FY 2012, 1,889 gang -related and 1,500 trafficking-re lated defendants in ATF cases were convicted. The following case highlights ATF's FY 2012 efforts: In September 2008, the President of the San Francisco Chapter of the Hells Angels was murdered in a gang related incident in the Mission District of San Francisco. Pursuant to an extens ive ATF investigation, in February 2012, a member of the Mongols Motorcycle Club was found guilty of murder in aid of racketeering, assault with a deadly weapon (in aid of racketeering), use of firearm during/in relation to a crime of violence, and using a firearm causing murder during a crime of violence. The jury found that he had murdered the President of the Hells Angels Chapter to maintain or increase his position in the Mongols Motorcycle Club. In May 2012, he was sentenced to four life terms of imprisonment. Data Definition: ATF's data reflect the number of gang-relate d cases and arrests resulting from coordination with state and local law enforcement and supported by the Gang Targeting, Enforcement, and Coordination Center/Operational Section for Gangs. DEA's Defend ant Statistical System (DSS) is designated as the database of record for all arrest statistics and data. The Case Status System (CAST) is an automated on-line record-keeping system for entering, updating, and re trieving information on all DEA case files and general files. Every file opened since October 1, 1986 must have a CAST record. CAST also provides authorized users with file status statistics and case review scheduling. FBI data represent the number of gang investigations that were reported in the Integrat ed Statistical Reporting and Analysis Application. Data Collection and Storage: ATF's data source is their National Field Office Case Information System, an integrated and centralized data management solutio n allowing real time monitoring and oversight of all criminal enforcement activities in the field. Statistics associated with DEA's GangTECC activities are -16%2% -20%-15%-10%-5%0%5%10% FY12Percentage Increase in Gang Arrests Resulting from Coordination of Gang Investigations Actual Target Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-9gathered and tracked by SOD using DEA DSS and CAST systems. FBI data are collected and stored in the Integrated Statistical Reporting and Analysis Application. Data Validation and Verification: ATF data are verified through an inspection process which occurs on a four-year cycle and is performed at each ATF field offi ce and division. DEA data are reviewed by quarters. DEA systems of record are also dynamic and data are re gularly updated automatically. FBI data are validated and verified through its Integrated Statis tical Reporting and Analysis Application. Data Limitations: ATF investigations often span multiple year s from initiation through closure; case-related data are calculated based on the date investigations ar e closed, and therefore likely to include investigations that have spanned previous time periods. FBI data ar e collected manually. FBI field personnel are required to enter accomplishment data within 30 days of the accomp lishment or a change in the status, such as those resulting from appeals. Data are compiled less than 30 days after the end of the fiscal year, and thus may not fully represent the accomplishments during the reporting period. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-10 Background/Program Objectives : The mission of the FBI's Gangs/Criminal Enterprise Program is to address violent gang threats in the U.S. by aggressively identifying, prioritizing, and targeting the most violent street and prison gangs whose activities constitute criminal ente rprises. The FBI established the Safe Streets Violent Crime Initiative to attack gang and drug-related violence through the establishment of long-term, proactive, and coordinated teams of federal, state, and local la w enforcement officers and prosecutors. The teams are manifested in Violent Gang Safe Streets Task Forces (VGSSTFs), which are composed of approximately 839 FBI Special Agents, 1,411 state and local law enforc ement personnel, and 92 othe r federal law enforcement agents. Through VGSSTFs, the FBI pursues violent gangs through sustained, pro active, and coordinated investigations and prosecutes gang members for a number of violations that incl ude, but are not limited to, racketeering, drug conspiracy, and firearms violations. The Safe Streets Task Forces (SSTFs) concept expands cooperation and communication amongst federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, increasing productivity and avoiding duplication of investigative efforts. SSTFs combine short term, street-level enforcement activity with sophisticated investigativ e techniques like undercover ope rations and Title III wire taps to root out, prosecute, and disrupt and dismantle the entire gang, from the street-level enforcers and dealers to crew leaders and gang's command structure. The National Gang Intelligence Center ( NGIC) integrates intelligence from across federal, state, and local law enforcement communities on the growth, migration, crimin al activity, and association of violent gangs. NGIC supports law enforcement by sharing timely and accurate information and by providing strategic, tactical, and analytical intelligence products. Products are define d as intelligence products that have a nexus to gang matters. These intelligence products include Intelligen ce Bulletins, Intelligence As sessments, Intelligence Reports, Situational Awareness Bulletins , and Gang Information Reports. Performance Measure: NEW MEASURE: Number of Intelligence Products to Support Federal, State, and Local Law Enforcement FY 2012 Target: 46 FY 2012 Actual: 53 Discussion of FY 2012 Results: The FBI met and exceeded its target for this measure in FY 2012 for the number of intelligence products produced in support of federal, state, and lo cal investigations that are focused on gangs posing a significant threat to the U.S. NGIC projected it would produce and disseminate 46 intelligence products in FY 2012. However, NGIC surp assed this goal by producing 53 intelligence products. In order to accomplish the target set for this measure, NGIC conducted outreach to law enforcement organizations to promote the existence and use of NGIC Online. Through NGIC Online, investigators throughout the country can submit reque sts for intelligence and analytical support electronically and receive the resulting analytical products electronically. NGIC Onlin e also allows the requestor to check the status of the request online. As a result of the successful impl ementation of NGIC Online, law enforcement officers can obtain gang intelligence more quickly and effectivel y. NGIC Online thus represents, and promotes, the efficient use of law enforcement resources. FY 2016 Outcome Goal: Increase by 14 percent intelligence products produced in support of federal, state, and local investigations that are focused on gangs posing a significant threat to communities (baseline = 45) FY 2012 Progress: Department is on target to achieve this longterm outcome goal. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-11 Data Definitions: Intelligence products such as Intelligence Reports , Bulletins, Assessme nts, and Notes are produced and disseminated to Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. These intelligence products aid law enforcement agencies in their efforts to address violent gangs as they focus on criminal activity, trends, growth, and migration of gangs domestically and internationally. Data Collection and Storage: All disseminated intelligence products are uploaded into NGIC Online. Reports are generated through NGIC Online to track the type and number of products disseminated. Data Validation and Verification: The Violent Criminal Threat Secti on management has the ability to run reports to verify the number of reports produced and disseminated. Data Limitations: None known at this time. 53 46 050100 FY12Number of Intelligence Products to Support Federal, State, and Local Law Enforcement Actual TargetDepartment of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-12 Background/Program Objectives: The abuse, neglect, exploitation, and tr afficking, including sexual abuse, of children, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations , causes irrevocable harm to victims and society. Ensuring that our children, seniors, and all citizens can live without being disturbed by sexual trauma, exploitation, or human trafficking are more than criminal justice issues, they are societal and moral issues. Despite efforts to date, the threat of these crimes remain s very real. In the broadest terms, the goal of the Department is to prevent child se xual exploitation, elder abuse, hate crimes, and human trafficking from occurring in the first place, in order to protect every person from the physical and mental traumas associated with these crimes. Performance Measure: NEW MEASURE: Number of Matters/Investigations of Child Sexual Exploitation and Human Trafficking Resolved FY 2012 Target: 4,938 FY 2012 Actual: 4,348 Discussion of FY 2012 Results: The Department did not meet the target for FY 2012. However, the following are highlights of some of the accomplishments in FY 2012. In the U.S. Attorney Office Eastern District of Penns ylvania, Omelyan Botsvynyuk was sentenced to life plus 20 years for operating a human trafficking organizati on that smuggled young Ukrainian immigrants into the United States forcing them to work in a cleaning bus iness he ran with his brother Stepan, who was also convicted. Both defendants, along with three other brot hers (two awaiting extraditi on from Canada and one a fugitive), illegally smuggled Ukrainian workers into the country and promised them jobs with good pay. However, once here, the brothers controlled the work ers through physical force, threats of force, sexual assault, control of the workers' documents, debt bondage, and extortion of their fa milies in the Ukraine in order to keep them in involuntary servitude. On September 6, 2012, in the Western District of Louisiana, John Wyss, aka \"Bones,\" 55, of Monroe, Wisconsin, was senten ced to life in prison for his participation in an international criminal network known as Dreamboard, a private, members-only, online bulletin board that was created and operated to promote pedophilia, encourage th e sexual abuse of very young children, and promote the creation and dissemination of graphic images and vide os of child sexual abuse throughout the world. Wyss was convicted at trial of one count of engaging in a ch ild exploitation enterprise, one count of conspiracy to advertise child pornography, and one count of conspiracy to distribute child pornography. A total of 72 individuals, including Wyss, have been charged for thei r participation in Dreamboard. On June 27, 2012, in the District of Connecticut, Jesse Osmun, 32, of Milford, Connecticut, pleaded guilty to one count of traveling from the United States to South Africa and engaging in illicit sexual conduct with children. Osmun sexually abused four minor girls while he was a volunteer with the U.S. Peace Corps in South Africa. On October 10, 2012, Osmun was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, followed by 10 years of supervised release. The CRM announced in May 2012 that Michael Wayne W ooten, a former security officer in the Birmingham City School System and a substitute bus driver for Shel by County Schools, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for producing child pornography. Wooten was also ordere d to remain on supervised release for the rest of his life after completing his prison term. The court noted during the hearing that Wooten had numerous child victims. Also, in August 2012, eight more defendants were sentenced for their involvement in an international criminal network organized to sexually exploit childr en in connection with their participation in the Dreamboard Child Exploitation bulleti n board. Altogether, these eight defe ndants received a collective total of 169 years in prison. FY 2016 Outcome Goal: Increase by 8 percent the matters/investigations resolved concerning sexual exploitation of children and human trafficking to protect potential victims from abuse and violence (baseline = 4,817) FY 2012 Progress: Target was not met for FY 2012. However, the Department is on target to achieve this longterm outcome goal. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-13The CRT has spearheaded a number of initiatives aime d at aggressively combating human trafficking, including outreach to the public concerning potential tra fficking situations, training for and collaboration with law enforcement officers, and implementing programs to a ddress the needs of trafficking victims. CRT led the creation of a specialized Human Trafficking Prosecu tion Unit that is a global leader in trafficking prosecutions, and its representatives train foreign inves tigators and prosecutors at the United Nations and across the globe. CRT established a national, toll-free tele phone complaint line to enable victims and others to report possible trafficking and worker exploitation abuses. CRT has been instrumental in developing a national human trafficking training curriculum for stat e and local law enforcement and in drafting model legislation for states to implement their own anti-tra fficking laws. CRT filed the second-highest number of human trafficking cases in the history of the Divisi on, exceeded only by the number of cases charged in FY 2010. Data Definition: A matter or investigation is defined as \"open\" once it is assigned a number. The definition of resolved means the matter/investigation is closed. Matter/investigation can be closed for a variety of reasons, such as plea bargain, dismissal, declination, and trial. Open investigations pertaining to sexual exploitation of children encompass domestic sexual child abuse, child pornography, child abuse in Indian country, and child enticement cases. Human trafficking op en investigations pertain to adult and child human trafficking. Data Collection and Storage: Data are currently captured within each component's automated case management system and companion interface systems. Currently, matters and investigations worked on by more than one component are included in the totals from CRM, CRT, and the Executive Office of the U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA). Also, the court's disposition da te is used for reporting purposes for CRM and CRT; however, EOUSA uses the date entered into their cu rrent case management system. Additionally CRM and EOUSA count matters and investigations at the defendant level; CRT count civil and criminal matters/investigations. Data Validation and Verification: Each component implements their individual methodology for verifying data; however, in general, matter/investigation listings a nd reports are reviewed by attorney managers for data completeness and accuracy on a routine basis. Batch da ta analysis and ad hoc reviews are also conducted. Data Limitations: Data quality suffers from the lack of a single DOJ case management system and a standardized methodology for capturing matters/inves tigations related data. Due to reporting lags, matter/investigation closures for any gi ven year may be under or over-reported. 4,3484,938 05,00010,000 FY12Number of Matters/Investigations of Child Sexual Exploitation and Human Trafficking Resolved Actual Target Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-14 Background/Program Objectives: The Department focuses its drug law enforcement efforts on reducing the availability of drugs by disrupting and dismantling the la rgest drug trafficking organi zations and related money laundering networks operating interna tionally and domestically, including those on the Attorney General's CPOT List. The first CPOT List was issued in Se ptember 2002 and is reviewed and updated semi-annually. The List identifies the most significant international drug trafficking and money laundering organizations and those primarily responsible for the nation's illegal drug supply. The Atto rney General has designated the OCDETF Program as the centerpiece of DOJ's illegal drug supply reduction strategy. The Program coordinates multi-agency and multi-jurisdictional investig ations targeting the most serious drug trafficking threats. The OCDETF Program is responsible for coordinating the annual formulation of the CPOT list. The OCDETF Program functions through the efforts of the USAs; elements of CRM; the investigative, intelligence, and support staffs of DEA, FBI, ATF, and USMS; Immigration and Customs Enforcement; the U.S. Coast Guard; and the Internal Revenue Service. The OCDETF agencies also partner with numerous state and local law enforcement agencies. The goal of each OCDETF investigation is to determ ine connections among related investigations nationwide in order to identify and dismantle the entire structure of the drug trafficking organizations, from international supply and national transportation cells, to regional and local distribution networks. A major emphasis of the Department's drug strategy is to disrupt the trafficker s' financial dealings and to dismantle the financial infrastructure that supports these organizations. The OCDETF Program has the greatest impact upon the flow of drugs through this country when it successfully in capacitates the entire drug network by targeting and prosecuting its leadership and seizing the profits that fund continued operations. Performance Measure: CPOT-Linked Drug Trafficking Orga nizations Disrupted and Dismantled Revised Actual: Dismantled: (Previous Actual: 446 Discussion of FY 2012 Results: The Department achieved impressive r esults during FY 2012 in dismantling and disrupting CPOT-linked drug trafficking organi zations. The Department dismantled 171 CPOT-linked organizations in FY 2012, exceeding its target by 18%. The Department disrupted 446 CPOT-linked organizations in FY 2012, exceeding its target by 31%. This is an 8% increase over the 414 reported for FY 2011. During FY 2012, in addition to making important gain s against CPOT-linked organizations, the Department continued to achieve significant successes against the CP OTs themselves. Over the course of the last year, four CPOT targets were dismantled and seven CPOT targets were disrupted. Through these dismantlements and disruptions, the Department made significant impact s against the Sinaloa Cartel, the North Valley Cartel and other significant cartels operating out of Mexico a nd South America. All four of the dismantled CPOT FY 2016 Outcome Goal: Dismantle 725 Consolidated Priority Organization Target (CPOT)linked drug trafficking organizations (FY 20122016). Disrupt 1,700 CPOTlinked drug trafficking organizations (FY 20122016) FY 2012 Progress: Department is on target to achieve this longterm outcome goal. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-15targets were arrested and either deported or extradite d to the United States for prosecution; three disrupted targets have been extradited to the United States as well; and another disrupted target is pending extradition. These eleven disrupted and dismantled CPOTs had a si gnificant impact on the illegal drug supply in the United States. It is estimated that their activities included using the internet to sell various drugs and controlled substances to customers worldwide; the co mbined capability of importing and distributing over 150 metric tons of cocaine into the United States, Mexico, and Europe; shipping truckloads containing more than 2 tons of cocaine to New York alone; and using a mu ltitude of companies to distribute a variety of drugs and launder money. Approximately $2.1 million in drug pr oceeds bound for Mexico was seized from just one of these organizations and many front companies have been identified in several countries and on the internet. The reach of these transnational drug trafficking or ganizations extended across multiple continents. Law enforcement activity targeting these CPOTs involve d complex and coordinated intelligence driven investigations, with exceptional cooperation between U.S. law enforcement agencies and international partners. The Department's FY 2012 successes dismantling or disrupting 617 CPOT-linked drug trafficking organizations, an increase over the previous high of 6 12 dismantled or disrupted in FY 2011, as well as the significant enforcement actions against CPOTs themsel ves have resulted in keeping multi-ton quantities of illegal drugs such as cocaine, heroin, marijuana and me thamphetamine from ever entering the United States. Data Definition: An organization is considered linked to a CP OT if credible evidence exists of a nexus between the primary investigative target and a CPOT ta rget, verified associate, or component of the CPOT organization. Disrupted means impeding the normal and effective operation of the targeted organization, as indicated by changes in the organizational leadership and/or changes in methods of operation. Dismantled means destroying the organization's leadership, financia l base, and supply network such that the organization is incapable of reconstituting itself. Data Collection and Storage: For this measure, OCDETF reviews all of the cases worked by the FBI and the DEA. When there are cases that both agencies work, th ey are counted as one case in the consolidated numbers reported in the Department's Performance and Accountability Report . This procedure is in place to prevent double counting in Department-level reports. Investigations may be linked to a CPOT organization at any time during the investigation. Once the link is verified, a specific code or other identifier is assigned to the investigation. A ccordingly, data on this performance measure may lag behind actual identificati on of the link by the investigative agency. The investigation is tracked as \"CPOT-linked\" by the ag ency and within the and Dismantled Dismantled Disrupted Note: FY 2011 actual numbers have been updated and do not reflect the numbers in the FY 2011 Performance Accountability Report. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-16Data Validation and Verification: The CPOT List is updated semi-annually. Each OCDETF agency has an opportunity to nominate targets for addition to or deleti on from the List. Nominations are considered by the CPOT Working Group (made up of mid-level managers from the participating agencies). Based upon the Working Group's recommendations, the OCDETF Operati ons Chiefs decide which organizations will be added to or deleted from the CPOT List. Once a CPOT is added to the List, OCDETF investigations can be linked to that organization. The links are reviewed and confirmed by OCDETF fi eld managers using the OCDETF Fusion Center, agency databases, and intelligence information. Field recommendations are reviewed by the OCDETF Executive Office. In instances where a link is not fully substantiated, the spons oring agency is given the opportunity to follow-up. Ultimately, the OCDETF Executive Office \"un-links\" any i nvestigation for which sufficient justification has not been provided. When evaluating disruptions/d ismantlements of CPOT-linked organizations, OCDETF verifies reported information with the investigating agency's headquarters. Data Limitations: Investigations of CPOT-level organizations are complex and time-consuming, and the impact of disrupting/dismantling such a network may not be apparent immediately. In fact, data may lag behind enforcement activity. For example, a CPOT-li nked organization may be disrupted in one FY and subsequently dismantled in a later year when law enfo rcement permanently destroys the organization's ability to operate. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-17 Background/Program Objectives: Representing the rights and interests of the American people is a top priority for the Department of Justice. Among the DOJ components sharing responsibilities to achieve this goal are the Executive Office of the U.S. Attorneys, the Antitrust, Civil, Civil Rights, Criminal, Environment and Natural Resources, and Tax Divisions. There are 94 U.S. Attorney Offices located throughout the United States and its territories. Each U.S. Attorney serves as the chief federal law enforcement officer within his or her judicial district and, as such, is responsible for the prosecution of criminal cases brought by the federal government; the litigation and defense of civil cases in which the United States is a party; th e handling of criminal and civil appellate cases before United States Courts of Appeal; and the collection of ci vil and criminal debts and restitutions owed the federal government which are administratively uncollectable. Additionally, the Department has litig ators that specialize in the areas of: preserving a competitive market structure; defending the public fisc against unwarranted claims; protecting civil rights; enforcing federal civil and criminal statutes; safeguarding the environment; and administrating internal revenue laws. The Antitrust Division (ATR) promotes and protects the competitive process - and the American economy - through the enforcement of antitrust laws. These laws a pply to virtually all industr ies and to every level of business, including manufacturing, transpor tation, distribution, and marketing. The Civil Division (CIV) defends challenges to Congr essional statutes, Presidential actions, national security issues, health care programs, vaccine injury claims, and energy policies; pursues violators of immigration and consumer protection laws; and handles thousands of affirmative and defens ive cases with billions of dollars at issue related to accident and liability claims, natura l disasters and other unprecedented events. CIV also handles commercial issues such as bankruptcy, contract di sputes, banking, insurance, patents, fraud, and debt collection and administers the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program and the newly re-opened September 11 th Victim Compensation Fund. The Civil Rights Division (CRT) enforces federal stat utes prohibiting discrimination in education, religion, employment, credit, housing fair le nding, public accommodations and faciliti es, conditions of confinement in state and locally operated institutions, national origin, voting, retaliation b ased on military service, and certain federally funded and conducted programs. Additionally , CRT enforces criminal civil rights responsibilities for human trafficking and involuntary servitude statutes, acts of racial, ethnic, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or religious violence, \"color of law\" offenses by local and federal law enforcement officials, and conspiracies to interfere with federally protected rights. CRT also enforces the criminal and civil provisions to protect the rights of people to use the services of reproductive health clinics free from interference. The Criminal Division (CRM) develops, enforces, and supe rvises the application of all federal criminal laws (except those specifically assigned to other divisions). The mission of the CRM is to identify and respond to critical and emerging national and intern ational criminal threats, and to lead the enforcement, regulatory, and intelligence communities in a coordinated, nationwide res ponse to reduce those threats. The Division engages in several functions vital to achieving its mission: in vestigating and prosecuting significant criminal cases and matters; providing expert legal advice and training; providing critical law enforcement tools (e.g., Title III wiretaps); and forging global law enforcement partnerships. The Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) brings cases against those who violate the nation's civil and criminal pollution-control and wildlife protec tion laws. Additionally, EN RD defends environmental FY 2016 Outcome Goal: Favorably resolve 90% of Criminal Cases (litigating divisions) FY 2016 Outcome Goal: Favorably resolve 80% of Civil Cases (litigating divisions) FY 2012 Progress: Department is on target to achieve this longterm outcome goal. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-18challenges to government programs and activities and represents the U.S. in matters concerning the stewardship of the nation's natural resources and public lands. In addition, EN RD litigates cases concerning Indian rights and claims. The Tax Division's (TAX) mission is to enforce the nati on's tax laws fully, fairly, and consistently, through both criminal and civil litigation, in order to promote voluntary compliance with the tax laws, maintain public confidence in the integrity of the tax system, and promote the sound development of the law. Performance Measure: Percent of Cases Favorably Resolved FY 2012 Target: Criminal Cases: 90% 81% Discussion of FY 2012 Results: The Department exceeded its target for this performance measure. The following are highlights of the accomplishments ach ieved by relevant components in FY 2012. The U.S. Attorneys continued its efforts combating fra ud with its Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force and 94 regional mortgage fraud task forces and working gr oups, together with target ed financial fraud training provided at the National Advocacy Center including semi nars in the areas of mortgage fraud, bank fraud, health care fraud, and securities fraud. Some highlights of these efforts include the following: On February 1, 2012, David Higgs, Managing Director at Credit Suisse Group, and Salmaan Siddiqui, Vice President in the Investment Banking Division, plead guilty in the Southern District of New York to failing to mark to market the fair value of Residential Mortgage backed Secur ities and Commercial Mortgage backed Securities assets, which contributed to a $2.65 billio n write down in Credit Suisse's repor ted net income, approximately $540 million of which was attributable to defendants' conduct. On June 4, 201 2, in the District of New Jersey, Matthew Kluger, a lawyer who fed inside information to a professional stock trader in a 17-year scheme that netted millions, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. This is the longest sentence ever handed down in an insider trading case. Stock trader Garrett D. Bauer was sen tenced to 108 months in prison for his role in the scheme. On July 2, 2012, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) agreed to plead guilty and to pay $3 billion to resolve its criminal and civil liability arising from the company' s unlawful promotion of certain prescription drugs. The resolution is the largest health care fraud settlement in U.S. history and the largest payment ever by a drug company. GSK agreed to plead guilty to a three-count criminal information, including two counts of introducing misbranded drugs, Paxil an d Wellbutrin, into interstate co mmerce and one count of failing to report safety data about the drug Avandia to the Food and Drug Administration. Under the terms of the plea agreement, GSK will pay a total of $1 billion, includi ng a criminal fine of $956, 814,400 and forfeiture in the amount of $43,185,600. GSK will also pay $2 billion to resolve its civil liabilities with the federal government under the False Claims Act, as well as the states. In May 2012, Global Health Care Company Abbott Laboratories Inc. plead guilty and agreed to pay $1.5 b illion to resolve its criminal and civil liability arising from the company's unlawful promotion of the prescription drug Depakote for uses not approved as safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration. The resolution - the second largest payment by a drug company - includes a criminal fine and forfeiture tota ling $700 million and civil settlements with the federal government and the states totaling $800 million. Abbott al so will be subject to cour t-supervised probation and reporting obligations for Abbott's Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors. The ATR obtained $1.1 billion in criminal fines in FY 2012 against antitrust violators. The Division's investigations into the liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and auto parts industries yielded significant restitution and fines which helped fund the Department's Crime Vi ctims Fund. In addition, the Division continued its work with the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force and its efforts to wage an aggressive, coordinated and proactive effort to investigate and prosecute financial cr imes. On the civil side, the Division was successful in Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-19protecting competition and U.S. consumers by challe nging proposed mergers and agreements in areas as diverse as telecommunications, health care and tax preparation software. In FY 2012, CIV defeated billions of dollars in unmer itorious claims, in addition to the successful defense of suits filed against the government as a result of fe deral policies, laws, and involvement in commercial activities, domestic and foreign opera tions, entitlement programs, law enfo rcement initiatives, military actions, and counterterrorism efforts. CIV also pursued affirm ative litigation, bringing su its on behalf of the United States, which resulted in the return of billions of dollars to the Treasury, Medicare, and other entitlement programs. This year alone, the Division, working with the U.S. Attorneys, recovered a record-high amount of over $4.8 billion as a result of its aggressive efforts in fighting health care, mortgage, and procurement fraud. The CRT reached the Nation's largest-ever fair lending settlement on behalf of minorities who were steered discriminatorily towards subprime loans, and negotia ted $25 billion in settlements with the Nation's five largest mortgage servicers as part of the enforcement of mortgage protections for U.S. service members. CRT achieved both a record monetary recovery by the Un ited States in a disability-based housing discrimination case, and a record monetary recovery for sexual harassmen t in a suit brought under the Fair Housing Act. As part of its work to protect vulnerable populations, CR T has convicted the most persons on hate crimes in over a decade, and charged the most defendants on human traffi cking offenses in the history of the Division. CRT has also filed record numbers of criminal police misc onduct cases. In New Orleans, CRT conducted one of the most extensive reviews ever of a law enforcement ag ency, and is now working to develop a comprehensive blueprint for sustainable reform of the police department . A similarly extensive review has been completed in Puerto Rico. CRT is committed to investigating voting irregularities and monitoring voter registration requirements to ensure that the vote of every American is counted, including military personnel, their families, and civilian personnel working overseas. CRT's determined enforcement of the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v L.C. , led to landmark settlements with Virginia, Dela ware, and Georgia, that will allow thousands of disabled citizens to receive community-based services. The CRM prosecuted and achieved favorable dispositi ons in FY 2012 in cases covering a wide range of complex case law. For example, in a shared case with th e U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas, the Division successfully prosecuted Robert Alle n Stanford for a twenty year, $7.2 billion Ponzi scheme centering around an offshore bank, which Stanfo rd owned and operated in Antigua and Barbuda. Stanford was convicted and received a 110-year sentence. The Division was also instrumental in prosecuting the New England La Cosa Nostra (LCN) leadership in Providence, RI, which resulte d in ten defendants being charged with racketeering conspiracy and extortion of fenses. A total of ten defendants pleaded guilty, including two successive LCN bosses. Lastly, the Barcla ys Bank PLC, a financial institution headquartered in London, has entered into an agreement with the Divisi on to pay a $160 million penalty to resolve violations arising from Barclays's submissions for the London Inte rBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), which are benchmark interest rates used in financial markets around the world. The ENRD continued to enforce the Clean Air Act. ENRD and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reached an innovative agreement in April 2012 with Ohio-based Marathon Petroleum Company that already has significantly reduced air pollution from all six of th e company's petroleum refineries. In a first for the refining industry, Marathon has agreed to install st ate-of-the-art controls on waste combustion devices known as flares and to cap the volume of waste gas sent to flares. The settlement is part of EPA's national effort to reduce air pollution from refinery, petrochemical, and chemical flares. When fully implemented, the agreement is expected to reduce harmful air pollution by approximately 5,400 tons per year and result in future cost savings for the company. The agreement, acco mpanied by a $460,000 civil penalty, resolves Marathon's alleged violations of the Clean Air Act. Marathon also will spend an as yet undetermined sum to comply with the flaring caps required in the consent decree. Under the agreement, Marathon will also implement a project at its Detroit, Michigan refinery to remove another 15 tons per year of VOCs and another one ton per year of benzene from the air. At an estimated cost of $2.2 million, Marathon will install c ontrols on numerous sludge handling tanks and equipment. Marathon's six refineries, which are located in Robinson, Illinois; Catlettsburg, Kentucky; Garyville, Louisiana; Detroit, Michigan; Cant on, Ohio; and Texas City, Texas, have a capacity of more than 1.15 million barrels per day. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-20 One of the Tax Division's top litigation priorities continu es to be the concerted civil and criminal effort to combat the serious problem of non-compliance with our tax laws by US taxpayers using secret offshore accounts - a problem that a 2008 Senate report concl uded costs the US Treasury at least $100 billion annually. As part of the deferred prosecution agr eement the Tax Division negotiated in 2009 with UBS Switzerland's largest bank, as well as a 2009 agreem ent negotiated among the US, UBS, and the Swiss government to settle a civil summons enforcement proceed ing brought by the Tax Division, the IRS continues to receive account information about thousands of the most significant tax cheats among the US taxpayers who maintain secret Swiss bank accounts. The prosecution r esults so far have been encouraging: To date, approximately 150 grand jury investigations of offs hore-banking clients have been initiated, of which 47 cases have been charged, with 38 guilty pleas having been ente red, 3 convicted after trial (two of whom have been sentenced, with each receiving a 10-year prison sentence), and 6 awaiting trial. A number of facilitators who helped clients hide assets offshore have been indicted , resulting in 19 bankers, 8 advisors, and 2 attorneys being charged and awaiting trial; one advisor and one ba nker have been convicted and sentenced. One Swiss bank, Wegelin and Co., has been indicted. The other banks implicated include not only UBS, but another international Swiss bank, regional Sw iss banks, an Israeli bank and HSBC I ndia. In addition, grand jury investigations have been opened into additional offsho re banks across the world, and the Division obtained a court decision allowing the IRS to summon additiona l account information from HSBC Bank. The Division also ensures that the public is aware of the offs hore initiative. Indeed, the IRS credits the publicity surrounding this initiative with prompting a huge increase in the number of taxpayers who have \"come in from the cold\" and voluntarily disclosed to the IRS their previously hidden foreign accounts. Nearly 18,000 US taxpayers made voluntary disclosures in the 18-month peri od concluding February, 2011 - in contrast to fewer than 100 in a typical year - and made $2.2 billion in payments to the IRS. Another 12,000 US taxpayers disclosed their accounts under the 2011 Offshore Volunt ary Disclosure Initiative (which ended September 9, 2011) and have made $500 million in payments to the IRS so far. Data Definition: Cases favorably resolved include those cases that resulted in court judgments favorable to the government, as well as settlements. For antitrust-relate d merger cases, favorably resolved data includes: abandoned mergers, mergers \"fixed,\" or mergers with c onsent decrees. Non-merger cases favorably resolved include instances where practices changed after the inves tigation and complaints filed with consent decrees. The data set includes non-appellate cas es closed during the fiscal year. 0%25%50%75%100%Percent of Cases Favorably Resolved Criminal and Accountability Report II-21Data Collection and Storage: Data are currently captured within each component's automated case management system and companion interface system s. Currently, cases worked on by more than one component are included in the totals from CRM, CRT, ENRD, and the EOUSA. Also, the court's disposition date is used for reporting purposes for ATR, CIV, CRM, CRT, and ENRD; however, EOUSA and TAX use the date entered into their current case management syst em. Additionally, CIV counts at the party level; CRM, ENRD, and EOUSA count cases at the defendant level; CRT and TAX count Civil and Criminal cases. Lastly, ATR includes Criminal, Civil Merger, and Civil Non-Merg er; ENRD includes affirmative, defensive, criminal, and condemnation cases in their totals. Data Validation and Verification: Each component implements their individual methodology for verifying data; however, in general, case listings and reports are re viewed by attorney managers for data completeness and accuracy on a routine basis. Batch data an alysis and ad hoc reviews are also conducted. Data Limitations: Data quality suffers from the lack of a single DOJ case management system and a standardized methodology for capturing case related data. Due to the inherent variances in data collection and management, cases may refer to cases or individuals. In addition, due to reporting lags, case closures for any given year may be under or over-reported. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-22 STRATEGIC GOAL 3: Ensure and Support the Fair, Impartial, Efficient, and Transparent Admini stration of Justice at the Federal, State, Local, Tribal, and International Levels 36% of the Department's Net Costs supports this Goal. An integral role of the Department of Jus tice is to help in the administration of our federal justice system. To ensure the goal of the fair and efficient operation of our federal system, the Department must provide for a proper federal court proceeding by protecting judges, witnesses, and other participants; ensure the appearance of criminal defendant s for judicial proceedings or confinement; and ensure the apprehension of fugitives from justice. The De partment also provides safe, secure, and humane confinement of defendants awaiting tria l or sentencing and those convicted and sentenced to prison. In order to improve our society and reduce the burden on our justice system, the Department provides services and programs to facilitate inmates' successful reintegration in to society, consistent with community expectations and standards. The Department strives to adjudicate all immigration cases promptly and impartially in accordance with due process. Additionally, the Depa rtment works to promote and strengthen innovative strategies in the administration of state and local just ice systems and uphold the rights and improve services to victims of crime. Background/Program Objectives: The BOP constantly monitors and reports weekly on facility capacity, population growth, and prisoner crowding. As federal inmate population le vels are projected to increase and continue to exceed the rated capacity of the BOP, every possible action is being taken to protect the community, while keeping institutional crowding at mana geable proportions to ensure that federal inmates continue to serve their sentences in a safe and humane environment. Performance Measure: Percent of System-wide Crowding in Federal Prisons FY 2012 Results: During FY 2012, the overall BOP population increased by 919. Although the BOP did not achieve its target for FY 2012, the institution population decreased by 378 and capacity from activating facilities Federal Correctional Institution (FC I) Mendota, CA and FCI Berlin, NH) increased by 564 beds to achieve a 1 percent reduction in system -wide crowding from FY 2011. Reducing overcrowding remains a high priority for both BOP and DOJ. The BOP will continue the activation process at FCI Ber lin, NH, and the Secure Female FCI Aliceville, AL, in FY 2013, in addition to of FCI Hazelton, WV, a nd USP Yazoo City, MS. Dependent on funding, this additional capacity should help alle viate crowding in FY 2013. In addition, the BOP purchased the Thomson Correctional Center at the end of FY 2012. This facility will add needed high-security beds to help alleviate the ove rcrowding in federal prisons. Revised FY 2016 Outcome Goal: Reduce systemwide crowding in federal prisons to 30% by 2016 FY 2012 Progress: Department will have difficulty in meeting this longterm outcome goal. III Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-23 Data Definitions: The crowding levels are based on a mathematical ratio of the number of inmates divided by the rated capacity of the institutions at each of the speci fic security levels. The percent of crowding represents the rate of crowding that is over rated capacity. For example, if an institution had a number of inmates that equaled the rated capacity, this would represent 100 per cent occupancy, which equals 0 percent crowding. Any occupancy above 100 percent represents a percentage of crowding. System-wide : represents all inmates in BOP facilities and all rated capacity, including secu re and non-secure facilities, low, medium, and high security levels, as well as administrative maximum, de tention, medical, holdover, and other special housing unit categories. Minimum security facilities : non-secure facilities that generally house non-violent, low risk offenders with shorter sentences. These facilities have li mited or no perimeter security fences or armed posts. Low security facilities : double-fenced perimeters, mostly dorm itory housing, and strong work/program components. Medium security facilities : strengthened perimeters, mostly cell-type housing, work and treatment programs and a lower inmate-to-staff ratio than low security facilities. High security facilities : also known as U.S. Penitentiaries, highly secure perimeters, multiple and single cell housing, lowest inmate-to-staff ratio, close control of inmate movement. Data Collection and Storage: Data are gathered from several computer systems. Inmate data are collected on the BOP on-line system (SENTRY). The BOP also u tilizes a population forecast model to plan for future contracting and construction require ments to meet capacity needs. Data Validation and Verification: Subject matter experts review and analyze population and capacity levels daily, both overall and by security level. BOP institu tions print a SENTRY report, which provides the count of inmates within every institutio n cell house. The report further s ubdivides the cell houses into counting groups, based on the layout of the institution. Using this report, institution staff conduct an official inmate count five times per day to confirm the inmate count within SENTRY. The BOP Capacity Planning Committee (CPC), comprised of top BOP officials, meet s bi-monthly to review, veri fy, and update population projections and capacity needs for the BOP. Offender data are collected regularly from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts by the BOP Office of Research and Evaluation in order to project population trends. The CPC reconciles bed space needs and crowding trends to ensure that all available prison space is fully utilized, both in federal prisons and in contract care. Data Limitations: None known at Prisons Actual TargetDepartment of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-24 Background/Program Objectives : In response to the rapid growth of federal inmates with a diagnosis of a drug use disorder (40 percent of inmates entering th e BOP), the BOP continues to develop evidence based treatment practices to manage and tr eat drug-using offenders. Mo re than half of the BOP's facilities operate an RDAP. The RDAP are located in separate units, away from the general population. The RDAP is based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), wrapped into a m odified therapeutic community model of treatment. The CBT and therapeutic communities are proven-eff ective treatment models with inmate populations. Inmates who participate in RDAP continue with drug a buse treatment when transferred to a Residential Reentry Center in the community while still in BOP custody. Th e BOP contracts with community-based treatment providers, often the same treatment providers who will continue the o ffender's course of treatment wh en released to community supervision. This ensures a continui ty of treatment and supervision. Performance Measure : NEW MEASURE: Number of inmate participants in RDAP Discussion of FY 2012 Results: The BOP approved 120 additional RDAP positions to allow an additional 1,616 inmates to participate in the program. BOP opene d an RDAP in a United States Penitentiary for the first time in 15 years. A Spanish Language RDAP was approved this year with activation to occur in FY 2013. The target of 18,500 was generated using a calculation of all inmate movement into and out of the RDAP. Through closer review, BOP determin ed this methodology resulted in the potential for the same inmate to be counted twice within the same fiscal year. ABOP has now developed a more refined methodology to calculate RDAP participation, with significantly less potential fo r duplication. This more precise methodology will be utilized going forward. Thus, while this change has re sulted in the number of participants during the fiscal year being less than the target number, it is a pref erred method to report inmate participation in RDAP. Revised FY 2016 Outcome Goal: Increase the number of inmate participants in the Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP) by 6 percent (from 18,500 to 19,920) FY 2012 Progress: Department will not meet the current longterm outcome goal target. New methodology has been developed in calculating inmate participants which will alter the longterm outcome goal target. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-25 Data Definitions: RDAP - data reported are the actual number of BOP inmates who participated in the RDAP within the fiscal year. Data Collection and Storage: Data are collected/entered into th e BOP's SENTRY data system and the Psychology Data System (PDS). Data are collect ed/entered primarily by Case Managers, Drug Abuse Treatment Specialists and Drug Abuse Treatment Coordi nators in the institutions. SENTRY data tracks the inmate's \"basic\" status in RDAP as WAIT, PARTICIPANT, COMPLETE, WITHDRAW, EXPELLED, or INCOMPLETE. PDS tracks the inmate's clinical progress, including: treatment plans; 60 day treatment reviews; group contacts; individual contacts; and treatment summaries. Both SENTRY and PDS are stored electronically. Signed documents are inserted in inmate's Central File. Data Validation and Verification: Validation is conducted by the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator through regular treatment meetings, supervisio n and inmate file and data review s. Data Verification is conducted through PDS and SENTRY data which are monitored by Central Office and the Regional Offices no less than monthly. Examples of reviews conducted include, but are not limited to: programs are operating as intended; participant status and progress are documented appropria tely; PDS documentation meets the clinical standard as outlined by policy and training; inmates are interviewe d for RDAP appropriately; and to ensure all inmates qualified for the RDAP are receiving the RDAP before their release from BOP custody. Data Limitations: None known at this time. 14,48218,500 015,00030,000 FY12Number of Inmate Pa rticipants in RDAP Actual TargetDepartment of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-26 Background/Program Objectives: The USMS has a long and distinguished history of providing assistance and expertise to other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in support of violent crime reduction through fugitive investigati ons. These partnerships have evolved into the ultimate force multiplier in federal law enforcement, and allow our task forces to focus on the most egregious state and local fugitives and ensure the greatest protection to the public by maximizing the effectiveness of resources. The USMS uses a combination of Regional Fugitive Task Forces (RFTFs) and District Fugitive Task Forces (DFTFs) to form a national network responsible for the apprehension of violent fugitive felons. The Presidential Threat Protection Act of 2000 initially established the USMS RFTF m odel. It consists of federal, state, and local law enforcement authorities in designated regions of the Unite d States, which are directed and coordinated by the USMS, for the purpose of locating and apprehending fugitives. In addition to domestic activities, the USMS is the lead agency responsible for extraditing (or deporting) U.S. fugitives that have fled to foreign countries back into this country. The USMS also apprehends fore ign fugitives within the U.S. who are wanted abroad. As part of the fugitive apprehension mission, the USMS has been designated by th e Attorney General as the lead agency for locating and appreh ending non-compliant sex offenders and others who violate the provisions of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. A non-compliant sex offender is any person who fails to comply with federal registration requirements. Performance Measure: Number of Primary Federal Felony Fugitives Apprehended or Cleared FY 2012 Target: 34,421 FY FY 2012, the USMS apprehended or cleared 36,229 primary Federal felony fugitives, exceeding th e target of 34,421. This resulted in 50 percent of total primary Federal felony fugitives apprehended or cleared whic h is half of the 72,001 warrants on hand or received during FY 2012. Among those arrested, 3,934 (including state/local) were for crimes of homicide, 4,917 (including state/local) were gang members, and 12,976 (including state/local) were sex offenders. In addition, in FY 2012, the USMS had 924 fugitives extradited or deported to the United States from other countries. The 7 operating RFTF, in addition to the 60 district task forces, are directi ng their investigative efforts toward reducing the number of violent crimes. These crimes in clude terrorist activities, organized crime, drugs, and gang violence. The RFTF and DFTF combined led to the arr est of 86,016 state and local fugitive felons in FY 2012. The USMS initiated 3,208 Federa l investigations into the failure of sex offenders to meet their registration requirements. Revised FY 2016 Outcome Goal: Apprehend or clear 33,660 primary fugitives FY 2012 Progress: Department is on target to achieve this longterm outcome goal. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report II-27 Data Definition: A \"primary\" federal felony fugitive mean s that the USMS has the lead apprehension responsibility. The USMS has primary jurisdiction to investigate fugitive matters involving escaped federal prisoners; probation, parole, and bo nd default violators; warrants gene rated by DEA and referred to the USMS; any other federal warrant referred by another fe deral agency without arrest powers; and any warrant referred by state and local agencies. A fugitive is consid ered apprehended or cleared if the fugitive is arrested, has a detainer issued, or the warrant is dismissed. The percent cleared is calculated by dividing the number of cleared fugitives by the sum of received fugitives (fugitiv es who had a warrant issued during the fiscal year) and on-hand fugitives (fugitives who had an active wa rrant at the beginning of the fiscal year). Data Collection and Storage: The USMS maintains the Justice De tainee Information System (JDIS) to collect warrant information, investigative leads, and ot her criminal information. Upon receipt of a warrant from a federal judge, Deputy U.S. Marshals query the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and the International Justice and Public Safety Informati on Network (NLETS) through JDIS to look for previous criminal information. Data Validation and Verification: Warrant and fugitive data are verified according to NCIC policy and procedures. The USMS coordinates with district offices to verify that warrants are validated against the signed court records. The USMS is able to enhance fugitive i nvestigative efforts by shari ng data with other agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, DEA, De partment of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Department of State, and a variety of state and local task forces around the country. Data Limitations: JDIS data are accessible to all USMS distri ct offices and are updated as new information is collected, thus there may be a lag in the reporting of data.

Department of Justice FY 2011 Performance and Accountability Report III-3A Message From The Chief Financial Officer November 9, 2012 I am very pleased to report that the Department has earned an unqualified audit opinion on its fiscal year 2012 consolidated financial statements. I am also pleased that for the sixth straight year the auditor's report on internal controls over financial reporting did not identify any material weaknesses at the consolidated Department level. Moreover, for the first time, no material weaknesses were reported in any of the individual component level audits. The continued progress made by our financial management offices is demonstrable evidence of the Department's commitment to pursuing continual improvement in sound financial management practices. The Department is fully cognizant of the economic difficulties faced by our country. We have been devoted to looking for ways to operate more efficiently in order to ensure taxpayer funds are spent wisely on the critical national security and law enforcement activities the Department performs for the nation. The Department's leadership has challenged our components to find savings across our operations, and components ha ve responded with savings in many areas, including travel management and the consolidation of large information technology contracts. The Department's SAVE Council will continue during fiscal year 2013 to look for additional areas we can reduce spending in order to operate as efficiently as possible. When we find areas where we can improve our practices and save money, we will act on those opportunities. Also on the horizon is the continued successful implementation of the Department's Unified Financial Management System (UFMS). As fi scal year 2013 started, implementations of UFMS began at the United States Marshals Service and four program offices in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The use of UFMS was also expanded at the Department's Assets Forfeiture Management program. Building upon successful implementations at DEA and ATF, these new implementations, while broad in scope and complexity, bring great potential for improving our financial management capabilities for the future. We take our financial accountability seriously, and we take our commitment to sound agency performance and providing taxpayer value seriously. We look forward in 2013 to furthering our fiscal achievements as the Department continues to serve the nation and its citizens.

Department of Justice FY 201 2 Performance and Accountability Report III-5 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FISCAL YEAR 20 12 OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL COMMENTARY AND SUMMARY This audit report contains the Annual Financial Statements of the U.S. Department of Justice (Department) for the fiscal years (FY) ended September 30, 2012, and September 30, 2011. Under the direction of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), KPMG LLP performed the Department's audit in accordance with audi ting standards generally accepted in the United States of America. The audit resulted in an unqualified opinion on the FY 2012 financial statements. An unqualified opinion means that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and the results of the entity's operations in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. For FY 2011, the Department also received an unqualified opinion on its financial statements (OIG Report No. 12- 03). KPMG LLP a lso issued Reports on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters. For FY 2012, the auditors did not identify any significant deficiencies in the Independent Auditors' Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Although progress continues to be made, it is important to note that the Department still does not have a unified financial management system to readily support ongoing accounting operation and preparation of financial statements. As discussed in past years, we believe the most important challenge facing the Department in its financial management is to successfully implement an integrated financial management system to replace the disparate and, in some cases, antiquated financial systems used by Department components. No instances of non- compliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards were identified during the audit in the FY 2012 Independent Auditors' Report on Compliance and Other Matters. Additionally, KPMG LLP's tests disclosed no instances in which the Department's financial management systems did not substantially comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996. The OIG reviewed KPMG LLP's reports and related documentation and ma de necessary inquiries of its representatives. Our review, as differentiated from an audit in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, was not intended to enable us to express, and we do not express, an opinion on the Department's financial statements, conclusions about the effectiveness of internal control, conclusions on whether the Department's financial management systems substantially complied with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996, or conclusions on compliance with laws and regulations and other matters. KPMG LLP is responsible for the attached auditors' reports dated November 9, 2012, and the conclusions expressed in the reports. However, our review disclosed no instances where KPMG LLP did not comply, in all material r espects, with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.

Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report III-7 Independent Auditors' Report on Financial Statements Inspector General U.S. Department of Justice United States Attorney General U.S. Department of Justice We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the U.S. Department of Justice (Department ) as of September 30, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of net cost, and changes in net position, and the combined statements of budgetary resources, and custodial activity (hereinafter referred to as \"consolidated financial statements\" or \"basic financial statements\") for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Department's manag ement. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of the following components of the Department: the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS); the Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI); and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which statements reflect total assets of $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion, and total net cos ts of $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion, as of and for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Those financial statements were audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for those components, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin No. 07-04, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, as amended . Those standards and OMB Bulletin No. 07-04 require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Department 's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit a lso includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the reports of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of the other auditors, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the U.S. Department of Justice as of September 30, 2012 and 2011 , and its net costs, changes in net position, budgetary resources, and custodial activity for the years then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Independent Auditors' Report on Financial Statements Page 2 of 3 Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report III-8 As discussed in Note 1. Z to the consolidated financial statements, the Department changed its presentation for reporting the combined statement of b udgetary resources in fiscal year 2012, based on new reporting requirements under OMB Circular No. A -136, Financial Reporting Requirements . As a result, the U.S. Department of Justice's combined statement of b udgetary resources for fiscal year 2011 has been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the information in Required Supplementary Information, including Management's Discussion and Analysis, and Required Supplementary Stewardship Information be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We and the other auditors have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit s of the basic financial statements. We and the other auditors do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements as a whole. The September 30, 2012 and 2011 consolidating and combining information in the Consolidat ing and Combining Financial Statements section is presented for purposes of additional analysis of the consolidated financial statements rather than to present the financial position, net costs, changes in net position, budgetary resources, and custodial activity of the Department's components individually, and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The September 30, 2012 and 2011 consolidating and combining information in the Consolidating and Combining Financial Statements has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied by us and the other audit ors, in the audits of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial state ments themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of the other auditors, the September 30, 2012 and 2011 consolida ting and combining information in the Consolidating and Combining Financial Statements section is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole. The information in the Introduction, FY 2012 Performance Report, Other Accompanying Information, Management Section, and Appendices is presented for the purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied by us and the other auditors in the audits of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it . In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also issued our reports dated November 9, 2012 , on our consideration of the Department 's internal control over financial reporting and our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and o ther matters. Independent Auditors' Report on Financial Statements Page 3 of 3 Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report III-9 The purpose of those reports is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. Those reports are an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be read in conjunction with this report in assessing the results of our audits.

We did not audit the financial statements of the following components of the Department: the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS); the Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI); and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as of and for the years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 . Those financial statements were audited b y other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our report, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for those components, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors. Also, as discussed in Note 1.Z to the consolidated financial statements, the Department changed its presentation for reporting the combined statement of budgetary resources in fiscal year 2012, based on new reporting requirements under OMB Circular No. A -136, Financial Reporting Requirements . We conducted our audit s in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin No. 07-04, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, as amended . Those standards and OMB Bulletin No. 07-04 require that we plan and pe rform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. As stated above, we did not audit the fiscal year 2012 financial statements of the USMS, FPI, and ATF. Those financial statements were audited by other auditors whose reports thereon, including the other auditors' Independent Auditors' Report s on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, have been furnished to us. Accordingly, our report on the Department's internal control over financial reporting, insofar as it relates to those components, is based solely on the reports and findings of the other auditors. The management of the Department is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting . In planning and performing our fiscal year 2012 audit, we considered the Department 's internal control over financial reporting by obtaining an understanding of the Department's internal control, determining whether internal controls had been placed in operation, assessing control risk, and performing tests of controls as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an KPMG LLP Suite 1 2000 1801 K Street, NW Washington, DC 20006 KPMG LLP is a Delaware limited liability partnership, the U.S. member firm of KPMG International Cooperative (\"KPMG International\"), a Swiss entity. Independent Auditors' Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Page 2 of 2 Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report III-12 opinion on the effectiveness of the Department 's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Department 's internal control over financial reporting. We and the other auditors did not te st all internal controls relevant to operating objectives as broadly defined by the Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act of 1982. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a t imely basis. Our consideration of internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the fourth paragraph of this report and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that mig ht be deficiencies, significant deficiencies, or material weaknesses. In our fiscal year 2012 audit, we and the other auditor s did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that we and the other auditor s consider to be mat erial weaknesses, as defined above. This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Department 's management, the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General, OMB, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, and the U.S. Congress and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-22 Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies A. Reporting Entity The Department of Justice (Department) has a wide range of responsibilities which include: detecting, apprehending, prosecuting, and incarcerating criminal offenders; operating federal prison factories; upholding the civil rights of all Americans; enforcing laws to protect the environment; ens uring healthy competition of business in the United States' free enterprise system; safeguarding the consumer from fraudulent activity; carrying out the immigration laws of the United States; and representing the American people in all legal matters involv ing the U .S. Government. Under the direction of the Attorney General, these responsibilities are discharged by the components of the Department. For purposes of these consolidated/combined financial statements, the following components comprise the Dep artment =s reporting entity: Assets Forfeiture Fund and Seized Asset Deposit Fund (AFF/SADF) Offices, Boards and Divisions (OBDs) U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) Office of Justice Programs (OJP) Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) (Public Law 111 -5) was signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009. As one of its many elements, the Recovery Act provides the Department with funding for grants to assist state, local, and tribal law enforcement (including support for hiring), to combat violence against women, to fight internet cri mes against children, to improve the functioning of the criminal justice system, to assist victims of crime, and to support youth mentoring. FY 2012 U. S. Department of Justice Annual Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements (Dollars in Thousands, Except as Noted) These notes are an integral part of the financial statements . Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-23 B. Basis of Presentation These financial statements have been prepared from the books and records of the Department in accordance with U nited States generally accepted accounting p rinciples issued by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) and presentation guidelines in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A -136, Financial Reporting Requirements . These financial statements are different from the financial reports prepared pursuant to OMB directives which are used to monitor and control the use of the Department =s budgetary resources. The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of all funds under the Department =s control. To ensure that the Department financial statements are meaningful at the entity level and to enhance reporting consis tency within the Department, Other Assets and Other Liabilities as defined by OMB Circular A -136 have been disaggregated on the balance sheet. These include Forfeited Property , Net; Advances and Prepayments; Accrued Grant Liabilities; Accrued Federal Empl oyees' Compensation Act (FECA) Liabilities ; Custodial Liabilities; Accrued Payroll and Benefits; Accrued Annual and Compensatory Leave Liabilities; Deferred Revenue; Seize d Cash and Monetary Instruments; Contingent Liabilities; Capital Lease Liabilities; R adiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) Liabilities; and September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Liabilities . C. Basis of Consolidation The consolidated/combined financial statements of the Department include the accounts of the AFF/SADF, OBDs, US MS, OJP, DEA, FBI, ATF, BOP, and FPI. All significant proprietary intra-departmental transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Statements of Budgetary Resources and Statements of Custodial Activity are combined statements for FYs 20 12 and 2011, and as such, intra -departmental transactions have not been eliminated. D. Basis of Accounting Transactions are recorded on the accrual and budgetary base s of accounting. Under the accrual basis, revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred, regardless of when cash is exchanged. Under the budgetary basis, however, funds availability is recorded based upon legal considerations and constraints. As a result, certain line items on the proprietary financial statements may not equal similar line items on the budgetary financial statements. FPI is non -appropriated and self-sustaining. While FPI performs budgetary accounting in prep aring its financial statements, FPI does not record budgetary information at the transaction level. Custodial activity reported on the Combined Statement of Custodial Activity is prepared on the modified cash basis. Civil and Criminal Debt Collections ar e recorded when the Department receives payment from debtors . Accrual adjustments are made related to collections of fees and licenses. The financial statements should be read with the realization that they are for a component of the U.S. Government, a s overeign entity. One implication of this is that liabilities cannot be liquidated without legislation that provides resources and legal authority to do so. FY 2012 U. S. Department of Justice Annual Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements (Dollars in Thousands, Except as Noted) These notes are an integral part of the financial statements . Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-24 E. Non-Entity Assets Non-entity assets are not available for use by the Department and consist primarily of restricted undisbursed civil and criminal debt collections, seized cash, accounts receivable, and other monetary assets. F. Fund Balance with U.S. Treasury and Cash Funds with the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) represent primarily appropriated, revolving, and trust funds available to pay current liabilities and finance future authorized purchases. The Treasury , as directed by authorized certifying officers , processes cash receipts and disbursements. The Depart ment does not, for the most part, maintain cash in commercial bank accounts. Certain receipts, however, are processed by commercial banks for deposit into individual accounts maintained at the Treasury. The Department =s cash and other monetary assets con sist of undeposited collections, imprest funds, cash used in undercover operations, cash held as evidence, and seized cash. G. Investments Investments are market -based Treasury securities issued by the Bureau of Public Debt. When securities are pu rchased, the investment is recorded at face value (the value at maturity). The Department =s intent is to hold investments to maturity, unless the invested funds are needed to sustain operations. No provision is made for unrealized gains or losses on these securities because, in the majority of cases, they are held to maturity. The market value of the investments is the current market value at the end of the reporting period. It is calculated by using the \"End of Day\" price listed in The FedInvest Price File which can be found on the Bureau of Public Debt website (http://www.fedinvest.gov/ ). Investments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their net value, the face value plus or minus any unamortized premium or discount. Premiums and discounts are amortized over the life of the Treasury security. The interest method is used for the amortization of premium and discount of Treasury notes and the straight -line method is used for Treasury bills. Amortization is based on the straight -line method over the term of the securities. The AFF , the U.S. Trustee System Fund, and the Federal Prison Commissary Fund are three earmarked funds that invest in Treasury securities. The Treasury does not set aside assets to pay future expenditures associated with earmarked funds. Instead, the cash generated from earm arked funds is used by the Treasury for general Government purposes . When these earmarked funds redeem their Treasury securities to make expenditures, the Treasury will finance the expenditures in the same manner that it finances all other expenditures. Treasury securities are issued to the earmarked funds as evidence of earmarked receipts and provide the funds with the authority to draw upon the U.S. Treasury for future authorized expenditures. Treasury securities held by an earmarked fund are an asset of the fund and a liabil ity of the Treasury, so they are eliminated in consolidation for the U.S. Government -wide financial statements.

Department of Justice Annual Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements (Dollars in Thousands, Except as Noted) These notes are an integral part of the financial statements . Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-25 H. Accounts Receivable Net accounts receivable includes reimbursement and refund receivables due from f ederal agencies and the public , less the allowance for doubtful accounts. Generally, most intragovernmental accounts receivable are considered fully collectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts for public receivables is estimated based on past collection e xperience and analysis of outstanding receivable balances at year end. I. Inventory and Related Property Inventory is maintained primarily for the manufacture of goods for sale to customers. This inventory is composed of three categories: Raw Materials, Work in Process, and Finished Goods. Raw material inventory value is based upon moving average costs. Inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market value (LCM) and include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Market value is calcu lated on the basis of the contractual or anticipated selling price, less allowance for administrative expenses. DOJ values its finished goods and sub- assembly items at a standard cost that is periodically adjusted to approximate actual cost. DOJ has established inventory allowances to account for LCM adjustments and obsolete items that may not be utilized in future periods. Additional i nventories consist of new and rehabilitated office furniture, equipment and supplies used for the repair of airplanes, administrative supplie s and materials, commissary sales to inmates (sundry items), metals, plastics, electronics, graphics, and optics. J. General Property, Plant and Equipment With the exception of land, r eal property and leasehold improvements are capitalized when the cost of acquiring and/or improving the asset is $100 or more and the asset has a useful life of two or more years. Land is capitalized regardless of the acquisition cost. Real property is depreciated or amortized , based on historical c ost, using the straight -line method over the estimated useful l ife of the asset. Except for BOP and FPI, Department acquisitions of personal property, excluding internal use softwa re, costing $25 or more is capitalized if the asset has an estimated useful life of two or more years. Personal property is depreciated, based on historical cost, using the straight -line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. BOP and FP I capitalize personal property acquisitions ove r $5 and $10, respectively . Internal use software is capitalized when developmental phase costs or enhancement costs are $500 or more and the asset has an estimated use ful life of two or more years. A ircraft are capitalized when the initial cost of acquiring those assets i s $100 or mor e. Internal use software and aircraft are depreciated, based on historical cost, using the straight -line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. FY 2012 U. S. Department of Justice Annual Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements (Dollars in Thousands, Except as Noted) These notes are an integral part of the financial statements . Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-26 K. Advances and Prepayments Advances and prepayments, classified as assets on the Consolidated B alance S heets, consist primarily of funds disbursed to grantees in excess of total expenditures made by those grantees to third parties, funds advanced to state and local participants in the DEA Domestic Cannabis Eradication and Suppressi on Program, and travel advances issued to f ederal employees for official travel. Travel advances are limited to meals and incidental expenses expected to be incurred by the employees during official travel. Payments in advance of the receipt of goods and services are recorded as prepaid charges at the time of payment and are recognized as expenses when the goods and services are received. L. Forfeited and Seized Property Forfeited property is property for which the title has passed to the U.S. Government. This property is recorded at the estimated fair market value at the time of forfeiture and is not adjusted for any subsequent increases and decreases in estimated fair market value. The value of the property is reduced by the estimated liens of record. Property is seized in consequence of a violation of public law. Seized property can include monetary instruments, real property, and tangible personal property of others in the actual or constructive possession of the custodial agency. Most non -cash property is held by the USMS from the point of seizure until its disposition. This property is recorded at the estimated fair market value at the time of seizure and is not adjusted for any subsequent increases and decrease s in estimated fair mar ket value. M. Liabilities Liabilities represent the monies or other resources that are likely to be paid by the Department as the result of a transaction or event that has already occurred. However, no liability can be paid by the Department absent prop er budget authority. Liabilities that are not funded by the current year appropriation are classified as liabilities not covered by budgetary resources in Note 11. Accrued payroll and benefits are accrued based on the number of days in a pay period earne d but not paid to employees at the end of the fiscal year. N. Accrued Grant Liabilities Disbursements of grant funds are recognized as expenses at the time of disbursement. However, some grant recipients incur expenditures prior to initia ting a request for disbursement based on the nature of the expenditures. The OBDs and OJP accrue a liability for expenditures incurred by grantees prior to receiving grant funds for expenditures. The amount to be accrued is determined through an analysis of historic grant expenditures. These estimates are based on the most current information available at the time the financial statements are prepared. Estimates for the grant accrual contain assumptions that have an impact on the financial statements. The key assum ptions used in the grant accrual are: grantees have consistent spending patterns FY 2012 U. S. Department of Justice Annual Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements (Dollars in Thousands, Except as Noted) These notes are an integral part of the financial statements . Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-27 N. Accrued Grant Liabilities (continued) throughout the life of the grant, grantees will drawdown throughout the life of the grant, and the grant has a determined end date. The primary elements of these assumptions include, but are not limited to, type of grant that has been awarded, grant period, accounting basis used by the grantees, and the grant expenditure rate. O. Contingencies and Commitments The Department is involved in v arious administrative proceedings, legal actions, and claims. The balance sheet includes an estimated liability for those legal actions where management and the Chief Counsel consider adverse decisions \"probable\" and am ounts are reasonably estimable. Legal actions where management and the Chief Counsel consider adverse decisions \"probable\" or \"reasonably possible\" and the amounts are reasonably estimable are disclosed in Note 16 . However, there are cases where amounts have not been accrued or disclosed because the amounts of the potential loss cannot be estimated or the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is considered \"remote\". P. Annual, Sick, and Other Leave Annual and compensatory leave is expensed with an offsetting liability as it is earned and the liability is reduced as leave is taken. Each year, the balance in the accrued annual leave liability account is adjusted to reflect current pay rates. To the e xtent current or prior year appropriations are not available to fund annual and compensatory leave earned but not taken, funding will be obtained from future financing sources. Sick leave and other types of nonvested leave are expensed as taken. Q. Inter est on Late Payments Pursuant to the Prompt Payment Act, 31 U.S.C. ' 3901 -3907, the Department pays interest on payments for goods or services made to business concerns after the due date. The due date is generally 30 days after receipt of a proper invoi ce or acceptance of the goods or services, whichever is later. R. Retirement Plan With few exceptions, employees hired before January 1, 1984 are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and employees hired on or after that date are covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). For employees covered by CSRS, the Department contributes 7% of the employees= gross pay for regular and 7.5% for law enforcement officers ' retirement. For employees covered by FERS, the Department contr ibutes 11.9 % of the employees= gross pay for regular and 2 6.3% for law enforcement officers' retirement . All employees are eligible to contribute to the Federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). For those employees covered by the FERS, a TSP accou nt is automati cally established to which the Department is required to contribute an additional 1% of gross pay and match employee contributions up to 4%. No contributions are made to the TSP accounts established by the CSRS employees. The Department does not report CSRS or FERS assets, accumulated plan benefits, or unfunded liabilities, if any, which may be applicable to its employees. FY 2012 U. S.

Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-28 R. Retirement Plan (continued) Such reporting is the responsibi lity of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) No. 5, Accounting for Liabili ties of the Federal Government , requires employing agencies to recognize the cost of pensions and other retirement benefits during their employees= active years of service. Refer to Note 19, Imputed Financing from Costs Absorbed by Others, for additional details. S. Federal Employee Compensation Benefits The FECA provides income and medical cost protection to covered federal civilian employees injured on the job, employees who have incurred a work- related occupational disease, and beneficiaries of employees whose death is attributable to a job -related inju ry or occupational disease. The total FECA liability consists of an actuarial and an accrued portion as discussed below. Actuarial Liability: The Department of Labor (DOL) calculates the liability of the federal government for future compensation benefit s, which includes the expected liability for death, disability, medical, and other approved costs. The liability is determined using the paid- losses extrapolation method calculate d over the next 37 -year period. This method utilizes historical benefit pay ment patterns related to a specific incurred period to predict the u ltimate payments related to that period. The projec ted annual benefit payments are discounted to present value. The resulting federal government liability i s then distributed by agency. The Department 's portion of this liability includes the estimated future cost of death benefits, workers' compensation, medical, and miscellaneous cost for approved compensation cases for the Department employees. The Department liability is further allocated to component reporting entities on the basis of actual payments made to the FECA Special Benefits Fund (SBF) for the three prior years as compared to the total Department payments made over the same period. The FECA actuarial liability is recorded for reporting purposes only. This liability constitutes an extended future estimate of cost, which will not be obligated against budgetary resources until the fiscal year in which the cost is actually billed to the Department. The cost associated with thi s liability cannot be met by the Department without further appropriation action. Accrued Liability: The accrued FECA liability is the amount owed to the DOL for the benefits paid from the FECA SBF directly to Department employees. T. Intragovernmental Activity Intragovernmental costs and exchange revenue represent transactions made between two reporting entities within the federal government . Costs and earned revenues with the public represent exchange transactions made between the r eporting entity and a non- federal entity. The classification of revenue or cost as \"intragovernmental\" or \"with the public\" is defined on a transaction -by-transaction basis. The purpose of this classification is to enable the federal government to prepar e consolidated financial statements, not to match public and intragovernmental revenue with the costs incurred to produce public and intragovernmental revenue.

Department of Justice Annual Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements (Dollars in Thousands, Except as Noted) These notes are an integral part of the financial statements . Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-29 U. Revenues and Other Financing Sources The Department receives the majority of funding needed to support its programs through Congressional appropriations. The Department receives annual, multi- year, and no -year appropriations that may be used, within statutory limits, for operating and capita l expenditures. Additional funding is obtained through exchange revenues, nonexchange revenues , and transfers- in. Appropriations Used are recognized as budgetary financing sources at the time the related program or administrative expenses are incurred. Exchange revenues are recognized when earned, for example, when goods have been delivered or services rendered. Nonexchange revenues are resources that the Government demands or receives, for example, forfeiture revenue and fines and penalties. The Depa rtment =s exchange revenue consists of the following activities: licensing fees to manufacture and distribute controlled substances; services rendered for legal activities; space management; data processing services; sale of merchandise and telephone services to inmates; sale of manufactured goods and services to other federal agencies; and other services. Fees are set by law and are The Department =s exchange revenue consists of the following activities: licensing fees to manufacture and distribute controll ed substances; services rendered for legal activities; space management; data processing services; sale of merchandise and telephone services to inmates; sale of manufactured goods and services to other federal agencies; and other services. Fees are set b y law and are periodically evaluated in accordance with OMB guidance. The Department =s nonexchange revenue consists of forfeiture income resulting from the sale of forfeited property, penalties in lieu of forfeiture, recovery of returned asset manageme nt cost, judgment collections, and other miscellaneous income. Other nonexchange revenue includes the OJP Crime Victims Fund receipts, ATF fees from firearms and ammunition industries, and AFF/SADF interest on investments with the Treasury. The Department =s deferred revenue includes fees received for processing various applications and licenses with DEA for which the process was not completed at the end of fiscal year or for licenses that are valid for multiple years. These monies are recorded as liabilities in the financial statements. Deferred revenue also includes forfeited property held for sale. When the property is sold, deferred revenue is reversed and forfeiture revenue in the amount of the gross proceeds of the sale is recorded. V. Earmarked Funds SFFAS No. 27, Identifying and Reporting Earmarked Funds , defines ' earmarked f unds' as being financed by specifically identified revenues, often supplemented by other financing sources, which remain available over time. These specifi cally identified revenues and other financing sources are required by statute to be used for designated activities, benefits or purposes, and must be acc ounted for separately from the g overnment's general revenues. The three required criteria for an E armar ked F und are: FY 2012 U. S. Department of Justice Annual Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements (Dollars in Thousands, Except as Noted) These notes are an integral part of the financial statements . Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-30 V. Earmarked Funds (continued) 1. A statute committing the federal government to use specifically identified revenues and other financing sources only for designated activities, benefits or purposes; 2. Explicit authority for the earma rked fund to retain revenues and other financing sources not used in the current period for future use to finance the designated activities, benefits, or purposes; and 3. A requirement to account for and report on the receipt, use, and retention of the revenues and other financing sources that distinguishes the earmarked fund from the Government's general revenues. The following funds meet the definition of an earmarked fund: AFF, U.S. Trustee System Fund, Antitrust Division, Crime Victims Fund, Divers ion Control Fee Account, and Federal Prison Commissary Fund. W. Allocation Transfer of Appropriation The Department is a party to allocation transfers with other federal agencies as a transferring (parent) entity and/or a receiving (child) entity. Allocation transfers are legal delegations by one department of its authority to obligate budget authority and outlay funds to another department. Generally, all financial activity related to these allocation transfers (e.g., budget authority, obli gations, outlays) is reported in the financial statements of the parent entity, from which the underlying legislative authority, appropriations, and budget apportionments are derived. Two exceptions to this general rule affecting the Department include the funds transferred from the Judicial Branch to the USMS, and funds transferred from the Executive Office of the President to OJP. Per OMB's guidance, USMS and OJP report all activity relative to these allocation transfers in the respective financial statements. The activity related to these transfers, included as part of these financial statements, is highlighted below: OJP, as the parent, transfers funds f rom the Crime Victims Fund to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This tr ansfer is required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a710603a {Sec. 14- 4A} for Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Grants . Amounts made available by section \u00a710601(d)(2) of this title, for the purposes of this section, are to be obligated and expended by the Secretary of HHS for grants under section \u00a75106c of this title. OJP receives, as a child entity, allocation transfers of appropriations from the Executive Office of the President. This transfer is authorized by P.L. 111-117 and P.L. 112-74. Per OMB guidance OJP reports all budgetary and proprietary activity for Do Right by Youth Pilot transferred from the Executive Office of the President to OJP. The Department also allocated funds from B OP, as the parent, to the Public Health Service (PHS) , a primary division of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). PHS provides a portion of medical treatment for federal inmates. The mone y is designated and expended for current year obligation of PHS staff salaries, benefits, and applicable relocation expenses.

Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-31 W. Allocat ion Transfer of Appropriation (continued) USMS, as the child, receives allocation transfers of appropriation from the Administrati ve Office of the U.S. Courts . The allocation transfers are used for costs associated with protective guard services - Court Security Officers at United States courthouses and other facilities housing federal court operations. These costs include their salaries (paid through contracts), equipment, and supplies. This transfer is performed on an annual basis. X. Tax Exem pt Status As an agency of the federal government , the Department is exempt from all income taxes imposed by any governing body whether it be a federal, state, commonwealth, local or foreign government. Y. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from th ose estimates. Z. Reclassifications The FY 2011 financial statements were reclassified to conform to the FY 2012 Departmental financial statement presentation requirements. The Department has realigned its Statement of Net Cost and Note 18, Net Cost of Operations by Suborganization to further align to the revised goal structure in accordance with the Department's Strategic Plan. Also, changes to the presentation of the Combined and Combining Statements of Budgetary Resources were made, in accordance with guidance provided in OMB Circular A -136 and as such, activity and balances reported on the FY 2011 Combined and Combining Statement of Budgetary Resources have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current year. Certain other prior year amounts have also been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. The reclassifications have no material effect on total assets, liabilities, net position, change in net position or budgetary resources, as previously reported. AA. Subsequent Events Subsequent events and transactions occurring after September 30, 20 12 through the date of the auditors' opinion have been evaluated for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The date of the auditors' opinion also represents the date that the financial statements were available to be issued. FY 2012 U. S.

Fund Balance with U.S. Treasury The Fund Balances with U.S. Treasury represent the unexpended balances on the Department =s books for all the Department =s Treasury Symbols . Annual and multi -year budget authority expires at the end of its period of availability. During the first through the fifth expired years, the unobligated balance is unavailable and may only be used to adjust obligations and disburs ements that were recorded before the budgetary authority expired or to meet a legitimate or bona fide need arising in the fiscal year for which the appropriation was made. The unobligated balance for no- year budget authority may be used to incur obligations indefinitely for the purpose speci fied by the appropriation act. No -year budget authority unobligated balances are still subject to the annual apportionment and allotment process. Unobligated Balance - Unavailable includes amounts appropriated in prior fiscal years that are no longer available to fund new obligations, but can be used for upward and/or downward adjustments for existing obligations. Additionally, this line includes amounts received that are restricted to future use and as a result are no t apportioned for current use . Other r estricted funds include the collections of fees in excess of amounts budgeted for administering the Diversion Control Program. These collections may not be used until authorized by Congress.

Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-36 Note 8. Forfeited and Seized Property Equitable Sharing Payments: The statute governing the use of the AFF (28 U.S.C. ' 524(c)) permits the payment of equitable shares of forfeiture proceeds to participating foreign governments and state and local law enforcement agencies. The statute does not require such sharing and pe rmits the Attorney General wide discretion in determining those transfers. Actual sharing is difficult to predict because many factors influence both the amount and timing of disbursement of equitable sharing payments, such as the length of time required to move an asset through the forfeiture process to disposition, the amount of net proceeds available for sharing, the elapse of time for Departmental approval of equitable sharing requests for cases with asset values exceeding $1 million, and appeal of for feiture judgments. Because of uncertainties surrounding the timing and amount of any equitable sharing payment, an obligation and expense are recorded only when the actual disbursement of the equitable sharing payment is imminent. The anticipated equitab le sharing allocation level for FY 2013 is $446 million . Analysis of Change in Forfeited Property: The number of items represents quantities calculated using many different units of measure. If necessary, the adjustments column includes property status and valuation changes received after, but properly credited to the appropriat e fiscal years. The valuation changes include updates and corrections to an asset's value recorded in the prior year. FY 2012 U. S.

Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-38 Note 8. Forfeited and Seized Property ( continued) Method of Disposition of Forfeited Property: During FYs 2012 and 20 11, $132,710 and $ 165,406 of forfeited property were sold, $2,672 and $1 6,211 were destroyed or donated, $10,349 and $9,262 were returned to owners, and $36,542 and $12,533 were disposed of by other means, respectively. Other means of disposi tion include property transferred to other f ederal agencies for off icial use or equitable sharing , or property distributed to a state or local agency . Analysis of Change in Seized Prop erty: Property seized for any purpose other than forfeiture and held by the seizing agency or a custodial agency should be disclosed by the seizing agency. All property seized for forfeiture, including property with evidentiary value, will be reported by the AF F/SADF . The Department has established a reporting threshold of $1 or more for Personal Property seized for evidentiary purposes. A seizure is the act of taking possession of goods in consequence of a violation of public law. Seized property consists of seized cash, monetary instruments, real property and tangible personal property in the actual or constructive possession of the seizing and the custodial agencies. The Department, until judicially or administratively forfeited, does not legally own such property. Seized evidence includes cash, financial instruments, non- monetary v aluables, firearms, and drugs. The AFF/SADF reports property seized for forfeiture and the FBI, DEA, and ATF report property seized for evidence. The adjustments for FYs 2012 and 2011 include property status and valuation changes received after, but properly credited to FYs 20 11 and 20 10, respectively. The valuation changes include updates and corrections to an asset's value recorded in a prior year . During FY 2011, the DEA had access to better information that allowed the reporting of partial destructions of drugs held for evidence at the time of partial destruction rather than at the time the exhibit was fully destroyed. Therefore, the DEA has recorded an adjustment in the FY 2011 \"Adjustment\" column to primarily reflect the partial destruction of exhibits destroyed in prior years. ATF's a djustments for non- valued firearms are items determined to be seized for evidence that were not included in the seized for evidence bala nces in prior years. The DEA, FBI, and ATF have custody of drugs taken as evidence for legal proceedings. In accordance with Federal Financial Accounting and Auditing Technical Release No. 4, Reporting on Non- Valued Seized and Forfeited Property, the De partment reports the total amount of seized dru gs by quantity only, as drugs have no value and are destroyed upon resolution of legal proceedings.

Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-39 Note 8. Forfeited and Seized Property (continued) Analyzed drug evidence includes cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine and represents actual laboratory tested classification and weight in kilograms (KG). Since enforcing the controlled substances laws and regulations of the United States is a primary mission of the D EA, the DEA reports all analyzed drug evidence regardless of seizure weight. However, the enforcement of these laws and regulations is incidental to the missions of the FBI and ATF and therefore they only report those individual seizures exceeding 1 KG in weight. \"Other\" primarily consist s of substances, both controlled and non-controlled as defined per the Controll ed Substances Act, other than those discussed above. \"Bulk Drug E vidence\" is comprised of controlled substances housed by the DEA in secured storage facilities of which only a sample is taken for laboratory analysis. The actual bulk drug weight may vary from seizure weight due to changes in moisture content over time. Unanalyzed drug evidence is qualitatively different from analyzed and bulk drug evidence because unanalyzed drug evidence includes the weight of packaging and drug categories are based on the determination of Special Agents instead of laboratory chemists. For these reasons, unanalyzed drug evidence is not reported by the Department. Seized drug evidence must be analyzed and confirmed through laboratory testing to be placed in one of the five categories of drug above. \"Disposals\" occur when seized property is forfeited, return ed to parties with a bona fide interest, or destroyed in accordance with federal guidelines.

Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-45 Note 11. Liabilities not Covered by Budgetary Resources (continued) Generally, liabilities not covered by budgetary resources are liabilities for which Congressional action is needed before budgetary resources can be provided. However, some liabilities do not require appropriations and will b e liquidated by the assets of the entities holding these liabilities. Such assets include civil and criminal debt collections, seized cash and monetary instruments, and revolving fund operations. Other Liabilities with the Public consists primarily of future funded energy savings performance contracts and utilities. Note 1 2. Environmental and Disposal Liabilities Per SFFAS No. 5 , Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government , SFFAS No. 6, Accounting for Property, Plant, and Equipment , and Technical Release No. 2 Determining Probable and Reasonably Estimable for Environmental Liabilities in the Federal Government , Technical Release No. 10 , Implementation Guidance on Asbestos Cleanup Costs Associated with Facilities and Installed Equipment , and Technical Release No. 11, Implementation Guidance on Cleanup Costs Associated with Equipment, federal agencies are required to recognize liabilities for environmental clean -up costs when the future outflow or sacrifice of resources is probable and reasonably estimable. Firing Ranges The BOP operates firing ranges on 66 of the sites where its institutions are located. Use of these firing ranges generates waste consisting primarily of lead shot and spent rounds from rifles, shotguns, pistols, and automatic weapons. At operational firing ranges, lead-containing bullets are fired and eventually fall to the ground at or near the range. As of September 30, 2011, BOP management determined their estimated clean -up liability to be $26,045 . In FY 2012, BOP management adjusted the estimated clean -up liability by the current U.S. inflation rate as determined by the U.S. Treasury and as such determined that an estimated firing range clean - up liability of $26,935, based on an inflation rate of 1.9 percent, should be record ed. Asbestos BOP conducted a review of 46 institutions that were built prior to 1980 ; the review provided an estimate of the extent of friable and non- friable Asbestos Containing Materials (ACM) remaining in each of the institutions as of October 30, 2009. As of September 30, 2011, BOP management determined their estimated clean -up liability to be $36,677. As of September 30, 2012, BOP management adjusted the clean -up lia bility in the amount of $610 for the removal of asbestos at 2 locations and by the U.S. inflation rate of 1.9 percent as determined by the U.S. Treasury and as such det ermined that an estimated asbestos clean -up liability of $37,287 should be recorded. The FBI operates facilities in Quantico, Virginia that contain friable and non- friable ACM. The facilities have a useful life of 50 years. The estimated total liability of $11,613 is based on the square footage of the facilities FY 2012 U. S.

Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-46 Asbestos (continued) that may be contaminated. This value, divided by the useful life and multiplied by the number of years in service, is the estimated cleanup liability. As of September 30, 2012 and 2011, the FBI recognized the estimated cleanup liability of $10,219 and $9,987 , respectively. The estimated asbestos cleanup liability is increased each quarter by recording future expenses for the asbestos clean- up costs. During FY 2012, fut ure funded expense for asbestos cleanup is $232. There are no other potentially responsible parties to the environmental liability and there are no unrecognized amounts to d isclose as of September 30, 2012. Note 1 3.

Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-52 Note 1 7. Earmarked Funds (continued) The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 established the AFF to receive the proceeds of forfeiture and to pay the costs associated with such forfeitures, including the costs of managing and disposing of property, satisfying valid liens, mortgages, and other innocent owner claims, and costs associated with accomplishing the legal forfeiture of the property. Authorities of the fund have been amended by various public laws enacted since 1984. Under current law, authority to use the fund for certain investigative expenses shall be specified in annual appropriation acts. Expenses necessary to se ize, detain, inventory, safeguard, maintain, advertise or sell property under seizure are funded through a permanent, indefinite appropriation. In addition, beginning in FY 1993, other general expenses of managing and operating the Asset Forfeiture Progra m are paid from the permanent, indefinite portion of the fund. Once all expenses are covered, the balance is maintained to meet ongoing expenses of the program. Excess unobligated balances may also be allocated by the Attorney General in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7524(c)(8)(E). United States Trustees (UST) supervise the administration of bankruptcy cases and private trustees in the Federal Bankruptcy Courts. The Bankruptcy Judges, UST, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986 (Public Law 99 -554) expanded the pilot trustee program to a 21 region, nationwide program encompassing 88 judicial districts. The UST System Fund collects user fees assessed against debtors, which offset the annual appropriation. The Antitrust Division administers and enforces antit rust and related statutes. This program primarily involves the investigation of suspected violations of the antitrust laws, the conduct of civil and criminal proceedings in the federal courts, and the maintenance of competitive conditions. The Antitrust D ivision collects filing fees for pre -merger notifications and retains these fees for expenditure in support of its programs. The Crime Victims Fund is financed by collections of fines, penalty assessments, and bond forfeitures from defendants convicted of federal crimes. This fund supports victim assistance and compensation programs around the country and advocates, through policy development, for the fair treatment of crime victims. The Office for Victims of Crime administers formula and discretionary grants for programs designed to benefit victims, provides training for diverse professionals who work with victims, develops projects to enhance victims' rights and services, and undertakes public education and awareness activities on behalf of crime victims. The Diversion Control Fee Account is established in the General F und of the Treasury as a separate account. Fees charged by the DEA under the Diversion Control Program are set at a level that ensures the recovery of the full costs of operating this program. The program's purpose is to prevent, detect, and investigate the diversion of controlled substances from legitimate channels, whi le ensuring an adequate and uninterrupted supply of controlled substances required to meet legitimate needs. The Federal Prison Commissary Fund was created in the early 1930s to allow inmates a means to purchase additional products and services above the necessities provided by appropriated federal funds, e.g., personal grooming products, snacks, postage stamps, and telephone services. The Trust Fund is a self -sustaining trust revolving fund account that is funded through sales of goods and services to inmates. FY 2012 U. S.

Imputed Financing from Costs Absor bed by Others Imputed Inter -Departmental Financing Sources are the unreimbursed (i.e., non- reimbursed and under - reimbursed) portion of the full costs of goods and services received by the Department from a providing entity that is not part of the Departme nt. In accordance with SFFAS No. 30, Inter -Entity Cost Implementation Amending SFFAS No.4, Managerial Co st Accounting Concepts and Standard s, the material Imputed Inter - Departmental financing sources currently recognized by the Department include the cost of benefits for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB), the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Program (FEGLI), and the Federal Pension plans that are paid by other f ederal entities, and any un -reimbursed payments made from the Treasury Judgment Fund on behalf of the Department. The Treasury Judgment Fund was established by the Congress and funded at 31 U.S.C. \u00a71304 to pay in whole or in part the court judgments and settlement agreements negotiated by the Department on behalf of agencies, as well as certain types of administrative awards. Interpretation of Federal Financial Accounting Standards Interpretation No. 2, Accounting for Treasury Judgment Fund Transactions , requires agencies to recognize liabilities and expenses when unfavorable litigation outcomes are probable and the amount can be estimated and will be paid by the Treasury Judgment Fund. SFFAS No. 5, Accounting for Liabili ties of the Federal Government , requires that employing agencies recognize the cost of pensions and oth er retirement benefits during their employees' active years of service. SFFAS No. 5 requires OPM to provide cost factors necessary to calculate cost. OPM actuaries calculate the value of pension benefits expected to be paid in the future, and then determ ine the total funds to be contributed by and for covered employees, such that the amount calculated would be sufficient to fund the projected pension benefits. For employees covered by Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), the cost factors are 29.8% of basic pay for regular, 50.9% law enforcement officers, 23.2 % regular offset, and 45. 2% law enforcement officers offset. For employees covered by Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), the cost factors are 13.7% of basic pay for regular and 29.7% for law enforcement officers. The cost to be paid by other agencies is the total calculated future costs, less employee and employer contributions. In addition, other retirement benefits, which include health and life insurance that are paid by other federal entities, must also be disclosed.

Imputed Financing from Costs Absorbed by Others (continued) Imputed Intra -Departmental Financing Sources as defined in SFFAS No. 4, Managerial Cost Accounting Standards and Concepts , are the unreimbursed portion of the full costs of goods and ser vices received by a Department component from a providing entity that is part of the Department. Recognition is required for those transactions determined to be material to the receiving enti ty. The determination of whether the cost is material requires considerable judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each type of good or service provided. SFFAS No. 4 also states that costs for broad and general support need not be recognized by the receiving entity, unless such services form a vital and integral part of the operations or output of the receiving entity. Cost s are considered broad and general if they are provided to many, if not all, reporting components and not specifically related to the receiving entity's output. The FPI imputed $24,718 and $25,464 for FY s 2012 and 2011, respectively of unreimbursed costs f or BOP warehouse space used in the production of goods by the FPI and for managerial and operational services BOP provided to FPI. These imputed costs have been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements. Note 2 0.

Information Related to the Statement of Budgetary Resources (continued) Status of Undelivered Orders: Undelivered Orders (UDO) represent the amount of goods and/or services ordered, which have not been actually or constructively r eceived. This amount includes any orders which may have been prepaid or advanced but for which delivery or performance has not yet occurred. Permanent Indefinite Appropriations: A permanent indefinite appropriation is open- ended as to both its period of availability (amount of time the agency has to spend the funds) and its amount. Following are the Department's permanent indefinite appropriations. 28 U.S.C. '524(c)(4) authorized the Attorney General to retain AFF receipts to pay operations expense s, equitable sharing to state and local law enforcement agencies who assist in forfeiture cases, and lien holders . On October 5, 1990, Congress passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (\"R ECA\" or \"the Act\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2210, providing for compassion ate payments to individuals who contracted certain cancers and other serious diseases as a result of their exposure to radiation released during above - ground nuclear weapons tests or as a result of their exposure to radiation during employment in underground uranium mines. Implementing regulations were issued by the Department of Justice and published in the Federal Register on April 10, 1992. These regulations established procedures to resolve claims in a reliable, objective, and non -adversarial manner, with little administrative cost to the United States or to the person filing the claim. Revisions to the regulations, published in the Federal Register on March 22, 1999, served to greater assist claimants in establishing entitlement to an award. On July 10, 2000, P.L. 106- 245, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2000 (\"the 2000 Amendments\") were passed. On November 2, 2002, the President signed the \"21st Century Department of Justice Appropriation Authorization Act\" (P.L. 107- 273). Con tained in the law were several provisions relating to RECA. While most of these amendments were \"technical\" in nature, some affect ed eligibility criteria and revised claims adjudication procedures.

Information Related to the Statement of Budgetary Resources (continued) Permanent Indefinite Appropriations (continued): Congress established the Federal Prison Commissary Fund (Trust Fund) in 1932 to allow inmates a means to purchase additional products and services above the necessities provided by appropriated federal funds. The BOP Trust Fund is now a self -sustaining revolving ac count that is funded through the sales of goods and services, rather than annual or no -year appropriations. The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act of 1976 (the \"PSOB Act\") is generally codified at 42 U.S.C. '46 Subchapter XII. OJP's PSOB appropriation supports one mandatory and two discretionary programs that provide benefits to public safety officers who are severely injured in the line of duty and to the families and survivors of public safety officers killed or mortally injured in the line of duty. The PSOB Program offers three types of benefits: 1. Death Benefits, a one- time financial benefit to survivors of public safety officers whose deaths resulted f rom injuries sustained in the line of duty. Under the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act of 2003, survivors of public safety officers who die of a heart attack or stroke within 24 hours of stressful, non- routine public safety activities may also q ualify fo r death benefits. 2. Disability Benefits, a one -time financial benefit to public safety officers permanently disabled by catastrophic injuries sustained in the line of duty. 3. Education Benefits, which provide financial support for higher education expenses (such as tuition and fees, books, supplies, and room and board) to the eligible spouses and children of public safety officers killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty. Legal Arrangements Affecting Use of Unobligated Balances: Unoblig ated balances represent the cumulative amount of budget authority that is not obligated and that remains available for obligation under law, unless otherwise restricted. The use of unobligated balances is restricted based on annual legislation requirement s and other enabling authorities. Funds are appropriated on an annual, multi -year, and no- year basis. Appropriated funds shall expire on the last day of availability and are no longer available for new obligations. Unobligated balances in unexpired fund symbols are available in the next fiscal year for new obligations unless some restrictions had been placed on those funds by law. Amounts in expired fund symbols are unavailable for new obligations, but may be used to adjust previously established obliga tions. FY 2012 U. S.

Net Custodial Revenue Activity Custodial revenue activity represents those collections of non -exchange revenue on behalf of other recipient entities. These collections are not recorded as revenue by the Department but as activity on the Statement of Custodial Activity. The custodial liabilities presented on the Consolidated Bala nce Sheet and Note 15 represent funds held by the Department that have yet to be disbursed to the appropriate Federal agency or individual. The primary source of the Department's Office of Debt Collection Management ( DCM ) ts of civil e.g. , student l oan d efaults, and health care fraud . The DCM also processes certain payments on criminal debts as an accommodation for the BOP and the Clerks of the U.S. District Courts. The BOP aggregates collections of inmate criminal debt by correction facility, and the DCM sorts the collections by judicial district and disburses payments to the respective Clerks of the U.S. Court. The DCM also accepts wire transfers or other payments on a criminal debt if a Clerk of the U.S. Court is unable or unwilling to do so. In addition, other negligible custodial collections occur for interest, fines , and penalties. The OBDs collect civil fines, penalties, and restitution payments that are incidental to its mission. By court order, the OBDs were given the investment authorit y and the settlement funds collected must be invested. The OBDs invest these funds with the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt. As of September 30, 20 12 and 2011, the custodial assets and liabilities recorded by the OBDs on the Consolidated B alance S heet are $ 1,320,292 and $752,797, respectively. cust collections totaled $ 7,035,591 and $5,260,397 for the fisca l years ended September 30, 20 12 and 2011. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 , DEA collected $ 27,595 and $97,268 , respectively. DEA's collections include $ 15 million of the total fees collected for the Diversi on Control Program and civil monetary penalties related to violations of the Controlled Substances Act that were incidental to DEA's mission. Since DEA has no statutory authority to use these excess funds, DEA transmits them to the Treasury General Fund. The DEA has a custodial liability for funds that have not yet been transmitted to the Treasury General Fund. As of September 30, 2012 and 2011 balances for cu stodial liabilities were $ 3,781 and $5,199, respectively. As an agent of the federal government and as authorized by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6301, ATF collects fees from firearms and explosives industries, as well as import, permit and license fees. Special Occupational Taxes are collected from certain firearms businesses. Miscellaneous collections include pr oject -generated proceeds. As ATF is unable to use these collections in its operations, ATF also has the authority to transfer these collections to the Treasury General Fund. The ATF custo dial collections totaled $24,675 and $21,444 for the fisca l years ended September 30, 2012 and 20 11, respectively. The FBI collected $10,736 and $902, in September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, in restitution payments, seized abandoned cash, and project generated proceeds. These collections were incidental to the FB I's mission. Since the FBI does not have statutory authority to use these funds, the FBI remits these funds upon receipt to the U.S. Treasury's General Fund. The FBI reports a custodial liability when custodial revenues are held by the FBI, but have not y et been transmitted to the U.S. Treasury's General Fund. As of September 30, 2012 and 2011, the FBI did not have any custodial liabilities. FY 2012 U. S.

Expla nation of Differences Between Liabilities not Covered by Budgetary Resources and Components of Net Cost of Operations Requiring or Generating Resources in Future Periods Liabilities that are not covered by realized budgetary resources and for which there is not certainty that budgetary authority will be realized, such as the enactment of an appropriation, are considered liabilities not covered by budgetary resources. Thes e liabilities totaling $6,695,824 and $ 3,617,966 on September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, are discussed in Note 11, Liabilities not Covered by Budgetary Resources. Decreases in these liabilities result from current year budgetary resources that were used to fund expenses recognized in prior periods. Increases in these liabilities represent unfunded expenses that were recognized in the current period. These increases along with the change in the portion of exchange revenue receivables from the public, which are not considered budgetary resources until collected, represent components of current period net cost of operations that will require or generate budgetary resources in future periods. The changes in liabilities not covered by budgetary resource s and receivables generating resources in future periods are comprised of the following: For the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 2012 2011 Resources that Fund Expenses Recognized in Prior Periods Decrease in Contingent Liabilities (40,101)$ (33,108) $ Decrease in Unfunded Capital Lease Liabilities (7,314) (6,762) Decrease in RECA Liabilities - (5,946) Decrease in Other Unfunded Employment Related Liabilities (594) - Decrease in Other Liabilities (20,548) - Total Other (68,557) (45,816) Total Resources that Fund Expenses Recognized in Prior Periods (68,557)$ (45,816) $ Components of Net Cost of Operations That Will Require or Generate Resources in Future Periods Increase in Accrued Annual and Compensatory Leave Liabilities 7,228 $ 5,921 $ Increase in Environmental and Disposal Liabilities 1,732 1,052 (Increase)/Decrease in Exchange Revenue Receivable from the Public 21,078 (51,628) Other Increase in Actuarial FECA Liabilities 114,918 45,255 Increase in Accrued FECA Liabilities 10,084 Increase Deferred Revenue 50,654 47,578 Increase in RECA Liabilities 195,399 - Increase in September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Liabilities 2,766,400 - Increase in Other Unfunded Employee Related Liabilities - 420 Increase in Other Liabilities - 78,484 (Increase)/Decrease in Nonexchange Receivables from the Public (96) (94) (Increase)/Decrease in Surcharge Revenue Receivable from Other Federal Agencies 6,737 (4,180) Total Other 3,144,096 174,152 Total Components of Net Cost of Operations That Will Require or Generate Resources in Future Periods 3,174,134$ 129,497$ FY 2012 U.

Department of Justice FY 20 12 Performance and Accountability Report III-64 Note 25. Compensation Funds Radiation Exposure Compensati on Act On October 15, 1990, Congress passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (REC A), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2210, providing for compassionate payments to individuals who contracted certain cancers and other serious diseases as a result of their exposure to radiation released during above -ground nuclear weapons tests or as a result of their exposure to radiation during employment in underground uranium mines. Implementing regulations were issued by the Department and published in the Federal Register on April 10, 1992, establishing procedures to resolve claims in a reliable, objective, and non -adversarial manner, with little administrative cost to the United States or to the person filing the claim. Revisions to the regulations, published in the Federal Register on March 22, 1999, served to greater assist claimants in establishing entitlement to an award. On July 10, 2000, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2000, P.L. 106- 245, was enacted. Some of the widespread changes include new claimant populations, additional compensable diseases, lower radiation exposure thresholds, modified medical documentation requirements, and removal of certain disease restrictions. Pursuant to the 2000 Amendments, the Department was directed to issue implementing regulations. The Department published two related rulemakings in the Federal Register to implement the legislation. Subsequent action by Congress required modification to those rulemakings. Therefore, the Department published a \"final\" rule in the Federal Register on March 23, 2004, which went into effect on April 22, 2004. There are now five categories of claimants: uranium miners, uranium millers, ore transporters, downwinders, and on- site participants. Each category requires similar eligibility criteria: if claimants can demonstrate that they contracted a compensable disease after working or residing in a designated location for a specified period of time, they qualify for compensation. The enactment of two pieces of legislation changed the funding sources for RECA claimants. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2005 requires that REC A Section 5 claimants (uranium miners, millers, and ore transporters) be paid out of the Department of Labor's (Labor) Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Fund. The RECA Section 5 liability of $316,993 as of March 30, 2004, was transferred to Labor during FY 2005. The RECA Fund began exclusively paying RECA Section 4 claimants (downwinders and on- site participants) in FY 2005. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, contains language that made funding for the RECA Trust Fund mandatory a nd indefinite beginning in FY 2006. The OBDs recognized liabilities of $731,237 and $ 535,838 for estimated future benefits payable by the Department as of September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, to eligible individuals under the Act through FY 2023. The estimated liability is ba sed on activity between FYs 2007 - 2012. Key factors in determining future liability are trends in the number of claims filed, trends in the percentage of claims adjudicated, and trends in the percentage of claims approved. The se estimates are then discounted in accordance with the discount rates set by the Office of Management and Budget. FY 2012 U. S.

Compensation Funds (continued) September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Title II of The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Zadroga Act) P.L. 111- 347, reactivates the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 and requires a Special Master, appointed by the Attorney General, to provide compensation to any individual (or a personal representative of a deceased individual) who suffered physical harm or was killed as a result of th e terrorist -related aircraft crashes of September 11, 2001, or the debris removal efforts that took place in the immediate aftermath of those crashes. The Zadroga Act amends the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act by among other things: Expanding the geographic zone recognized as a 9/11 crash site and providing greater consistency with the World Trade Center Health Program by adding additional forms of proof that may be used to establish eligibility. The Zadroga Act requires that the tota l amount of Federal funds paid for including compensation with respect to claims filed on or after October 3, 2011, will not exceed $2,775,000. Furthermore, the total amount of Federal funds expended during the period from October 3, 2011, through October 3, 2016, may not exceed $875,000. For fiscal year 2012, the Department of Justice received an appropriation of $200,000.

Both programs provide grants for the purposes of building and expanding correctional facilities and jails to increase secure confinement space for violent offenders and implementing correctional alternatives to reduce reliance on incarceration. VOI/TIS funds are available to any of the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and recognized Tribal governments; while CSCATL funds are available to tribes within the 50 states. The Tribal Law a nd Order Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-211) expanded the CSCATL grant program scope to include multi-purpose justice centers. The facilities built or expanded with these funds constitute non- federal physical property. Upon completion, the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of Interior, and/or tribal grantees are responsible for supporting, operating, and maintaining the correctional facilities. The CSCATL strategy broadly addresses tribal justice systems and lends support to tribes that: Are int erested in establishing/enhancing (tribal/non-tribal) multi-agency cooperation and collaborations; Are committed to conducting community -wide assessment for purpose of developing a comprehensive master plan that encompasses the design, use, capaci ty, and cost of adult and/or juvenile justice sanctions and services; Wish to explore an array of detention and correctional building options, including prototypical or quasi -prototypical concepts/designs for local correctional facilities, multipurpose justice centers, and regional facilities; and Are interested in lea rning about/applying community -based alternatives to help control and prevent jail overcrowding due to growing problems involving alcohol, substance abuse, and methamphetamine.

Two primary sources used to id entify these issues are the Department's OIG-identified Top Management and Performance Challenges and the Fe deral Managers' Financia l Integrity Act (FMFIA) assessment process. The challenges identified by the De partment's OIG are from an auditor's perspective and include areas of concern that bear significantly on how well the Department carries out its mission and meets its responsibilities as a steward of public funds. The FMFI A assessment process evalua tes the effectiveness of internal controls to support effective and efficient programmatic operations, reliabl e financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations (FMF IA \u00a7 2) and whether financial management systems conform to financial system requirements (FMFIA \u00a7 4). Presented on the following pages are the OIG-identified Top Management and Performance Challenges in the Department, Department mana gement's response to those challenges, and the Corrective Action Plan resulting from the FMFIA assessment. Section IV OverviewDepartment of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-2 This page intentionally left blank. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-3 Top Management and Performance Challenges in the Department of Justice November 7, 2012 MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL FROM: MICHAEL E. HOROWITZ INSPECTOR GENERAL SUBJECT: Top Management and Performance Challenges in the Department of Justice Attached to this memorandum is the Of fice of the Inspector General's (OIG) 2012 list of top management and performance challenges facing the Department of Justice (Department). We have prepared similar li sts since 1998. By statute this list is required to be included in the Departme nt's annual Performance and Accountability Report. The challenges are based on the OIG's oversight work, research, and judgment. While the challenges are not presented in priority order, we continue to believe that Safeguarding National Security presents the greatest challenge to the Department. We also have highlighted the many challenges the Department faces in enforcing federal law in a coordinated and effective fashion, and we again have highlighted the importance of Restoring Confidence in the Department , as recent events - most notably the events detailed in our August 2012 report on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' Operation Fast and Furious and Related Matters - have once more placed the Department's role as a custodian of the public's trust under intense scrutiny. In addition, we have posed many questions that go to the heart of the Department's structure and operations, such as whether the Department is adequately addressing the growing costs of the federal prison system, whether aspects of the Department's four law enforcement components could be further consolidated with each other, and whether the Department's operations duplicate similar efforts by other federal agencies. These questions are not new, but they take on new importance in this era of constrained budgets. Together, these issues pose a clear, if daunting, challenge: the Department must have in place an innovative and transparent strategic vision for how to fulfill its mission without requiring additional resources. We hope this document will assist th e Department in addressing its top management and performance challenges. We look forward to continuing to work with the Department to respond to these important issues. Attachment OIG Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-4 This page intentionally left blank. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-51. Safeguarding National Security: Terrorism remains a significant threat world-wide as the country moves into the second decade si nce the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In its latest \"Report on Terrorism,\" the National Counterterrorism Center identified more than 10,000 terrorist attacks world-wide during calendar year 2011, resulting in nearly 45,000 victims and over 12,500 deaths in 70 countries. Consequently, safeguarding national security has remained the Department of Justice's (DOJ or Department) highest priority and the focus of intensive resources: the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) alone de dicated approximately 4,200 of its approximately 13,000 special agents to investigate more than 33 ,000 national security cases in fiscal year (FY) 2011. The Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) overs ight has consistently demonstrated that the Department faces many challenges in its efforts to help protect the nation from attack. One such challenge is ensuring that national security inform ation is appropriately shared among Department components and the intelligence community so that r esponsible officials have the information they need to act in a timely and effective manner. Th e OIG is currently conducting numerous reviews in this area. For example, we are examining wh ether the FBI and National Security Division are appropriately handling and coordinating the Depart ment's responsibilities with regard to terrorist financing, a crucial component of the country's effo rts to disrupt terrorist organizations and prevent future attacks. The OIG is also continuing its oversight of in formation sharing and coordination among Department components with respect to watchlisting terrorists. For example, in audits conducted in 2008 and 2009, the OIG concluded that the FBI was not adding known or suspected terrorists to the Terrorist Watchlist maintained by the FBI's Terrorist Screen ing Center in a timely fashion and that it lacked effective procedures to ensure that names on the watchlist were updated or removed as required by law. We have initiated anothe r review to determine whether the FBI has made progress toward remedying these deficiencies. We are also reviewing the operations and functions of the FBI's Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force, an entity formed to provide information that helps keep foreign terrorists and their supporters out of the United States or leads to their removal, detention, prosecution, or other legal action. Our review is evaluating whether the FBI has implemente d a viable strategy to locate and track suspected terrorists and their supporters, including its effo rts to coordinate with law enforcement and intelligence agencies both inside and outside the De partment, and whether the FBI has appropriately managed terrorist-related informati on maintained by the task force. In addition to the challenges of information shari ng, the Department faces the challenge of ensuring the appropriate use of the tools available to its personnel responsible for monitoring and detecting national security risks and threats. The importance of this challenge was demonstrated in two prior OIG reviews assessing the FBI's use of national secu rity letters (NSL), which allow the government to obtain information such as telephone and financ ial records from third parties without a court order, but which are subject to legal requirements that protect fundamental civil liberties and privacy interests. These reviews found that the FBI had mi sused this authority by failing to comply with important legal requirements designed to protect civil liberties and privacy interests, and we therefore made recommendations to help remedy these failures. The FBI has implemented many of these recommendations and continues to make progr ess in implementing others. However, some recommendations remain outstanding. We are now conducting our third review of NSLs to assess the FBI's progress in responding to those recomme ndations and to evaluate the FBI's automated system for tracking NSL-related activities and ensu ring compliance with applicable laws. The review will also evaluate the FBI's use of two relate d national security tools: the authority to obtain business records pursuant to Section 215 of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act , and the Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-6 authority to use pen register and trap-and-trace devices under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Similarly, the OIG recently completed a review of the Department's use of Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act (FAA), which culminated in a classified report released to the Department and Congress. Section 702 confers authority to \"target persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States to acquire foreign intelligence in formation.\" As required by the FAA, the OIG examined the number of disseminated FBI inte lligence reports containing a reference to a U.S. person identity, the number of U.S. person id entities subsequently disseminated in response to requests for identities not referred to by name or title in the original reporting, the number of targets later determined to be located in the United Stat es, and whether communications of such targets were reviewed. The OIG also reviewed the FBI' s compliance with the required targeting and minimization procedures. 2. Enhancing Cyber Security: Computer systems that are in tegral to the infrastructure, economy, and defense of the United States face the constant and rapidly growing threat of cyber intrusion and attack, including the threat of cyber terrorism. According to recent statements by the Secretary of Defense, the United States is in creasingly vulnerable to foreign computer hackers seeking to launch cyber-attacks on critical national infrastructure. While the number of cyber security incidents directly affecting the Depart ment remains classified, a recent study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the number of such incidents reported by federal agencies increased by near ly 680 percent from 2006 to 2011. The Department will continue to face challenges as it seeks to pr event, deter, and respond to cyber security incidents - both those targeting its own networks and t hose that endanger the many privat e networks upon which the nation depends. The Department has identified the investigation of cyber crime and the protection of the nation's network infrastructure as one of its top prior ities. The Department's FY 2013 budget request highlights the increased resources sought for the Co mprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative, which is intended to combine the missions of various federal agencies to protect government computer systems and begin to address the protection of private sector systems, as well as for the FBI's cyber terrorism investigations and the forens ic examination of digital evidence. The budget request also seeks increased resources for the National Cyber Investiga tive Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), an FBI-led multi-agency task force to coordinate the counterintelligence, counterterrorism, intelligence, and law enforcemen t activities of its member organizations in response to cyber threats. In addition to funding increases, the Department has sought to strengthen cyber security by responding to recommendations made in OIG reports relating to cyber security. For example, in September 2011, the OIG released an audit report ex amining the operations of the Justice Security Operations Center (JSOC), which was established in 2007 to protect the Department's information technology systems from cyber intrusions, attacks, espionage, and other cyber incidents. The audit identified needed improvements to JSOC's activities, including its cooperati on and coordination with Department components and with the Department of Homeland Security's United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team. We made 20 recommend ations to improve JSOC's ability to report and manage information pertaining to cyber in cidents, and to enhance the effectiveness of coordination between JSOC and components a nd offices. The Department has implemented corrective action and closed 19 of the 20 recommenda tions. The Department has also implemented and closed all 10 recommendations in the OIG' s 2011 audit report assessing the NCIJTF and the capabilities of FBI field offices to investigate national security cyber intrusion cases. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-7However, the challenges posed by cyber crime multiply as cyber threats grow in number and complexity. Of central importance to any cyber secu rity strategy is working effectively with the private sector. The Department must not only encour age the private sector to invest in the security of its own networks, but it must also conduct aggr essive outreach to assure potential victims of cyber crime that proprietary network information disclo sed to law enforcement will not become public. Even a modest increase in the rate at which cyber crimes are reported would afford the Department invaluable opportunities to learn the newest t actics used by an unusually dynamic population of criminals and other adversaries, and to arrest and prosecute more perpetrators. Cyber intrusion and attack also pose risks to th e security of the Department's information, the continuity of its operations, and the effectiveness of its law enforcement and national security efforts, and the Department consequently faces the challe nge of protecting its own systems, including systems that protect its sensitive and classified in formation. Partly in response to the highly publicized 2010 incident in which an Army intellig ence analyst allegedly provided classified combat footage and hundreds of thousands of classified Stat e Department documents to a website devoted to publishing secret information, news leaks, a nd classified media from anonymous sources, the President issued an executive order requiring a go vernment-wide program for deterring, detecting, and mitigating insider threats. As a result, in March 2012 the Department established an Insider Threat Detection and Prevention Working Group. The Department plans to issue a strategy and guidance on how components should implement an insi der threat program and to provide training on insider threats. But more can be done. For example, the OIG annually conducts its Federal Information Security Management Act audits, which include testing the effec tiveness of information security policies, procedures, and practices of a representative subset of agency systems. The OIG recently reviewed the security programs and a selection of individual systems for six Department components: the FBI, Justice Management Division (JMD), Federal Bu reau of Prisons (BOP), U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), Criminal Division, and Tax Division. These audits identified deficiencies that included inadequate configuration management settings that expose workstations to cyber security threats; inadequate identification and authentication contro ls that increase the risk of inappropriate or unauthorized access to information systems; aud it and accountability controls that decrease the timely identification of operational problems and una uthorized activity; and inadequate contingency planning that increases the risk that information systems will not continue to operate during an emergency. In addition, the Civil Division has yet to complete corrective ac tions in response to the 2009 OIG audit report finding significant vulnerabiliti es in its laptop computer encryption policies and practices. The Department must strive not only to correct these deficiencies, but to avoid them in the first instance. 3. Managing the Federal Prison System: Housing a continually growing and aging population of federal inmates and detainees is consum ing an ever-larger portion of the Department's budget, making safe and secure incarceration increasingly difficult to provide, and threatening to force significant budgetary and programmatic cuts to other DOJ components in the near future. In FY 2006, there were 192,584 inmates in BOP cust ody. As of October 2012, the BOP reported 218,936 inmates in its custody, an increase of near ly 14 percent. Not surprisingly, these trends mirror the increased number of federal defe ndants sentenced each year, which rose from approximately 60,000 in FY 2001 to more than 86,000 in FY 2011, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. The Department's own budget reports demonstrate the fundamental financial challenges facing the Department. Fifteen years ago, the BOP's en acted budget was $3.1 billion, which represented approximately 16 percent of the De partment's budget. In comparison, the Department has requested Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-8 $6.8 billion for the BOP in FY 2013, or 26 percen t of the Department's total FY 2013 budget request. Moreover, the President's FY 2013 bud get projects the budget authority for federal correctional activities to rise to $7.4 billion by 2017. The Department has been aware for years of the problems that it is facing due to the rapidly expanding prison population. The Department first identified prison overcrowding as a programmatic material weakness in its FY 2006 Pe rformance and Accountability Report, and it has been similarly identified in every such report since. In fact, prison overcrowding was the Department's only identified material weakness in th is last year. To reduce overcrowding in existing federal prisons as the inmate population continues to grow, the BOP has contracted with private sector and state and local facilities to house certain groups of low-security inmates, and it recently purchased an existing state facility. The Departme nt also has expanded existing federal facilities, and the GAO recently reported that from FY 2006 through FY 2011 the BOP increased its rated capacity by approximately 8,300 beds as a result of opening 5 new facilities. Yet despite this increase in bed space since FY 2006, and despite the growth in BOP budget authority from approximately 22 percent of the DOJ budget in FY 2006 to the requested 26 percent in FY 2013, conditions in the federal prison system continued to decline. Since FY 2000, the BOP's inmate-to-staff ratio has increased from about four-t o-one to a projected five-to-one in FY 2013. Since FY 2006, federal prisons have moved from 36 percent over ra ted capacity to 39 percent over rated capacity in FY 2011, with medium security facilities currently operating at 47 percent over rated capacity and high security facilities operating at 52 percent over rated capacity. Moreover, the Department's own outlook for th e federal prison system is bleak: the BOP projects system-wide crowding to exceed 44 percent over rated capacity th rough 2018. In an era where the Department's overall budget is likely to remain flat or decline, it is readily apparent from these figures that the Department simply cannot solve this challenge by spending more money to operate more federal prisons unless it is prepared to make drastic cu ts to other important areas of the Department's operations. One approach the Department recently has embraced to reduce prison system costs is to focus on reducing recidivism. According to Department figur es, of the more than 45,000 federal offenders who leave prison every year and return to Amer ican communities, approximately 40 percent are rearrested or have their supervised release revoked within 3 years. The Deputy Attorney General has spoken about various alternatives to incarceration - including the Pretrial Alternatives to Detention Initiative in the Central District of Illinois, the Conviction and Sentence Alternative program in the Central District of California, and the BRIDGE program in the District of South Carolina. The Department also is pursuing legislative propo sals targeting the problem of recidivism. Recent proposals include the Federal Prisoner Recidivism Reduction Programming Enhancement Act , which would allow prisoners who successfully partic ipate in programs that have been demonstrated to reduce recidivism to earn up to 60 days per year of credit toward the completion of their sentences, and the Federal Prisoner Good Conduct Time Act , which would increase the amount of time a federal prisoner could earn for good behavior to reduce his or her sentence. The Department's efforts to develop new altern atives to incarceration also may help reduce overcrowding and costs. For example, it supporte d changes to the federal sentencing guidelines to permit drug or mental health treatment for certain low-level offenders to serve as an alternative to incarceration. It also revised the U.S. Attorneys' Manual regarding available alternatives to incarceration, such as pretrial diversion program s that offer addicted defendants treatment and monitoring instead of prosecution. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-9Additionally, the Department can make better use of existing programs to realize cost savings and reduce overcrowding. For example, in Decemb er 2011, the OIG reviewed the Department's International Prisoner Treaty Transfer Program, wh ich permits certain foreign national inmates from treaty nations to transfer to their home countri es to serve the remainder of their sentences. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 48 pe rcent of defendants sentenced in FY 2011 were non-U.S. citizens, up from 37 percent in FY 2006, an d the BOP reported that, as of August 2012, up to approximately 27 percent of federal inmates we re foreign nationals. Yet the OIG review found the BOP and the Criminal Division's International Prisoner Transfer Unit had rejected 97 percent of foreign national inmates' requests to transfer from FY 2005 through FY 2010, and in FY 2010, slightly less than 1 percent of the 40,651 foreign national inmates in the BOP's custody were transferred to their home countries to complete thei r sentences. While some factors that reduce the number of transfers are beyond the Department's c ontrol, the OIG found the Department could take steps to increase the number of inmates transfe rred and the timeliness of the process that would result in potentially significant savings. The Department is now implementing the OIG's 14 recommendations to manage the program more eff ectively. Similarly, the OIG is reviewing the BOP's implementation of its Compassionate Releas e Program, which allows the Department to release prisoners under extraordinary and co mpelling conditions, such as terminal illness. Importantly, the challenges facing the BOP and the Department are not limited to overcrowding and rapidly increasing costs. For example, the Depart ment bears the heavy responsibility of preventing the sexual abuse of inmates in BOP facilities and detainees in the custody of the USMS. The OIG raised concerns about this issue in a 2009 report on the Department's efforts to detect and deter staff sexual abuse of inmates in federal prisons, and the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA) required the Department to issue by June 2010 national standards to enhance the detection, prevention, reduction, and punishment of prison rape . The Department issued its final rule in May 2012, and the new rule is responsive to the con cerns we previously raised. However, the BOP's and USMS's implementation of the rule may pr ove challenging. Among other requirements, the new standards obligate agencies to include complianc e with PREA standards as a requirement in any new contract or contract renewal with outside entities, thus imposing new monitoring obligations on the BOP and USMS with respect to private contract facilities. The Department also faces challenges in mana ging its prisoner work program, Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI), a wholly owned federa l government corporation created by Congress that operates under the trade name UNICOR. As of September 2012, the FPI had closed 36 of 104 factories while opening only 13 new factories in the previous 5 years, resulting in an overall decrease in both the number of facilities and the nu mber of inmates working in FPI facilities. The FPI is currently employing only about 8 percent of work-eligible inmates, well below its goal of 25 percent. The OIG is reviewing the FPI's business management practices to determine what factors have led to the significant reduction of in mate work and the FPI's plans to maintain and create work opportunities for inmates. Also under re view are the FPI's management of its business operations, including development and significant cha nges to product offerings, and how the FPI is using new legislative authority that would allow it to grow its business and employ more inmates. 4. Leading the Department in an Era of Budget Constraints: The Department's mission has remained substantially unchanged since 2001, yet the budgetary environment in which the Department operates has changed dramatically. From FY 2001 through FY 2011, the Department's discretionary budget grew by more than 41 pe rcent in real dollars, from $20.4 billion to $28.9 billion. Yet the Department's discretionary budget decreased by more than 7 percent in FY 2012 to $26.8 billion, and its FY 2013 discre tionary budget request of $26.7 billion represents a further decrease from historical levels. With the President's budget for FY 2013 forecasting additional cuts to the overall Executive Branch di scretionary budgets in coming years, it appears Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-10 likely that Department leadership faces the signi ficant challenge of fulfilling the Department's mission without the assurance of increased resources. The Department has taken initial steps to reduce its budget. For example, the Attorney General issued a memorandum ordering a Department-w ide temporary hiring freeze and instructed components to limit travel, training, and conference spending. In February 2011, the Deputy Attorney General provided guidance for operational a nd programmatic efficiencies. The Department has implemented cost-saving initiatives relating to information technology expenditures, travel expenses, and time-and-attendance tracking. The Attorney General also created his Advisory Council for Savings and Efficiencies (SAVE Counc il) in 2010, which has taken such steps as eliminating the Drug Enforcement Administrati on's (DEA) Mobile Enforcement Teams, posting administrative notices on the forfeiture.gov website, consolidating Department offices, and merging JMD's strategic planning and management functions. With respect to the Department's budget request for FY 2013, the Department has proposed almost $700 million in efficiencies, offsets, and rescissi ons, representing approximately 2.6 percent of the Department's total budget. A pproximately $647 million of these cuts resulted from administrative efficiencies, non-grant program reductions, and resciss ions of prior year balances. However, the Department also has proposed approximately $228 million in FY 2013 program increases, including: $55 million for investigating and prosecuting fi nancial and mortgage fraud; $32 million for traditional missions (civil rights, cyber security, inte llectual property, transnational organized crime, and immigration services); and $141 million to ensure prisoners and detainees are confined in secure facilities and to improve federal prisoner reentry. As part of the effort to find operational efficien cies, the Department should redouble its efforts to adopt and implement OIG recommendations desi gned to reduce costs. We understand that corrective actions take time to implement, but as of September 2012, 819 OIG recommendations to the Department remained open, including many reco mmendations that could lead to substantial cost savings. Our FY 2012 audits and re lated single audits also identifie d $25 million in questioned costs that the Department should make every effort to resolve and, if necessary, recover. Additionally, various GAO reports have identified functions that the Department may wish to consolidate, such as the recent report recommending that the Departme nt consider combining its Asset Forfeiture Program with that of the Treasury Department. The Department must also focus on enhancing lo ng term planning for large information technology projects. For example, in January 2012, the OI G released a follow-up audit report examining the status of the Integrated Wireless Network program intended to address the Department's aging law enforcement communications systems, meet federa l law enforcement requirements to communicate across agencies, allow interoperability with stat e and local law enforcement partners, and meet mandates to use federal radio frequency spectrum more efficiently. Our previous audit had concluded that the program was at high risk of fa iling to secure an integrated wireless network for use by the Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Treasury Department. We found that by 2012, after spending more than $356 million over 10 years, the program had yet to achieve the results intended when the Department began developing it in 1998 due to inconsistent funding from Congress, the departure from the progr am of a major federal agency partner, and unforeseen changes in the technological environment. Similarly, our September 2012 audit report examining the FBI Laboratory's forensic DNA case backlog found that after spending $14 million since 2003 on two attempts to develop an informa tion management system, the FBI Laboratory did not have a system capable of electronically mana ging laboratory operations, and a new system was in the preliminary stages of development. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-11The Department should also contin ue to strengthen its efforts to collect criminal penalties, civil judgments, and other funds owed to the Department , while also ensuring that enforcement efforts across its components and sub-components remain e qually and appropriately vigorous. In FY 2011, the U.S. Attorneys' Offices collected $6.5 billion in criminal and civil actions - $2.7 billion in restitution, criminal fines, and felony assessment s, and $3.8 billion in in dividually and jointly handled civil actions - as well as an additional $1. 68 billion collected through asset forfeiture actions in partnership with other divisions and agenci es. However, at the end of FY 2011, the U.S. Attorneys' Offices reported an ending princi ple balance of nearly $75 billion relating to criminal and civil actions that remained uncoll ected. In addition, collection efforts may vary substantially among the U.S. Attorneys' Offices. For example, according to the United States Attorneys' Annual Statistical Report, a single office accounted for more than 68 percent of the approximately $1.5 billion recove red through civil asset forfeitures during FY 2011. Based on our review of Annual Statistical Reports for other fiscal years, this substantial variance does not appear to be anomalous. Leading the Department in this climate of budget constraints will require careful budget management and significant improvements to existing operations. Discrete operating efficiencies are unlikely to fully address the significant challenges of moving th e Department from an era of expanding budgets into an era of budget constraints without sacrificing its mission. It is therefore incumbent upon the Department to plot a new course for the current budgetary environment, one that streamlines the Department's operations while simultaneously taking on the mo st important and fundamental questions about how the Department is structured and run. 5. Protecting Civil Rights and Civil Liberties: Protecting civil rights and liberties requires that the Department ensure that it is respecting civ il liberties and properly enforcing civil rights laws. The Attorney General has stated that \"[s]afeguard ing the civil rights of every American is at the heart of what we do, and represents our core missi on.\" Yet this core mission remains a challenge in many respects. Emerging technology - and shifting rules relating to its use - poses one of the most difficult challenges to the Department's efforts to protect civ il rights and liberties, particularly when effective law enforcement techniques have the potential to encr oach on civil rights and liberties. For example, in January 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in United States v. Jones , in which it found that installing a global positioning system (G PS) tracking device on a surveillance target's vehicle constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendm ent. Overnight, the Court's ruling required prosecuting attorneys to exercise greater oversi ght of the use of GPS devices and necessitated updated guidance and training with respect to the use of such technology. Subsequently, in August 2012, a federal appeals court held in United States v. Skinner that users of cellular telephones do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the data emanating from a cell phone that show its location. Whether other federal appellate courts will reach the sa me conclusion cannot be known, thus adding further complexity and uncertainty to the rules governing law enforcement's use of emerging surveillance technologies. The Department will continue to face similar challenges as technologies evolve, and it must be prepared to adapt quickly to a fast-changing landscape of legal rules. Another emerging technology, unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, has already joined the arsenal of some U.S. law enforcement agencies, and the Federal Aviation Administration predicts that 30,000 drones will be used in the United States w ithin 20 years. Advances in drone technology represent an obvious opportunity for law enforcemen t, as drones can be equipped with facial or biometric recognition technology to identify and trac k individuals, and can even be recharged while in flight using a laser on the ground. The Depa rtment provides grant funds to state and local Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-12 governments to purchase equipment and technolog y that could be, and has been, used for surveillance drones. Yet drones also raise signi ficant privacy concerns, and there are several legislative proposals to improve the privacy safeguard s attached to their use. As the use of drones increases, the Department will face the challenge of monitoring the use of its grant money to ensure that drone technology purchased with federal funds is used in a manner consistent with applicable privacy and civil rights protections. Abolishing unlawful discrimination is one of the most important facets of the Department's civil rights and liberties mission. To that end, the Depa rtment's Civil Rights Division works to uphold the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans by enforcing federal statutes prohibiting improper discrimination with regard to criminal enforc ement, disability rights, educational opportunities, employment, and housing. To ensure that this important work is c onducted in an evenhanded manner, the OIG is conducting a review of the Civil Rights Division's Voting Section. Our review is examining the types of cases brought by the Voti ng Section and any changes in the types of cases over time; any changes in Voting Section enforcem ent policies or procedures over time; whether the Voting Section has enforced the civil rights laws in a non-discriminatory manner; and whether any Voting Section employees have been harassed for part icipating in the investigation or prosecution of particular matters. We are also investigating allegations that Voting S ection managers improperly took political affiliations into account in hiring late ral attorneys and gave preferential treatment to political allies in responding to FOIA requests. Finally, the OIG's recent investigation into the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives' (ATF) Operation Fast and Furious rai sed concerns about the approval process involving one of the Department's most intrusive investigat ory tools, the wiretap. During our review, we determined that at least three of the five De puty Assistant Attorneys General who reviewed the wiretap applications regularly relied on summa ry memoranda provided by subordinates when approving such applications rather than undert aking a personal review of the applications themselves. Given the significant intrusion on in dividual liberties that occurs following the approval of a wiretap application, as well as the substantial limitations that Congress placed on the approval of a wiretap, we concluded that the Department n eeded to strengthen its approval process and made a recommendation for it to do so. 6. Restoring Confidence: The Department must address several substantial challenges to ensure that it strengthens and maintains the public's trust in its fairness, integrity, and efficiency. Inadequate management and oversight of la w enforcement activities undermine confidence in Department operations. Over the past year, si gnificant public attention has focused on ATF investigations that permitted \"gun walking.\" The OIG's review of ATF's Operations Wide Receiver and Fast and Furious revealed that ATF and the U. S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona did not manage these investigations responsibly and that hundreds of firearms that ATF agents could and should have interdicted ende d up at multiple crime scenes in the United States and Mexico, including the scene of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent's murder. The OIG determined that the investigations were plagued by several systemic problems, including inadequate attention to public safety, a lack of sufficient supervisory controls and oversight from ATF Headquarters, inappropriate use of cooperati ng federal firearms licensees as informants, and a failure to coordinate with other law enforcemen t agencies. In addition, the OIG found that the Department responded to a congressional inquiry about ATF firearms trafficking investigations with inaccurate information. Such incidents seriously tarnish the Department's reputation and greatly enhance the need to focus on restoring the public's confidence in the Department as an organization capable of protecting public safety. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-13 The Department also faces challenges with respect to ensuring the fairness of its prosecutions, an issue that was the focus of recent Senate and House Judiciary Committee hearings on discovery concerns arising out of the failed prosecution of fo rmer Senator Ted Stevens. To achieve this goal, the Department must be able to conduct fair, objec tive, and accountable reviews of the conduct of its lawyers and other professionals, and to mete out appropriate discipline when it finds misconduct. In our management challenges reports in prior years, the OIG has outlined concerns about the Department's disciplinary efforts. For example, the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), by statute, has jurisdiction to investigate allegations of misconduct against Department attorneys acting in their capacity as lawy ers. The OIG has long questioned this role for OPR because OPR is managed as a component of th e Department, has no institutional independence, and lacks transparency insofar as it does not regular ly release its reports and conclusions to the public. It is therefore unduly difficult - if not im possible - for the public to assess the consistency of OPR's findings and conclusions. The credibility of the Department's disciplinary decisions is inevitably reduced when the responsible components operate under the direction of the Department's senior leadership and withou t appropriate transparency. Additionally, the OIG is examining the eff ectiveness of the discipline system used by U.S. Attorneys' Offices and the Executive Office fo r U.S. Attorneys when investigating allegations of employee misconduct. This review is the sixth OIG review since 2001 to assess a component's disciplinary system. Previous OIG evaluations examined the disciplinary systems of the USMS, BOP, DEA, ATF, and FBI and made many reco mmendations to these components, including a still- open recommendation from 2004 that the BOP develop procedures to ensure that discipline is imposed consistently throughout the agency. Bu t the Department faces a broader challenge than simply ensuring that individual components maintain internally consistent and effective disciplinary system: it must also ensure that disciplinary pro cedures remain consistent across components so that all of the Department's employees, attorneys and n on-attorneys alike, are held to the same tough but fair standards. The Department also faces challenges with respect to ensuring the integrity of its hiring processes. In July 2012, the OIG issued a report finding that eight current or former JMD officials - many holding senior positions - violated applicable statut es and regulations in seeking the appointment of their relatives to positions within JMD. The OI G also found that a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in JMD responded inadequately to warnin g signs she received concerning the hiring of relatives of JMD employees. The 2012 OIG report marks the third OIG investigation in the last 8 years involving improper hiring practices within JMD, suggesting that prior management efforts to correct hiring practices in JMD have been inadequate . Adherence to fundamental federal hiring laws and regulations must be enforced to restore conf idence in the fairness of the Department's hiring processes and the integrity of its operations. The Department must also restore the public's conf idence that the FBI Laboratory is using forensic techniques in accordance with strict protocols to ensure unbiased, objective, and reliable results. Between 1996 and 2 004, a Department task force review ed thousands of past prosecutions potentially affected by 13 FBI Laboratory employ ees whom the OIG criticized in an April 1997 report concerning the FBI Laboratory. The t ask force identified and referred many cases for independent scientific review. Th is review involved an examinatio n of available lab reports, bench notes, and trial testimony; it did not include a re-examination of the original evidence. The task force then provided the results of these reviews to prosecutors who, in turn, were responsible for determining whether to disclose the material to the defendants pursuant to laws requiring the disclosure of exculpatory evidence. However, th e task force never published a complete accounting Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-14 of the results of its review or the prosecutors' disclosures. At Congress's request, the OIG recently initiated a review of the task force's activities, processes, and decisions. Since the initiation of the OIG's current review of this matter, the FBI, in cooperation with the Department and the Innocence Project, announced that it will conduct a separate and new review of all case files involving FBI Laboratory hair and fiber examiners. The Department's handling and use of informants also has affected the public's confidence in the Department. Among the most notable incidents was the FBI's failure to properly supervise Special Agent John Connolly, Jr.'s dealings with organi zed crime figures James \"Whitey\" Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. More recently, a former FBI agen t, Adrian Busby, was convicted of making false statements when he lied to his supervisors a nd the OIG about his relationship with a female informant. The OIG's investigation determined th at, after the informant came under investigation, Busby provided the informant and her defense attorn ey with copies of confidential FBI and Internal Revenue Service reports of interviews and also e ngaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with the informant. Busby was sentenced to 1 year and 1 day for his crimes. Separately, the OIG found that ATF agents in both Operation Wide Rece iver and Operation Fast and Furious used the substantial cooperation of federal firearms licensees to advance their investigations, creating at least the appearance that ATF agents approved or encour aged sales of firearms they knew were unlawful and did not intend to seize. In light of these misst eps, the Department must focus its attention on ensuring the appropriate handling and use of informants. The Department also must ensure the transparency of its operations. An important aspect of this effort is to avoid over-classifying its national secu rity information, which can inhibit information sharing, increase the cost of information secu rity, and unnecessarily limit the public's access to information. As required by the Reducing Over-Classification Act , the OIG is conducting a review to assess whether applicable classification policies, procedures, rules, and regulations have been adopted, followed, and effectively administered, and to identify whether any of these rules and practices may contribute to misclassificat ion of Department information. The Department also has received criticism for its responses to requests for information pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The Department has made progress in this regard, most notably by issuing a memorandum from the Attorn ey General in 2009 encouraging federal agencies to make discretionary disclosures of informati on and by launching www.FO IA.gov in 2011 to make data from agencies' annual FOIA reports more acces sible and useful. Nevertheless, with roughly 60,000 FOIA requests handled in a decentralized fashion by 34 separate FOIA offices and the equivalent of 528 full-time FOIA employees, the Department faces a continuing challenge in ensuring that its own FOIA responses are consiste nt with each other and with the presumption of disclosure articulated the Attorney General's memora ndum. In addition, as part of its review of the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division, the OI G is investigating allegations that Department personnel gave preferential treatment to politi cal allies in responding to FOIA requests. Finally, the Department must encourage its empl oyees to come forward and report information about waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in the De partment's operations and functions. Further, the Department must be committed to protecting th e legal rights of those employees who do come forward. Whistleblowers play a crucial role in uncovering waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement, yet they are too often subject to retaliation for their disclosures. The OIG has conducted numerous investigations into allegations of retaliation, and we recently appointed an OIG Whistleblower Ombudsperson responsible for, among other things, ensu ring that complaints of retaliation within the OIG's jurisdiction are reviewed and addressed in a prompt and thorough manner, and for communicating with whistleblowers about the status and resolution of such complaints. The OIG will continue to monitor this important issue. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-15 7. Coordinating Among Law Enforcement Agencies: Law enforcement represents a central element of the Department's mission, yet the ability and willingness of Department components to coordinate and share intelligence, resources, and personnel with one another and other law enforcement agencies has historica lly posed a significant challenge. One cause of this challenge is the confusi on created when components have overlapping jurisdictions. The Department has four primary law enforcement agencies - the FBI, DEA, ATF, and USMS - yet these components' jurisdictions are not exclusive. For example, whereas the FBI may investigate all federal crimes and instances of terrorism, other agencies possess simultaneous jurisdiction to enforce specific criminal laws that necessarily overlap, such as the DEA's investigations of federal drug cases or ATF's inves tigations of federal firearms cases. The OIG highlighted this issue in its October 2009 repor t detailing coordination problems between ATF and the FBI in explosives investigations and ma de 15 recommendations to assist in improving coordination and reducing conflic t between the FBI and ATF on explosives investigations and associated support activities. Five of these recommendations remain open, including our recommendation that the FBI and ATF develop certa in protocols on joint investigations for explosives incidents. More recen tly, an April 2011 GAO report, entitled Law Enforcement Coordination: DOJ Could Improve Its Pro cess for Identifying Disagreements Among Agents , described similar coordination problems that exist out side of the realm of explosives investigations. Some overlap between these four components is una voidable and may even help ensure proper law enforcement focus and attention. However, th e Department should clarify the jurisdictional boundaries of each wherever possible. It may also benefit from considering whether consolidation of any operational functions or administrative f unctions, such as information technology, human resources, budgeting, and records management, c ould yield operational benefits, improve law enforcement safety, or save costs. Similarly, th e Department should consider ways to increase the sharing of lessons learned and best pr actices among law enforcement components. In the same vein, the Department should consider whether its law enforcement components have the proper level of consistency in their standard pr ocedures, protocols, and manuals; where there are differences, the Department should consider whether they are justified. While the Department's law enforcement components generally adhere to Atto rney's General Guidelines and policies for law enforcement activities, specific protocols and proced ures for particular investigative techniques often vary from component to component. In particul ar, our review of new policies ATF implemented after Operation Fast and Furious underscored the ag ency's delay in completing its integration into the Department and in implementing controls to protect the public that were used in other Department law enforcement components. For ex ample, we found that ATF had not until recently used review committees to evaluate either its unde rcover operations or its use of high-level and long-term confidential informants. We also expr essed concern that ATF and the Department had not devoted sufficient attention to ensuring that ATF's policies scrupulously adhered to requirements found in the Attorney General' s Guidelines and other Department policies, including ATF's confidential informant policies, which were not revised to conform to the Attorney General's Guidelines Regarding the Use of Confidential In formants until 8 years after ATF joined the Department. We therefore believe that Depart ment-led, cross-component assessments designed to compare the law enforcement components' polic ies could identify opportunities for improvements that would make the Department's law enforcem ent operations more cons istent and efficient. Finally, opportunities may exist for the Department to better coordinate the collection and sharing of information used in law enforcement investigations . The OIG is reviewing one such effort already under way, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) Fusion Center, an Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-16 intelligence and data center for drug and drug -related financial intelligence information from numerous member agencies and other sources, including the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Our revi ew is assessing the timeliness and value of the fusion center's analytical products and information sharing procedures. 8. Enforcing Against Fraud and Financial Offenses: The Department has long played an important role in preventing and reducing fraud and fi nancial crimes, but rarely in the Department's history has this role received as much attention - or as many resources - as in the past few years. From FY 2009 to FY 2011, with the country struggling to recover from the collapse of its housing market, the FBI received approximately $196 milli on from Congress to fund 156 new agents and 256 new non-agent positions devoted to combating mort gage fraud. During this same time period, the U.S. Attorneys received an additional $19.9 m illion in financial fraud funding, enough to fund 95 new attorney positions and 26 new non-atto rney positions; the Criminal Division received $1.8 million in financial fraud funding for 5 ne w attorney positions and 2 new non-attorney positions; and the Civil Division received $10 million in financial rescue funding for 87 new attorney positions and 31 new non-attorney positions. Th e Department also requested an additional $55 million for FY 2013 to fund 328 new positions , including 40 FBI agents, 184 attorneys, 49 in-house investigators, 31 forensic accountants, and other administrative support, all to support the Department's efforts to inves tigate and prosecute financial fraud. Resources alone, however, are not sufficient to address the problem of fraud and financial crime; the Department must also make the most of the tools and resources it has at its disposal. Prosecution and civil litigation are among the most important of those tools. For example, in September 2012, the Department announced that its total recoveries in False Claims Act cases since January 2009 exceeded $13 billion, of which $9.3 billion was r ecovered in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs. Many of those cases were th e result of disclosures by whistleblowers, starkly demonstrating the importance of encouraging government employees to come forward with information about waste, fraud, abuse, and misman agement. The Department should continue to strive to maximize such recoveries. The Department has particularly targeted the prob lem of mortgage fraud. The Department reported in June 2012 a 92-percent increase in mortgage fraud prosecutions across the nation since FY 2009, and in February 2012, the Attorn ey General announced a $25 billion se ttlement with the nation's five largest mortgage servicers to address misconduct by the banks in bankruptcy cases involving inflated or inaccurate claims, improper accounting of mortga ge payments, adding improper fees and charges to mortgage accounts, charging hidden fees to mort gage accounts, and other similar activities. The OIG is conducting an audit of the Department's st rategy and approach to address mortgage fraud. Another tool in the fight against fraud and financia l crime is the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF), an interagency working group estab lished by the President in November 2009 and led by the Attorney General. With more than 20 federal agencies, 94 U.S. Attorneys' Offices, and state and local partners, the FFETF provides an unus ual opportunity for a coordinated approach to the complex problem of fraud and financial crime. At the same time, an interagency effort of this scope also presents the significant challenge of c oordinating these agencies' enforcement efforts, and the FFETF therefore requires strong leadership from the Department. Yet the FFETF is currently operating without an overall strategic plan that ou tlines its goals for preventing fraud and identifies how the effectiveness of the task force's efforts is to be measure d. Nor has the FFETF published an annual report since 2010, its first year. We be lieve the FFETF has the opportunity to be more effective by uniting its members behind clear goals and by improving the accountability and transparency of its operations. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-17 The Department has also prioritized the investig ation of Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) fraud. The President, in his January 2012 State of the Union address, announced the creation of what became known as the Residentia l Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group. The working group is intended to be a collabor ative effort to investigate RMBS misconduct by looking for evidence of false or misleading statements, deception, or other misconduct by market participants in the creation, packaging, and sale of mortgage-backed securities. However, current budget uncertainties and the possibility of future bu dget constraints could cause future managerial challenges for the Department in fighting this area of financial fraud. In addition, the Department must fight financial fraud both before and after it occurs. For example, the Department can use the suspension and debarm ent of individuals or entities to protect the government's financial interest from unethical, dis honest, or otherwise irresponsible entities and to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in federal programs. Suspension and debarment decisions are made either administratively through agency suspending and debarring officials or statutorily as a result of convictions for qualifying offenses. In June 2012, the OIG completed an audit of the Department's implementation and oversight of statutory debarment activities from FY 2005 through FY 2010. Overall, the OIG found that the Department had not established an adequate system to ensure that it fulfills its responsibilities related to statutory debarm ent, creating the possibility that federal funding could be inadvertently and inappropriately aw arded to excluded individuals. The OIG made 21 recommendations to the Department and its comp onents to improve the effectiveness of statutory debarment programs, including recommending th e development of additional policies and procedures to improve the completeness and accu racy of the reporting of debarment actions. The Department also uses its Asset Forfeiture Pr ogram to confiscate both the means to commit and the proceeds of criminal activity. For FY 2011, th e Department reported to Congress that it disposed of forfeited property valued at over $1.6 billion us ing methods such as liquidation and retention for official use. However, the Department may benefit from seeking greater interagency efficiency in its asset forfeiture efforts, as a recent GAO report conc luded that there may be overlap between the asset management activities and the information t echnology infrastructures of the Department's Asset Forfeiture Program and the Treasury Department's similar Asset Forfeiture Fund. The Department may wish to consider studying the feasi bility of consolidating or better coordinating the administrative structure of its asset forfeiture pr ogram with that of the Treasury Department. 9. Administering Grants and Contracts: The Department's management of grants and contracts has long presented a challenge by virtue of the large amounts of money at stake. From FY 2008 through FY 2011 the De partment awarded approximate ly $15 billion in grants and $27 billion in contracts, and it awarded another appr oximately $1 billion in grants and $6 billion in contracts in FY 2012. Appropriate administration of public funds must always be a priority, but in this climate of constrained budgets, the use of billions of taxpayer dollars requires particular attention from Department management. Grants The OIG has previously noted the Department's demonstrated commitment to, and significant improvements in, the area of grant management . While we acknowledge the Department's continued efforts in this regard, we also be lieve that both challenges and opportunities for improvement remain. The Department maintains three grantmaking com ponents: the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-18 This division of responsibility creates the challenge of ensuring that there is proper coordination of, and clear strategic vision for, its overall grantmak ing efforts, and that those overall efforts are consistent with the priorities of the Department 's non-grantmaking components. Prior OIG reports have found that improvements could be realized, part icularly with regard to reducing duplication. For example, while OVW has in the past required its grant recipients to use the OJP financial guide, OVW has recently released its own financial guide . OVW grantees who also receive OJP grants therefore must often follow two different sets of rules, thereby increasing the risk of waste and noncompliance. A recent GAO report raised similar concerns, noting that COPS uses a different grant management system than OVW and OJP, th ereby limiting the Department's ability to share information on the funding its components have awarde d or are preparing to award. The Department should seek to consolidate the common functions of these three grantmaking components to increase coordination and save costs while maintaining key se parate practices for meeting individual statutory requirements and fulfilling the missions of each office. In addition to increased coordination, the Departme nt should ensure that grants are achieving the intended results. The Department presented sever al outcome-oriented performance measures in its FY 2011 Performance and Accountability Report (PAR) that related to grants, yet many of those measures did not adequately measure the total return on investment a grant award has achieved. For example, the PAR included a measure of the percen t reduction in DNA backlog, but it did not report the amount of resources used to achieve that reduc tion - a crucial element in any assessment of the success of DNA backlog-related grantmaking. Us ing performance measures that provide adequate information to evaluate not only the benefits ach ieved through the grantmaking process but also the investment required will help the Department improve the efficiency of its grantmaking and allow it to use its limited resources where they will be most useful. Once grant funds are disbursed, the Department relies on thousands of governmental and non- governmental grant recipients to appropriately mana ge the billions of dollars of awards. It is imperative that the Department diligently oversee th ose recipients and provide them with tools to help ensure that grant terms and conditions are fo llowed. Several such efforts are under way at the Department. For example, in September 2011, repr esentatives from the Civil Division, the Antitrust Division, and the OIG, in cooperation with the De partment's National Advocacy Center, produced a grant fraud training video for federal prosecutors a nd other government atto rneys. In March 2012 the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force's Recovery Act, Procurement, and Grant Fraud Working Group, which includes the OIG, released a training framework for reducing grant fraud risk. The Department also developed and impl emented a Grant Financial Management Online Training program complete with test questions to help support grant recipient compliance with rules and regulation. Yet not all of these training programs are required for all Department grant recipients, and as demonstrated by the $22 milli on in questioned costs reported in FY 2012 OIG grant and contract audits as well as related singl e audits, grant management and the oversight of grantee expenditures continue to be si gnificant challenges for the Department. Contracts The Department spends more on contracts for goods and services each year than on grants. Some of the largest of these contracts are related to th e planning, implementation, and management of complex information technology systems. For exampl e, the Department awarded a contract of up to $512 million over 7 years to provide manage d information technology services and secure technology solutions to ATF and the USMS. The Department's FY 2012 projections also included spending $220 million for the FBI's Next Generation Identification project to share fingerprint and other biometric information, $87 million for JM D's Law Enforcement Wireless Communications program, and $84 million for a Department-wide Un ified Financial Management System, all under Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-19Department-awarded contracts. In total, the Department awarded nearly $3 billion in contract funds on information technology in FY 2012. The OIG's audits and reviews of Department pr ograms have found instances of wasteful and poorly managed expenditures on informati on technology. For example, and as described above, the OIG's September 2012 audit of the FBI Laboratory's fo rensic DNA case backlog determined that two attempts and a combined $14 million since 2003 had failed to yield a system capable of electronically managing laboratory operations, a nd a new system is now in development. Additionally, the OIG's September 2012 interim re port on the FBI's implementation of Sentinel, an investigative and case management system, found that the FBI deployed the system after taking over management of the project from a contractor. However, we found that the system was deployed behind schedule and did not provide all of the origin ally planned capabilities. We also found that although the FBI's $441 million cost estimate is $10 m illion less than the latest Sentinel budget, the estimate did not include originally planned operati ons and maintenance costs for the next 2 years, which the FBI estimated to be $30 million annually. Moreover, the FBI did not adjust its cost baseline when it transferred requirements to other FBI information systems. The Department must ensure that there is adequate management and oversight of information technology contracts to minimize cost overruns and provide planned system functionality. Finally, the Department must ensure that it uses all the tools at its disposal to avoid awarding contracts to recipients who are likely to waste, em bezzle, or mismanage the funds. For example, the Department should use suspension and debarment, de scribed in detail above, to the fullest extent possible to protect the government's financial in terest from unethical, dishonest, or otherwise irresponsible entities, and to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs. 10. Ensuring Effective International Law Enforcement: According to the Administration's July 2011 Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime , \"[t]ransnational organized crime poses a significant and growing threat to national a nd international security, with dire implications for public safety, public health, democratic ins titutions, and economic stability across the globe.\" Moreover, transnational crime is no longer lim ited to organized crime. New communications technologies, the global banking system, and porous borders in international conflict zones have increasingly allowed criminals involved in terrori sm, money laundering, gun trafficking, human trafficking, and myriad other crimes to operate internationally, thus creating new and daunting challenges for the Department's inte rnational law enforcement efforts. In an effort to address this issue, the DEA, FBI, ATF, USMS, and the Department's Office of International Affairs (OIA) ha ve stationed personnel abroad who work with their foreign counterparts to investigate and prosecute violations of U.S. law, and to provide reciprocal assistance to their foreign counterparts. The DEA maintain s the Department's largest international presence with more than 1,000 full-time employees devoted to international operations in 65 countries. The DEA requested an international enforcement budget of more than $400 million in FY 2013. The FBI's international presence is also substantial, with 61 legal attach\u00e9s, 14 sub-offices, and 287 authorized positions in 66 countries during FY 2012. Devoting resources to transnational law enforcem ent efforts will not be enough: these resources must also be well managed, coordinated with each other, and coordinated with both domestic and foreign law enforcement organizations. Meeti ng these challenges requires putting frameworks in place to support international inves tigations before they begin, including clear lines of investigative authority among law enforcement agencies, appropr iate mechanisms to share information, and appropriate and consistent trai ning of all personnel involved in international operations. For example, the Department, and in particular the OI A, works to advance the government's interests in Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-20 extraditing defendants from abroad and in obtaining critical information through Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) requests and other means. Yet with many countries, the United States does not have effective legal mechanisms to perm it the exchange of defendants or information. Ensuring that these mechanisms are in place - including bilateral and multilateral treaties, memoranda of understanding with foreign counterpart law enfo rcement agencies, and other agreements - will greatly enhance the Department 's ability to fight crime at home and abroad. International law enforcement operations also requi re robust supervision and oversight. The OIG's recently released report on ATF's Operation Fast a nd Furious vividly demonstrated the importance of this challenge - and the serious pitfalls and potential threats to public safety that await when law enforcement efforts fall short. Our report examined ATF's Operation Wide Receiver, an investigation conducted in 2006 and 2007, focusing on straw purchasers of firearms that were later transferred to Mexico. The primary goal of the operation was to allow straw purchases to continue in order to identify and prosecute members of the fir earms trafficking organization. In service of that goal, ATF agents did not arrest the primary subjects involved in straw purchasing and seized less than a quarter of the more than 400 firearms purchased. ATF also worked with Mexican law enforcement to attempt failed surveillance opera tions of cross-border firearms shipments and developed a \"cooperative agreement\" with its Mexican counterparts. Yet ATF Headquarters neither vetted nor approved these joint efforts with Mexico, and we found no evidence that senior leaders in the Department had knowledge of Operation Wi de Receiver until 2009. That a single ATF field office could have conducted this in vestigation without more oversight illustrates the shortcomings of ATF's case initiation and monitoring processes. In addition to robust partnerships with foreign allies, effective and efficient international law enforcement requires cooperation and coordination w ith other federal agencies. For example, our examination of Operation Fast and Furious rai sed questions about how information was shared among various offices of ATF, the DEA, and the FBI. We also saw coordination and information sharing issues between ATF and U.S. Immigrati ons and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a component of the Department of Homeland Security. Our report noted instances where ATF resisted ICE conducting any independent or coordinated investiga tions that were related to Operation Fast and Furious through recovered firearms. In light of ICE's jurisdiction over export violations involving munitions and firearms, close coordination with ICE was essential in an investigation that purported to target a cartel in Mexico and had as a goal id entifying the border crossing mechanism the cartel was using to obtain firearms from the United States. The need for cooperation among federal agencies in th e context of international law enforcement is not limited to investigative entities. In March 2012, the OIG released a report on the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) and the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) offices in the Criminal Division that assist foreign prosecutors, law enforcement ag encies, and governments to develop effective mechanisms to combat criminal conduct around the world. We found that while OPDAT's and ICITAP's relationships with most of their partne r agencies were productive, their relationships with their primary funder, the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, warranted significant improvement during ou r review period. These strained relationships compromised OPDAT's and ICITAP's ability to make long-term international program plans and personnel retention decisions prior to 2012. Althou gh the Department stated at the time of our report that these relationships had greatly improved, th e inefficiencies we identified underscore the importance of working collaboratively with other federal agencies to address the growing challenge of international crime. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-21 MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT ON THE TOP MANAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE CHALLENGES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FY 2012 The Department of Justice (the Department, DOJ) is th e world's largest law office and the central agency for enforcement of federal laws. Its mission a nd responsibilities extend over the broad spectrum of American life. The Department appreciates the Office of the Inspector General's (OIG) recognition of its progress in addressing management and performance ch allenges facing this diverse institution. The Department's progress is an indication of agreement with the categories of top challenges in the OIG's report and represents the Department's commitment to prioritize and address these areas. 1 Safeguarding National Security The Attorney General has said, \"First and foremost: we will protect Americans from terrorism and other threats to national security - both at home and abroad .\" He has pledged to use every available and appropriate tool to obstruct terrorists at all stag es of their actions around the world and in the United States. To address the challenge of ensuring that national security information is appropriately shared among Department components and the Intelligence Community (IC), the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) coordinate with law enforcement across multiple jurisdictions. These Task Forces combine the resources of the FBI, th e IC, state and local officers, and the military, and serve as a coordinating mechanism to investigate and sh are information regarding terrorism activity. In support of these efforts the FBI developed eGuardian to meet the challenges of collecting and sharing terrorism-related information. The eGuardian syst em serves as a single information repository for suspicious activity and is accessible to thousands of law enforcement personnel. Information captured in eGuardian is migrated to FBI internal systems and assigned to the appropriate JTTF for further investigation. The Terrorist Watchlist maintained by the FBI's Te rrorist Screening Center (TSC) is a database of identifying information about those kno wn or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity. The Department is pleased that, to date, the OI G has closed 20 out of 23 recommendations stemming from its two watchlist reports. Currently, the OI G is assessing the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of watchlisting practices, including nomin ations, modifications, and removals. The FBI's Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force ( FTTTF) partners with other government agencies to obtain data, conduct analyses, and provide investigativ e information to assist these agencies in detecting foreign national security threats. The FBI has impl emented a strategy that provides significant value by performing in-depth analyses that proactively iden tify national security threats and assist ongoing national security investigations. Another tool that the Department employs is nationa l security letters (NSL). The Department is pleased that the OIG recognizes the FBI's progress in its use of NSLs while adhering to the legal requirements that protect civil liberties and privacy interests. Th e Department looks forward to the OIG's feedback to resolve the outstanding recommendations, many of which are part of the current USA Patriot Act Review. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-22 2 Enhancing Cyber Security The Department is keenly aware of the scope of cybersecurity threats and is collaborating with interagency partners and buildin g relationships with private sector allies to address them. There is recent evidence that these threats are growing, and leaders of the IC have assessed that the threat of cyber-based terrorism, cyber-based espionage, a nd other state-sponsored cyber intrusions may eventually surpass that of terrorism generally. These threats present complex technical, legal, and jurisdictional challenges. They demand an all-tools response - including the use of the Department's law enforcement and intelligence capabilities. The Department addresses cybersecurity threats in two capacities: first, as an agency responsible for detecting, disrupting, and deterring cyber threats, and second, as a government entity that is a potential target of cyber threats. DOJ has a primary role in domestic cyber incident response, and DOJ components are taking steps to improve their respective cyber security activities and to expand cross-component coordination of the Department's cybersecurity effort s. The principal components that investigate or conduct operational cybersecurity activities (the FB I, the Criminal Division (CRM), and the National Security Division (NSD)) each have active and ongoi ng outreach efforts to increase the private sector's awareness of these threats and to encourage the reporti ng of cyber incidents. The FBI, NSD, CRM, and the U.S. Attorneys' Offices (USAOs) also are increa sing the use of prosecutorial tools against cyber threats to the national security. In addition to bringing pr osecutions against domestic criminal actors, the FBI, CRM, NSD, and over 200 Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (CHIP) coordinators in USAOs around the country have continued to develop innovative means to disrupt, deter, and prosecute online criminal behavior, including through the use of civil tools and criminal forfeiture. For their part, the CHIP coordinators in each USAO have not only focused their efforts on pr osecuting computer crime and intellectual property offenses, they also (1) serve as the district's legal counsel on matters relating to those offenses and the collection of electronic or digital evidence; (2) tr ain prosecutors and law enforcement personnel in the region; and (3) conduct public and industry outreach a nd awareness activities. In addition, over the past year, departmental components have continued robust international out reach to ensure that DOJ's law enforcement partners abroad have the capacity to ad dress computer crime within their countries, including by extraditing to the United States individuals involved in data breaches and other computer crimes. Additionally, the Department has been at the forefr ont of addressing the information sharing and public- private sector cooperation necessary to secure and protect critical networks. The Department was integral in developing the Administration's proposed cybersecuri ty bill that would enhance information sharing in both directions between the federa l government and the private sector, giving the private sector better information to direct its investments in security and enhance its defense against criminals and other threats to computer systems and information. As noted in the OIG report, the Department's ability to achieve its strategic goa ls depends heavily on its ability to collect, process, manage, analyze, and shar e information. To meet mission investigative and information sharing requirements, DOJ's agents, a ttorneys, and analysts are increasingly reliant on connectivity to the Internet, to other DOJ component s, and to multiple levels of government. This connectivity level increases the exposure of DOJ syst ems to disruption from cyber threats and attacks. DOJ strives to stay abreast of cybersecurity issues and improve the protection of its critical systems and information from attack and compromise. The De partment developed a co mprehensive continuous monitoring program that enables all components and th e Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) to achieve near real time awareness on the security posture of its more than 230,000 information technology (IT) endpoint assets. In addition, the Depa rtment operates a 24/7 Security Operations Center Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-23that monitors cyber threats and protects Department IT systems from cyber intrusions, attacks, espionage, and other cyber incidents. Regarding the remaini ng findings on contingency planning, identification and authentication, and audit and accountability controls, the Department developed rigorous plans of action and milestones for FY 2013 to help DOJ co mponents correct these areas of weakness. The Department has taken a leadership role to address the five classified information safeguarding priority areas identified by the Senior Informati on Sharing and Safeguarding Steering Committee. The Department OCIO worked closely with the FBI to cons olidate DOJ classified circuits, with the results of significant security enhancements and cost savings. As noted in the report, the Department worked quickly to establish an Insider Threat Working Gr oup comprised of components that access and process classified information. The Working Group has drafted Department policy, currently in final review, that establishes a Departmentwide insider threat detecti on and prevention program. This program, in addition to technology investments in the areas of ente rprise audit, identity and access management, and removable media controls, will greatly reduce the risk of classified data loss within the Department. DOJ's strategic security planning includes improveme nts in configuration management, identity and access management, security monitoring, auditing, al erting, and contingency planning. All of these enhancements leverage pr evious investments in security infrastructure and resources that form a strong foundation upon which the Department will continue to improve and respond to new and emerging cyber threats. With regard to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) audits cited by the OIG, the Civil Division has fully implemented all seven of the OIG recommendations w ith respect to DOJ-owned equipment and equipment owned by most contractors, which comprise the vast majority of portable equipment potentially housing DOJ data. OIG has mark ed four of the seven recommendations \"closed.\" The remaining three are outstanding only for equipm ent owned and operated by some outside experts, neutrals, and consultants hired under specific contract s. The solution for such contractors had been delayed due to technical issues with the Department wide encryption solution provided to the Civil Division. However, a pilot program for the outside contractor solution is nearing completion, and the Civil Division is preparing for full implementation. While the recent FISMA audit identified control wea knesses in configuration management in the Bureau of Prison's (BOP) information security program, th e audit concluded that the risk of compromising BOP's information security environment was low. Nevertheless, BOP took steps to monitor and track vulnerabilities and immediately implemented correctiv e action pertaining to configuration management such that the issue was resolved i mmediately and the risk that the defi ciency would reoccur in the future was eliminated. 3 Managing the Federal Prison System The Department appreciates the OIG's descriptions of the challenges the Federal Prison System faces. In addition to the alternatives to incarceration the OIG cited, the U.S. Parole Commission (the Commission) continues to work with its criminal justice partne rs to use alternatives to incarceration for low risk offenders that have demonstrated non- compliant behavior on supervision. As an example, in 2012, the Commission began the Short-term Intervention for Success project, which is designed to assist low risk offenders in successfully co mpleting their terms of supervision by use of short- term prison sanctions rather than longer prison terms. During the first year that the project has been in place, the average length of prison stay for prisoners th at participated in the project has been 3.5 months compared to 11 months for prisoners committing sim ilar violations of supervision during the 2-year period that preceded the pilot project. Since the pilot's inception, the ove rall number of prisoners held in Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-24 custody in the District of Columbia on a Commission warrant has been cut in half. The cost in jail bed days that is avoided by the reduced prison sen tences has saved the federal government significant incarcerations costs. This is an evidence-based pilot program and the Commission will be evaluating whether recidivism rates are impacted by the shorter prison terms. With respect to the OIG review of the Department's International Prisoner Treaty Transfer Program, the Department notes that only a small subset of the tota l number of foreign national prisoners incarcerated in the United States are either eligib le to transfer to their native countries under the provisions of the applicable treaties or suitable to transfer after an an alysis of the facts of each case. To clarify, the BOP's role in the treaty transfer process is limited wi th regard to determining eligibility and suitability. The BOP does not reject requests, but rather it review s all inmate requests to determine if the inmate satisfies the requirements of the applicable treaty ag reement and notifies the inmate of their apparent ineligibility. The BOP follows legally mandated guida nce and applies the criteria to the requests. For example, the BOP uses criteria such as: the inma te has less than 6 months of the current sentence remaining to be served at the time of the request (F rance, Hong Kong, and Thailand require 12 months); the inmate has any pending proceedings, appeals, or collateral attacks - the judgment on the current conviction of sentence must be final. There are othe r equally concise criteria that the BOP applies to all requests. If an inmate believes the criteria were app lied incorrectly, he can use the administrative remedy process to appeal. However, becau se the BOP applies a definitional pr ocess, not a judgmental one, to the requests, it is rare that an appeal is successful. Just as challenging as the above are issues related to the sexual abuse of persons in the custody of the Department's BOP and the U.S. Mars hals Service (USMS). As directed by the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), the Department issued its final rule in May 2012 and is working to implement it throughout BOP and USMS facilities, including contract a nd Inter-Governmental Agreements facilities. With regard to the prisoner work programs of Fede ral Prison Industries (FPI), the serious challenges to FPI's important reentry programs are not \"business management practices\" as mentioned by the OIG. Instead, fundamental changes to the economic and le gislative environment in which FPI operates have diminished FPI's ability to market its products and pr ovide for broader inmate employment and training opportunities. FPI is one of the BOP's most impor tant reentry programs, one that reduces inmate recidivism by improving the job skills of inmates re turning to society after serving their sentences. Unfortunately, FPI sales and revenues have significantly fallen in recent years, and, as the OIG indicates, more factories have been closed than opened sin ce 2007. In addition to gene ral economic and budgetary challenges affecting FPI, the change in its sales is al so attributable to various legislative changes in Department of Defense authorization bills and various appropriations acts that ha ve curtailed FPI's ability to enter into contracts with federal agencies. The Department's leadership, BOP leadership, and the FPI Board are acutely aware of the contracting and ot her budgetary dynamics affecting FPI's important programs, and will continue to seek opportunities to sustain FPI's programs. Among such approaches are an emphasis on finding repatriated off-shore work for FPI factories and a renewed emphasis on the use of job sharing for inmate workers. 4 Leading the Department in an Era of Budget Constraints The Department has always faced budget constraints, but they have been greater over the past few years. As an agency whose mission requires that it often react to events, these constraints are felt across all DOJ components. Regardless, all components have develope d strategies to work within these constraints, and the Department is pleased that the OIG recognizes these efforts. In addition to typical approaches to address tight bu dgets, the Department proactively saves resources and uses them more efficiently. For example, the Atto rney General's Advisory Council for Savings and Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-25Efficiencies (SAVE Council) has saved $107.4 million to date by identifying opportunities for savings and implementing best practices Departmentwide. One example of component savings is the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) approach to travel costs. In FY 2012, the DEA achieved savings of $6.5 million on travel costs by always choosing the lo west available airfares rather than customary government full refundable airfares. Another SAVE Council initiative involves the Depart ment advertising administrative forfeiture notices online. Because of the volume of administrative forfeitu re notices, the Department expects to achieve an annual savings of $6.2 million. The Department current ly offers the benefits of this online platform to other federal law enforcement agencies, including th e U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Secret Service. By expanding this program to more ag encies, including Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even more taxpayers' dollars will be saved. Both the DOJ and the Department of the Treasury (T reasury) have given serious on-going consideration to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report recommending that the DOJ combine its Asset Forfeiture Program with that of the Treasury. Wh ile there are long-standing and significant differences between the operational and statutory environments of the two forfeiture program s, substantial benefits continue to be derived from adapting, whenever and wherever possible, the essential concept of economies of scale that is recommended by GAO. In th is regard, judicial forfe iture cases are processed under one system for both forfeiture programs, and dur ing FY 2012 a joint Claims Administration process was established to expedite the return of victims' assets forfeited under both programs. In FY 2013, a single joint international asset recovery support contract will be available to the investigative agencies of both programs. Regarding long term planning for large IT systems, DOJ has maintained focus on the IWN program and, as noted in the OIG's report, changing circumst ances have required the Department to change significantly the scope and deployment approaches fo r the IWN program over the last 10 years, thus adapting the program's spending during constraine d and inconsistent funding periods. The IWN program's initial objectives were later reshaped due to advances in technology and the funding challenges of the program. Despite these challenges, as noted in the OIG Report, the Department has achieved significant improvements in the wireless comm unications capabilities delivered to DOJ's law enforcement agents. The Department has maintained its commitment to implementing a secure, reliable, and interoperable Land Mobile Radio system for its tactical wirel ess communications. Additionally, the Department's Chief Information Officer (CIO), in conjunction with the Wireless Communication Board, provides oversight, governance, and management of resour ces associated with the IWN program to ensure efficiencies, reduce duplication, and improve economies of scale. The Department is identifying and eliminating wastef ul and duplicative IT spending. Several activities that were begun in FY 2012 to manage the Depart ment's IT spending across the entire departmental portfolio will continue and expand in FY 2013. The Department is tracking all unclassified IT spending, allowing the Department to identify situations wh ere duplicative component spending can be replaced with the use of shared resources. The Department also established commodity IT working groups in key areas such as email, data centers, telecommunicati ons, and mobility. These cross-component groups are developing plans to consolidate IT assets and increase leveraged use of shared infrastructure. Another key area of work is strategic sourcing and vendor management. The Department will continue vendor management efforts begun in 2012 that include iden tifying strategic sourcing opportunities to pool the purchasing power of the Department. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-26 Regarding the Department's debt co llection efforts, in FY 2012, th e Department collected $13.16 billion in criminal and civil actions - the highest amount ev er and more than double the $6.5 billion collected in FY 2011. The $13.16 billion collected includes $3.03 b illion in restitution, criminal fines, and felony assessments, and $10.12 billion in individually and jointl y handled civil actions. In addition, $4.39 billion was collected through asset forfeiture ac tions in partnership w ith other divisions and agencies. 5 Protecting Civil Rights and Civil Liberties The Department never loses sight of its responsibility to protect individuals' civil rights and liberties. This is more than just policy; protecting civil rights and civil liberties is part of the Department's culture and one of the Attorney General's identified priorities. Discrimination persists in the education system, in th e foreclosure crises, in America's workplaces, and in the voting booth. The Department uses a multifaceted program of enforcement designed to target and deter discriminatory conduct to: fulfill the promise of basic civil rights protections through effective and vigorous enforcement of the law; deter and reme dy discriminatory and illegal conduct through the successful prosecution of these federal laws; a nd promote voluntary compliance and civil rights protection through a variety of education, technical assistance, and outreach programs. The Department uses electronic surveillance techniqu es in some investigations because they are an effective law enforcement tool. At the same time, the Department recognizes that these court-authorized tools must be used carefully because if they are used inappropriately, they could intrude on civil liberties. The Department follows strict protocol when approvi ng and using such techniques. In an effort to enhance its own approval process, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) updated and reissued guidance in April 2011 that re flects current laws and provides updated policies and procedures concerning approval and reporting requirements for the use of electronic surveillance. Another technology, unmanned aerial vehicles, also raises privacy and civil rights concerns. As a provider of grant funds to state and local governme nts to purchase equipment and technology that could be used for surveillance drones, the Department will ensure that grants used for funding drone technology will include requirements to ensure that federal funds are used in a manner consistent with applicable privacy and civil rights protections. The Department is carefully monitoring court rulings and other legal proceedings related to the use of emerging technologies and modifying its investig ative and prosecutorial guidance accordingly. 6 Restoring Confidence The Department continues to strengthen its processes to maintain the public's trust in its fairness, integrity, and efficiency. When the Attorney General learned of the ATF's flawed Fast and Furious operation, he ordered that the practices involved in that operation be stopped, he ordered the OIG to investigate the matter, and he instituted personnel changes and pro cedural reforms at the ATF. The ATF Acting Director issued a memorandum, dated November 3, 2011, clarifying po licy concerning the transfer of firearms in the course of investigations. ATF established a monitore d case program that ensures Headquarters' oversight of significant investigations. Additionally, ATF is completing a comprehensive revision to ATF's firearms transfer policy, which also addresses public safety, supervisory cont rols, and Headquarters' oversight of criminal investigations. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-27With respect to the OIG's concern that the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) has no institutional independence, the Department notes that OPR operates independently, with no interference from Department senior leadership. Actually, the OI G Report points to no instance in which Department senior leadership interfered with an OPR investigatio n, nor does it point to any OPR investigations that failed to hold Department leaders accountable. OPR has not hesitated to inv estigate senior Department leadership at the highest levels in the past, wher e appropriate, and to make misconduct findings against Department attorneys when the evidence supported such findings. Indeed, in FY 2012, OPR made professional misconduct findings in approximately 43% of the investigations it closed during the year. To address the OIG's concern that OPR lacks transpar ency, OPR believes it is appropriately transparent, given the strict privacy protections afforded witnesses and subjects pursuant to the Privacy Act. In fact, the Privacy Act prevents OPR from releasing personal information about Department employees, except in limited circumstances. With respect to the 2004 OIG Disciplinary Audit, the BOP continues to work to close the open recommendation. An unresolved issue regarding th e Standards of Employee Conduct policy was litigated before the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) . The FLRA ordered the agency to negotiate the union's proposal regarding its request for an employ ee to receive a copy of his affidavit during the course of Office of Internal Affairs and OIG investigations. The agency and the union ha ve been unable to reach an agreement on this issue, but the BOP remains comm itted to resolving this matter and issuing the policy to meet the OIG's recommendation. Regarding the OIG audit report on USMS Internal Affairs, a staffing shortage and a significant case backlog existed within Internal Affairs, the organi zation responsible for discipline within the USMS. However, as of August 2012, only 12 cases were ol der than 180 days. Additionally, the USMS has addressed its disciplinary system within its Strategic Pl an. The USMS expects its latest update to the OIG regarding the status of open recommendations associat ed with this audit will close the audit report. The Department's senior leadership took the OIG's findings in its report on the integrity of the hiring process within the Justice Management Division (JMD) ve ry seriously. In response to the OIG report, the Assistant Attorney General for Administration (AAG/A ) stressed to all JMD employees the importance of following the merit system principles, the prohib ited personnel practices guidance, and the nepotism statute, all of which ensure a fair civil service sy stem. In addition, the AAG/A instituted procedures to ensure that no inappropriate preferences in hiring oc cur in the future. Finally, the AAG/A appointed an impartial senior executive to review the employee an d selecting official disclosures to ensure their confidentiality is preserved and that JMD is in compliance with all laws , policies, and regulations. As it did in the earlier cited instances, JMD will take a ppropriate action on the findings included in the OIG report. The Department is focused on ensuri ng the transparency of its operations. It is committed to the full implementation of the \"new era of open government\" a nd the presumption of disclosure established in the President's and the Attorney General's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) memoranda. Despite 3 straight years of receiving over 61,000 FOIA requests, the fourth highest number of requests received by any agency, the Department has made substantial effort s to ensure that requests consistently are processed in accordance with the FOIA and the President 's and Attorney General's FOIA memoranda. 7 Coordinating Among La w Enforcement Agencies The Department agrees with the OIG that its co mponents must coordinate and share intelligence, resources, and personnel with one a nother and other law enforcement agencies. To address any possible confusion created within the Department due to overlapping jurisdiction among the four primary law Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-28 enforcement components (ATF, DEA, FBI, and USMS), the Department has worked to clarify roles and responsibilities when multiple organizations are involved in an incident or investigation. Under the direction of the Deputy Attorney Gene ral, law enforcement components within the DOJ convened a De-confliction Working Group, consisting of representatives from DEA, FBI, USMS, ATF, and JMD, to examine the existing departmental de -confliction policies, procedures, and practices to further improve the efficient use of available resour ces and maximize the Department's performance. De- confliction of operational information such as persons of interest, inves tigative targets, and pre-planned enforcement operations is an essential element in all DOJ law enforcement inves tigations. Additionally, de-confliction facilitates the sharing of investiga tive information as well as the coordination among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. To address the OIG's recommendation that the FBI and A TF develop a protocol for joint investigations of explosives incidents, the organizations have been working together, under the direction the Deputy Attorney General, on the jurisdictional overlap pe rtaining to explosives investigations. Since the Deputy Attorney General's Explosives Protocol was issued in FY 2010, the FBI and ATF have continued to resolve any lingering confusion over which entity should lead particular explosives investigations. They are developing plans and strategies to improve furthe r the Department's coordi nation and management of explosives investigations. The Department h as made significant progress toward resolving the jurisdictional concerns outlined in the OIG report. It has improved and integrated the databases for explosives-related information, improved law enforc ement training for explosives investigations, and identified ways in which the FBI and ATF laboratori es can work more efficiently and collaboratively on explosives investigations. The OIG also recommends that the Department consider whether components' standards are appropriately consistent and notes that ATF's revision of several policies after Fast and Furious \"underscores\" ATF's delay in fully integrating with the Department and implementing controls already in place to protect the public. ATF has been working over the last year to ensure that all of its law enforcement policies are updated and consistent with Attorney General's Guide lines and policies for law enforcement activities. For example, in addition to establishing monitored case program management and updating its Firearm Enforcement Program policy, ATF has coordinated with other departmental components to update its confidential informant (CI) pr otocols. The results have produced a number of positive changes and additions to ATF's CI policy th at will ensure effective approval processes for CIs and comprehensive de-confliction, not only within ATF but with other law enforcement agencies. The OIG identified the Organized Crime Drug Enfo rcement Task Force's (OCDETF) Fusion Center (OFC) as one of the Department's efforts to share law enforcement information. The OFC is a key compartment in the Department's information shari ng efforts. It supports numerous types of cases, including drugs, gangs, and transnational organized cr ime. In total the Department operates three fusion centers that support its law enforcement mission, the OFC, the Special Operations Division, and the El Paso Intelligence Center. These fusion centers, wh ich address separate aspects of the enforcement process, combine the support of numerous federal pa rtners, including participants from the Department, the IC, and other federal law enforcement agencies, as well as state, local, and foreign agencies. The law enforcement information sharing activities provided by these centers not only support case agents in the specific cases they are investigating, but they also link cases and agents through the information sharing process. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-298 Enforcing Against Fraud and Financial Offenses For the past several years, the Department has prioriti zed its efforts to eliminat e fraud and other financial offenses and penalize those who commit them, and it h as made use of the available tools, including prosecution, civil litigation, investigations, and task forces. Some examples of the use of prosecution and civil li tigation include the followi ng: In the real estate sector, as a result of the Department's Antitrust Divi sion's (ATR) efforts in FY 2012, 53 defendants pleaded guilty to real estate foreclosure and tax lien conspiracies across the United States that suppress and restrain competition in ways that harm commun ities and already financially distressed homeowners. In the municipal bonds industry, ATR's ongoing investig ations have resulted in criminal charges against 20 former executives of various financial services comp anies and one corporation. Numerous financial institutions have agreed to pay a combined total of nearly $750 million in restitution, penalties, and disgorgement to federal and state agenci es for their roles in the conduct. As for the use of investigations, since the creation of the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (known as \"HEAT\") in May 2009, preventing and shutting down health care fraud schemes have become top priorities for both DOJ and the Depart ment of Health and Human Services (HHS). Joint DOJ/HHS Medicare Fraud Strike Forces are now operati ng in nine locations nationwide: Miami, Los Angeles, Detroit, Houston, Brooklyn, Baton Rouge, Ta mpa, Chicago, and Dallas. Since the first Strike Force was launched in 2007, these teams have charge d more than 1,480 defendants for falsely billing the Medicare program more than $4.8 billion. The Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force (FFETF) is a tool that was established by the President in 2009 and is led by the Attorney General. Th e FFETF's mission, enumerated in the Executive Order creating it, is to (i) enhance coordination and coope ration among government agencies responsible for the investigation and prosecution of significant financial cr imes and violations, (ii) strengthen the efforts of the Department of Justice and other federal, state, and local agencies to investigate and prosecute significant financial crimes and other vi olations relating to the financial crisis and the recovery efforts, (iii) protect the public and encourage greater coordi nation in the detection and prosecution of financial crimes through extensive outreach and educational op portunities, and (iv) suppo rt victims of financial crimes. While the Task Force's goals are ambitious, its foundation is rooted in simplicity: those charged with protecting the public in all levels of governme nt cannot work in isolated and compartmentalized silos. Instead, the government is unified in its a pproach and execution, and it can achieve more by having its many offices and agencies working together than it ever could with the organizations acting separately. In FY 2012 the FFETF created two additional work ing groups, the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) Working Group and the Consumer Protection Working Group, both of which already have produced identifiable results. For exampl e, the RMBS Working Group is overseeing active investigations by various DOJ components, numerous USAOs, and other government and state agencies and offices. Recently it announced the filing of a ci vil complaint against J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (formerly known as Bear Stearns & Co. Inc.), JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A., and EMC Mortgage LLC (formerly known as EMC Mortgage Corporation) by the Office of the New York Attorney General (a Working Group co-chair) based in part on the substa ntial assistance provided by the Department and other Working Group members. The suit was f iled against these defendants for making fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions to promote the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities to investors. These defendants allegedly deceived invest ors concerning the way with which they evaluated the quality of mortgage loans packaged into residen tial mortgage-backed securities prior to Bear Stearns & Co's collapse in early 2008, incurring losses that have totaled approximate ly $22.5 billion to-date. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-30 The Department agrees with the OIG that transp arency and accountability of the FFETF are important. That is a principle reason the FFETF initially established a public website, www.stopfraud.gov , which frequently contains updates of the efforts of the various Task Force members and their activities, as well as provides educational resources for the public. Signif icantly, in an effort to reach an even larger population, the Victims' Rights Committee, which ma intains the website, recently added a web-page containing Spanish-language resources for victims of financial fraud crimes. The FFETF will continue to examine new ways it can expand its reach, as well as con tinue to publish the results of its work, to the extent practicable. Last, although the resources of the FFETF RMBS Work ing Group are frequently a topic of public discussion, the group has been performing quite well w ith its existing resources. Currently, it has more than 200 attorneys, investigators, analysts, and sta ff actively engaged in these in vestigations, and another dozen USAOs that have assisted with witness interviews around th e country. The President's budget request for FY 2013 includes $55 million to assist the De partment in fighting financial fraud, including RMBS fraud, in such ways as funding more FBI agents, prosecutors, civ il attorneys, in-house investigators, and forensic accountants. The Department agrees that suspension and debarmen t are powerful administrative tools which, when used appropriately, help protect the government's financial interests from unethical, dishonest, or otherwise irresponsible entities, as well as help re duce waste, fraud, and abuse. The Department's Suspending and Debarring Official (SDO) has actively u sed these tools in cooperation with the OIG to the fullest extent possible. For example, in calenda r year 2011, the OIG referred 27 cases to the SDO recommending suspension or debarment, and the S DO issued notices of suspension or proposed debarment in 22 cases. The SDO also issued a no tice to show cause in one case, entered into an administrative agreement in one case, and declined to initiate proceedings in one case involving an organization and three employees. Thus far in calen dar year 2012, the OIG has referred 28 cases to the SDO, and the SDO has issued notices of suspen sion or debarment in 26 cases and proposed the debarment of the organization rather than two of its employees in the final two cases. Meanwhile, to increase the integrity of the particip ants in the investigation and prosecution processes related to fraud and other financial offenses, on January 30, 2012, the Attorney General issued a policy statement on parallel proceedings that updated and strengthened th e Department's longstanding policy that its \"prosecutors and civil attorneys coordinate to gether and with agency attorneys in a manner that adequately takes into account the government's criminal , civil, regulatory and administrative remedies.\" Pursuant to this policy statement, and in an effort to ensure that suspension and debarment officials at government agencies have greater access to publicly -available information on corporate defendants that would permit them to pursue debarment and suspen sion remedies as appropriate, the Deputy Attorney General directed that all litigating components provi de corporate criminal case information to the Interagency Suspension and Debarment Committee quarterly. Regarding the Department's Asset Forfeiture Program , as was stated in the Department's response to Challenge #4, the Department c oncurred with the GAO's recommendation and is working with the Treasury forfeiture program to conduct a joint study to assess the feasibility of consolidation in the areas of asset management and asset tracking systems. The st udy will take into account the costs, benefits, and key questions to consider when determining whethe r consolidation could realize increased efficiencies, effectiveness, and cost savings. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-319 Administering Grants and Contracts Grants The Department's grant making components, the OJ P, the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), and the Community Oriented Policing Service (COP S), have significantly improved collaboration and information sharing among themselves and other federa l agencies to reduce duplication, identify cost efficiencies, and address common issues. The DOJ Grants Management Challenges Workgroup, established by the Associate Attorney General's Offi ce and comprised of grants officials from COPS, OJP, and OVW, meets to develop consistent prac tices and procedures in a wide variety of grant administration and management areas. For example, in January 2012, the Department issued policy and procedures developed by the Grants Management Challenges Workgroup to implement the DOJ-wide high risk grantee designation program. In recent months, COPS, OJP, and OVW have taken a number of actions in response to the recent GAO recommendations pertaining to potential duplication a nd overlap. DOJ currently is conducting a study to identify opportunities for shared grants management ser vices. The first phase of the study, completed in August 2012, focused on documenting each component 's award life cycle and identifying the areas of commonality across functional requirements to better assess the feasibility of a shared solution from a systems perspective. The study found a high degr ee of commonality and the potential for greater collaboration among the grant making components. Based on these findings, the Department will conduct an assessment to better understand the extent to whic h the Department's grant programs overlap with one another and determine if grant programs may be consolidated to mitigate the risk of unnecessary duplication. Using the results from the assessment, DOJ will be in a be tter position to develop a targeted and strategic approach to carry out a review of a pplications across all three components during the pre- award process. As part of this approach, DOJ will work to establish policies and procedures to govern this coordinated effort. Meanwhile, COPS, OJP, and OVW have been engaged in an IT shared services feasibility analysis. During the first phase of the project, and after revi ewing the current systems and business requirements, the contractor concluded that sharing a grants system was feasible, but that without enhancements, neither OJP's system nor COPS' system could support the business needs of each component. The two offices currently are beginning phase two of the project which will assist them with identifying the most feasible option for sharing IT services. This may include enha ncing an existing system, building a new system, or sharing data through a data warehouse. The OIG expressed concern regarding a decision to maintain separate Financial Grants Management Guides for OJP and OVW and that the Guides had dup licate information and might confuse grantees of both offices. While the Department recognizes that two guides may create a slight additional burden on those grantees that receive funding from both organi zations, the Department notes that specific guides improve grantee performance by respon ding to their specific needs. Regarding performance measurement, th e Department is constantly tryi ng to develop more meaningful measures for its grant making components. OJP is improving the quality and usefulness of the performance data collected from state, local, and tribal partners to help the agency make better informed programmatic and funding decisions. OJP recently initiated a new Performance Management effort aimed at integrating high-quality, reliable data into performance reporting and its operations, specifically grant monitoring, strategic planning, and management d ecision-making. As a first step in this effort, in FY 2013, OJP will carry out a thorough assessment of its current business processes related to performance measurement. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-32 The COPS' performance goal is to obtain COPS-relate d contribution to a 3% rate of change over 36 months in homicide violent crime rates. COPS will implement a comprehensive community policing strategy within targeted COPS-funded cities and comp are the crime rates of those cities with cities of similar size and demographics that have not receive d COPS funding. Also, beginning in FY 2013, COPS will implement the Homicide Reduction Measure to de termine if grant funding is achieving the intended results. The Department is dedicated to improving continu ously its oversight and monitoring of grantees and grant programs. OJP consistently exceeds its statut ory requirement to conduct comprehensive monitoring of not less than 10% of total award dollars. In FY 2012, OJP monitored more than twice the award amount required by law. It also conducts annual desk reviews on each of its nearly 14,000 grants. COPS also has a comprehensive monitoring strategy that en tails programmatic and financ ial oversight of all of its grantees. The COPS Monitoring Division conducts both on-site and office-based grant reviews. Each visit, whether on-site or in the office, is supported with an exhaustive monitoring report that captures an extended list of requests, potential problems, docum ented issues, and recommendations. During FY 2012, the Monitoring Division managed 144 on-site gran tee monitoring visits totaling 222 grants valued at over $276 million. The grant-making components also closely coordi nate with grantees and the OIG to address issues identified in grant audits and resolve outstanding aud it recommendations in a timely manner. They have worked proactively and collabora tive with the OIG on significant new programs that pose special risks, such as the Presidential Nominating Co nvention Security Fundin g, to ensure that all steps are taken to mitigate the risks with such large and/or complex funding programs. To help grant recipients follow grant terms and c onditions, the Department ensures grantees have access to tools and training necessary to effectively im plement and manage their programs. The Grant Management Challenges Workgroup created an on-line grantee financial management training program. In December 2011, the Department launched this comprehensive on-line training tool for all DOJ grantees and grant management staff. The OIG described this training as a tool to help ensure that grant terms and conditions are followed, a nd to support grant recipients' comp liance with rules and regulations. On-line training has increased the accessibility of DO J's grant recipients to financial management administration and program compliance requirements and has been highly rated by those using the tool. In addition, under the DOJ High Risk Policy, gran tees designated as high-risk receive an automatic special condition on all new DOJ awards that requir es them to take financial management training. Contracts The Department spends large amounts on contracts each year, and it closely monitors the cost, timeliness, and quality of requested goods and services. As noted by the OIG, some of the largest of these contracts are related to planning, implementation, and manage ment of complex information technology systems. The Department, under the direction of its new Chie f Information Officer, is examining its entire IT portfolio and is explori ng opportunities for leveraged buying a nd strategic sourcing of IT commodities and services. With regard to the OIG's comments on the FBI's Sentin el system, the FBI successfully deployed Sentinel in July 2012. The Department notes that the FBI did not eliminate or reduce any of the Sentinel requirements to stay within the $451 million budget al location. However, IT has changed significantly since system requirement specifications were devel oped 7 years ago. Since October 2010, Sentinel executives and stakeholders have completed sever al comprehensive reviews of the requirements necessary to achieve the objectives set out for Sentinel. Some requirements changed to take advantage of new technology. Additional functionalities originally pl anned for Sentinel continue to be provided more Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-33effectively by other systems that remain online irr espective of Sentinel. The Department notes that implying that Sentinel was in any way deficient for \"not providing all of the originally planned capabilities\" is misleading. Because of the dynamic nature of the FBI's development process, the FBI deployed Sentinel for approximately $10 million less than had been budgeted. Beyond reporting the actual cost of the project, $441, there is no \"cost baseline\" to adjust. The Department agrees that it \"must ensure that there is adequate management and oversight of information technology contracts to minimize cost overruns.\" This aspect of the recommendation, however, is out of place following a discussion of Sentin el. The Sentinel project did not suffer from cost overruns; it came in under budget. As for the other as pect of the recommendation, rather than ensuring that an IT project \"provide[s] planned system functi onality\" statically, as initially conceived even if that was years before deployment, Sentinel serves as a model of dynamic reassessment and refinement of a project's required functionality. Sentinel has not failed to provide any appropriate functionality; data provided to the OIG confirms that the FBI has recognized significant efficiency gains in just the first few months since deployment. 10 Ensuring Effective International Law Enforcement As the OIG states, in an effort to address the threat of transnational organized crime, the DEA, FBI, ATF, USMS, and the Criminal Division's Office of Interna tional Affairs (OIA) have stationed personnel abroad to work with their foreign counterparts to investigate and prosecute violations of U.S. law. To build and nurture relationships with law enforcement counterparts, the Department works with host nation counterparts through vetted units, le gal attaches, and other personnel st ationed overseas. A large amount of the Department's international work, however, ta kes place in its domestic offices. For example, in addition to its 10 prosecutors stationed abroad, OIA has an additional 50 attorn eys and 35 paralegals in Washington, DC. Similarly, the Department's law enforcement components have substantial numbers of personnel within the United States who are pursuing international cases and who work in collaboration with personnel posted overseas. The Department agrees with the OIG that devoting r esources to transnational law enforcement efforts will not be enough, that the resources must also be well managed, coordinate d with each other, and coordinated with both dom estic and foreign law enforcement organizations. The Department recognizes that there always will be i ssues and differences that must be worked out with other organizations, regardless of whether those or ganizations are foreign or domestic. The OIG references the Criminal Division's Office of Over seas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) and its International Criminal I nvestigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) offices and their relationship with their primary funder, the State Department (State). While both OPDAT and ICITAP have responsibilities that are strictly focused on assisting foreign entities - training prosecutors, law enforcemen t agencies, and governments, they work very closely and collaboratively with their international counterparts. However, the comp lexity of funding for international activities presents challenges that the Department continues to address.

The BOP's Long Range Capacity Plan relies on multiple approaches to house the increasing federal inmate population, such as contracting with the private sector and st ate and local facilities for certain groups of low-security inmat es; expanding existing institutions where infrastructure permits, prog rammatically appropriate, and cost effective to do so; and acquiring, constructing, and activating new facilities as funding permits. To address this material weakness, the BOP will continue im plementing its Long Range Capacity Plan, making enhancements and modifications to the plan, as needed , commensurate with funding received thro ugh enacted budgets. The BOP's formal Corrective Action Plan includes utilizing contract facilities; e xpanding existing institutions; and acquiring, constructing, an d activating new institutions as funding permits. The BOP will continue to validate progress on construction projects at new and existing facilities through on-site inspections or by reviewing monthly construction progress reports. This material weakness was first reported in 2006. Remediati on of the weakness through increas ing prison capacity is primarily dependent on funding. Other correctional reforms and alternativ es will require policy and/or statutory changes. Other initiat ives notwithstanding, if the acquisition, expansion, construction, an d activation plans detailed in the BOP's Long Range Capacity Pl an are funded as proposed, the over-crowding rate for FY 2018 is projected to be 44 percent. The Department's corrective action efforts are not limited to the BOP alone. The Department continues to consider and implement an array of crime prevention, sentencing, and corrections management improvements that focus on accountability and rehabilitation, while protecting public safety. The Department recognizes that the BOP's capacity management efforts must be teamed with targeted programs that are proven to reduce recidi vism and promote effective re-entry. The BOP will continue to work with the Department on these programs.

Status of Funding Available to Achieve Corrective Action FY 2013 funding is unknown at this point because the FY 2013 budget has not been enacted. The Department of Justice's proposed FY 2014 budget for BOP is under review at the Office of Management and Budget. Planned Measures to Prevent Recurrence The BOP will continue to structure budget requests to address capacity needs in the most cost effective manner possible. Validation Indicator Results are measured as a new institution or expansion project is activated and resulting increases in rated capacity are established. A corresponding decrease in the over-crowding rate will also be a tangible measurement of the results. Progress on construction projects at new and existing facilities will be validat ed via on-site inspections of each facility or by review of monthly construction progress reports.

According to Section 20.4(c) of OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, the expired phase \"lasts five years after the last unexpired year unless the expiration period h as been lengthened by legislation. Specifically, you may not incur new obligations against expired b udget authority, but you may liquidate existing obligations by making disbursements.\" For FY 2012, the below information is re quired to be reported in the Performance and Accountability Reports and annu al performance plans/budgets with regard to undisbursed balances in expired grant accounts: 1) de tails on future action the department, agency, or instrumentality will take to resolve undisbursed balan ces in expired grant accounts; 2) the method that the department, agency, or instrumentality uses to tr ack undisbursed balances in expired grant accounts; 3) identification of undisbursed balances in expired gr ant accounts that may be returned to the Treasury of the United States; 4) in the preceding three fiscal years, details on the total number of expired grant accounts with undisbursed balances (on the first day of each fiscal year) for the department, agency, or instrumentality and the total finances that have not b een obligated to a specific project remaining in the accounts. Three Department of Justice grant-making agenci es are required to report under this guidance: Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), Office of Justice Programs (OJP), and the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW). Their responses are noted below: Details on future actions that will be taken to resolve undisbursed balances in expired grant accounts: COPS closely monitors the financial ac tivity of all grantees. This includ es requiring all grant recipients to report the financial expenditures for all COPS awards on a quarterly basis. COPS also maintains a group of dedicated Grant Program Specialists and Staff Ac countants that offer grantees real-time technical assistance with implementing any aspect of their grant. Due to the additional reporting requirements and transparency associated with American Recove ry and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) grant recipients, COPS has implemented additional efforts to monitor COPS Hiring Recovery Program (CHRP) grantees. First, all CHRP grantees are required to co mplete an online grants management training, which includes a training track specifically addressing financ ial reporting and disbursement of funds. Second, CHRP grantees were notified earlier this year that the undisbursed balance on their grant awards will lapse on September 30, 2015 (5 years after the last unexpired year for ARRA), thus all grant program requirements should be completed by that time and al l expensed funds disbursed. Third, beginning in November 2010, COPS conducts quarterly outreach e fforts to a select group of CHRP grantees who appear to have either discrepancies in the financial or programmatic reporting on their awards. Finally, the COPS Director receives monthly and quarterly repo rts of CHRP activity, including disbursement data, and COPS management works with the Justice Manage ment Division (JMD), OMB, and the Office of the Vice President (OVP) to ensure that ARRA f unds are being disbursed and outlayed timely. All OJP discretionary/categorical and block/formul a grantees are required to submit a financial report quarterly. Grantees have 90 days after the end date of the award to drawdown funds and close out the award. If the payments to the grantee are less than the amount of the grant expenditures, then the grantee is given the opportunity to draw down these funds. OJP Customer Servi ce Outreach staff calls the grantee Undisbursed Balances in Expired Grant Accounts Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-40 to ask them to draw down their funds. The firs t notice will commence on the same day as the phone call to the grantee. If the grantee has not drawn down their available funds after 14 calendar days, a second contact is made by the Customer Service Outreach st aff and a second notice is sent. If there is no action by the grantee, a third notice is sent to the grant ee informing them that OJP will de-obligate the funds from their grant. If the grantee has not retrieved th eir funds after 14 additional calendar days, the funds are de-obligated. After deobligation, the grantee will receive a Grant Adjustment Notice (GAN) in the mail informing them that the funds have been de-ob ligated and are no longer available and the grant is closed. OVW closely monitors the financial activity of all gr antees. All grant recipients are required to report their financial expenditures for OVW awards on a quart erly basis and their project performance activities on a semi-annual or annual basis. ARRA grantees are also required to submit special Section 1512 reports on a quarterly basis that include project and financial information. OVW reviews 100 percent of these reports for each reporting period and contacts th e grantees regarding any concerns or questions. OVW has Grant Program Specialists and Financial Analysts that offer ARRA grantees technical assistance with implementing any aspect of their gran t, including trainings, outreach, site visits and monitoring. The OVW management receives and reviews frequent reports on ARRA grant activity, including obligation and outlay data, and OVW management works with JMD, OMB, OVP, and the OIG to ensure that ARRA funds are being disbursed and outlayed timely. Method used to track undisbursed balances in expired grant accounts: COPS utilizes both the Financial Management Inform ation System 2 (FMIS2) data as well as data from OJP's Grant Payment Request System (GPRS) to tr ack CHRP undisbursed balances. OJP currently uses its Grants Management System (financial reports), FMIS2 and GPRS to track undisbursed balances. OVW utilizes both FMIS2 data as well as data fro m OJP's GPRS to track undisbursed balances. Identification of undisbursed balances in expired gr ant accounts that may be returned to the Treasury: The Department has the authority to transfer unob ligated balances of expired appropriations to the Working Capital Fund. Specifically, Public Law 102-140 provides that at no later than the end the fifth fiscal year after the fiscal year for which funds are appropriated or otherwise made available, unobligated balances of appropriations available to the Departme nt of Justice during such fiscal year may be transferred into the capital account of the Working Ca pital Fund to be available for the Department-wide acquisition of capital equipment, development and implementation of law enforcement or litigation related automated data processing systems, and for the improvement and implementation of the Department's financial management and payroll/perso nnel systems. Therefore, in general unobligated and undisbursed balances in the Depa rtment's expired grant accounts will be transferred to the Working Capital Fund for use as authorized by law, not return ed to the Treasury. An exception to this will be American Recovery and Reinvestment Act grant funds; pursuant to Public Law 111-203, such grant funds that have not been obligated as of December 31, 2012, will be rescinded and returned to the Treasury. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-41The total number of expired grant accounts with u ndisbursed balances (on the first day of each fiscal year) and the total finances that have not been oblig ated to a specific project remaining in the accounts, are as follows (dollars in millions): OJP: FY unobligated balances Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report IV-42 This page intentionally left blank. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report A-1APPENDIX A The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA), as amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA), requires agencies to annually report informati on on improper payments to the President and Congress through their annual Perform ance and Accountability Report. In accordance with that requirement and the implementing guidance in OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, Requirements for Effective Measurement and Remediation of Improper Payments, and OMB Circular A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements , the Department provides the following improper payments reporting details. Item I. Risk Assessment. Briefly describe the ri sk assessment performed (including the risk factors examined, if appropriate) subsequent to completing a full program inventory. List the risk-susceptible programs (i.e., programs that have a significant risk of improper payments based on OMB guidance thresholds) identified by the agency risk assessmen t. Highlight any changes to the risk assessment methodology or results that occurred since the FY 2011 IPIA report. In accordance with the IPIA, as amended by the IP ERA, and the April 2011 OMB implementing guidance, OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, the Department a ssessed its programs and activities for susceptibility to significant improper payments. The Department's top-down approach for assessing the risk of significant improper payments allows for the anal ysis and reporting of results by th e Department's five mission-aligned programs - Law Enforcement; Litigation; Prison and Dete ntion; State, Local, Tribal, and Other Assistance; and Administrative, Technology, and Other. The appr oach promotes consistency across the Department in implementing the expanded requirements of the IPERA. In FY 2012, the Department disseminated an updated risk assessment survey instrument for Departmental components to use in conducting the required risk assessment. The instrument examined disbursement activities against nine risk factors, such as paymen t volume and process complexity, and covered commercial payments, custodial payments, benefit and assistance payments, and grants a nd cooperative agreements. 1 The Department's risk assessment methodology for FY 2012 did not change significantly from FY 2011; i.e., for FY 2012, the methodology again included assessing risk against various risk factors and for various payment types. The primary difference for FY 2012 was that the Department included clarifying language in the survey instrument to ensure components consid ered all questioned costs as improper payments when conducting the required risk assessment. The results of the FY 2012 risk assessment did not differ from FY 2011; i.e., the Department concluded based on the results of the Department-wide risk assess ment for the period ending September 30, 2012, that there were no programs susceptible to significant im proper payments, i.e., improper payments exceeding the OMB thresholds of both 2.5 percent of program outlays and $10 million, or $100 million. Item II. Statistical Sampling. Any agency that has programs or activities that are susceptible to significant improper payments shall briefly describ e the statistical sampling process conducted to estimate the improper payment rate for each program identified with a significant risk of improper 1 The nine risk factors examined during the risk assessment were Policies and Procedures; Results of OMB Circular A-123 Assessment, OIG Audits/Reviews, and other External Audits/Reviews; Corrective Actions ; Results of Monitoring Activities; Result s of Recapture Audit Activities; Process Complexities; Volume and Dollar Amount of Payments; Control Risk; and Capability of Personnel. Improper Payments Information Act (as amended by the IPERA) Reporting DetailsDepartment of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report A-2 payments. Highlight any changes to the statistical sampling process that have occurred since the FY 2011 IPIA report. Not applicable. Based on the results of the FY 2012 Department-wide risk assessment, there were no programs susceptible to significant improper payments. This remains unchanged from FY 2011. Item III. Corrective Actions. Any agency that h as programs or activities th at are susceptible to significant improper payments shall describe the corrective action plans for: A. Reducing the estimated improper payment rate and amount for each type of root cause identified. Agencies shall report root cause information (including error rate and error amount) based on the following three categories: Administrative and Documentation errors, Authentication and Medical Necessity errors, and Verification errors. This discussion must include the corrective actions, planned or take n, most likely to significantly reduce future improper payments due to each type of error an agency identifies, the planned or actual completion date of these actions, and the results of the actions taken to address these root causes. If efforts are ongoing, it is appropriate to include that information in this section and to highlight current efforts, including key m ilestones. Agencies may also report root cause information based on additional categories, or sub-categories, of the three categories listed above, if available. Not applicable. Based on the results of the FY 2012 Department-wide risk assessment, there were no programs susceptible to significant improper payments. B. Grant-making agencies with risk-susceptibl e grant programs shall briefly discuss what the agency has accomplished in the area of funds stewardship past the primary recipient. Discussion shall include the status of projects and results of any reviews. Not applicable. Based on the results of the FY 2012 Department-wide risk assessment, there were no programs susceptible to significant improper payments, to include grant programs. Item IV. Improper Payments Reporting. A. Any agency that has programs or activities that are susceptible to significant improper payments must provide the following information in a table: - all risk-susceptible programs must be listed whether or not an error measurement is being reported; - where no measurement is provided, the agency should indicate the date by which a measurement is expected; - if the Current Year (CY) is the baseline measurement year, and there is no Previous Year (PY) information to report, indicate by either \"Note\" or \"N/A\" in the PY column; - if any of the dollar amounts included in the estimate correspond to newly established measurement components in addition to previously established measurement components, separate the two amounts to the extent possible; - agencies are expected to report on CY activity or, if not feasible, PY activity is acceptable if approved by OMB. Agencies should include future year outlay and improper payment estimates for CY+1, +2, and +3 (future year outlay estimates should match the outlay estimates for those years as reported in the most recent President's Budget). Not applicable. Based on the results of the FY 2012 Department-wide risk assessment, there were no programs susceptible to significant improper payments. B. Agencies should include the gross estimate of the annual amount of improper payments (i.e., overpayments plus underpayments) and should list the total overpayments and underpayments that make up the current year amount. In addition, agencies are allowed to calculate and report a second estimate that is a net total of both overpayments and Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report A-3underpayments (i.e., overpayments minus underpayme nts). The net estimate is an additional option only and cannot be used as a substitute for the gross estimate. Not applicable. Based on the results of the FY 2012 Department-wide risk assessment, there were no programs susceptible to significant improper payments. Item V. Recapture of Improper Payments Reporting. A. An agency shall discuss payment recapture audit (or recovery auditing) efforts, if applicable. The discussion should describe the agency's payment recapture audit program, the actions and methods used by the agency to recoup overpayments, a justification of any overpayments that have been determined not to be collectable, and any conditions giving rise to improper payments and how those conditions are being resolved (e.g., the business process changes and internal controls instituted and/or strengthened to prevent further occurrences). If the agency has excluded any programs or activities from review under its payment recapture audit program (including any programs or activities where the agency has determined a payment recapture audit program is not cost-effective), the agency should list those programs and activities excluded from the review, as well as the justification for doing so. Include in the discussion the dollar amount of cumulative reco veries collected beginning with FY 2004. The Department's payment recapture audit program is part of its overall program of internal control over disbursements. The program includes establis hing and assessing internal controls to prevent improper payments, reviewing disbursements to id entify improper payments, assessing root causes of improper payments, developing co rrective action plans, and tracking the recovery of improper payments and disposition of recovered funds. The Department's top-down approach for tracking and reporting the results of recovery auditing activiti es promotes consistency across the Department in implementing the expanded requirements of the I PERA. In FY 2012, the Department provided components an updated template to assist them in analyzing root causes of improper payments and tracking the recovery of such paymen ts and disposition of recovered funds. The root causes for overpayments other than for gr ants largely fell within the OMB-defined error category of Documentation and Administrative, as most errors were overpayments resulting from duplicate payments or data entry errors. Depart mental components have implemented actions to address specific areas where improvements could be made. For example, to reduce duplicate payments and prevent other types of imprope r payments, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) conducts data analytics on payment data en tered into the Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) prior to processing disbursements to identify payments that, if processed, would be improper, e.g., payments to ineligible recipien ts, payments for ineligible services, and duplicate payments. To reduce data entry errors, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) increased its use of electronic billing and cons olidation of invoices. The root causes for grant overpayments also largel y fell within the Documentation and Administrative category, as most involved payments for which grantees did not provide sufficient documentation to support the payments. To reduce the risk of these types of overpayments, the Department's granting components expanded training and communications in forming grantees of their responsibilities related to receiving Federal awards. For example, the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) requires all grantees responsible for improper payments to submit written policies and procedures describing the internal controls put in place to prevent si milar occurrences in the future. Departmental components have also taken actions to facilitate the recovery of improper payments. For example, the FBI produces an accounts receivable report to track the age and collection efforts for all uncollected improper payments. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issues demand letters to debtors notifying them of the status of the debt, the date payment is due, where to send payment, and the collection acti ons the ATF can pursue to recover the debt. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report A-4 The Department excluded employee disbursements a nd intra-governmental payments from the scope of its payment recapture audit program in accordance with the IPERA and OMB implementing guidance. The Department also excluded paymen ts to confidential informants because of its responsibility to protect sensitive law enforcement information. Lastly, the Department excluded payments at DEA foreign offices, because the DEA ob tains the services of the Department of State for certifying and disbursing payments on behalf of the DEA at foreign offices. In accordance with the IPERA and OMB implemen ting guidance, the Department measured payment recapture performance. Based on performance thr ough the period ending Se ptember 30, 2012, the Department achieved a payment r ecovery rate of 93 percent for the cumulative period of FYs 2004 through 2012, and an annual recovery rate of 121 percent for FY 2012. 2 In FY 2012, approximately $22,400 of overpayments were determined not to be collectable, th e majority of which were due to a vendor's bankruptcy. Table 1B provided later in this section provides additional detail on the approximate $40.5 million in improper payments identified in FYs 2004 through 2012 and the approximate $37.5 million of recovered funds. B. Complete the tables below (if any of this inform ation is not available, indicate by either \"Note\" or \"N/A\" in the relevant column or cell): Note: To allow information to be easily view able, the Department reformatted the table in OMB Circular A-136 into three separate tables. Table 1A provides information on the total amount of disbursements subject to review in FY 2012, as well as the total amount reviewed under the Department's payment recapture audit program. As shown in the table, the Department reviewed 100 percent of its FY 2012 disbursements, except fo r the payments excluded from review as discussed in Item V.A.

Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report Table 1B provides the cumulative results of payment recapture audit activities for the nine-year period of FYs 2004 through 201 2. As shown in the table, as of the end of FY 2012, the Department had recovered 93 percent of the im proper payments identified for r ecovery. The Department reported a cumulative recovery rate of 86 percent in its FY 2011 PAR. As shown in the table, the cumulative rec overy rate for grants was 79 percent, while the cumulative recovery rate for all other t ypes of payments ranged from 90 to 100 percen t. The lower recovery rate for grants is attributed in part to fact ors that extend the time frame for receiving recovered grant funds. For example, some grantees have been placed on multi-year repaymen t programs based on ability to pay and other factors. Table 1B Cumulative Payment Recapture Audit Reporting DOJ Mission-Aligned Program Type of Payment (includes only the types made per program) FYs 2004 through 2012 Cumulative Improper Payments Identified for Recovery3 Cumulative Improper Payments Determined Not to be Collectable Cumulative Improper Payments Recovered Recovery Rate (Percent of Cumulative Improper Payments Recovered out of Cumulative Improper Payments Identified for Recovery) Cumulative Improper Payments Outstanding Percent Outstanding (Percent of Cumulative Improper Payments Outstanding out of Cumulative Improper Payments Identified for Recovery) Administrative, Technology, and Other Commercial 1% State, Local, Improper payments identified for recovery do not include all questioned costs. When questioned costs are identified in an OIG audit report or through some other means, Departmental management initiates a process to validate whether the costs in ques tion were improper payments; e.g., the Departm ent will request additi onal support from grantees for transactions that, at the tim e of audit, were not supported by adequate documentation. The validation process can take mon ths, and in some cases years, to complete. Therefore, for payment recapture audit reporting purposes, impr oper payments identified for reco very include only the questione d costs for which Depart mental management has completed the validation process and determined that the incu rred costs should not have been charged to the Government. A-5 Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability ReportTable 1C provides the results of payment recapture audit activiti es separately by current year (FY 2012) and previous years (FY s 2004 through 2011 combined). As shown in the current year section of the table, the improper paymen ts recovered for two programs - Law Enforcement and State, Local, Tribal, and Other Assistance - excee ded the improper payments identified for recovery due to the recovery during FY 2012 of improper payments identified in previous years.

The targets shall be based on the rate of recovery. Agencies are expected to report current year amounts and rates, as well as recovery rate targets for three years. Table 2 provides current year (FY 2012) payment recapture audit activities information, cumulative information (FYs 2004 throug h 2012), and recovery rate targets for three years. As mentioned, the lo wer cumulative recovery rate for grants is attributed in part t o factors that extend the time frame for receiving recovered grant funds. In FY 2013, the Department will continue focusing on improving the recovery rate for grants and sustaining the high recove ry rates for all other types of payments.

An aging schedule of the amount of overpayments identi fied through the payment recapture audit program that are outstanding (i.e., overpayments that have been identified but not recovered). Typically, the aging of an overpayment begins at the time the overpayment is detected. Indicate with a note whenever that is not the case. Table 3 provides the aging schedule for the De partment's overpayments that were outsta nding (not recovered) as of the end of FY 2012. As shown in the table, of the approximate $2.5 million in overpayments that were outstanding for more than a year, 70 percent were grants. As mentioned, in FY 2013, the Department will continue fo cusing on improving the recovery rate for grants.

As applicable, agencies should also report on improper payments identified and recovered through sources other than payment recapture audits. For example, agencies could report on improper payments identified through statistical samples conducted under the IPIA, agency post-payment reviews or audits, Office of the Inspector General reviews, Single Audit reports, self-reported overpayments, or reports from the public. Specific information on additional required reporting for contracts is included in Section 7 of OMB memorandum M-11-04, issued in November 2010. Reporting this information is required for FY 2011 reporting and beyond. If previous year information is not available, indicate by a \"Note.\" The Department's payment recapture audit program leverages both internal and external efforts to identify improper payments. The reporting in Tables 1B through 5 is inclusive of all overpayments, regardless of whether they were identified through internal or external sources. Table 5 provides information on the overpayments that were identified in the current year (FY 2012) and previous year (FY 2011) by source, i.e., through internal efforts or by auditors, vendors, or payment recapture audit contractors. The table also provides the recovery information associated with overpayments identified by those sources. The table provides informati on for FYs 2011 and 2012 only, as agencies were not required to track this level of detail prior to FY 2011.

Any agency that has progra ms or activities that are susceptible to significant improper payments shall describe the steps the agency has taken and plans to take (including timeline) to ensure that agency managers, accountabl e officers (including the agency head), programs, and States and localities (where appropriate) are held accountable for reducing and recovering improper payments. Specifically, they should be held accountable for meeting applicable improper payments reduction targets and establishing and maintain ing sufficient internal controls (including an appropriate control environment) that effectively prevents improper payments from being made and promptly detects and recovers any improper payments that are made. Not applicable. Based on the results of the FY 2012 Department-wide risk assessment, there were no programs susceptible to significant improper payments. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report A-11Item VII. Agency Information Sy stems and Other Infrastructure. A. Describe whether the agency has the internal controls, human capital, and information systems and other infrastructure it needs to reduce improper payments to the levels the agency has targeted. The results of the FY 2012 Department-wide ri sk assessment demonstrated that, overall, the Department has sufficient internal controls over di sbursement activities to prevent improper payments. The assessment identified no programs suscep tible to significant improper payments. Department-wide actions to reduce improper paym ents are accomplished through an aggressive strategy of re-engineering and standardizing bus iness processes, concurrent with the Department's implementation of an integrated financial manageme nt system, which is underway. As of the end of FY 2012, all Departmental components reported that they had sufficient internal controls, human capital, and the information systems and other infra structure needed to reduce improper payments to targeted levels. In addition to the Department's actions to improve agency information systems and infrastructure, individual components have taken ac tions to incorporate additional controls into their financial systems to reduce improper payments. For exampl e, in FY 2012, the Federal Prison Industries implemented a centralized accounts payable docum entation management system. The system provides end-to-end automation of invoices and also provides r econciliation, voucher posting, workflow for approvals, and detailed reporting and au diting information that can be used to monitor payment activities. B. If the agency does not have such internal controls, human capital, and information systems and other infrastructure, describe the resources the agency requested in its most recent budget submission to Congress to establish and maintain the necessary internal controls, human capital, and information systems and other infrastructure. Not applicable. The continued implementation of th e Department's integrated financial management system will complement the Department's current infrastructure and capabilities to reduce improper payments. Item VIII. Barriers. Describe any statutory or re gulatory barriers that may limit the agency's corrective actions in reducing improper payments and actions taken by the agency to mitigate the barriers' effects. The Department has not identified any statutory or re gulatory barriers that limit its corrective actions in reducing improper payments. Item IX. Additional Comments. Discuss any additi onal comments, if any, on overall agency efforts, specific programs, best practices, or common challenges identified as a result of IPERA implementation. The Department recognizes the importance of maintaini ng adequate internal controls to ensure proper payments and is committed to the continuous improvement of the overall disbursement management process. The Department's top-down approach for implementing the expanded requirements of the IPERA promotes consistency across the Department, both with regard to conducting the required risk assessment and for tracking and reporting payment recapture audit activities. In FY 2013, the Department will continue its efforts to further reduce improper payments, as well as improve the recovery rate for grants. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report A-12 This page intentionally left blank. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report B-1APPENDIX B This financial management status report describ es the Department's three most significant and overarching financial management initiatives - achie ving a clean audit opinion, implementing a new Department-wide financial management system, a nd continually improving internal controls. The President's emphasis on transparency emphasizes th e significance of federal government performance and accountability to achieve successful results. Th e ultimate goal is accurate and timely financial information on a recurring basis. These initiatives support the Department's overall goal to improve management and administration of the Department 's programs while also supporting mandates such as the CFO Act, the Government Management Reform Act (GMRA), the Federa l Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), the Government Perform ance and Results Act (GPR A), Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA), and the Debt Collection Improvement Act (DCIA) of 1996. Reliable Financial Statements and Meeting Due Dates for Financial Statements. KPMG LLP, an independent public accounting firm unde r contract with the Department's Office of the Inspector General, performed the FY 2012 consolidated Department audit. Th e Department earned an unqualified opinion on its audited cons olidated financial statements for FY 2012. All nine of the Department's components that produce financial stat ements received unqualified opinions, as well. The Department and components continued to demonstrat e progress in remediating weaknesses identified by the independent auditors. The Department has consis tently met the OMB due date for submission of the consolidated financial statements. Ensuring these deadlines are met required planning and coordination which included issuance of the annual Financial Stat ement Requirements and Preparation Guide (Guide). The Guide includes a detailed timeline of major ev ents and interim milestones. This, along with components' corrective actions quarterly status upda tes, adds to the foundation necessary to eliminate auditor-reported internal control material weaknesses. For FY 2012 and beyond, the Department expects to maintain its consistent status on its audited consolidated financial statements. Integrated Financial Management System. The Unified Financial Management System (UFMS) initiative is the keystone to the Department's strategy for financial systems improvement. UFMS is replacing multiple core financial management and procurement systems with an integrated Commerc ial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) solution, Momentum, provided by CGI Federal Inc. Implementation of UFMS is streamlining an d standardizing business processes and procedures across DOJ Components. As of September 2012, UFMS continued to suppor t more than 2,500 users worldwide from the DEA (fully implemented), ATF (fully implemented), A sset Forfeiture Program/AFP (Phase I), BOP (UFMS Acquisitions), FBI (Phase I), and USMS (UFMS Acqui sitions). In October 2013 the number of UFMS users will grow to 5,000 with completion of thr ee implementations - FBI phase II pilot, AFP (fully implemented) and USMS (fully implemented). By FY 2014 UFMS will serve as the financial system of record for 4 DOJ components (DEA, ATF, USMS and FBI), and AFP. Major accomplishments in FY 2012 include the following: Go-lives in October 2012 are on schedule for the FBI phase II pilot, AFP and USMS. Worked collaboratively with FBI to stand up UFMS SECRET at an FBI facility to support the successful deployment of UFMS to FBI in October 2012. FY 2012 Financial Management Status Report Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report B-2 A newer version of UFMS, 2.1, was configured, tested and formally accepted in January 2012 which met the timeframe for the FBI configuration of UFMS. FY 2012 is the third year DEA relied on the UFMS as the system of record and the second year for ATF. Both received clean audit opinions based on UFMS. Requirements for two additional UFMS interfaces, the Over the Counter Channel Application (OTCnet) and CWTSato Travel E2 Solutions\u00ae, were finalized early in FY 12 and the design, development and testing activities were complete d to enable deployment of both in October 2012. The UFMS 1.1 Shared Acquisitions users (BOP and USMS) were successfully migrated to the UFMS 2.0 Shared instance in June 2012. This is the 7th UFMS project completed on schedule and budget since FY 2008. The Shared Acquis itions migration also provided the first successful test/execution of data migration fro m an older to a newer version of UFMS. Successful data migrations will be critical to c ontrolling the costs of the long term operations and maintenance of UFMS. Transitioned the responsibility and staff (govern ment and contractor) from the UFMS Program Management Office (PMO) to Finance Staff to pr ovide oversight of the IT security functions for UFMS. Transitioned responsibilities include lead ership of IT security issues, subject matter expertise for vulnerability management, Certif ication &Accreditation activities, incident response, maintenance of documentation and collaboration with FBI on efforts relating to UFMS SECRET and the Cross Domain Solution. Responsibility for physical and personnel security as well as IT security maintenance functions such as collaboration on patch management, vulnerability scanning, analysis and tracking and audit log analysis, remains with the UFMS PMO/Solution Services group. The transition was effective in March 2012. Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) Remediation Plan and A-123 Compliance. During FY 2012, the Department continued effo rts to resolve internal control weaknesses in critical areas by providing oversight and resources to individual components. Through ongoing review programs, components aggressively demons trated their commitment to identify areas of concern and implement corrective actions prom ptly. The Department also continued to demonstrate progress on its multiyear project to im plement an integrated financial management system. This system will eventually provide a si ngle source for timely and reliable financial data, and strengthen the Department's ove rall control environment. The system will also facilitate the collection of information, increase transparency, and enhance decision-making by program managers. The Department continued its commitment to impr oving and strengthening controls through the annual OMB Circular A-123, Appendix A assessment. Using a top-down risk-based approach, efforts were focused on significant areas where the risk of material errors in financial reporting could occur. Efforts are continuing to coordinate a nd leverage existing reviews and ass essments of the controls over significant financial information systems. These acti ons, coupled with the Department's corrective action plan process, have enabled the Department to mon itor the components' progress against corrective action plans more timely and, when necessary, provide additional resources to correct control weaknesses. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report C-1APPENDIX C Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Follow-Up Audit of the DOJ Internal Controls over Reporting of Terrorism-Related Statistics In February 2007, the Office of the Inspector General (O IG) completed an audit of the Department's internal controls over reporting terroris m-related statistics. This audit review ed terrorism-related statistics reported by the Department and three Department components - th e Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Executive Office for United States Attorneys, and Criminal Divisi on, and it found that the Department components and the Department as a whole did not accurately report terro rism-related statistics. The three components did not accurately report 24 of the 26 statistics reviewed, with some statistics significantly overstated or understated, while others were overstated or understated by minor amounts. The OIG initiated a follow-up audit to determine if the: (1) Department components took appropriate actions to implement the recommendations from the 2007 audit; and (2) corrective actions implemented improved the components' ability to gather, track, classify, verify, a nd report accurate terrorism-related statistics. Following the 2007 audit report, the National Security division (NSD) took over responsibility for corrective actions on the recommendations to the Criminal Division. In November 2008, the NSD's Counterterrorism Section revised and republished its circular that established and documented internal control procedures for gathering, verifying, and reporting terrorism-rela ted statistics. These procedures, if implemented appropriately, should ensure that statistics are accurately reported and supporte d. This audit provided results pertaining only to the NSD. The OIG found that while the NSD revised its procedures for gathering, classifying, and reporting terrorism- related statistics based on the recommendations from the 2007 audit, the NSD's implementation of the revised procedures were not effective at ensuring that terrorism -related statistics were reported accurately. In this audit, the OIG identified nine unique terrorism-related st atistics reported by the NSD in budget submissions or other documents for fiscal years 2009 through 2012, and the a uditors selected five of the nine statistics to test for accuracy. The OIG determined that the NSD did not accurately report four of the five statistics reviewed. Although it appears that the statistics were not significa ntly overstated or understa ted, the inaccurate reporting indicates a need for the NSD to strengthen further its a pplication of controls for gathering, verifying, and reporting its terrorism-related statistics. The statisti cs were inaccurately report ed because the NSD's: (1) Counterterrorism Section did not main tain documentation detailing the statis tics on convictions, charges, and cases favorably resolved at the time the numbers were reported; and (2) Office of Justice for Victims of Overseas Terrorism did not have written internal control procedures for gathering, tracking, verifying, and reporting its terrorism-related statistic on U.S. victims of terrorism identified abroad. NSD has already taken steps to implemen t all three of the OIG's recommendations. Government Accountability Office (GAO) Review of Terrorist Watchlist Screening Processes The attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 in December 25, 2009, exposed weaknesses in how the federal government nominated individuals to the terrorist watchlist and gaps in how agencies used the list to screen individuals to determine if they posed a threat. In response, the President tasked agencies to take corrective actions. GAO was asked to assess: (1) govern ment actions since the incident to strengthen the nominations process; (2) how the composition of th e watchlist has changed based on these actions; and (3) how agencies are addressing gaps in screening process es. GAO analyzed government reports, the guidance used by agencies to nominate individuals to the watc hlist, data on the volumes of nominations from January Major Program Evaluations Completed During FY 2012 Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report C-22009 through May 2011, the composition of the list, a nd the outcomes of screening agencies programs. GAO also interviewed official from intelligence, law enfo rcement, and screening agencies to discuss changes to policies, guidance, and processes and related impacts on agency operations and the traveling public, among other things. Overall, the volume of nominations the Te rrorist Screening Center (TSC) is receiving from the FBI and NCTC has generally increased since the attemp ted attack. GAO found the TSC has avoided backlogs by employing a variety of strategies to address its work load, including management of personnel resources and use of more advanced technology. GAO recommended the Assistant to the President for Home land Security and Counterterrorism ensure that the outcomes and impacts of agencies' actions to strengt hen nominations and screening processes are routinely assessed. OIG Audit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory's Forensic DNA Case Backlog The OIG initiated an audit of the FBI's forensic case backlog on September 16, 2011. The primary objective of the audit was to: (1) verify the total number of fo rensic DNA cases that rema ined unprocessed by the FBI Laboratory; (2) evaluate the status of the implemen tation of a laboratory information management system; (3) examine the effect of outsourcing agreements on the overall DNA forensic casework backlog, and (4) assess any impending external factors that may have impacted the ability of th e forensic DNA units to maintain their workload. The OIG concluded that th e FBI Laboratory's forensic DNA casework backlog has been significantly reduced. The OIG found that the FB I has effectively eliminat ed the Nuclear DNA Unit case backlog, which is noted as a significant achievement. This progress can be attributed primarily to efficiency improvements and the addition of personnel. While the Mitochondrial DNA Unit's backlog decreased, the OIG found that that the decreases can be attributed to a decision to no longer automatically conduct Mitochondrial DNA analysis on all hairs identified or improvised explosive devices. The FBI took these cases out of the queue for automatic examination because there have been no documented instances for which probative results were generated from these Mitochondr ial DNA examinations. Instead, the Mitochondrial DNA Unit worked together with the Terrorist Explosiv e Device Analytical Center (TEDAC) to revise the Unit's case acceptance policy so that new submissions to the unit are more likely to yield probative information. The FBI's current effort to implement a laboratory information management system, eLAB, has an experienced program manager, has secured initia l funding of $4 million, and has adopted the FBI Information Technology Governance Framework. GAO Study of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Inmate Crowding - Growing Inmate Crowding Negatively Affects Inmates, Staff, and Infrastructure BOP operates 117 federal prisons to house approximately 178,000 federal offenders, and contracts with private companies and some state governments to house about a nother 40,000 inmates. BOP calculates the number of prisoners that each BOP-run institution can house safely and securely (i.e., rated capacity). GAO was asked to address (1) the growth in BOP's population from fisca l years 2006 through 2011 and BOP's projections for inmate population and capacity; (2) the effects of a gr owing federal prison popula tion on operations within BOP facilities, and the extent to which BOP has taken acti ons to mitigate these effects; and (3) actions selected states have taken to reduce their prison populations, a nd the extent to which BOP has implemented similar initiatives. GAO analyzed BOP's inmate population data from fi scal year 2006 through 2011, BOP's 2020 long-range capacity plan, and BOP policies and st atutory authority. The results are not generalizable, but provide information on the effects of a growing prison populati on. Despite the continued growth in inmates and related expenses, in recent years, BOP has been adding capacity and staff at a lower rate than the inmate population has been growing. As a result, both indivi dual facilities and the federal prison system as a whole are experiencing increased crowding. Crowding has implic ations for inmates, staff, and infrastructure - as well as safety and security, and the potential for inmate disr uptions or an even more serious security incident is Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report C-3a significant concern. BOP has taken steps to help mitig ate the implications of crowding in the federal system, but does not have the authority to implement many of the reforms that several states have adopted to reduce crowding and, in some states, the size of their pris on populations. BOP also re quires congressional approval and appropriated funds to expand capac ity in the federal system. As such, BOP has limited ability to address crowding in the federal prison system. GAO makes no recommendations in this report. Department of Justice FY 2012 Performance and Accountability Report C-4 This page intentionally left blank.
