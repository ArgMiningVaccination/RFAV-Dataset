Complementary therapies are treatments that make up a range of services provided by the NHS. Treatments that are available are acupuncture, aromatherapy, art therapy, chiropractic, herbal medicine and homeopathy. These treatments are offered to patients who may have cancer or other illnesses. These treatments are also used to help maintain one's health, improving the immune system, sleeping patterns, increasing energy levels and help to depose of toxins. Complementary therapies are not clinically tested but have been used for many years and also most therapists are self employed. Locura is a culture bound syndrome that affects Latin Americans and Hispanics, regardless of where they are born, in the United States or South America (Jilek 2001:5,9). Locura has also been documented in immigrants from the Caribbean Islands (Razzouk 2011:517). In Columbia, Locura is also known as \"ataques de locura\" madness attacks, it is attributed to a spell known as \"maleficio\". Locura is commonly associated with other culture bound syndromes thru out Central and South America, such as ataques de nervious (nervios) and possession syndromes (Pi\u00f1eros 1998:1425). It is a very costly and time consuming therapy and does similar things compared to relaxation Thesis Statement: Today I am going to tell you about an aspect of human culture that appears just about everywhere you go: music. The 2002 Romanow Report identified the promotion of overall wellness and a focus on prevention as critical elements to achieving sustainable health care in Canada. All practitioners within the health care system, including registered massage therapists (RMTs), play an instrumental role in helping to realize this mandate. Further research on the state of the Massage Therapy profession in Canada led me to the \"Massage Therapy and Canadians' Health Care Needs 2020: Proceedings of a National Research Priority Setting Summit\". This research states that: In Edvard Grieg's \"Morning Mood\", a well-recognized piece of classical music, a flute is the first instrument one hears. The beautiful whistle of the flute's first note strikes a high A, played softly, and the softness continues as the flute travels down the scale, only to play a C and make its way, legato, back up to an A (Morning Mood: Peer Gynt No.1). As the piece continues, violins, cellos, oboes, and many other instruments are softly introduced to complement the flute's high and quiet notes. It is only when the flute crescendos in the middle of the piece that the other instruments follow along. This continues Grieg's trend, on this track, of forming the other instrument's parts around the flute. Occasionally, the flute will soften and be replaced by another wind or string, but the trend of surrounding the main instrument with other pieces still continues. This soothing blend of the instruments is what causes the mind to remove stress when listening. I believe that music This contextual project consists of 10 concept from the block 1 study with the title \"Research and Nursing Research\". The meaning of each concept will be clarified, critically analyzed and applied to social context, personal life and current professional life.

Although, they are by logic completely opposites in practice the have some similarities. The first one, is accepted in most of the advance countries. Though, the second one is having a lot of attention not just from de common people but from the biomedical system as part of their usual treatments. That is why the differences and similarities between Chiropractic as part of the CAM world and the Biomedical Model are getting smaller and closer together. Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) consider all forms of therapies outside the field of medical practice. CAM is attracting more attention within the context of health care provision and health sector reform.Use of CAM remains common in developing countries and is increasing knowledge and concern in developed countries.Cultural beliefs and practices often lead self-care, home remedies or consultation with traditional healers particularly in far as in rural and Bedouin communities. (16) In this study the review of related literature talks about the variety of literature that related to the case study on the effect of Music Therapy to the cohort of children with ADHD. Summary: Changing with the changing world is a must. The world of medicine is changing today and the world is leaning towards the holistic approach. The University of Maryland Medical Center states that Herbal Therapy also called botanical medicine or phytomedicine, refers to using plant's, seeds, berries, leaves, barks, or flowers for medicinal purposes. Herbalism has a long tradition of use outside conventional medicine. It is becoming more mainstream as improvements in analysis and quality control, along with advances in clinical research, show the value of herbal medicine in treating and preventing diseases. Herbal medicine is a natural, non-toxic way to treat many conditions of ill-health. It is holistic, meaning it treats the whole person, embracing all levels of an individual: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Herbal medicines are widely preferred by some individuals all When exploring what is health, it looks at the idea of an individual being free from illness or injuries (World Health Organization 1948). WHO further explains that it is the state of complete: physical, mental, and social well-being and not the absence of disease or infirmity (health context, 2018) "}
