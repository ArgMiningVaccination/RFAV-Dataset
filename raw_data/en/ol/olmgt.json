The video ends with a slide announcing \"Niko's (sic) story coming August 30, 2016,\" and a plug for the documentary, Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe.

I mean, there's thousands of parents out there that have the same story. So my opinions are just my opinions as a daddy, as a husband who happens to be the DA.\" There is [no scientific evidence](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html) linking vaccines to autism, and anti-vaccination critics have warned about a re-emergence of diseases such as measles and whooping cough.

The number of students in Dallas ISD who were not vaccinated for reasons of conscience or religious belief totals less than 1 percent, though some schools have higher rates.
