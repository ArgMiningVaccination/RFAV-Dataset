Here are some of the most popular local herbal drinks that you should try. There is just something special about Cantonese food. While it might not look the most extravagant - think [Cantonese desserts](https://thehoneycombers.com/hong-kong/cantonese-desserts-traditional-sweets/) and [street food in Hong Kong](https://thehoneycombers.com/hong-kong/street-food-in-hong-kong/) - you'll probably find that much of it is surprisingly delicious and addictive. Instead of taking you on a [Hong Kong food tour](https://thehoneycombers.com/hong-kong/hong-kong-food-tours/) this time, we're teaching you how to hunt down some the best Chinese herbal teas in the city - even though they all look the same shade of brownish black. Chinese herbal teas that are popular in Hong Kong 1. 24 Flavours Tea () Why's it called 24 Flavours Tea? Because it's a mixture of around 24 ingredients, although sometimes as few as ten or as many as 28. As one of the most commonly seen Chinese herbal teas in Hong Kong, the 24 Flavours Tea is great to aid digestion, alleviate sore throats and common colds, and it helps clear toxins and \"internal heat\" (yeet Prunellae () Spica Prunellae is known for lowering blood pressure and blood sugar levels, as well as for treating liver fire and conjunctival congestion. While a lot of Chinese herbal teas are described as bitter and dull, Spica Prunellae is one of our personal favourites in terms of flavour, as it carries a subtle sweetness. It's probably the best one to start your journey into the world of Chinese herbal teas in Hong Kong. 3. Five Flower Tea () A staple in traditional Chinese medicine, five flower tea is a blend treasured for its soothing and restorative properties. Containing chrysanthemum, honeysuckle, red cotton, coltsfoot, and sweet chrysanthemum buds, this sweet herbal infusion helps detoxify the liver, boost immunity, improve vision, and prevent heat stroke. Hong Kongers have long turned to five flower teas as a gentle health tonic, consuming them regularly to balance the body's systems. 4. Rorippa Indica () Valued for its soothing properties, Rorippa Indica is made from wild watercress. With a flavour reminiscent of watercress soup, this infusion helps dissolve phlegm, ease coughs, and reduce internal heat. A touch of monk fruit sometimes adds sweetness, but the subtle herbal notes shine when left unsweetened. When Hong Kong's humidity stokes coughs and throat discomfort, you can rely on Rorippa Indica's traditional formulation for gentle relief. 5. Canton Abrus Herb () Known as \"chicken bone grass\" for the appearance of its curved seed pods, Canton Abrus Herb is celebrated for its ability to dispel dampness and heat from the body. Often utilised in the treatment of jaundice and other damp-heat related conditions, a brew of Canton Abrus Herb tea can offer relief by clearing the liver and alleviating any discomfort in the chest and ribs. Though beneficial for certain cases of internal heat, those with deficiency conditions are advised to either avoid Canton Abrus Herb tea, or consult a healthcare professional before consumption. 6. Monk Fruit Tea () Naturally sweet, monk fruit (aka luo han guo) is loved by many Chinese households for its health benefits, such as curing sore throats and coughs. Since it is believed to have cooling effects, it is widely consumed by Chinese during summer. Although it tastes very sweet, monk fruit contains barely any carbs and calories, thus your insulin levels will not rocket after drinking. 7. Detox and Dampness Clearing Tea () A potent blend of white mulberry, dried tangerine peel, and ginger, the Detox and Dampness Clearing Tea targets the concept of \"dampness\" - an excessive retention of water thought to trigger various illnesses. This tea works by stimulating the spleen, enhancing the body's capacity to eliminate excess moisture and accumulated toxins. For those struggling with poor appetite, fatigue, acne, or bloating, this light infusion offers an aromatic remedy. 8. Fire Hemp Seed Tea () Rich in monounsaturated fat, protein, and vitamin E, fire hemp seeds are believed to have many health benefits. Constipation prevention, anti-aging, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases - just to name a few. Moreover, fire hemp seeds have been used as Chinese medicine for over 2,000 years, and are still loved by many Chinese medicine practitioners today. 9. White Sugar Cane Tea () A popular summertime drink in Hong Kong, White Sugar Cane Tea provides a sweet, refreshing way to cool excess internal heat. It has cooling properties to relieve sore throats, coughs, nosebleeds, and other signs of heat. Made from mugwort root, this liang cha clears heat in the body while replenishing its fluids. 10. Chrysanthemum Tea () At the heart of this potent brew is the chrysanthemum flower, widely revered in traditional medicine for its heat-clearing, detoxifying, and Yin-nourishing properties. For Hong Kongers prone to sore throats, fever, or dryness, sipping warm Chrysanthemum Tea provides gentle relief. With its subtle sweetness and pretty petals, Chrysanthemum Tea conjures memories of healing remedies passed down through generations. 11. Guilinggao () Also known as tortoise jelly, Guilinggao is a traditional Chinese dessert and medicine that's been treasured for centuries for its wide-ranging health benefits. According to legend, the Tongzhi Emperor's smallpox was cured by this formula until he prematurely stopped the treatment. While tortoise shell was originally one of the key ingredients in the ancient and authentic recipe for Guilinggao, it's been increasingly replaced by agar in modern versions due to the ethical concerns around sourcing the rare shells. The rich brown jelly may be bittersweet, but do give it a try - it's believed to improve your circulation, muscle growth, skin complexion, and kidney function!
