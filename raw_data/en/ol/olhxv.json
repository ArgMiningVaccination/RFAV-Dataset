These include: chronic pain, headache, back pain, and arthritis, and more. Treatments can be one to two times per week or, depending on the patient's medical condition, can be more frequent sessions. Acupuncturists use sterile needles or other methods (e.g., pressure) to stimulate specific points on the body. The most common technique involves inserting thin metal needles into the skin. Acupuncturists use different needling methods and vary the depth of the needles to produce different effects and results. In some cases, the acupuncturist applies a tiny electric current to the needle (called electrical stimulation). Needles used by acupuncturists are sterile, non-toxic, and are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Acupuncture is a safe, painless procedure that carries very few risks.
