Box 616, 6200 MD Maastricht, the Netherlands Abstract \u2014Asurvey among 293 GPs in the Netherlands showed that many believe in the efficacy of common alternative procedures. High scores were especially found for manual therapy, yoga, acupuncture, hot bath therapy and homoeopathy. Other procedures, such as iridology, faith healing and many food supplements, were considered less useful. Key words \u2014alternative medicine, efficacy, general practice, questionnaire INTRODUCTION Alternative medicine is quite popular among GPs in the United Kingdom [1-3]. An earlier study in the Netherlands showed that almost all GPs refer certain patients to alternative practitioners, and that half of them practice alternative medicine themselves (mostly homoeopathy) [4]. This policy may partly be caused by patients' pressure, financial motives or reluctance to prescribe pure placebos. However, this report shows that many GPs really believe in the efficacy of certain alternative procedures. DOCTORS AND METHODS From the register of GPs in the Netherlands a random sample of 400 doctors was drawn. In the summer of 1989 they received a postal questionnaire to state their belief in the efficacy of many alternative procedures [5]. It was stressed that our interest was in specific effects, beyond placebo effects, and that all procedures should be considered under optimum circumstances (complete compliance, expert prac- titioner). They could give their opinion on a scale from 0 to 10. The familiar report marks should not indicate perceived quantitative effects, but the degree of belief in any efficacy. Small but almost certain effects should be rated much higher than large but seriously doubted effects (say, 9 vs 2). RESULTS Five addresses turned out to be wrong. After two reminders the response was 74% or 293 doctors. Table 1 shows their scores (mean and distribution). In the text we only mention the percentage of positive scores (6-10); the width of its 95% confidence inter- val is approx. 10%. The scores of various alternative procedures are reported under seven headings.Acupuncture Especially for patients with chronic pain, acu- puncture is considered efficacious by half of the doctors. Some 25% believe acupuncture to be a useful treatment for asthma or smoking addiction. Neural therapy is positively scored by 15%. Homoeopathy About 45% thinks that homoeopathic remedies are efficacious in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections or hay fever. For chronic joint problems this is 30%. Anthroposophical medicine makes sense to 22%. Spiritual techniques Compared to acupuncture and homoeopathy doc- tors give less credit to faith healing (7%) or healing (17%). Nevertheless, 30% report to believe that hypnosis can help to quit smoking. For patients with psychological problems yoga appeals to 62%, and more conventional psychotherapy to 83%. Manual techniques Manual therapy in the Netherlands is generally not considered alternative medicine anymore. No less than 80% believes it to be efficacious in the treatment of patients with chronic neck or back problems, compared to 71% for conventional physiotherapy. Hot bath (Kurort) therapy is positively rated by 46% for rheumatic patients. With 14% reflexology (foot massage) scores much lower. Natural remedies Among the many available products we inquired after evening primrose oil (premenstrual syndrome, atopic eczema), garlic (cardiovascular disease) and ginseng (decreased vitality). Less than 10% considers them efficacious. The 'Moerman' diet is well-known 625626 PAUL KNIPSCHILD et al. in the Netherlands as an alternative therapy for cancer patients. However, only 12% of the GPs believes it to have any efficacy. Orthomolecular medicine The same negative opinion is usually expressed for megadoses of calcium, beta-carotene or vitamin C (cancer prevention), vitamin E(atherosclerosis) or combinations of vitamins (general prevention). Vita- minCin megadose is considered efficacious by 20% for common cold, whereas vitamin B6in cases of the premenstrual syndrome is positively scored by 35%. Miscellaneous Many other procedures are generally believed to make no sense. Among the diagnostic procedures less than 10% considers astrology or iridology to be proper medical practice. The same goes for ozon therapy and chelation therapy (cardiovascular dis- ease), and for enzyme therapy, cell therapy or injec- tions with thymus extract. DISCUSSION Our study shows that many Dutch GPs believe in the efficacy of common alternative procedures. Of course, it is only a survey of opinions and no conclusions can be drawn about true efficacy. We are surprised about the high amount of credit that is given to certain (to us) incomprehensiblepractices such as acupuncture, homoeopathy and anthroposophy. It must be realized that even low percentages of positive scores represent a good many doctors. Especially if there is a large contrast between belief in and evidence of efficacy, the publication of literature reviews and empirical studies in scientific journals and the lay press makes sense.
