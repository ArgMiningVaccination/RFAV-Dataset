Don't worry, you're reading this article so you've come to the right place. We're walking you through four easy ways to remove toxic ingredients and chemicals from your home. Consider this your beginner's guide to all-natural living; home detox 101. Use non-toxic household cleaners. Whether you begin by focusing on one category like the kitchen, or feel ambitious with a complete overhaul by clearing out all your chemical-filled products\u2014either way\u2014a shift to natural ingredients is step one for home detox. Innovative brands like [Ecover](http://rstyle.me/+zsCunihjxBIW8GzYhfXbXA) and [The Laundress](http://rstyle.me/+fnoLmJwaszZUfK_a2FF3Ew) have made it easy to transition and stock the home with non-harmful replacements. You can even try an at-home solution with this [DIY recipe](https://poosh.com/how-to-make-nontoxic-cleaning-solution/). Swap plastic for alternative materials. Plastic is extremely bad for the environment and our bodies, especially when used to reheat food. Many plastics contain Bisphenol-A (known as BPA) and harmful phthalates. If you don't know whether or not your plastic containers and kids' dinnerware is completely free of these chemicals, play it safe and don't use them. Research suggests exposure to these chemicals can cause horrible health risks ranging from cancer to diabetes (to name a few). When you can, try and opt for [stainless steel](http://rstyle.me/+bcoUJvRRSDV2cS536iqIfw) or glass options for kitchen necessities like cups, plates, and cutlery. Other kitchen hacks to avoid plastic include: using [mason jars](http://rstyle.me/+RhVJCFcBFZxwm-3iTYy5tA), rolling up salad in a damp cloth, keeping carrots fresh in a glass of water, and freezing food in [silicone zip-lock bags](http://rstyle.me/+cQPlOfz6HEpL4xxprACmBw). Use organic bedding and mattresses. All of the mattresses in Kourt's house are from [Custom Comfort](http://customcomfortmattress.com/), which uses [organic materials](https://poosh.com/organic-bedroom-sheets/) and are made with cotton and wool. This is important because some mattresses contain petroleum-based polyester or polyurethane foam, which can emit toxins. Her mattresses are from [Custom Comfort](http://customcomfortmattress.com/), but [Nook](http://nooksleep.com/collections/crib-mattresses) is a great place to find organic baby crib options. For sheets, a good rule of thumb is to look for brands that meet the [National Organic Program standards](http://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program) or are certified by [Oeko-Tex](http://www.oeko-tex.com/en/business/certifications_and_services/ots_100/ots_100_start.xhtml). Invest in water and air purifiers. One way to cut down on waste at home is to drink filtered water from the tap in reusable glasses. Another option is using a stainless steel countertop water filtration system. Kourt also uses air purifiers from [Dyson](http://rstyle.me/+y3fxTf7U4B4z9I0psZBa5Q) to filter out pollutants and particles. Keep them in rooms where you spend the most time, like your bedroom and family room. "}
