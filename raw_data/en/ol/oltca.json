Student assignments include work as teacher aides, tutors, counselors, and research aides at all levels of educational centers, international institutions, geriatric institutions, mental institutions, centers for handicapped individuals, and museums. Issues in American Health Care. Field placements are in such health-related activities as patient care, research, and education, with primary emphasis on student contact with people involved in health care. The Arts and Their Audiences. 'Ihis course consists of weekly seminars and internships in Washington arts organizations. Intern placements include such organizations as the Kennedy Center, Wolf Trap Farm, and the Folger Theatre Group. Independent Study. Allows students to combine field work with academic study involving field placements (12-20 hours per week) and complementary ~cademic program of study, under the supervision of an appropriate faculty member. Students must \"contract\" with the placement agency, the faculty member, and the Service-Learning Program. Community Planning and Development. Field placements in either public or private urban and regional planning agencies to gain an under\u00ad standing of the role of planning, research and analysis. Students also attend a weekly seminar conducted by faculty and city officials. Contact: Dr. Neil Seldman Assistant Director 676-7565 GUIDE TO COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT PROGRAMS AT THE GEORGE WASHilJGTON UNIVERSITY Office of Public Relations George Washington University Washington, D.C. 20052 1978 George Washington University is an institution of national and inter\u00ad national stature and importance--but it is also intimately linked with the city of which it is a part, Washington, D.C. GW is not an island in the city, but is involved with and committed to the community in many ways. For example, our Medical Center is in the news when Judge Sirica of Watergate fame suffers a heart attack and is taken to GW Hospital, and when injured hostages from B'nai B'rith, the District Building, and the Islamic Mosque or Iranian demonstrators 'from the Ellipse arrive there in ambulances. These are the things you hear about. But the university serves its community in a number of other, less publicized ways. GW is one of the cultural focal points of Washington and offers a wide variety of lectures, concerts, dramatic productions, art, publications, medical, scientific, and educational programs that are open to people from the community. Economically, George Washington University is a major financial resource and one of the largest private employers in the Washington metropolitan area. Seven thousand full-time and part-time members of the university community-\u00ad faculty, carpenters, clerks, electricians, nurses, administrators, and others-\u00ad will earn some $80 million in 1977-78. GW's 16,000 students spend money in the community in addition to tuition and fees. It is estimated that of the 5,000 full-time undergraduates, 80 per cent are from outside the Washington metropolitan area. Including tuition, this fraction of GW's student enrollment alone spends more than $6,000 each academic year, amounting to a $24 million injection into the local economy. \u00b7 GW will spend $150 million this year--$410,000 each day, mostly in Washington, on everything from salaries to paper clips and panel trucks. This large budget also provides scholarships for many students to attend GW who otherwise could not. Some $2.6 million was used in student aid last year. Out of their own salaries, GW employees have personally contributed nearly $200,000 during the last five years to United Way of the National Capital Area which goes toward the support of 140 United Way agencies in D.C., lVlaryland, and Virginia. Our 510-bed University Hospital furnished nearly 151,000 patient days of care to hospitalized patients during 1976-77 and attended to over 40,000 patient visits through its emergency room. In caring for these patients and those in the University Clinic, the Medical Center provided approximately $6 million in services for which it was not reimbursed. A portion of this sum was spent in caring for charity patients and a portion was the cost of care for those, who though they were not on charity, were unable to make full payment for the care they received. Another important cornmunity asset is GW's alumni. About 32,000 of the 66,000 graduates live in Washington and the metropolitan area. Among them are thousands of attorneys, physicians, educators, engineers, and public servants. 67 V. DIVISION OF EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMS The Division of Experimental Programs is responsible for the development of new academic programs and for the continued development and coordination of programs incorporating off-campus resources. The two most prominent academic programs are Experimental Humanities and Service-Learning. The Experimental Humanities course offerings provide students the opportunity to combine field-study with classroom work. The Service-Learning program integrates supervised work-study with class\u00ad room ~eminars in such ar~as as law, education, health care, community planning, and the arts, in which students are placed in part-time work situations in public and private agencies. In this program students provide needed services to Washington communities in exchange for on-the-job experience. Contact: Prof. Roderick S. French Director 676-7565 GW-ANACOSTIA COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CONSORTIUM PROJECT. GW-ACDC is a community-campus partnership which was developed to work towards the planned development of the Anacostia-Congress Heights area of Far South\u00ad ~ast Washingt~n. GW-ACDC is a singular effort in that its thrust originates in the community rather than on the campus. GW assesses cornmunity needs through data collection and information gathering from area organizations and residents; additionally, attempts have been made to strengthen ties with those area organizations. Problems uncovered in that process are then transmitted to GW's Division of Experimental Programs in the form of specific requests for research, corrnnunity service student internships, and technical assistance. ' An example of activities includes community planning studies conducted by GW urban planning students and a free community legal clinic which includes a yearly income tax service. GW has also begun a working relationship with the University of the District of Columbia to provide a broader range of services to the Anacostia-Congress Heights area.

SEAS offers to selected secondary school students who have recently completed their junior year the opportunity to attend, at no cost, a one-week engineering seminar to inform them about the engineering profession, the courses an engineering major is required to study in college, and the benefits of a career in engineering. Thirty-three high school students attended the first seminar held in June 1977. The program is completely funded by SEAS. Contact : W. F. Shanahan Manager, Engineering Admissions 676-6158 TRANSPORTATION WORKSHOP. The workshop involves the cooperation of a multidisciplinary student body --mostly engineers, urban and regional planners, and economists --and a multidisciplinary guidance staff drawn from the university, the U.S. Department of Transportation, local governmental agencies, and consulting firms. An urban area is selected for study. Information is gathered on the transportation needs of the selected area, and on the thinking of local planners and decision makers concerning feasible solutions. Local and regional problems and land-use objec~ives are identified, and applicable technologies are evaluated. The workshop then gradually acquires the character of a team project, aimed at the definition of elements of a transportation system that may be designed to serve the land-use and other objectives previously identified. Each student in the sequence is required to choose a pertinent aspect of the problem within his field of competence, to study it in depth, and to participate L11 the capacity of a 11specialist11 in his chosen subject in weekly\u00b7 conferences with the guidance staff and with fellow students. Continuing contacts are maintained with the governmental agencies involved in planning and decision-making in the region under study. At the end of the course each student reviews and discusses in a term paper the ideas which he has developed in his studv and offers recomnendations. At the end of each oroject, the papers which are considered most worthy are collected in a volume, cooies of which are sent to agencies and organizations in thP. urban region considered in the study, as well as to the National Technical Information Service for further duplication and distribution. Contact : Prof. ,Joseph V. Foa Director, Transoortation Engineering Programs 676-6149 In addition to these cultural and economic contributions, GW involves itself intimately with comrm.mity needs, offering service and educational opportunities to government employees, industrialists, business people minorities, and women. Many GW students and faculty have chosen to ' involve themselves personally with comnunity and community-oriented projects and programs. This booklet is a partial guide to those GW comnunity involvements. 4~ Lloyd H. Elliott President George Washington University 4 Portrait of a University: Like many institutions, The George Washington University was born of a need and an idea. When it was founded in 1821 George Washington had been dead for 22 years, but his belief that a uni\u00ad versity was needed in the new capital city had not died. A similar belief in the city as a site for a great educational institution animated Luther Rice, Bap\u00ad tist missionary and the University's founder, in forging ahead with plans for it. And so, on Febru\u00ad ary 9, 1821, a bill duly passed by Congress was signed by President James Monroe, and the Co\u00ad lumbian College in the District of Columbia came into being. Its first home was a building on a 47-acre plot on what became known as \"College Hill.\" The years between 1821 and the Civil War were marked by growth despite severe financial crisis; in fact the first of the University's additional aca\u00ad demic components (now numbering eleven) had their origins in this period, the School of Medicine and Health Sciences in 1824 and the National Law Center in 1865. During the war the College build\u00ad ing served as a hospital. The 1870s saw two significant developments: an Act of Congress amended the charter (1873) so thatthe institution became Columbian University, and pursuing its commitment as a urban univer\u00ad sity, Columbian moved even more deeply into the city, to 15th and H Streets. By the 1880s women had been admitted to the Medical School and the College. GW also became active in an area where it was a pioneer: higher education for the em\u00ad ployed or \"late afternoon\" student. Shortly after the turn of the century, the Uni\u00ad versity adopted the name by which it is known today and moved to its present location in the \"Foggy Bottom\" area of Washington. Both World Wars saw the University respond in terms of plac\u00ad ing its resources at the disposal of the govern\u00ad ment, and both in turn increased the University's sphere in the broader world of national and inter\u00ad national concern. By the middle 1950s, a national magazine described GW as a \"Genius Factory\" and \"the nation's most cosmopolitan university.\" More recent decades have been marked by consistant and purposeful growth in the Uni\u00ad versity's physical plant and by academic innova\u00ad tion within the framework of traditional values. Today the hopes of Washington and others have found fulfillment-the Federal City has a uni\u00ad versity worthy of it.

Federal regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehab\u00ad ilitation Act of 1973 call for an explicit statement that the requirement not to discriminate on the basis of sex or handicap extends to employment in and admission to such programs and activities. Inquiries concerning the application of this policy and federal laws and regulations concerning discrimination in edu\u00ad cation or employment programs and activities may be addressed to Marianne Phelps, Assistant Provost for Affirmative Action, Rice Hall, GWU, Washington, D.C. 20052, or to the Director of the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. 65 aptitude, is given annually on a Saturday in both January and February. Approximately 75 to 100 students take these tests here each year. Contact: W. F. Shanahan Manager, Engineering Admissions 676-6158' PROBLEJVIS IN OPERATIONS RESEARCH. Problems in Operations Research, (OR 291) is a course required in the final semester for all master of science students in operations research who select the non-thesis option. The class breaks up into teams of two or three people to work on real problems in the corrmunity. Many teams do projects for the District of Columbia government on such topics as fire station location, cleaning schedules for catch basins, and business license processing. Projects have also been performed for other local governrrents--including Montgomery, Arlington, and Fairfax Counties, and the City of Alexandria--on topics ranging from scheduling bus routes for special education students to computer-aided tax assessment. Federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Energy Administration, nonprofit foundations such as the Police Foundation and the American Association of Railroads, and private industries have also provided problems to OR 291 students for their projects. No transfer of funds of any nature takes place. The organization for which the project is done is expected only to donate time to help the student team become familiar with the problem and with data sources, and in return receives an oral briefing and final written report. The students gain invaluable \"real world\" experience from their projects, while the organizations gain the services of soon-to-be master of science graduates. Contact: Prof, Donald Gross Chairman Dept. of Operations Research 676-6084 SCIENCE FAIR FOR JUNIOR HIGH AND SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS. Each spring SEAS holds a science fair for selected projects of junior high and secondary school students who have competed in one of 86 other local science fairs in the metropolitan Washington areao The object of the science fair is to encourage students to study engineering. Usually about 40 students are selected to participate. Each receives a gift certificate for participation and several receive monetary prizes. SEAS faculty serve as judges of the exhibits.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Langley Research Center joined with George Washington University's School of Engineering and Applied Science in 1971 to create the Joint Institute for Advancement of Flight Sciences (JIAFS). This institute is dedicated to increasing the nation's research and engineering capabilities in relevant technical fields such as acoustics, aeronautics, and structures and dynamics. The institute, which is located at the Langley Research Center, is dedicated to the advanced training of students and professional engineers in acoustics, aeronautics, environmental modeling, materials science, structures and dynamics, and other relevant areas, and provides a center for advanced research by bringing together researchers and scholars from these fields for the exchange of ideas and findings. The institute also provides facilities for qualified researchers and scholars who want to engage in research work in these areas. The objective of the program is to prepare qualified graduate students for careers in research, development, design, and teaching to meet the challenges of ever-increasing technical problems and the nation's needs in these fields. Education and research opportunities offered in the program combine the academic resources of George Washington University and the professional research resources and facilities of NASA-Langley Research Center. Research Programs Under JIAFS. JIAFS research activities are supported largely by NASA-Langley Research Center with grants totalling $1.4 million in 22 projects. SEAS Dean Harold Liebowitz is principal inves\u00ad tigator; Dr. J.L. Whitesides, Associate Professor of Engineering and Applied Science, is the coordinator on site. The Chairman of GW's Civil, Mechanical, and Environmental Engineering Department, Professor S.W. Yuan, acts as the overall coordinator for these projects. The Civil, Mechanical, and Environmental Engineering Department offers a range of academic programs in acoustics, aeronautics, environmental modeling, fluid mechanics and thermal sciences, solid mechanics and materials engineering, and structures and dynamics at the NASA-Langley Research Center which parallel and support many research projects. Currently, some 30 graduate students working toward M.S. and D.Sc. degrees are supported by JIAFS projects. Contact: Prof. S.W.

Many SEAS faculty have volunteered their services to visit secondary schools in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia to give talks on engineering as a career, job prospects, cooperative education, college engineering curricula, and student preparation for the study of. engineering. In 1976-77, about 30 secondary schools asked for and received visits from SEAS faculty. Contact: W .F. Shanahan Manager, Engineering Admissions 676-6158 CONTINUING ENGINEERING EDUCATION PROGRAM. Today most engineers and their employers are well aware of the rapid advances of knowledge in science and technology. The inability to understand and to apply new technologies can mean both personal and corporate failure. To prevent potential obsolescence, engineers must involve themselves in a continuing program of technical reading and organized learning. The School of Engineering and Applied Science meets this need with a comprehensive program of non-credit courses. The program's objective is to increase the competence of practicing engineers rather than to grant further academic degrees. Staff reorganizations require many engineers to change their specialties or to take on additional duties within their present jobs. Continuing engineering education provides the education and skills the engineer needs to effectively make these changes. Continuing Engineering Education is also an aid in qualifying for promotions and in maintaining certification in certain professional fields. The program presents about 300 non-credit courses each year. About half of them last for five days (30 classroom hours), while others are for two three or four days. Some courses are presented in the evening (two-hour s~ssions'once a week for 10 to 12 weeks), or on Saturday morning. Last year about 6,000 students attended. Presentati?n of theo~ ~s o~e~ . augmented by workshops to give registrants practice in the specific discipline. All courses stress practical applications. Students from all over the nation and from many foreign countries have participated in coui~ses. The cost for the courses offered varies. Contact: J.E.

GENERAL UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS ADAPTED PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND THERAPEUTIC RECREATION (MASTER'S DEGREE PROGRAM). This is a three-year project for personnel at the master's level in adapted physi~al education and therapeutic recreation, funded by the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped, U.S. Office of Education. The focus is on competency-based instruction in the two fields. The project covers faculty support and student traineeships. Contact: Prof. James Breen, Ph.D. Chairman Department of Human Kinetics and Leisure Studies 676-6280 ART THERAPY. The Graduate Training Program in Art Therapy provides training in the use of art to help people with problems in living as well as those with severe physical disabilities having psychological implications for their adjustment. The program is part of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. It is possible to complete the course of study on a part-time basis; however, a majority of students study on a full-time basis. Most classes are held at night, further enhancing the students' opportunity for work and study. Preparation in human psychology and in the self-expressive aspects of studio art are prerequisites to admission. Field work and practicum courses are integral components of the program: field work is an extension of classroom learning while the practicum focuses upon therapeutic work with either clients or patients. About 50 graduate students provide service in the greater Washington, D.C. area. They are equally distributed in D.C., Northern Virginia, and nearby Maryland. Recipients of art therapy services can be found on the psychiatric services of general hospitals, in psychiatric day-care centers, out-patient community mental health centers, university clinics, centers for the care and treatment of the elderly, cente~s for the treatment of alcoholism, jails, the National Institutes of Health, St. Elizabeth's, and the Walter Reed Hospital.

The focus is to provide training for therapeutic recreation specialists to work with severely handicapped adults in clinical rehabilitation settings. Grant funds cover faculty support and student traineeships. Contact: David C. Park Project Director Department of Human Kinetics and Leisure Studies 676-6985 59 INSTITUTE OF LAW AND AGING. The National Law Center and Administration on Aging, DHEW, jointly address the national problem of the need for access to legal representation and counsel by elderly people with low and moderate incomes through the Institute of Law and Aging. Under the direction of Professors Donald P. Rothschild and Eric S. Sirulnik,the institute serves as a clearinghouse for information and materials on legal services for elderly people. Paralegal Training for Seniors provides legal education for persons 55 and older to improve their lives as well as substantially assist other older people in need of legal assistance. All courses focus on the impact of law on the elderly and include Legal Research and Writing, Administrative Law, Paralegal Practice, Consumer Problems, Disability, Health Care Delivery, Housing, Medicaid/Medicare, Pensions, Social Security/ Supplemental Security Income, Tax, Trusts and Estates/Probate Problems, Veterans Benefits, and a Clinical Placement. Protection for Elderly People (PEP) is a storefront legal services office located at 1806 Adams Mill Rd., N.W., in a neighborhood heavily populated with older people. Attorneys and paralegals supervise law students and paralegal students who provide services ranging from will writing and probate counseling to representation at administrative hearings before the Social Security Administration and in various divisions of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. On- site legal services are provided to elderly people who are unable to come into the PEP office. An average of 100 clients per month is handled by this four-year-old outreach program on a no-fee basis. Seven textbook supplements have been developed for use in conjunction with existing law school materials and focus on the effects that the traditional areas of law have on the elderly. Titles currently available for distribution include: \"Administrative Practice in Social Security,\" \"Agency Practice in Supplemental Security Income,\" \"Health Problems of \"Taxation,\" and \"Probate Problems of the Elderly.\" A textbook for use in training senior citizens as paralegals and a training manual for paralegals on pensions are available, and other manuals are being developed. A survey of all part-time and full-time law professors in the United States is being conducted to determine the kinds of materials, training, services and research available concerning the elderly at every law school. Survey results will be widely distributed to facilitate the establishment and expansion of programs. A quarterly newsletter is published, and staff presentations and training sessions for community and agency groups are other important facets of the institute's work in educating the public to the legal needs of older Americans. Contact: Donald P. Rothschild Professor of Law 676-6364 58 11 Some want to follow up on a long-time fascination with the law. Others are looking for a new interest now that they are nearing retirement. Others are interested in putting a little \"structure\" in their lives. For the majority of students taking the Paralegal Training for Seniors Program at George Washington University's National Law Center, however, the main reason is to help others as weZZ as themselves with the legal aspects of problems Zike housing, Medicare, and Social Security that are faced by the elderly. \"They are eager, extremely conscientious students,\" says Judith Ferber, director of the paralegal program at GWU, who also teaches a legal research course. uit 's a joy to teach them because they 're diligent. ~/hen I come to class I know that everyone has read the assignment and is prepared. And, they bring their life experiences into class and that makes discussions and questions challenging. \" Professor Donald P. Rothschild, co-director of the GWU Institute of Law and Aging, said it is important to have a course geared toward senior citizens 55 or older because \"it would be an enormous waste of energy if we didn't. ~le want to tap that talent. We feel that it's better for the elderly to work with the elderly because it's less patronizing\" than having a young person help the elderly, he said . . . Beatrice Aitchison, 69, a retired government employee, said she ''needed structure in my life, something constructive to do with my time. I've always been interested in the law and when I saw a little notice of this course in the paper, I thought it would be fun to go back to school.\" Excerpted from \"!?aralegal Program Opens New Doors for Senior Citizens\" by Tonya Sanders The Washington Star, December 21, 1977 COLLEGE OF GENERAL STUDIES. CGS was established to extend the educational resources of The George Washington University to the community at large. Now in its 27th year, CGS, the major off-campus division of the university, offers degree and non-degree academic programs, both credit and non-credit, for adults wishing to expand their continuing educational needs. Experimental pilot programs of study are developed in cooperation with other colleges and schools within the university in response to specific needs of the local government and business community. CGS works closely with education directors, public school officials, and personnel administrators in metropolitan area governments, businesses, and industries to expand the educational opportunities available to the mature student. In cooperation with these groups, CGS offers courses at off-campus centers throughout the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. Contact: Dean Robert Holland College of General Studies 676-7000 Special Workshops in Education. In response to needs articulated by individuals within the D.C. Public Schools, the university has developed specialized workshops for selected school personnel. Each workshop is designed to help the target population focus on and find solutions to a specific problem or set of problems. The workshops generally have 25-30 participants and are usually funded by the schools. All workshops are conducted in D.C. school facilities. Participants are encouraged to develop skills and materials to take back to share with their students and their colleagues. Examples of specific workshops that have been conducted in the past year are Library Skills Learning Management for School Librarians and Teachers, Diagnostic and Instructional Techniques in Reading for Special Needs, Competency-Eased Curriculum in Mathe\u00ad matics, Competency-Based Curriculum in Reading, Planning and Developing a Facilitative Learning Environment in the Open Classroom, and Implementing Learning Management Strategies in the Open Space School.

Established in 1964, Continuing Education for Women encourages women and men throughout the Washington metropolitan area to pursue personal, educational, and career goals. Its comprehensive program includes counseling services, academic credit courses, enrichment classes, on-site workshops for government and business, and five career training programs. Recognized as a pioneer in continuing education, the center extends its services to the community both in speaking to organizations and in consulting with other institutions wishing to introduce similar programs. The center also works with business, professional, and community organizations to provide funding for financial assistance to its students. Developing New Horizons for Women, scheduled at campus and suburban locations, has enabled more than 5,000 women to increase their self-understanding and set short\u00ad and long-term goals. This group counseling experience, also offered to men and young adults, includes testing, introspective exercises, and group discussion. Participants explore interests, aptitudes, and values; they consider options and make decisions about education, career, personal development, and community involvement. Academic credit courses taught by GWU faculty meet once a week days or evenings on campus and in the suburbs. Noncredit courses allow students to improve academic or career skills or pursue personal interests. Counselors and GWU faculty are also available for employer-sponsored on-site workshops and courses. The five one-year career training programs taught in the evenings by professionals practicing in the Washington area are Legal Assistant, Landscape Architect Assistant, Publication Specialist, Management Specialist, and Fund- Raising Administrator.

Students working at the phone bank have handled over 43,000 complaints since the service was established in 1970. Complaints alleging fraud are fed into a computer and the resulting reports are used as a pre-investigative tool by the U.S. Attorney's Office and the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. The phone lines (202-785-1001) are open weekday afternoons and receive consumer problems ranging from automobile repair to nondelivery of goods. This program is funded by government and private grants. Most recently, the center has received a grant from the Food and Drug Administration to prepare materials to teach professionals and consumer advocates how to obtain access to the agency. The center has also organized other consumer protection programs including Operation PEP (Protection for Elderly People). This group provides information concerning special services available to the elderly, educational programs to protect senior citizens in their daily dealings with local merchants, and exposes fraudulent activities that prey especially on the older residents of Washington.

Contact : Nona Boren Director, Gerontology Program 676-3721 15 Gold stars for GW's Educational Opportunity Program, which enables deserving students who live in the District of Columbia to attend GW, and for the perseverance of two new alumni. Adrienne Mims, BS'?B, the first in her family to attend college, and Donald Toatley, BS'?B, a high school dropout before he finished night school at Spingarn STAY five years ago, will enter medical school in the fall. Together, they were accepted by 11 medical schools--Toatley will attend GW; Adrienne, Stanford. \"There would have been no way for Adrienne to attend the university without the EOP progra111, \" said Mrs. Wilma Jenkins, Adr\u00b7ienne 's mother. 11EOP not only gave her financial support, but also moral support. 11 During her junior year Adrienne was inducted into the \u00b7premedical honor society, the only EOP student in the group. Her crade point average within her major is 3.4. For Donald Toatley, one of five children of Mr. and Mrs. Peterson Toatley, EOP meant a chance to transcend the educational limitations imposed by a non-competitive secondary school. 11I entered the pre-med program at Gr./ with a limited scie~ce background, because the science curriculum was not emphasized at the night school I attended, 11 he explained. After a difficult first year at GW, he established himself academically through heightened self-discipline and EOP support. 11I learned that you ne\u00b7ver fail until you stop trying, 11 he said. The two, among many EOP students who graduated in May, aren't the first EOP students to continue their education. Since l969, three others in the program have gone on to medical school; one to law school. Excerpt \"From Mortarboards to Stethoscopes\" GW Times, May/June, 1978 16 EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM. The Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) at George Washington was established in 1969 to increase the opportunity for District of Columbia residents with academic potential, but limited financial resources, to attend George Washington, and, once here, to insure their academic success. EOP is a comprehensive program which assists student~ through academic advis:img, personal counseling and financial aid. EOP candidates are identified through recommendations made by high school counselors and teachers, current EOP students, and through such programs as Upward Bound and Talent Search. Financial support for EOP students is based on need an:i is awarded in the form of University EOP-Tuition Grants, federally funded Basic Educational Opportunity Grants (BEOG) or loans, D.C. Government Grants or loans, private scholarships, or a combination of these. The university currently has a commitment of $366,820 to the 143 students enrolled in the program. Forty students are admitted to the Educational Opportunity Program each year and participate in the free Pre- college Review and Enrichment Program (PREP) arrl in the Tutorial Prognam. PREP, which runs from about July 1 through the end of the surrmer sessions, involves students in intensive college-level work in the areas of communication, mathematics and science.

The Health Staff Seminar, a program operating under the Office of Policy Studies and Special Projects, assists federal level professional staff in the field of health in obtaining a realistic understanding of current health practices and problems. The program attempts to improve cormnunication between Washington-based policy makers and practitioners in the field through a series of meetings, training sessions, and out-of-town site visits providing participants a variety of opportunities to explore critical health policy issues. HSS advocates no particular health policies nor does it take positions on pending legislation. By examining issues as a group in a non-partisan, off\u00ad the-record setting, HSS members have the latitude to consider all aspects of an issue, regardless of political affj_liation or job constraints. Permanent participants are senior federal employees of the legislative and executive branches of government involved in the legislative or implementation process. The seminar serves an estimated 400 policy makers. Over the years, it has received funding from the Carnegie Corporation, the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Milbank Memorial Fund, the New World Foundation, and The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Corporate contributions now help support the program as well. While there are a number of health policy research groups throughout the country, HSS is the only one specifically designed to assist federal health policy makers on a continuing basis.

Persons in whom abnormalities are detected are advised that they should seek the advice of an ophthalmologist. Contact: Dr. Mansour Armaly Chairman Dept. of Ophthalmology 676-4050 50 PACEMAKER CLINIC. The Pacemaker Clinic has developed a sophisticated system to closely scrutinize the medical and mechanical aspects of the care patients whose hearts function with the aid of a pacemaker, a complex piece of machinery on which their lives depend. Periodic and frequent follow-ups are essential to detect early pacemaker malfunction and permit elective replacement of the unit thus avoiding unnecessary emergency situations. Part of the plan for care includes out-patient visits with a team comprised of cardiologists, specially trained nurses, house staff and medical students. In 1970, the clinic developed a telephone monitoring system which permits close medical evaluation with a minimum of disruption to the patient's normal routine. Patients simply telephone the clinic and attach the receiver to a specially designed apparatus which transmits electrocardiographic data through the telephone to the clinic. The data is instantly printed out on an ECG machine and the information stored.in the Medical Ce~ter's computers to provide the staff with easily accessi~le, accurate patient profiles. Monitoring can be performed anywhere the patien 1~ has access to a telephone --home, office and, recently, on an ocean iner and a E1;1I'?pean vacation. The system reduces the patient's dependence on the physician and the amount of leisure and work time that is lost when frequent office visits are the only method of evaluation. Telephone monitoring will reveal early signs of pacemaker malfunction so that th~ patient can come in for an office visit with the physician. The system increases the mobility of individuals with permanent pacemakers and enables the~ to continue to be productive, active members of society. Furthermore, while the quality of patient care is increased the cost of that care is lowered by reducing the number of office visit~ and avoiding unnecessary replacement of the pacemaker. Contact: Dr. Brian Gaffney Director Pacemaker Clinic 676-4177 POST-CORONARY GROUP/EXERCISE THERAPY STUDY.

Biostatistical and epidemiological analysis of the data will be conducted and provided to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Contact : Dr. Larry McGowan Director Division of Gynecologic Oncology 676-4357 48 MOH'S CHEMOSURGERY. Chemosurgery is a very exacting procedure of surgically removing skin cancer. The procedure utilizes a method of mapping small pieces of tissue previously removed from the cancerous area and examining each of the tissue specimens meticulously under a microscope. In this way, minute cancerous cells are removed, preventing spread and recurrence of the disease. Mohs' chemosurgery has an extremely high cure rate. It is used principally for the basal cell carcinoma, whose borders are clinically indistinct, and tumors that are exceedingly large; it is also used for the squamous cell carcinoma. An adaptation of the classic Mohs' technique is being performed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, but George Washington University is the only medical center where the procedure is accessible to the public. At this time there are approximately three such operations performed each week, but these numbers are expected to increase over the next several years.

Through an awareness of current vocational trends and close contact with private and government businesses, homebound and non-homebound jobs are developed in computer operations, insurance claims, statistical analysis, accounts maintenance, and microfilm operations, as well as clerk, receptionist, and information-handling positions. To successfully fill these positions, jobs and clients are carefully matched. Through the Job Placement Process necessary adjustments are made to complete a smooth transition of the client into the work environment and routine. Contact is maintained with the referring counselor during this process to insure complete involvement. The laboratory has shown conclusively the cost/benefit advantages of the placement process in development of appropriate jobs, enhancement of physical function, and realistic job placement for the severely disabled person. The laboratory encourages implementation of the job placement approach through workshops, conferences, consultation, and a future monograph series to aid employers, employees, rehabilitation practitioners, and consumers in using the Job Placement Process. The laboratory is supported in part by Rehabilitation Services Administration RT-9 and the Developmental Disabilities Office. Staff members have various backgrounds: biomedical engineers, industrial designers, vocational counselors, occupational therapists, and secretaries.

Novak Administrator George Washington University Hospital 676-2500 JOB DEVELOPMENT LABORATORYo The Job Development Laboratory was established in 1973 as a result of a successful four-year research and demonstration project at GWU Rehabilitation Research and Training Center (Rr-9) . This homebound employment project demonstrates the feasibility of competitive employment for severely disabled persons. Clients are placed in occupations ranging from minimally skilled to highly skilled (and highly paid) positions. The laboratory has established and refined a model for successful placement of persons with severe disabilities. Research clients (considered infeasible for conventional vocational rehabilitation methods and accepted on the basis of the ongoing research projects) are referred through 23 The children doing an Indian dance seemed as noisy and high-spirited as any group of elementary school youngsters, but they were far from being a typical hunch of children. All of them were reading at least two years above grade level. All of them had IQs of l25 or more--to top 5 percent on the tests. One of the girls stamping across the carpeted floor at George Washington University was Amy Carter, President Carter's lO-year-old daughter. Near her in line was Alice Jay, 9, whose grandfather is British Prime Minister James Callaghan. (Alice's father, Peter Jay, is the British ambassador to Washington.) However, the class of 26 also includes Marcel Prather, who lives ~n a low-income neighborhood in Southeast Washington, and Jayne Meeks, of Hyattsville, whose father is a postman. \"What these children have in common and what makes them different from others is their aptitude,\" said Patricia Carter (no relation to Amy), who is coordinator of the program for academically gifted children at the university reading center. The program for gifted students was started at the university last summer for bright youngsters from Washington's public schools. The city's schools have long been involved in controversies over what to do for unusually bright students since the time of official segregation that ended in l954.

The Blood Drive is held biannually, in the spring and fall. The Student Affairs Division is the sponsoring university coordinator of the drive. The program is aimed at university staff and faculty who donate approximately 125 to 150 units of blood each session. A letter from President Elliott is sent to all University employees urging them to participate. An appointment system expedites donor processing time and makes it easier for employees to adjust their daily schedules accordingly. University personnel who are unable to participate in the drive visit the Red Cross office, located just a few\"blocks from campus at 2025 E Street, which is equipped to handle unscheduled donors during normal working hours.

The center provides these services without regard to a patient's financial condition. Contact: Dr. Lawrence S. Lessin Director Division of Hematology 676-2939 HOME CARE PROGRAMo Through this program the home care needs of the cancer patient are met by a team composed of nurse practitioners, enterstomal therapists, social service workers and public health nurses. The team assesses the patient's needs whether he or she is in the hospital, doctor's office or home and offers a complete and comprehensive program of post-hospital care and follow-up. Every attempt is made to facilitate early discharge of the hospitalized patient, permit the advanced cancer patient to spend the greatest period of time at home in a familiar environment, and provide emotional support to patients and their families as they cope with the problems associated with the disease. The staff coordinates the patient's medical care with the physician, nursing staff, therapists, and social comnunity agencies. In addition, the Medical Center operates a mobile van to transport patients to and from therapy daily. There is no charge for the services of the home care team; substantial financial support is provided by the Alexander and Margaret Stewart Trust Fund. Through this program, costly health resources are conserved. The program has been operating since 1971 and is staffed to care for approximately 40 patients at any given time. Contact: Delia 0 'Hara Nurse Practitioner Home Care Program 676-4273 IN AND OUT SURGERY. The in and out surgical unit at GWU Hospital, established in 1966, was one of the first in the country to offer one-day care for patients undergoing minor surgical procedures. This program not only saves the patient the cost of an overnight hospital stay but also frees beds for patients who have more urgent medical needs. The unit was recently increased from two to three operating rooms. In 1976, 44 JIM HARTZ: Intensive care. That is a relatively new concept in medicine. It's the place where all the modern technology and expertise is pulled together in one spot in a fight for life. And it doesn't have to be all that frightening as Mary Ann Maskery reports in a Segment 3 series this week, Inside the Intensive Care Unit at George Washington University Hospital. MARY ANN MASKERY: Intensive care. The words can have an awful sound. Frightening. The first thing you notice are the bottles and their lifelines and the machines, of course. The constant noise level can be unnerving at times. Slowly you realize this ~s a battlefield. People don't come here unless there's a chance they might die. But also, people don't come here unless there's a chance they might live. The battle is for that life. DR. JACK E. ZIMMERMAN: The patients come here because they need the technical and human resources that we have available in the intensive care unit. And the other criteria in addition to need for intensive care is that there's salvageability, reversibility of the illness. MASKERY: The bottles supplied a liquid that supplied the pressure. The machines pwrrped the lungs and sometimes the heart and sometimes the kidneys. And all of that takes care. Twenty-four hours. One nurse to a patient often, and sometimes more than that. ZIMMERMAN: Intensive care is basically the application uf life s-:A.pport. We're the pound of cure when the ounce of prevention didn't work.

The road to independence for him has come through a combination of initiative, hard work, and imagination, and also through a College Work Study program that brings him $?00 per semester, a National Direct Student Loan of $625 per semester, and a Basic Educational Opportunity grant of $500 per semester. He also recalls one swroner during which he made $l,250 selling books, mostly Bibles. \"I learned a lot about myself, mostly in the area of ethics; in some cases I could have charged more, but I discovered I just couldn't take advantage.\" '~n attorney back home who loves GW advised me to come here, and Washington has been a fast 'growing-up' experience for me.\" Poe's first bout with expenses in the District ended with his having to go home briefly. \"But I got back,\" he relates, \"and the Financial Aid Office was particularly helpful and made me feel really welcome. Of course you have to do well academically (Poe maintains a B average), but the office is deeply concerned about a student's need.\" Right now things seem to be going well for Bill Poe. He writes for the Urban Bikeway, Design Collaborative, a project of User, Inc., at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a post he holds under the work-study program. He is also busy writing a proposal for an incentive program to get communities to use low-energy transportation. And he's a man who practices what he preaches. For his transportation he uses a bike whenever possible. Excerpted from Students: Values Revalued GW's 1977 Annual Report 28 SI'UDENT FINANCIAL AID.

A new multidisciplinary format for evaluating the incontinent child has been established at the Children's Hospital National Medical Center. Combining several perspectives of pediatrics such as pediatric psychiatry and urology, the child and at least one parent are interviewed. During the initial visit, urinalysis, urine culture, and a brief physical exam are carried out. Following the first visit, members of the medical team meet to discuss each patient and determine a recommen\u00ad dation. Once a recommendation is decided upon, a specialist in that field then meets with the parent and the child and suggests a course of treatment, further evaluation, or makes a recommendation to the referring physician--\u00b7 whatever is most appropriate. Patients are seen weekly on a fee-for-service basis. Contact: Dr. A.

Contact: Dean Burton Sapin Director 676-6240 URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING. Students in this department have asswned a signifi\u00ad cant role in providing continuing technical professional support for community organizations in several strategic sectors of Washington and the metropolitan area. For example: Far Southeast Community Development Plan (District of Colwnbia) Two teams of students in U&RP 215, Advanced Planning Problems, carried out research and planning studio projects to develop a comprehensive plan for a consortiwn of 15 neighborhood organizations representing some 150,000 people in Far Southeast Washington. Through meetings with community leaders and local officials, student/faculty teams succeeded in carrying the planning project close to completion in the spring term of 1977. After final editing of the sUITJIJEry text and preparation of the three-color map of the overall area, the plan is to be distributed in large quantities to residents of Far Southeast, to the Municipal Planning Office staff, and other interested agencies. This planning project has been instrwnental in articulating a variety of community development needs for neighborhood groups interested in benefiting from the poten\u00ad tial benefits of the proposed Metro system, historic preservation projects, commer\u00ad cial development activities, and other factors affecting Far Southeast. Research conducted by U&RP students and faculty during the past year has created a wealth of information and several new technical reports on fUndamental aspects of community development and change in Far Southeast Washington and adjacent Prince George's County, Maryland. Feet First (District of Colwnbia) A study for improving the pedestrian environment in the District of Columbia 39 CT SCANNING. GW's computerized tomographic scanners, two dedicated to brain diagnosis and one to the diagnosis of body lesions, are considered to be among the most revolutionary advances in radiology. The sophisticated, computerized X-ray units permit radiologists to detect abnormalities in tissue through a painless, non-invasive technique. Patients with minor symptoms can be evaluated while disease is in its early stages. These new devices continue to serve the needs of the entire Washington medical community while saving patients time and money and sparing them the pain and discomfort associated with conventional techniques.

The Gerontology Program administers and coordinates a multidisciplinary university-wide program in gerontology. This interprofessional program involves students, faculty, and staff in the field of aging. Training, research, and service activities offered through this program impact the training of students in medicine, allied health professions, social work, recreation therapy, sociology, psychology, health care administration, and law. Development of community-based multidisciplinary professional services for the District's elderly is one of the objectives of this program. St. Mary's Court, a congregate housing facility scheduled for occupancy in the spring of 1979,will be the site of a professional service center staffed by faculty, professional personnel, and medical, allied health, and graduate students from GW. The court is located at 725 24th Street, N.W. adjacent to St. Mary's Episcopal Church and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences. It has been developed by the Episcopal Diocese of Washington and financed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide a supportive environment for approximately 150 low and moderate income elderly and handicapped persons. The Professional Services Center will provide services to help residents of the court maintain independent living and improve the quality of their lives. Coordinated services will include direct services to the elderly, such as health maintenance services, health education, counseling (legal, social work, employment), information and referral services, and recreational, rehabilitative and physical fitness activities. The proximity of St. Mary's Court to the university gives students from different disciplines field experiences in working with the healthy, ambulatory elderly population. It is the intent of Gerontology Program administrators and the St. Mary's Court Board of Directors to extend the services of the Professional Service Center to elderly residents of the nearby community. Many of the services developed for the center will be extended to other D.C. sites, such as public housing for the elderly, senior centers, churches, and community service agencies. Existing services, consultation resources, and the use of older volunteers will be maximized in coordinating these outreach activities. Contact: Nona Boren, A.C.S.W.

The project doci.nnents problems pedestrians face daily within the Dis\u00ad trict, proposes a strategy for involving agencies that affect the pedestrians in the District, presents a wide range of design reconmendations based on proto\u00ad typical situations within the city, and suggests means for institutionalizing this strategy on a continuing basis. A Study of the Planning Function in the District of Columbia This report reviews the new planning agency in the District of Columbia using a combination of techniques from planning and anthropology. A legislative model reviews the legal requirements establishing the agency and forming the basis for its performance, a functional model (based on interviews with personnel in the agency) looks at how the agency actually operates, and a perceptual model (based upon attendance at citizens' meetings and telephone surveys) allows the \"citizen to speak.\" The study is an interdisciplinary effort by a graduate anthropology student at Catholic University, an MBA student in accounting at GWU, and an urban affairs undergraduate student at GWU. A Zoning Study for the 1900 Block of N Street (District of Columbia) This project of the U&RP 153 Principles of Urban Planning and Design under\u00ad graduate studio class was done for Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2B which was preparing zoning testimony regarding this site. The project considers the area just south of Dupont Circle bounded by New Hampshire Avenue, Connecticut Avenue, and M Street and analyzes policies which have been developed or are in process within the District of Columbia; reviews the existing and historical land use, construction, and trends in the area; cites demographic information and attitudes of citizens residing in the area; and indicates trends in zoning and demolitions which have depopulated and changed the character of the area. Recommendations include a general planning concept for the area which could be incorporated into the Comprehensive Plan being prepared for the District as well as several architectural studies which indicate how construction on the site, if permitted, could be made more compatible with the scale of the area and more accessible and amenable to pedestrians. Mt. Pleasant and Capitol Hill Household Studies Household ihterviews were conducted by students in U&RP 213 Social Factors in Urban Plannin5 as the basis for a class project in neighborhood demographic analysis.

The Division of Gastroenterology in the Department of Medicine has been funded by the National large Bowel Cancer Project of the National Cancer Institute of Health to study factors that determine development of cancer of the colon in patients with ulcerative colitis. All patients with ulcerative colitis of 10 or more years' duration are eligible for the study. All patient procedures are free of charge as the costs are assumed by the grant. The primary objective is the early detection of precancer lesions in the colons of these patients. The early detection of precancer (a clue to the later development of invasive cancer) may permit proper surgical treatment to cure cancer at its earliest stage.
