Here's what you should know about chiropractic adjustment for functional medicine. What is Integrated Physical Therapy? Integrated physical therapy is a practice that involves the use of functional and integrative forms of care to address the symptoms of illness and disease. These non-invasive and low-intensity practices are drug-free and focus on bringing balance to a patient's overall energy to improve the wellness of not just the body, but mind and spirit as well. Certified physical therapists can be trained in several different modalities of integrative health, including: - Traditional Chinese medicine, which includes acupuncture, reiki, and mind-body exercises like tai chi and qigong - Yoga - Hypnosis What Are the Benefits of Integrated Physical Therapy? There are multiple benefits to undergoing integrated physical therapy. One major advantage is that patients can receive an interdisciplinary perspective on their disease or illness, as well as a comprehensive treatment plan with multiple follow-ups along the way to treat not just one symptom, but several at the same time. This form of non-invasive therapy is typically low-intensity but has shown to be quite effective in treating patients on an individualized level. Some benefits include: - Improve cognitive function and balance - Decrease in chronic pain, especially in the lower back, neck, or knees - Improvement in mood and reduction of levels of stress and anxiety - Enhanced quality of life - Improve in emotional and mental well-being Studies have also shown that integrated physical and electrical therapy can benefit patients with pneumonia and improve their overall well-being by raising their physical levels of performance. What to Expect During an Integrated Physical Therapy Appointment If you've never been to an integrated physical therapy appointment, you might be wondering what to expect. A trained physician or personal therapist at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin by asking you a set of questions related to your chronic pain and current health status. Your physical therapist may also evaluate your everyday mobility, as well as your mood and emotions during the intake session. A personalized treatment plan will then be created to best address and treat the underlying symptoms of your illness. It can include one or several forms of integrative therapy, including acupuncture, yoga, and chiropractic adjustment.
