The minimum number of samples required to be taken by the system shall be based on the number of treatment plants used by the system. Multiple wells drawing raw water from a single aquifer may, with the department's approval, be considered one treatment plant. All samples taken within an established frequency shall be collected within a twenty-four-hour period. (1) Routine sampling. Analyses for total trihalomethanes shall be performed at quarterly intervals on at least four water samples for each treatment plant used by the system. At least twenty-five percent of the samples shall be taken at locations within the distribution system reflecting the maximum residence time of the water in the system. The remaining seventy-five percent shall be taken at representative locations in the distribution system, taking into 59 account number of persons served, different sources of water and different treatment methods employed. (2) Reduced sampling frequency. (a) Systems utilizing surface water or gronnd water, or both a combination of surface and ground water. The sampling frequency may be reduced to a minimum of one sample analyzed per quarter taken at a point in the distribution system reflecting the maximum residence time of the water in the system. The system 1 s nonilor ing samp 1 i ng frequency may only be reduced upon written request o\u00a3 by the water system and upon 1n itt en a determination by the department that data from at least one year of sampling at a frequency of four samples collected per calendar quarter per water treatment plant used by the system and that local conditions demonstrate that total trihalomethane concentrations will be consistently below the maximum contaminant level. If at any time during which the reduced sampling frequency is in effect, the result from any analysis exceeds the maximum contaminant level and such results are confirmed by at least one check sample taken promptly after such results are received, or if the system makes any significant change to its source of water or treatment program, the system shall immediately resume sampling on a routine basis of four samples per quarter per treatment plant used by the system. Such increased sampling shall continue for at least one year before the frequency may be reduced again. (b) Systems utilizing only ground water. The sampling frequency \u00a3or s:ystems utilizing only ground wat-er sources may be reduced to a minimum of one sample analyzed per year per water treatment plant taken at a point in the distribution system reflecting the maximum residence time of the water in the system. The system's sampling frequency may only be reduced upon written request u\u00a3 by the water system and upon a written determination by the department that-, b-as-ed upon the d-ata submit ted by the s:ystem, the system has a maximum total trihalomethane potential of less than one tenth 60 milligtam per -l-iter the maximum contaminant level and that local conditions demonstrate that ~system is not likely to approach or exceed the maximum contaminant level. If at any time during which the reduced sampling frequency is in effect, the result from any analysis taken by the system for maximum total trihalomethane potential is equal to or exceeds the maximum contaminant level and such results are confirmed by at least one check sample taken pxomptly after 'SttCh xesults -are xeceived, the system shall immediately begin resume sampling on a routine basis of four samples per quarter per treatment plant used by the system. Such increased sampling shall continue for at least one year before the frequency may be reduced again. In the event of any significant change to the system's source of water or treatment program, the system shall immediately analyze an additional sample for maximum total trihalomethane potential taken at a point in the distribution system reflecting maximum residence time of the water in the system for the purpose of determining whether the system must begin sampling on a routine basis of four samples per quarter per treatment plant used by the system. (3) Increased sampling frequency. At the option of the department, sampling frequencies may be increased above the minimum in those cases where it is necessary to detect variations of total trihalomethane levels within the distribution system. d. Compliance. Compliance with the maximum contaminant level shall be determined based on a running annual average of quarterly samples analyses. If the average of samples analyses covering any twelve-month period exceeds the maximum contaminant level, sampling shall be at a frequency designated by the department and shall continue until a sampling monitoring schedule as a condition to a variance, e.<emption or enforcement action becomes effective.

Systems shall sample at points of entry to the distribution system representative of each source unless the sources are combined before distribution, then the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of normal operating conditions. Systems must sample every three months if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are detected in the initial sample or in any subsequent sample. Sampling must be conducted at the same location or a more representative location each quarter. Systems must sample every three years if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are not detected in the initial sample or in any subsequent \u00b7sample but the system is vulnerable and has more than five hundred service connections. Systems must sample every five years if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are not detected in the initial sample or in any subsequent sample and the system is not vulnerable or is vulnerable but has five hundred or less ser~ice connections. Analysis for vinyl chloride is required only for systems that have detected one or more of the following two-carbon for vinyl chloride is required at each distribution or entry point at which one or more of the two-carbon organic compounds were found. If the first analysis does not detect vinyl chloride, the department may reduce the frequency of vinyl chloride monitoring to once every three years for that sample location or other sample locations which are more representative of the same source. (2) Surface water systems. Systems shall sample at points of entry to the distribution system representative of each source unless the sources are combined before distribution, then the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system after any application of treatment during periods of normal operating conditions. Systems must sample every three months if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are detected in the initial sample or in any subsequent sample. Sampling must be conducted at the same location or a more representative location 63 each quarter. Systems must sample quarterly for the first year and every three years thereafter if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are not detected but the system is vulnerable and has more than five hundred service connections. Systems must sample quarterly for the first year and every five years thereafter if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are not detected but the system is vulnerable and has five hundred or less service connections. Systems may be required to monitor at department discretion if volatile synthetic organic chemicals are not detected in the first year of quarterly sampling and the system is not vulnerable . Systems may be required to analyze for vinyl chloride at the discretion of the department. c. Reduced sampling frequency. The department may reduce the frequency of monitoring to once per year for a system detecting volatile synthetic organic chemicals at levels consistently less than the maximum contaminant level for three consecutive years. d. Vulnerability. Vulnerability of systems shall be determined by the department based upon an assessment of the following: (1) Previous monitoring results; (2) Number of persons served by the system; (3) Proximity of a smaller system to a larger system; (4) Proximity to commercial or industrial use, disposal, or storage of volatile synthetic organic chemicals; and (5) Protection of the water source. A system is deemed to be vulnerable for a period of three years after any volatile synthetic organic chemical or unregulated contaminant, except for disinfection byproducts, is detected. e. Reporting. The results of all analyses must be reported to the department within thirty days of the system's receipt of such results. f. Compliance. Compliance must be determined based on the results of running annual average of quarterly sampling for each sampling location. If one location's average is greater than the maximum contaminant level, then the system must be deemed to be out of compliance. For 64 systems that only take one sample per location, compliance must be based on that one sample. The department has the authority to allow the use of monitoring data collected after January 1, 1983, for purposes of monitoring compliance. If the data is consistent with the other requirements of these rules, the department may use that data to represent the initial monitoring if the system is determined by the department not to be vulnerable. The department has the authority to determine compliance or initiate enforcement action based upon analytical results and other information compiled by a sanctioned representative or agency. g. Public notification. If a system fails to monitor or fOmply with a maximum contaminant level, the system shall notify the department and give notice to the public. 4. Unregulated contaminants. a.

A sanitary survey by the department shows the ground water supply to be adequately protected. b. The water supply contamination. has a history of no coliform 2. Sampling frequency for noncommunity water systems. The supplier of water for a noncommunity water system shall sample for coliform bacteria in each calendar quarter during which the system provides water to the public. If the department, on the basis of a sanitary survey, the existence of additional safeguards such as a protective and enforced well code, or accumulated analytical data, determines that some other frequency is more appropriate, that frequency shall be the frequency required under this chapter. Such frequency shall be confirmed or changed on the basis of subsequent surveys or data. The frequency shall not be reduced unt i 1 the noncommunity water system has performed at least one coliform analysis of its drinking water and found to be in compliance with maximum microbiological contaminant levels. 3. Sampling frequency for check samples. When the co 1 i form bacteria colonies in a single sample, as determined by the membrane filter procedure, exceeds four per one hundred milliliters, at least two consecutive daily check samples shall be collected and examined from the same sampling point. Additional check samples shall be collected daily or at a frequency established by the department until the results obtained from at least two consecutive check samples show less than one coliform bacteria colony per one hundred milliliters. When coliform bacteria, as determined by the fermentation tube method, occur in three or more ten milliliter portions of a single sample, at least two consecutive daily check samples shall be collected and examined from the same sampling point. Additional check samples shall be collected daily or at a frequency established by the department until the results obtained from at least two consecutive check samples show no positive tubes. 72 The location at which the check samples were taken shall not be eliminated from future sampling without approval of the department. The results from \u00b7all coliform bacterial analyses performed except those obtained from check samples and special purpose samples shall be used to determine compliance with the maximum contaminant level for coliform bacteria. Check samples shall not be included in calculating the total number of samples taken each month to determine compliance. When the presence of coliform bacteria in wate~ taken from a particular sampling point has been confirmed by any check samples, the supplier of water shall report to the department within forty-eight hours. \u00b7 When a maximum contaminant level is exceeded, the supplier of water shall report to the department and notify the public. Special purpose samples, such whether disinfection practices replacement, or repair have been to determine compliance. as those taken to determine following pipe placement, sufficient, shall not be used 4. Substitution of chlorine residuals. A supplier of water of a public water system may, with the approval of the department and based upon a sanitary survey, substitute the use of chlorine residual monitoring for not more than seventy-five percent of the required microbiological samples; provided, that the supplier of water takes chlorine residual samples at points which are representative of the conditions within the distribution system. Four samples for chlorine analysis shall be substituted for each microbiological sample. There shall be at least daily determinations of chlorine residual. The supplier of water shall maintain no less than two-tenths milligLams milligram per liter free chlorine at the extremities of the public water distribution system. When a particular sampling point has been shown to have a free chlorine residual less than two-tenths milligLams milligram per liter, the water at the location shall be retested as soon as practicable and in any event, within one hour. If the original analysis is confirmed, this fact shall be reported to the department within forty-eight hours. Also, if the analysis is confirmed, a sample for coliform bacterial analysis must be collected from that sampling point as soon as practicable and preferably within one hour, and the results of such analysis reported to the department within forty-eight hours after the results are known to the supplier of water. Compliance with the maximum contaminant levels for coliform bacteria shall be determined on the monthly mean or quarterly mean basis, including those samples taken as a result of failure to maintain the required chlorine residual level. The 73 department may withdraw its approval of the use of chlorine residual substitution at any time. If the department determines that some higher chlorine level is more appropriate, that level . shall level required under these regulations. residual be the The measurements for chlorine shall be made by a method approved by the department. 5. Sampling frequency for the replacement samples. When the coliform bacterial colonies 1n a single sample, as determined by the membrane filter procedure, cannot be determined, the department at its discretion may require one or more replacement samples to be collected from the same sampling point for analysis. The sample or samples which were replaced shall not be used to determine compliance. History: Amended effective December 1, 1982; July 1, 1988. General NDCC 61 28.1 06, 61 26.1 07 33-17-01-12.

History:\u00b7 Effective 1. Urea and other nonprotein products defined in the official publication of the association of American feed control officials are acceptable ingredients only in commercial feeds for ruminant animals as a source of equivalent crude protein. If the commercial feed contains more than eight and seventy-five-hundredths percent of equivalent crude protein from all forms of nonprotein nitrogen, added as such, or the equivalent crude pr~tein from all forms of nonprotein nitrogen, added as such, exceeds one-third of the total crude protein, the label must bear adequate directions for the safe use of feeds and a precautionary statement: 11CAUTION: USE AS DIRECTED\". The directions for use and the caution statement must be in type of such size so placed on the label that they will be read and understood by ordinary persons under customary conditions of purchase and use. 2. Nonprotein nitrogen defined in the official publication of the association of American feed control officials, when so indicated, are acceptable ingredients in commercial feeds distributed to nonruminant animals as a source of nutrients other than equivalent crude protein. The maximum equivalent crude protein from nonprotein sources when used in nonruminant rations may not exceed one and twenty-five-hundredths percent of the total daily ration. 3.

When the commercial feed is itself a drug and is generally recognized as safe and effective for the labeled use or is marketed subject to an application approved by the food and drug administration under 21 U.S.C. 360(b); or c. When one of the purposes for feeding a commercial feed is to impart immunity (that is to act through some immunological process) the constituents imparting immunity have been approved for the purpose through the Federal Virus, Serum and Toxins Act of 1913, administered by the animal and plant health inspection service, United States department of agriculture. The reason for the amendment is because of a problem encountered by feed control officials in developing the basis for evaluation of such products that have a primary purpose to impart immunity. States, in many cases, are unable to make correct judgments on the effectiveness on such products. The committee feels that this will definitely have more uniformity and effectiveness in handling product registrations.

Scope of chapter. This chapter establishes rules for review and disposition of permit applications, made on or after January 1, 1987, to drain water from a wetland or any series thereof, as required by North Dakota Century Code section 61-32-03. This chapter does not apply to permit applications made after January 1, 1987, if the final administrative action by the board and the state engineer was completed on or before July 21, 1987. This chapter does not apply to permit applications made after July 20, 1987, and before the effective date of these rules. In such case, chapter 89-02-01 shall govern to the extent it does not conflict with North Dakota Century Code chapter 61-32, which shall govern in the event of a conflict. A permit is not required pursuant to this chapter if the application to drain was submitted to the state engineer prior to January 1, 1987. In that event, chapter 89-02-01 governs. History: Effective October 1, In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions apply: 1. \"Assessment drain\" is any drain fitting the definition set forth in subsection 2 of North Dakota Century Code section 61-16.1-02. 2. \"Board\" means the managers of the water resource district in which the majority of the watershed of a project is located. 3. \"District\" means water resource district. 4. \"Drain11 is any structure or construction which changes the water surface area of a wetland. 326 5. \"Land not normally subject to standing water\" means land which is inundated, on the average, not more than once in five years. 6. ''Lateral drain\" means a drain constructed after the establishment and construction of the original drain or drainage system which the permit previously obtained did not contemplate and which allows water to flow into such original drain or drainage system. 7. rParty of record11 means any person who submits oral or written testimony or evidence for the record at the state engineer's hearing. 8. 11Permanent wetland\" means a well-defined basin which characteristically holds water throughout the year. Permanent wetlands go dry only after successive years of below normal runoff and precipitation. Freshwater permanent wetlands typically have a border of aquatic vegetation and a predominant open water area in the interior. Saline permanent wetlands are typically devoid of emergent vegetation and exhibit a white, salt encrusted shoreline. This definition is the uniform classification adopted by the state engineer and the game and fish commissioner for permanent wetlands. 9. \"Project\" means the proposed activity contained in a drainage application under consideration by the board for a permit, or, when considered by the state engineer, the activity approved by the board. 10. \"Seasonal (shallow) wetland\" means a depression which holds water in normal years from spring runoff until mid-July. In years of normal runoff and precipitation, seasonal wetlands may not be tilled but can be used for hayland or pasture. In low runoff, dry years, these areas may be tilled for crop production, but commonly reflood with frequent or heavy summer or fall rains. This definition is the uniform classification adopted by the state engineer and the game and fish commissioner for seasonal wetlands. 11. \"Semipermanent (intermittent) wetland\" means a well-defined depression or basin which holds water in normal years throughout the summer. Semipermanent wetlands generally go dry only in years of below normal runoff and precipitation. Freshwater semipermanent wetlands, commonly referred to as cattail sloughs, are characterized by a predominance of cattail and bulrush vegetation with scattered open water areas. Saline semipermanent wetlands are characterized by a predominance of alkali bulrush and scattered open water areas. This classification is the uniform classification adopted by the state engineer and the game and fish commissioner for semipermanent wetlands. 327 12. \"Supplemental hearing11 means a hearing held to review evidence not contained in the record of the state engineer's hearing. 13. 11Temporary wetland11 \u00b7 means a shallow depressional area which holds water or is waterlogged from spring runoff until early June. In years of normal runoff and precipitation, temporary wetland areas may be tilled for crop production. In years of high runoff or heavy spring rain, these areas may not dry out until mid-July and would not be tilled but may be used for hayland or pasture. Temporary wetlands frequently reflood during heavy summer and fall rains. Sheetwater, as defined in North Dakota Century Code section 61-32-02, is not a temporary wetland. This definition is the uniform classification adopted by the state engineer and the game and fish commissioner for temporary wetlands. 14. 11Watercourse11 is as defined by North Dakota Century Code section 61-01-06. 1S. \"Watershed11 is the area draining into a wetland or series of wetlands. A series of wetlands is a group of two or more wetlands which are hydrologically linked naturally or by man's efforts. History: Effective October a drainage permit. Pursuant to this chapter, a permit is required before any person may drain waters from a wetland, or series thereof, with a watershed of eighty acres [32.37 hectares] or more. For purposes of this section, the term 11drain11 means any process used to decrease the water surface area of a wetland. A drainage permit is not required for the use of water from a wetland for beneficial purposes pursuant to North Dakota Century Code chapter 61-04. History: Effective October 1, covered by permit. Each wetland in the area identified in the permit will be permitted unless specifically identified as being undrained in the permit application. The drain must be designed to accommodate the drainage of all wetlands in the permit area which are not identified as being undrained. History: Effective October 1, Agencies not required to obtain permits. In the event replacement of wetland acre loss is required by federal law, the following agencie~ are deemed by the state engineer capable of providing supervision and analyzing downstream impacts and are exempt from obtaining a permit: 1. The United States department of agriculture soil conservation service for projects constructed pursuant to the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act [Pub. L. 83-566; 16 U.S.C. 1001]. 2. The United States bureau of reclamation for drainage which is a part of the originally authorized Garrison Diversion Unit authorized in 1965. 3. The state highway department for federal aid proje~ts. However, these agencies shall notify the state engineer of any proposed drainage projects during the planning stages. History: Effective October 1, 1988. watershed area. Seven and one-half minute topographic maps must be used by the state engineer to determine the area of a watershed for a wetland, or series of wetlands. This information may be supplemented by aerial photos or a survey conducted under the superv1s1on of a registered land surveyor. An onsite investigation may be conducted by the state engineer if, in his judgment, it is deemed necessary. History: Effective October 1, 1988. Applications for a permit to drain must be filed with the state engineer on the state engineer's application from. The application must provide the following: 1. Description of the drain. 2. United States department of agriculture soil conservation service photos of the project area with the wetlands which are not to be drained specifically identified thereon. 3. An estimate of the number of wetland acres to be drained. The application may be mailed or delivered to: Office of the State Engineer 329 900 East Boulevard Bismarck, NO 58505 Insufficient or incomplete applications will be returned t~ the applicant by the state engineer. History: Effective October 1, 1988. state engineer and transmittal to appropriate board. Upon receipt of a properly completed application, the state engineer shall review the wetlands to be drained in the project area and determine whether all wetlands to be drained are temporary wetlands. If all wetlands are determined to be temporary wetlands, that fact must be noted on the permit application. If a project is proposing to drain only temporary wetlands, the state engineer shall also determine whether the project is of statewide or interdistrict significance using the factors set out in section 89-02-02-12. The state engineer shall note the determination in that regard upon the application. If the project will drain other than temporary wetlands, the state engineer may not determine whether the project is of statewide or interdistrict significance until after the board has considered and approved the project. In any event, the permit application must then be forwarded to the board in which a majority of the watershed of the proposed project is l0cated. History: Effective October 1, procedure for processing applications to drain other than temporary wetlands. A board shall follow this procedure in processing a drainage permit application when the project will drain permanent, semipermanent, or seasonal wetlands, or if it has been determined to be of statewide or interdistrict significance, or if the board determines a board hearing should be held: 1. Upon receipt of an application to drain from the state engineer, the board shall set the date, time, and place for a meeting at which it will receive information concerning the merits of, as well as any testimony or information pertinent to the application. At the applicant1s expense, the board shall also give notice by mail not less than twenty days from the date set for consideration of the drainage application to: a. All record title owners of real estate or holders of a contract for deed whose property would be crossed by the proposed drain. 330 b. All downstream riparian landowners on the watercourse into which water will be drained within two miles [3. 22 kilometers] from the outlet of the drain as determined by the board. c. Any water resource board which woul~ be substantially affected by the water to be drained. d. The state game and fish department. e. The state department of health and consolidated laboratories. f. The state highway commissioner for any proposed drainage that will affect or cross the right of way of any public highway or road. g. The state engineer. h. Any person who has made a written request for notification of that project and has advanced the cost of providing that notification. Such advance may not exceed ten dollars. 2. Notice must also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the proposed drainage once a week for two consecutive weeks. Final notice must be published not more than fifteen days nor less than five days from the date set for1the hearing. 3. The notice must give the essential facts of the proposed drain including, but not limited to: name and address of applicant; legal description of the area to be drained; purpose of the drainage; watercourse into which the water will be drained; legal description of the confluence of the drain and watercourse into which the water will be drained; the time, date, and place of the board's consideration of the application; and the location and date of availability of information regarding the project. 4. Fourteen days prior to the date set by the board for its meeting to receive information on the application, the applicant shall submit to the board all documentary information the applicant intends to present at the board's meeting. The board shall immediately place such information in the board's office if the office is open for public access at least twenty hours each week, or if the board offices are not open to the public twenty hours each week, in custody of the auditor of the county in which the majority of the watershed of the drain is to be built. The information must be available for public review. The board shall notify the applicant of this requirement upon its receipt of an application to drain. If the information is placed in the 331 auditor's office, the auditor shall return the information to the board one working day prior to the board's meeting. 5. The \u00b7board shall allow submission of all ~elevant evidence, oral or written. If the board does not make its decision to approve or disapprove the application at the meeting, it shall provide written notice of its decision to all persons requesting such notice and to all persons identified in subsection 1. 6. The meeting at which the board receives information concerning the application must be recorded either stenographically or by electronic recording. If the board approves the permit application, this record and all documentary information received by the board must be transferred to the state engineer. The cost of providing a transcript must be borne by the applicant. 7. At the conclusion of the meeting at which the board receives information about the proposed drain, the board shall announce that: a. The board's denial of a permit constitutes final denial of the permit. Appeals of a denial must be taken to the district court within thirty days. b. A board approved application will be forwarded to the state engineer who will determine whether the project is of statewide or interdistrict significance and whether the wetlands to be drained will be replaced. c. Those who wish to be notified of the board's decision approving an application or of a decision by the state engineer of statewide or interdistrict significance shall so notify the board and shall provide their name and address at the end of the meeting. Notice will then be provided as set forth in section 89-02-02-13. 8. Applications considered by the board will be evaluated by the factors considered for drains of statewide or interdistrict significance. Those factors are set forth in section 89-02-02-14. 9. If the board denies the application, it shall return the application to the applicant along with a copy of the board's determination and rationale. A copy of the board's denial and rationale must also be sent to the state engineer. 10. If the board approves the application, the board's approval must be noted on the application and a copy of the determination sent to the applicant. The application, a copy of the determination, and all information reviewed by the board in considering the application must be forwarded to the 332 state engineer for review within twenty days of the determination. The board's decision approving the application must contain a determination of the location and size, in surface acres, of wetlands to be drained by the proposed drain. A seven and one-half minute topographic map indicating the location and size of the wetlands approved for drainage must be attached to the determination. 11. The board's notice to an applicant must state that the board's approval of the application is not a permit to drain until the state engineer has: a. In the case of a drain determined to be of statewide or interdistrict significance, also approved the application and found the wetland acres drained would be replaced by an equal number of replacement acres; or b. In the case of a drain determined not to be of statewide or interdistrict significance, found the wetland acres drained would be replaced by an equal number of replacement acres. History: Effective October 1, procedure for processing permits when a hearing is not required. Upon referral from the state engineer of a permit which is not of statewide or interdistrict significance and will not drain permanent, semipermanent, or seasonal wetlands, the board shall follow this procedure: 1. The board shall review the permit application and any supporting documentation and determine whether protection of public and private interests would be better served by a specific public meeting to consider the project. If it is determined a specific public meeting is necessary to protect public and private interests, the board shall process the permit application in accordance with the provisions of section 89-02-02-09. 2. If the board determines a specific public meeting is unnecessary, the board shall consider the project pursuant to the criteria set forth in section 89-02-02-14 and shall deny or grant the application with or without modifications or conditions based upon those criteria. If the application is granted, it ihall be forwarded to the state engineer for his determination of the necessary replacement wetlands. In either case, written notice of the board's decision must be provided to all participants in the board's decision and to the state engineer. The notice must state that the board's approval does not constitute a final approval until the state 333 engineer finds the wetland acres to be drained will be replaced by an equal number of replacement acres. History: Effective October 1, for determination by board. Within sixty days after receipt from the state engineer of an application to drain, the board shall make a determination on the application. This time limit may be extended only with the written consent of the state engineer. A request for an extension of time under this section must be in writing to the state engineer and must set forth the reason for requesting the t\u00b7ime extension. In applications involving assessment drains, the sixty-day time period does not commence until the date the assessment board is finally established and is no longer subject to appeal to a court of law or the state engineer. History: Effective October 1, 1988. statewide or interdistrict significance. Upon receipt of a board approved application, or in the case of an application draining only temporary wetlands, the state engineer shall determine whether the proposed drain is of statewide or interdistrict significance. The state engineer may, in his discretion, determine any proposed drain as having statewide or interdistrict significance. However, the state engineer shall determine a drain is of statewide or interdistrict significance if: 1. Publicly owned property will be substantially affected; or 2. The proposed drain will have a substantial impact upon property in another district. History: Effective October 1, 1988. engineer's determination of statewide or interdistrict significance. Upon a determination by the state engineer that a project is of statewide or interdistrict significance, the state engineer shall notify the following of that determination by mail: 1. The state game and fish department. 2. The state department of health and consolidated laboratories. 334 3. The state highway department. 4. Any district which may sustain a substantial impact from the project. 5. Any political subdivision which owns land which would be affected. 6. The district in which the majority of the project watershed is located. 7. All persons who have, in writing, notified the state engineer that they wished to be notified of a state engineer's determination that a project was of statewide or interdistrict significance. 8. The applicant. History: Effective October 1, application of statewide or interdistrict significance Factors considered. App 1 i cations of statewide or interdistrict significance will be evaluated by giving consideration to the foll~wing factors: 1. The volume of water proposed to be drained and the impact of the flow or quantity of this water upon the watercourse into which the water will be drained. 2. Adverse effects which may occur to the lands of lower proprietors. This factor is limited to the project's hydrologic effects such as erosion, duration of floods, impact of sustained flows, and impact on the operation of downstream water control devices. 3. The engineering design and other physical aspects of the drain. 4. The water resources policy as expressed in North Dakota Century Code section 61-01-26. Because the water resources policy was adopted for purposes of protecting North Dakota's right to use water in the state, the consideration to be given under this policy to evaluate a drainage application is confined to how the project will affect future or present water appropriations and whether the project conflicts with any state, regional, or local water resources plan as adopted pursuant to subsection 4 of North Dakota Century Code section 61-01-26 or subsection 3 of North Dakota Century Code section 61-16.1-10. 335 5. The wetlands policy as expressed in North Dakota Century Code section 61-32-01, including: a. The project's impact upon the area's erosion potential. b. The project's impact upon agricultural productivity in the project watershed. c. The value of the wetlands in their undrained and drained conditions for flood control, wildlife, water purification, ground water recharge, agriculture, water development, and water management, and whether those values will be adequately protected if the wetlands are replaced. 6. The project's impact upon flooding problems in the project watershed. 7. Reasonable features that could be included in the drainage project to protect downstream water quality. 8. Other factors unique to the project not previously considered pursuant to subsections 1 through 7. History: Effective October 1, applications of statewide or interdistrict significance Information to be used. In the state engineer's evaluation of an application of statewide or interdistrict significance, the state engineer shall use all relevant documentary information submitted and oral testimony given for the board's consideration at its meeting. The state engineer may also use any information in the files and records retained by his office or, engineering information developed or obtained through investigation of the project area by his staff. The state engineer may also seek information and comment-from independent sources. However, the state engineer is not required to delay his decision on an application for more than thirty days from the date of request while waiting for comment from these sources. History: Effective October 1, 1988. and contents of notice of state engineer's decision to grant or deny application of statewide or interdistrict significance. 336 1.

Construction of a project permitted pursuant to this chapter may not commence until the law concerning replacement of wetlands is satisfied. 339 History: Effective October 1, 1988. within which to begin construction of drain. The recipient of a permit to drain under this chapter shall commence actual construction within two years of the date the state engineer's decision granting the permit is final. The two-year period does not begin until any appeal of the state engineer's decision or board's decision is completed, nor does it run during the course of any other legal action brought to challenge the state engineer's decision or board's decision or halt or modify the project. Once construction has been commenced the permit recipient shall make good faith efforts and satisfactory progress, as determined jointly by the state engineer and the water resource board, toward completion of the project. If the two-year period runs before construction is commenced, the permit recipient may make a written request for a one-year extension which must be granted by both the state engineer and the water resource board. All requests for extensions must be made at least sixty days prior to the end of the two-year period and must specifically state why construction has not commenced. Upon expiration of any extension, the permit recipient may request a further extension. In the event the two-year period passes without the commencement of construction, an extension of the period as provided in this section, or legal process staying construction, the permit is void.

Scope of chapter. This chapter contains rules by which the state game and fish department and the state engineer jointly determine the number of wetlands acres to be drained and find .those wetland acres will be replaced by an equal acreage of replacement wetlands. This chapter includes rules governing the wetlands bank. History: Effective October 1, 1988. In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following definitions apply: 1. 11Applicant11 means a person requesting a drainage permit. 2. 11Application11 means an application for a permit to drain made pursuant to North Dakota Century Code section 61-32-03. 3. 11Appropriate replacement acres11 means fifty percent of the wetland acres required within the same county or contiguous counties as the wetland being drained. However, if less than fifty percent are available in that county or a contiguous county, wetlands in the same biotic area are considered appropriate replacement wetlands. 4. 11Biotic area11 means one of the four biotic areas which are designated: (a) Agassiz Lake Plain, (b) Southern Drift Plain, Northeastern Drift Plain, Northwestern Drift Plain, Turtle Mountain, (c) Missouri Coteau, Coteau Slope, and (d) Missouri Slope, Little Missouri Slope. 341 5. \"Board\" means the managers of the water resource district in which the wetland to be drained is located. 6. \"Drain\" is any structure or construction which changes the water surface area of a wetland. 7. \"Evaluation team\" consists of one staff member from each of the state engineer's and commissioner's staff. Their duties include determining the number of wetland acres to be drained, whether replacement acres are available in the wetlands bank, and whether manmade wetlands not in the wetlands bank have material wildlife values. 8. 11Manmade wetland\" is a wetland with material wi\"ldlife values which results from man's activities whether inadvertent or not. 9. \"Normal water level\" is the level arrived at by evaluating a wetland under the criteria set forth in section 89-02-03-04. 10. \"Replacement wetland\" includes both restored natural wetlands and manmade wetlands with material wildlife values. History: Effective October 1, 1988. and membership of evaluation team. Upon receipt of an application to drain which has been processed and approved by the board, the state engineer shall inform the commissioner. The state engineer and commissioner shall appoint one member from each of their staffs to determine the wetland acreage to be drained, the availability of replacement wetland in the wetland bank, and the wildlife values of any manmade wetlands created after December 31, 1986, not contained in the wetlands bank but which an applicant wishes to use for replacement wetlands. In the event the evaluation team cannot agree, they shall each state their position in writing and present it to both the commissioner and the state engineer who shall together resolve the issue. History: Effective October 1, 1988. In eva 1 uat i ng the acreage of wetlands to be debited, the evaluation team shall first determine the normal water level for each wetland. This determination will be made by using one or more of the following data sources: 342 1.

When any photos, documents or governmental determinations of the presence or absence of a wetland is provided by the applicant with the board approved permit, the evaluation team will consider that information in making its determination. The evaluation team shall coordinate its decision with the state engineer's decision on a permit application of statewide or interdistrict significance. The sum of the area of land within the normal water level for each wetland to be drained will be the acreage of wetlands to be drained. History: Effective October 1, of acres to be replaced and sources for replacement. Once a determination of the number of wetland acres to be drained has been made, and in the case of an application of statewide or interdistrict significance after the state\u00b7 engineer's approval of a drainage permit pursuant to chapter 89-02-02, the evaluation team shall report its findings to the state engineer and the commissioner. The state engineer shall then notify the applicant and the board by certified mail of: 1. The number of wetland acres required to replace the acres to be drained. 343 2. Whether sufficient appropriate replacement acres are available in the wetlands bank including: the number of acres in that county or .contiguous counties, or if less than fifty percent of the required acreage is available in the account for that county or contiguous counties, the availability of replacement wetlands within the same biotic area, and the availability of replacement wetlands in other areas of the state. 3. The average cost of replacement acres in the wetlands bank at the time of the notice. 4. That the applicants desire to use wetlands from the wetlands bank must be expressed in writing by personally delivering it to the state engineers office, or by mailing it by certified or regular mail to the state engineer, within thirty days of the date the notice of availability is received by the applicant or his agent. If the applicant chooses to mail the notice by regular mail, the date of receipt by the state engineer tolls the thirty-day time period. The notice to the landowner must include a notice of intent form for the landowner1s use. History: Effective October 1, intent -Payment. Within thirty days of the receipt of notice of the acreage to be replaced and the availability of replacement acres, the applicant shall provide written notice of intent to use wetlands from the wetlands bank to the state engineer by personal delivery or by certified or regular mail on the notice of intent form. The state engineer will notify the commissioner upon receipt of the notice. The form must include: 1. Name and address of the applicant. 2. The drain permit application number. 3. Whether applicant will use replacement acreage from the wetlands bank. 4. Other information deemed pertinent by the state engineer. For purposes of this section, the average cost of replacement acres is determined on the day the notice of intent is received in the office of the state engineer if the notice is delivered personally, the date the notice of intent is mailed if sent by certified mail, or the date of receipt by the state engineer if mailed by regular mail. The state engineer shall notify the applicant by certified mail of the 344 amount due to defray ten percent of the average cost of replacement. Within ten days of the state engineer's sending of this notice, the landowner shall give a cashier's or certified check for at least that amount to the state engineer. The check must be payable to the wetlands replacement fund. Upon receipt, as determined above, of a notice of intent from an applicant whose permit has received the necessary approval from the board and the state engineer, the acreage to be replaced shall become a debit to the wetlands bank. History: Effective October 1, 1988. in cases where a governmenta 1 agency or a coal mining operation has created or restored a wetland for the purposes of an identified project, priority in time gives the superior right to use credits in the wetlands bank. However, in no event may a governmental agency or a coal mining operation hold a priority for the same credit for more than two years unless an application to drain and use that credit has been made. A priority dates from the conditional approval by the board of an application to drain. Provided, if any notice of intent or certified or cashier's check is not received within the time period allowed under section 89-02-03-05, the priority date is the date of receipt by the state engineer of the certified or cashier's check. Regardless, the notice of intent must be in writing on the form prescribed by the state engineer and must be personally delivered to the office of the state engineer or mailed by certified or regular mail. History: Effective October 1, 1988. to wetlands bank Qualification. To qualify as a credit to the wetlands bank, a manmade wetland must have material wildlife values. Any natural wetland which is restored in whole or in part shall qualify as a credit to the wetlands bank unless the drainage of the wetland was not authorized by state law and no debit was made pursuant to section 89-02-03-15. History: Effective October 1, -What is credited. All previously drained natural wetlands, which are or were restored, or manmade wetlands with material wildlife values, which are or were created, by any person after December 31, 1986, must be credited to the wetlands 345 bank unless their restoration or creation is required as mitigation of a federal aid project. Each acre credited must be identified on a map by the state engineer. The acreage credited to the wetlands bank must be determined using the method for evaluating acreages to be drained. Unauthorized drainage constructed after July 1, 1975, and closed pursuant to final action under North Dakota Century Code section 61-32-07 may not be a credit to the wetlands bank. For purposes of this section, a federal aid project is one where mitigation is required by federal statute or rule. History: Effective October 1, 1988. of wetland in wetlands bank. The cost of acquisition, easement, lease, and construction of replacement wetlands is the actual cost of acquisition plus either the construction cost to restore a natural wetland or the cost to construct a manmade wetland. The average cost of a wetland acre is calculated by summing the cost of each of the total wetland acres ever placed in the bank and dividing the sum by the total number of acres ever placed in the bank. If wetlands are donated to the wetland bank, the state engineer and commissioner shall determine the probable cost of acquisition and restoration or construction and that amount must be factored into the average cost of wetlands in the bank. History: Effective October 1, 1988. of material wildlife values. In determining whether a manmade wetland has material wildlife values, the evaluation team shall consider: 1. Underlying soil type and its suitability for wetlands as determined by soil survey data. 2. Water depth and duration of inundation. 3. Adjacent land use. 4. The existence of a buffer suitable for wildlife habitat. 5. If the replacement wetland will compliment existing wildlife resources. 6. The potential for use by wildlife. 346 7. The likelihood desirable wetland vegetation will establish itself in and around the wetland. 8. Other factors pertinent to the wetl~nd under consideration. History: Effective October 1, of wetlands bank. The state engineer shall maintain an accounting of credits and debits in the wetlands bank. Credits and debits will be separately identified by county and biotic area. History: Effective October 1, of funds. The commissioner shall deposit all moneys paid under section 89-02-03-06 into the wetlands replacement fund. History: Effective October 1, the wetlands bank must be accounted for in the order of priority set forth in section 89-02-03-07. At least fifty percent of the wetlands to be drained shall become a debit or be replaced from the wetlands bank in this order: 1. Wetlands located in the same county. 2. Wetlands located in a contiguous county. 3. Wetlands located in the same biotic area. If the drainage project is conducted by a government agency or pursuant to a coal mining operation, wetlands may be replaced from credits created by that agency or operation for that project if the project was identified when the wetlands were credited to the bank, if the state engineer was informed at the time of crediting of the intended use of 347 the wetlands, and if the order for replacing the wetlands acres set forth in this section is complied with. History: Effective October 1, 1988. is debited. A 11 wet 1 ands drained after January 1, 1987, except for those projects for which permits were requested prior to January 1, 1987, must be charged as a debit against acreage credit balances. The acreage of the wetlands debited must be determined in accordance with section 89-02-03-04 and must include both authorized and unauthorized drainage. A drainage permit may not be granted if the project will result in a debit balance to the wetlands bank exceeding two thousand five hundred acres {1011.70 hectares].
