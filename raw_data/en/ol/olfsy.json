Cannabis When providing guidance to patients who are interested in incorporating non- medical (recreational) cannabis into their lives, naturopathic doctors shall do so safely, competently, and ethically in accordance with standards of practice and applicable legisl ation. Introduction The use of recreational cannabis became legal in Canada in October 2018. On October 17, 2018 the NWT passed new laws about access, possession and where cannabis can be smoked in the territory. Medical cannabis will continue to be subject to the requirement of a prescription by a Medical Doctor or Nurse Practitioner. The goal o f this document is to establish a guideline interpreting the Cannabis Act (2018) for naturopathic doctors , in conjunction with the regulations and standards of practice. Types of Cannabis There are three types of cannabis: 1. Non -medical (recreational) cannabis Health care practitioner authorization not required No pre -market review for safety, efficacy Quality and security requirements are set out under the Cannabis Act ; No health claims can be made about these products. 2. Medical cannabis Health care practitioner authorization required ; Registration as a patient with a Licensed Producer required; Quality and security requirements are set out under the Cannabis Ac t; No health claims can be made about these products. 3. Health Products containing cannabis Health care practitioner prescription is required Pre-market review for safety, efficacy and qualit y under Food and Drug Act (Canada) Manufacturing subject to quality and security requirements under the Food and Drug Act (Canada) and Cannabis Act ; Can make health claims. A: When addressing non -medical (recreational) cannabis, naturopathic doctors shall : 1. have knowledge of the Cannabis Act (2018) ; 2. ensure that the patient is aware that they are not authorized to prescribe, dispense or sell cannabis and as such can only provide general guidance on cannabis use for nonmedical purposes; 3. advise patients to dis cuss the use of cannabis for health purposes with their original prescriber, in accordance with NWT Standard of Practice: General; Page 8 of 15 4. refrain from guiding patients: a) that non- medical (recreational) cannabis is to be used for health purposes including for the treatment and management of health conditions or for therapeutic purposes, b) of recommendations on the type, strain, amount, frequency and/or potency that a patient should use, and c) that a patient cease current medication in lieu of using non- medical (recreational) cannabis; 5. not possess or sell cannabis for professional use in their practice; 6. understand that non -medical (recreational) cannabis can only be used in a private residence and cannot be consumed in any public place, workplace or motorized vehicle and that personal use of non- medical (recreational) cannabis does not impact the delivery of professional naturopathic services and treatments.

Collaboration in Patient Care in a Shared Healthcare Setting When collaborating in administering a shared treatment with another health and social services provider in a shared healthcare setting, naturopathic doctors shall do so safely, competently and ethically in accordance with current standards of practice and legislation. Introduction This document serves as a resource to help naturopathic doctors apply the NWT Standards of Practice with respect to collaborating in administration of a shared treatment with other health and social services providers within a shared healthcare setting. Guidelines help clarify roles and responsibilities, and/or provide a framework for sound and appropriate decision making. A. General When collaborating with other health and social services providers within a shared healthcare setting, a naturopathic doctor should ensure to only collaborate with another health and social services provider with appropriate registration (i.e. being registered in the NWT or another province or territory), authorization and competence in performing shared treatment. When collaborating with other health and social services providers within a shared healthcare setting, a naturopathic doctor can only collaborate on shared treatments including intravenous vitamin therapy, intravenous chelation therapy and appropriate naturopathic injection therapies, where the other health and social se rvices provider has appropriate registration, authorization and competence in performing the said shared treatment. Such shared treatments can only be administered by a regulated health and social services pro vider with an appropriate and current scope of practice (both the naturopathic doctor and the other health and social services provider ). Naturopathic doctors are reminded that when making decisions regarding collaboration with another health and social services provider within a shared healthcare se tting, that they are always required to follow the adopted Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice for the profession. This includes, but is not limited to the following: The naturopathic doctor ensures that when developing an evidence -informed shared tre atment plan for the patient, the best interests of the patient and the assessments and diagnoses of the patient are considered, as per the NWT Standard of Practice: General; The naturopathic doctor ensures that they refrain from performing activities that they are not competent to perform, despite any authorization given to the member to perform activities, as per the NWT Standard of Practice: General; The naturopathic doctor ensures that a plan is in place to manage any critical or unexpected events including adverse events associated with performing an Expanded Scope Activity, as per the NWT Standard of Practice: Emergency Readiness; Page 10 of 15 The naturopathic doctor implements and amends shared treatment plans with the consent of the patient, as per the NWT Standard of Practice: Consent; The naturopathic doctor monitors each patient appropriately for the level, type and continuation of treatment, as per the NWT Standard of Practice: G eneral; and The naturopathic doctor appropriately maintains patient naturopathic medical records, as per the NWT Standard of Practice: Record Keeping. B. Protocols When collaborating with other health and social services providers within a shared healthcare setting, written or electronic protocols are required to further patient safety. An appropriate protocol includes: the name of the specific protocol, a description of the intervention(s) included in that protocol, identification of the competencies, educational requirements and/or health and social services providers that can implement the protocol, identification of any contraindications or exclusions to implementing the protocol, clear, specific clinical conditions that must be met be fore the interventions can be implemented, the relevant assessment data and diagnosis to be collected and used in decision making when implementing the protocol, monitoring parameters, the required communication to the most responsible health and social ser vices provider documentation required for the health and social services provider implementing the protocol, the date the protocol was formally established, and the date to be reviewed. Protocols must be: evidence -informed, in accordance with federal and territorial legislation and regulation, appropriate for the scope of practice of the health and social services p rovider performing the interventions within the protocol, based on patient health needs, appropriate for the specific practice setting (i.e. the availability of essential technical and human resources, etc.), and reviewed, evaluated and revised, if needed, on a regular basis to ensure that they continue to be evidence -informed and reflect best practice. C. Preparing Substances for Administration In situations where more than one person is involved in administering a shared treatment, particularly in the case where a naturopathic doctor has recommended a specific Page 11 of 15 intravenous therapy and another health and social services provider is administering the treatment, best practice should be that: All involved health and social services providers be physically present when preparing the intravenous treatment bag to be administered, The names of all involved health and social services providers be labelled on the intravenous treatment bag, and Documentation is co -signed by all involved health and social services pr oviders confirming that this occurred. D. Monitoring Treatment In a shared healthcare setting, ther e may be situations where a naturopathic doctor creates a shared treatment plan for a patient where the treatment, or part of it, is administered by another health and social services provider . It is important to note that the naturopathic doctor is still responsible for monitoring the patient and ensuring the treatment plan is still in the best interest of the patient as per the NWT Standard of Practice: General. The method of monitoring needs to be appropriate to the patient's condition, the clinical situation, and puts the patient's welfare first.

Medical Technologies and Devices When using medical technologies and devices, naturopathic doctors shall do so safely, competently and ethically in accordance with the standards of practice and legislation. Introduction This document serves as a resource to help naturopathic doctors apply the standards of practice with respect to the use of medical technologies and devices as part of a safe and competent naturopathic practice. The se guidelines do not r eplace current standards; rather it is an additional resource to help naturopathic doctors apply the NWT standards to their practice. A. When using medical technologies and devices, naturopathic doctors shall: 1. Be knowledgeable of how to use the technology and/or device safely and competently; 2. Use evidence informed practice, as described in NWT Standard of Practice: General; 3. Only recommend diagnostic procedures and treatments that are necessary and beneficial to the patient, as described in the adopted Code of Ethics; 4. Provide clear communication to the patient and obtain informed consent, as described in NWT Standard of Practice: General and Standard of Practice: Consent; 5.

Using titles and Terminology in Advertising, Marketing and Digital Media Content The intention of this document is to provide guidance to naturopathic doctors when selecting terminology, titles, and descriptors of their practice that comply with all relevant legislation and to ensure that naturopathic doctors are clear and transparent to the pubic in their advertising, marketing and digital media content. Introduction Advertising, marketing and digital media is a component to many naturopathic doctors ' practice. It is imperative that the naturopathic doctor holds accountability for publishing information that is accurate and complete, and that this information is delivered to the public in a clear and transparent manner. Additionally, it is crucial that the naturopathic doctor only use protected titles authorized by the Naturopathic Profession Regulation and refrain from using protected titles that have not bee n granted to naturopathic doctors in the N WT. A. Use of Protected Titles The Naturopathic Profession Regulation outlines the protected titles that may only be used by naturopathic doctors that are re gistered to practice in the NWT and include: Naturopathic Doctor and its initials N.D.; Naturopathic Practitioner; Naturopathic Physician; Naturopath; Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine and its initials N.M.D; and Doctor of Naturopathy. In their advertisin g, marketing and digital media content, naturopathic doctors should: 1. comply with Standard of Practice: Advertising and Marketing by only using only titles as provided for in the Naturopathic Profession Regulation; 2. Be deliberate and clear and ensure that ea ch time a reference to a naturopathic doctor's title is made, it is placed in context: use the word \"naturopathic\" preceding the word, \"doctor\" when referring to themselves; use the word \"naturopathic\" referring to themselves as a doctor of naturopathic medicine; use the word \"naturopathic\" when a naturopathic doctor is referring to the practice of naturopathic medicine; and, use the word \"naturopathic\" when referring to any kind of naturopathic medicine. Page 15 of 15 Do not use Use instead *Doctor (as a standalone) Naturopathic Doctor or ND Physician Naturopathic Doctor or ND *Medicine Naturopathic Medicine *Becoming a doctor Becoming a Naturopathic Doctor or ND *members should be using \"naturopathic\" every time this reference is made. B. Specializations To be clear and transparent to the public, naturopathic doctors must ensure that they do not mislead the public by implying specializations or, that they are a specialist. Naturopathic doctors do not have the authorization to use the term s pecialist or to infer that they are a specialist. Any reference that a naturopathic doctor has to a specialty in an existing field infers that they are a specialist. This contravenes the Health and Social Services Professions Act and regulations and consti tutes unprofessional conduct. Do not use Use instead Specializing Focusing Family Medicine Naturopathic Family Health Care Naturopathic Family Medicine / Practice Naturopathic Family Health Care *Medical School Naturopathic Medical School Oncology or Cancer ** Treatment Naturopathic Cancer Care / Support Pediatric Special Interest in Children's Health *Members should be using \"naturopathic\" every time this reference is made **Using the terms 'support' and 'care' instead of 'treatment' wh en referencing a specialization or another profession's protected titles.
