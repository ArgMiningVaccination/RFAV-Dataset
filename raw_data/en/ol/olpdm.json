A quantum energy practitioner for the last 20 years, Dr Chimthanawala believes the science of thoughts and emotions will play a crucial role in the coming days, whether to cure an ailment or build immunity, than the products emerging from laboratories. Dr Chimthanawala highlighted the significance of thought-process in healing soul, body and mind devastated by the pandemic. Excerpts from the interview... Q. What is the scope of energy healing in Covid times? A. There is enough research across the globe depicting the components of universe as energies, frequencies, pilot waves, quantum entanglements and so on. Going by physiology, even our body is comprised of energy, frequency and we are also vibrational beings. Meditation, reiki, pranic, access bars, sound therapy, mantra healing and such practices are energy therapies. Among Covid patients, we have observed an effective combination of homeopathy and energy therapies. A regular use of energy therapies can boost immunity. Q. How mind, thought and emotions affect immunity and ability to fight diseases? A. My observations and experiments over two decades have shown that the mind, thoughts and emotions are reasons behind the 'dis-ease state' of the frequency of cells manifesting into an ailment. Every negative thought and emotions create vibrations which disturb the frequency of cell, leaving it in a state of anomaly. Symptoms start surfacing gradually as the adverse frequency gains momentum and begins to spread. Even allopathy doctors refer to stress and tension in diseases like hypertension, diabetes and so on. The beta brainwave is state of awareness but excess of it releases cortisol which brings down immunity. Alpha brainwaves release chemicals which heal and relax our body. Fear is one of the factors behind excess beta state. Positive thoughts keep you in alpha, and negative in beta. I have been spreading this message through webinars across the nation. Q. Will spirituality and spiritual healing help cope with the stress of living in the pandemic? A. Spirituality and spiritual healing are the need of the hour. Spirituality is not just about walking off to an ashram or following rituals but, as per me, it's more about following simple tools like gratitude, love and forgiveness. It is more scientific than what others may perceive. Wellness can be ushered through meditation, chanting, positive affirmations and so on to cover mind, body and soul. The motto should be 'change your thoughts to change your life'. Q. Does energy healing and such practices help expedite recovery during and after Covid? A. Our observations with Covid patients since the onset of symptoms and throughout the recuperation, recovery and rehabilitation period have been encouraging. As energy healing therapies works on mind, body and soul, the recovery period is shortened and immunity gets stronger. Q. Do energy healing and emotional releases also help professionals overcome career issues? A. It is certainly not a magic wand that would bring results overnight. Losses and setbacks during the pandemic have led to depressions, despairs and fears. It has resulted in increase in hypertension, diabetes, cardiac problems and so on. Meditations, visualizations and other energy therapies and their modules are helping people become mentally and emotionally stronger. The mental clarity achieved after energy therapies have led to many new ventures and start-ups. Even women have started businesses, whether cooking, boutiques, chocolate-making and so on. Q. How energy healing helps one get mentally stronger and spiritually balanced? A. There is a technique to energy healing and spirituality. It is supposed to be integrated in one's life. Practicing the technique daily would transform one to attain the frequency of wellness. It would lead to a balanced and stronger mental and spiritual state. There is no need to follow anyone blindly. Q. Would energy healing even help victims of domestic violence that witnessed a spurt during the lockdown? A. Domestic violence victims need counselling and emotional release sessions. Other therapies like balancing techniques and karmic cord cutting help break the pattern of traumas. A complete release of negativities requires minimum 21 days to three months of therapies. Then a scheduled follow up is also required. Q. Do energy therapies help youngsters too? A. Positive affirmations and creative visualizations are great modules to help in programming the subconscious mind to manifest one's desires. We grow up within a limited framework of family values which shapes our belief system and the subconscious mind also gets programmed accordingly. Our belief system also restricts our talent, strengths and abilities. Q. Can energy healing help overcome irreversible losses? A. Any negative situation may lead to depression and even physical illnesses. Again, emotional release sessions help in getting rid of emotional stresses, grief and depression. It should be practised minimum 21 days to three months. Q. How do spirituality and energy healing help one find true meaning of life? A. I always ask my clients and patients, 'Have you met yourself or know who you are?' It sounds weird but it's necessary. Meditation helps you know yourself better. When in state of conscious awareness of your inner being, you make effort to know self and purpose of life. You start meeting the right person at the right time and situation, which ultimately takes you to the path you were chosen for. One must change one's thought to change one's life. "}
