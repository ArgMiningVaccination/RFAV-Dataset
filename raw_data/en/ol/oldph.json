Eisenberg is the Director of the Division for Research and Education in Complementary and Integrative Medical Therapies and the Osher Institute at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Eisenberg has served as an advisor to the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federation of State Medical Boards with regard to complementary and alternative medicine research, education and policy. He has authored numerous scientific articles involving complementary and integrative medical therapies, most notably the 1993 New England Journal of Medicine report on the landmark survey showing that one and three Americans were using some form of alternative medicine. In this interview Eisenberg discusses how this survey paved the way for the tentative acceptance of alternative medicine within the conventional medicine community, and his concerns that much more research is necessary, especially on dietary supplements, before we know which alternative healing methods are safe and effective.
