What to Look For in a Concealer For Sensitive Skin Allergy Tested For people with sensitive skin, making sure to not agitate it further is a key factor [in choosing](https://www.byrdie.com/allergic-to-makeup) any beauty or skincare products.

Hydration There are many [moisturizing ingredients](https://www.byrdie.com/skincare-ingredients-glossary-4800556) available in beauty products. Since dry skin could lead to further irritation, choosing concealer that has hydrating ingredients is an ideal choice.

With sensitive skin, the less covered up it is the safer your chances of it not becoming irritated.
