Several years ago I did an informal survey of colleagues on their experiences with various media. The results can be found in the archives of the acarology list, at this address: http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/acarology/archive/summary.html I hope this information is of some interest.

With this mail I would like to ask investigators who prepare microscopic permanent slide preparation to answer a questionnaire about method on making and preserving preparations. Please ignore this mail, therefore, if you are not concerned microscopic preparations. Further, please forgive me in case you receive the same questionnaire once again or more, since I have sent it to participants of another mailing lists and members of some societies as well. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Dear colleague I beg your generosity to send you such a long mail without introduction. I am working at a museum in Japan and studying taxonomy of pauropods. As you know, pauropods are very tiny and I must make them into microscopic preparations* when examine. Unfortunately, however, slide preparations mounted with Hoyer's medium -most popular mounting medium among Japanese soil zoologists- are to be invaded by air within a couple of years with high frequency, and not a few portion lose taxonomic value in several years. Moreover, unlike \"hard\" creatures such as oribatid mites, pauropods are so \"soft\" that I cannot remount them even when they become dried up. ----- * My present method of mounting and preserving pauropods (1) Use a 32x24mm cover glass as a slide glass, for I have to examine pauropods from both dorsal and ventral sides with oil immersion lens. (2) Place a material, which was stored in 70-80% ethanol, onto the \"slide glass\" mentioned above (excess ethanol was removed with filtre paper), drip a drop of Hoyer's medium. (3) Put a 15mm circle cover glass over the material gently. (4) Let preparation as it is for 2 weeks for drying; no special apparatus such as a hot plate nor an incubator is used. (5) Seal (ring) with nail enamel (OVERCOAT, SHISEIDO). (6) Mount preparation on an aluminium flame (same to one which was used by excellent Danish proturan taxonomist, late Prof. Dr. S.L.TUXEN), store in a slide box (wooden 100 slides) and put the box on a flapless-shelf. Consequently it is a serious problem for me to find much better alternative method as soon as possible. At first I decide to send a questionnaire about method on making and preserving preparations to investigators who seem to prepare small creatures, mainly arthropods, into microscopic permanent slide preparation. I will plan how I may perform experiments to search for better methods by taking its results into consideration. I am most grateful if you kindly help me by replying this questionnaire, preferably by the end of April, 2001. I also provided questionnaire sheet in a Microsoft Word file at the website: <http://homepage.mac.com/norihagino/prep_Q_E.html>. Please visit there and download a file if it is convenient for you -it will make you a little easier in answering. At last, Please be sure that some parts of your answer except for the personal information will be presented in the form of oral report and/ or publication (sorry, probably in Japanese!). I am sorry to bother you much but I am really look forward to hear from you. With my kindest regards.

Dr Zhang I came across your web page - and email address- while attempting to find house dust mite culture methods. I am heading a research group working on the involvement of human common cold viruses (mainly rhinoviruses) on asthma. While these viruses are implicated in over 80% of asthma attacks, no one knows the mechanisms of any possible synergy between these agents and the house dust mites (mainly dermatophagoides spp) on the airway epithelium. Dermatophagoides allergens have protease activities that may synergize with rhinoviruses though the transcription factor NF-kB. We are therefore planning to co-culture lung epithelial cells with virus and dermatophagoides allergens with determined protease activities. However, we are not familiar with the techniques of mite isolation and/or culture, on which your expertise could be invaluable. We will be obliged if you could guide us to either publications or dermatophagoides experts that could help us in that respect. Thanks in advance Frankly Nikolaos G.

Many thanks, Michael Fuller ---------------------------------------- Michael Fuller Graduate Student Department of Biology University of New Mexico Albuquerque, NM 87131 Dear members of the acarology list, A couple of weeks ago, I posted a message asking for info about bird mites because my wife and I were suffering from what we thought were bird mites. An entomologist has since discovered that what I have on my skin are baker's itch mites (rather than bird mites). Can someone tell me more about baker's itch mites (acarus siro)? What ways are there to get rid of them from my environment? How can I get them off of my skin and out of my scalp? Would home fumigation with Vikane kill this type of mite? In a home, where do they live? where do they breed? Do they breed on humans? lay eggs in/on the skin? in the scalp? If I slap my skin with a piece of tape where I feel an itch, I often get a black speck on the tape. What is that black speck? Are baker's itch mites contagious? Do I need to worry about giving them to other people via shaking their hands or kissing them on the cheek? Will other people get them if they come into our home, say for an evening meal? I would appreciate any info about these mites.

Specifically, the mite of interest is clover mite, Bryobia praetiosa. It readily will walk up stakes placed in turfgrass areas but I would like some sort of adhesive that would trap in place those that wander onto the stakes. (These mites, as most of you probably know, readily drop when disturbed, making quanitification of their presence difficult.) I have tried the standard materials I use for insects, Tanglefoot and Stick-em Special (USA product names). The mites, upon contact, avoid the treated surface and do not get ensnared. Any suggestions as to an adhesive that is good for coating a trap that would capture and hold a clover mite that contacts and subsequently walks across the surface? Whitney Cranshaw Colorado State University Ft. Collins, CO USA wcransha@ceres.agsci.colostate.edu Dear Acarologists, some time ago I informed that I was trying to get information on salivary composition of eriophyoid mites. I have preliminary tested about a dozen of species causing several injuries to get salivary spit in oil. And I tested several oils finding that the mites are able to spit largely in oil commonly used for immersion oil objectives. The species which gave us more success was Aceria caulobia, common in Southern Italy on Suaeda fruticosa, causing large galls on the stems. By means of several cares we were able to concentrate (by means of an air flow) a lot of specimens with the oil and then carefully we sieved the fluid (oil and phosphate buffer) by a nylon filter with pore less than 20 microns to avoid the passage of individuals into the filtered emulsion. We checked also that the specimens were integre after the extraction. Than we tested the water phase with two bio-tests: 1) wheat coleoptile length for auxine presence with three different thesis: phosphate buffer, extracted water phase, and water solution of pure hormon (alfa indol acetic acid) 2) radish cotyledon weight for kinetin presence with three different thesis: phosphate buffer, extracted water phase, and water solution of pure hormon (cinetine) The preliminary tests gave us interesting answers. Of course we have to re-arrange the amount of the hormones, but the cotyledons and the coleoptiles in extracted water phase increased largely more than the phosphate buffer and a bit less than the hormon solutions. But we would like to go over this. Of course we have to repeat the bio-tests, but we would like to try in defining the chemical composition by other techniques. So, the question is: are there people which have been worked with CG-MS or HPLC for getting these data? How protocol they have applied? Moreover, one hypothesis is that eriophyoids could transmit small peaces of nucleic acid by saliva into the plant cells. So, the question is: are there people which have been worked on this way? Could they give me information? PCR could work in this, but .... ? Finally, I have tried several times to find the chemical composition of the Olympus immersion oil for ordinary use in microscopy, but I was not able to get data. Could someone help me? Sorry for this long letter, but the topic is so complicated that I am not able to solve by myself all the troubles. Thanks a lot Enrico de Lillo CC: DNA from mites Hello all, just to add another 2 cents... I have been sequencing water mites and other minute freshwater arthropods (admittedly, Hydracarina are larger than many other mite taxa) after extracting with 1) standard phenol-choroform, 2) chelex and 3) Qiagen DNEasy kits. I would endorse the Qiagen kits and chelex for ease of use and suggest that overnight incubation in the lysis buffer is preferable to incubation for only a few hours. However, quality of DNA in chelex seems to degrade over time, whereas the Qiagen extractions do not. It may have something to do with the buffers. Andy -- Andrew J. Bohonak Assistant Professor San Diego State University Department of Biology San Diego, CA 92182-4614 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = Hello Lucie (and other acarologists), I would recommend you try the DNAeasy tissue kit from QIAGEN (no affiliation). Recently I have been using this kit to extract DNA from lice while preserving the exoskeletons for slide mounting as voucher specimens. First I decapitate the louse, then I put both the head and body (with no further grinding necessary) into the lysis buffer provided in the kit and incubate at 55 degrees C over two nights. I then remove the head and body of the louse, which are still intact, and these are subsequently slide mounted as voucher specimens. These vouchers can be used to check the identification of the lice I have sequenced, or to score morphological characters for use in phylogenetic analyses along side the molecular characters. DNA is extracted from the remaining lysate according to the protocol given in the QIAGEN handbook. I've also used this protocol on mites and complete grinding up is only necessary for the very smallest mites. This is far and away the best method I've found for extracting DNA from microarthropods and I urge you to try it. For more information, check out these websites... http://www.qiagen.com/catalog/chapter_05/chap5a1.asp http://www.qiagen.com/literature/handbooks/dny/dnytiss/1011607_dnsy_499.pdf For other methods of extracting DNA from mites check out the protocols on my website at http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rcruicks/pb.html.

I am, accordingly, sending it off again. I just thought that this year's ionosphere is thick enough to propagate this signal up there... Best, Cheol-Min Dear Lucie and other acarophiles, Hybrid but solid state acarologists, who study both morphology and molecules, at the OSAL here, led by Hans Klompen, follow *standard* *homebrewed* CTAB extraction protocol with 1-6 individuals of mites, which works *very* fine with freshly preserved materials. Fresh preservation implies that the mites are, if parasitic or phoretic, separated from their hosts and then preserved in at least 95% ethanol. These samples are then stored at -80C so-low freezer until they are materialized. I think that the closest person to be contacted from the UK regarding this matter is B. Fenton at Scottish Crop Research Institute, who extracted, PCRed, and RFLPed DNA from eriophyid mites. He used Nucleon Kit (Scotlab, Lanark, Scotland). His address is: B. Fenton Scottish Crop Research Institute Invergowrie, Dundee DD2 5DA Scotland, U.K. All the best, Cheol-Min On Thu, 1 Mar 2001 17:26:45 UTC Lucinda Evans wrote, >Hello All, > >Can anyone suggest a useful protocol for extracting DNA from very samll >numbers of mites ?????? > > >I am running molecular work on Psoroptes and Sarcoptes mites and am having >difficulties getting useful DNA out of fewer than 20 or so pooled individuals. > >Any help anyone can send my way will be gratefully received. > >Thank you in advance >Lucie Evans > >Hatherly Labs ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Cheol-Min Kim Acarology Laboratory Museum of Biological Diversity The Ohio State University 1315 Kinnear Rd. else who is interested), I have had good luck extracting DNA from individual larval Dermacentor ticks (pretty small, but maybe not as small as mites?) using the IsoQuick Nucleic Acid Extraction kit (ORCA Research, Inc., Bothell Washington, 98041, USA). I've modified the protocol to include grinding in LN2 and Proteinase K digestion before extraction. I resuspend the DNA in 50 ul of water and have plenty of DNA for 20-30 PCR reactions. For small mites you may want to resuspend the DNA in a smaller volume of water. I've done about 100 larvae from 5 different species and had 100% success amplifying 16s rDNA and ITS2.

The specimens are mostly from cultures (Mesostigmata) or field collections (Tetranychoidea) and were killed in 100% ethanol and then stored in a freezer, or snap frozen at -70. We've had less luck with older specimens from 80% ethanol, room temperature stored collections. Dr Nick Campbell (N.Campbell@mailbox.uq.oz.au) might be able to give you some more technical advice. *Hillis, D.M., Mable, B.K., Larson, A., eds), pp 321 - 384. Sinauer, Sunderland, Massachusetts.
