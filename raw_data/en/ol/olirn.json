Reiki is a healing technique that originates in Japan. \"Rei\" is \"universal\" and \"Ki\" is \"life energy.\" Reiki means \"Universal Life Energy\" and is a laying of hands healing technique based on the principle that the therapist can channel energy to the patient by means of touch to activate the natural healing processes of the patient's body and restore physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual wellbeing. \"LaHoChi is a powerful hands-on healing technique that brings in a very high frequency of light. The \"La\" in LaHoChi refers to the Light, Love and Wisdom coming from the Christ frequency or higher. The \"Ho\" means the movement of this energy, and the \"Chi\" is universal life force. As such, LaHoChi energy can be summarized as \"healing light of the highest frequencies, filled with life force, moving with the combined intentions of spiritual and human beings to wherever it needs to go\" (Philpott). When a person's energy flow is disrupted, stagnant, and/or blocked in some manner, an imbalance occurs on an energetic level (Murray). This energetic disturbance can affect a person on a physical, emotional, mental, and/or spiritual level (Murray). Energetic disturbances can come because of stressors such as thoughts, traumas, and/or toxins. Another way to look at energy is through the scope of vibration/frequency. Vibration is defined as an oscillation or movement of back and forth of energy (Britannica - Vibration). Frequency is defined as the number of waves that pass a fixed point in time (Britannica - Frequency). If the vibration and/or frequency are aberrant for any reason, it can disturb the energy flow in the body, leading to disruptions in the areas listed above. Through use of energy work, Universal Life Force is channeled in by the practitioner and guided to the patient. Vibrations and/or frequencies are normalized once more and energetic flow is re-established. This can have a beneficial effect on a person at a physical, emotional, mental, and/or spiritual level. Energy work can be done in person or remotely on humans and pets. Energy work can be performed to clear homes, businesses, and other locations. References: Murray, Steve.
