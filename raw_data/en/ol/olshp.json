Thes e arrangements recognise that the enforcement of UK food law relating to food safety, hygiene, composition, labelling, imported food and feeding stuffs is largely the responsibility of local authorities. These local aut hority regulatory functions are principally delivered through their Environmental Health and Trading Standards Services. The Agency's website contains enforcement acti vity data for all UK local authorities and can be found at: www.food.gov.uk/enforcement/auditandmonitoring . The attached audit report ex amines the Local Authorit y's Food Law Enforcement Service. The audit scope includes the asse ssment of local arrangements in place for service planning, delivery and revi ew, provision and adequacy of officer training on imports and aut horisations, and implementat ion and effectiveness of imported food (including inspection, sampling and enforcem ent). Maintenance and management of appropriate records in relation to imported food activities and food businesses that handle im ported food, as well as internal service monitoring arrangements, will also be examined. This programme of focused audits has been specifically developed to address one of the main priorities identified in the Food Standard Agency's Strategy for 2010-2015 in meeting the outco mes that imported food is safe to eat and that regulation is effective, risk-based and proport ionate. The strategic priority is to ensure risk-based, targeted checks at po rts and local authority monitoring of imports throughout the food chain. The audits examined Port Health Aut hority (PHA) and Local Authority (LA) systems and procedures for control of imported food and where relevant imported feed, at ports of entry (sea and air) and at inland authorities, in 15 geographically representative PHAs and LA s in England. The audits of PHAs were confined to food not of animal origin (FNAO), wh ere relevant imported feed. However the audits of inland authoritie s covered products of animal origin (POAO) and FNAO. As part of the progr amme, other LAs with ports are also being contacted to establish whether lia ison with ports and appr opriate checks on imports are being undertaken. Agency audits assess local authoritie s' conformance against the Feed and Food Law Enforcement Standard (\"The Standard\"), which was published by the Agency as part of the Fr amework Agreement on Offici al Feed and Food Controls by Local Authorities (am ended April 2010) and is available on the Agency's website at: www.food.gov.uk/enforcem ent/auditandmonitoring . - 3 - It should be acknowledged that there will be considerable diversity in the way and manner in which local author ities may provide their feed and food enforcement services reflecting local needs and priorities. The main aim of the audit scheme is to maintain and improve consumer protection and confidence by ensuring that local authorities are providing an effective feed and food law enforcement se rvice. The scheme also provides the opportunity to identify and disseminate goo d practice and provide information to inform Agency policy on food safety, standar ds and feeding stuffs. Parallel local authority audit schemes are implemented by the Agency's o ffices in all devolved countries comprising the UK.

Introduction 1.1 This report records the results of an audit at t he London Borough of Haringey with regard to food law enf orcement, under relevant headings of the Food Standards Agency F eed and Food Law Enforcement Standard. The audit focused on t he Authority's arrangements for imported food controls. The audit was undertaken as part of the Agency's focused audit programme on imported food and, where appropriate, feed controls. The report has been made publicly available on the Agency's website at www.food.gov.uk/enforcem ent/auditandmonitoring . Hard copies are available from the Food Standards Agency's Local Authority Audit and Liaison Division at Aviation House, 125 Kingsway, London WC2B 6NH, Tel: 020 7276 8428. Reason for the Audit 1.2 The power to set standards, moni tor and audit local authority feed and food law enforcement services was conferred on the Food Standards Agency by the Food Standards Act 1999 and the Official Feed and Food Controls (England) Regul ations 2009. This a udit of the London Borough of Haringey was undertaken under section 12(4) of the Act as part of the Food Standards Agency's annual audit programme. Regulation (EC) No. 882/2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, includes a requirement for competent authorities to carry out internal audits or to have external audits carried out. The purpose of these audits is to verify whether official controls relating to feed and food law are effect ively implemented. To fulfil this requirement, the Food Standards Agenc y, as the central competent authority for feed and food law in the UK has est ablished external audit arrangements. In developing these, t he Agency has taken account of the European Commission guidance on how such audits should be conducted. 1 1.3 The London Borough of Haringey was included in the Food Standards Agency's programme of audits of local authority f ood and feed law enforcement services, because the Authority is home to a diverse community and therefore is likely to be an area where many local food businesses handle imported food. In addi tion the Authority was selected to be representative of a geographica l mix of 15 PHAs and LAs selected across England. 1 Commission Decision of 29 September 2006 setting out the guidelines laying down criteria for the conduct of audits under Regulation (EC) No . 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on official controls to verify compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (2006/677/EC) - 6 - Scope of the Audit 1.4 The audit examined the London Borough of Haringey's arrangements for imported food controls in respect of both imported food not of animal origin (FNAO) and products of animal origin (POAO). 1.5 The audit scope included the assessment of local arrangements for service planning, delivery and review , provision and adequacy of officer training on imports and authorisations , implementation and effectiveness of imported food control activities, including inspection, sampling and enforcement. Maintenance and management of appropriate records in relation to imported food activities and food businesses that handle imported food, as we ll as internal service moni toring arrangements, were also examined. 1.6 The on-site element of the audit took place at the Authority's office at 272 Lee Valley Technopark, Ashley Road, London on 12-13 October 2010. The audit included a realit y check to assess the e ffectiveness of official controls implemented by t he Authority at the food business premises and, more specifically, the checks carried out by the Authority's officers to verify compliance with impor ted food law requirements. 1.7 The audit also afforded the opport unity for discussion with officers involved in imported food law enforcement with the aim of exploring key issues and gaining opinio ns to inform Agency policy. A set of structured questions were used as the basis fo r discussions which sought views and information on areas related to im ported food controls such as: service planning and the stra tegic framework of controls training and support criteria used to determine the level of checks issues affecting the impor ted food control programme sampling, surveillance and enforcement approaches. 1.8 The information gained during interviews will be incorporated into a summary report on the imported food and feed inspection and control activities audit programme. Background 1.9 Haringey is one of 32 London Boroughs and is located in the north of the capital, covering an ar ea of 11.5 square miles. The Authority, which borders six other London Boroughs, is home to over 225,000 people, over half of which come from ethnic minority backgrounds. It is estimated that about 193 languages are spoken within this diverse community. In the Borough there are five princi pal population centres, namely: - 7 - Wood Hornsey and There are approximatel y 8,000 businesses in Haringey, the majority of which are small, employing less t han 24 people, with a relatively high concentration of businesses involving f ood and drink. Although there are several meat processing premises manufacturing kebabs or operating cutting establishments, the vast majo rity of food businesses in the Authority's area comprise small catering outlets, local and regional retailers and larger wholesale premises. 1.11 In the 2010/2011 Service Plan for Food Safety Enforcement, the Authority confirmed that there were 1,808 registered food premises within the Borough, including 19 food impor ters/exporters. The majority of businesses were, however, in the catering sector. There were 68 food manufacturers/packers in the Aut hority's area with 15 establishments requiring approval under Regulation (EC) No. 853/ 2004, although current approvals had been highlighted for review. 1.12 There were 594 food retailers in the Borough and the Service Plan predicted that, ' as the population diversifies and the number of retail food businesses increase, the amount of imported food coming into the Borough is likely to also increase.' 1.13 The food safety function, encom passing both food hygiene and food standards was delivered by officers within the Commercia l Environmental Health Team, who were also respons ible for health and safety, pollution control, contaminated land and ani mal welfare. Although the Team Leader carried out the day to day management of the team and was responsible for the yearly planning of the Service, the Lead Officer for Food Safety provided the specialist s upport for delivering the food safety function. 1.14 The profile of the Bo rough's food businesses, as shown in the 2010/2011 Service Plan was as follows: Type of Food Premises Number Manufacturers/Packers 68 Importers/Exporters 19 Distributors 28 Retailers 594 Restaurants/Caterers 1,098 Total Number of Food Premises 1,807 - 8 - 2. Executive Summary 2.1 The Authority had developed a comp rehensive and detailed Service Plan for Food Safety Enforcement which wa s in line with the Service Planning Guidance in the Framework Agr eement. The Plan made numerous appropriate references to the Au thority's imported food control arrangements. 2.2 A documented procedure for the authorisation of officers had been developed and implemented. Audit checks also confirmed that officers were appropriately authorised for current legislation and had recently undertaken relevant training in relation to imported food control. 2.3 It was evident from audit record c hecks that imported food control is considered by the Authority to be an integral part of the food service. Officers carried out investigations and took proportionate action where illegal imports or high risk third count ry imports were identified. The Service had recognised, however, t hat records relating to previous inspections and other interventions were not sufficiently detailed to give a clear picture of the size, nature and sc ope of the business or the level of inspection and assessment that was carried out. A new comprehensive aide-memoire had therefore been recent ly implemented to address the absence of essential information relating to food businesses and to ensure that detailed records were made of each intervention. 2.4 Audit checks confirmed that appropr iate follow-up action, including formal enforcement, was generally taken in rela tion to illegal food imports or high risk imported foods where food safety issues had been identified. However, it was difficult to ascert ain whether due legal process had been followed in every case, due to the lack of cohesive records on individual cases to confirm that seized or surrendered food had been appropriately destroyed. The audit highlighted that, in the absence of paper records, it is essential that all relevant documents are consistently scanned and electronically linked to premises records to enable retrieval. 2.5 The Authority did not have a docu mented procedure for monitoring the accuracy of their food premises database. The current ad hoc systems which were in place to identify f ood businesses that may not be on the database needed to be further developed and documented. Audit checks confirmed that a significant number of higher risk premises were overdue for food hygiene interventions. This could result in some businesses increasing the risk of their food operations in relation to imported foods or changing ownership without the Aut hority being made aware of their changing circumstances. - 9 - 2.6 It was clear that the Service was pr oactive in providing advice to food businesses on imported food controls. This included information leaflets, letters, a targeted area project and talks at business seminars and local events. 2.7 It was evident that referrals relati ng to imported foods were investigated. However, it was not always clear from available records that appropriate and adequate follow-up action was ta ken. Audit checks confirmed, however, that food alerts requiring action were effectively followed up with appropriate records maintained. 2.8 The Service's food sampling policy and sampling programme took account of the diverse nature of imported f oods sold in the Authority's area. However, from available records, it was not always clear that appropriate follow-up action had been taken following un satisfactory sampling results. 2.9 The Authority's existing internal monitoring procedure required further development and implementation to in clude all areas of imported food enforcement activity. There was little evidence of regular qualitative monitoring being undertaken apart from a structured process for authorised managers to agree formal enf orcement decisions. Robust and effective internal monitoring would ens ure that improved record keeping is sustained and would promote consistency among officers. - 10 - 3. Audit Findings 3.1 Organisation and Management Strategic Framework, Po licy and Service Planning 3.1.1 The Authority had developed a docum ented Service Plan for Food Safety Enforcement 2010/2011, which was ap proved in April 2010 by the Head of Enforcement and reflected the Se rvice Planning Guidance in the Framework Agreement. T he Plan had been produced in consultation with the Service Manager for Commercia l Services and was aimed at contributing to the Council's Key Serv ice Objectives as published in the Urban Environment Directorate Business Plan 2009-2012. 3.1.2 The Food Service Plan set out the Service's values, aims and objectives, which included an objective 'to tackle illegal importation of foods into the Borough and to monitor the composit ion and labelling of imported foods through sampling.' The scope of the food service as outlined in the Plan also highlighted imported food controls and the Service also recognised that 'as the population diversifies and the number of retail food businesses increase, the amount of imported food coming into the Borough is likely to also increase.' 3.1.3 The Service Plan also contained other appropriate references to imported food controls in relation to targeted sampling, providing relevant advice to businesses and area based initiatives 'to provide a platform for effective enforcement.' It was therefore evident that the Authority considered imported food control to be an integral part of the day to day food law enforcement service. 3.1.4 In addition to the monthly scrutiny by Senior Management and the Director of Frontline Services of the performance indicators contained in the Service Plan, a full documented re view of the Plan was undertaken annually. This included the identification of any variances in service delivery and consequent areas for impr ovement in the following year. 3.1.5 The Service Plan confirmed that there was a total staffing allocation of 5.42 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) En vironmental Health Officers (EHOs) for food safety work including th e management and strategic functions relating to service delivery. The Plan also contained a detailed analysis of staffing resourcing requirements to deliv er all aspects of the food safety function. This conclu ded that there was a ' minimum deficit of 1.1 FTE officers, excluding any unpl anned and unquantifiable work .' However, the Plan confirmed that 'there is no opportunity for fu rther staffing resources. We will continue to prioritise, work smarter and focus our work in the highest risk areas to achieve our objectives.' - 11 - Documented Policies and Procedures 3.1.6 The Authority had developed a range of relevant policies and procedures, which were part of their accredited ISO 9001-2008 documented quality management syst em. Documents were held electronically on a shared drive and the maintenance of the quality manual was the responsibility of t he Lead Officer for Food Safety. The Quality Manual was subject to external audit approximately twice a year. 3.1.7 Some of the procedures, relevant to the imported food control, required updating, review and further development in order to provide accurate and comprehensive operati onal guidance to officers and to facilitate effective qualitative internal monitoring. Recommendation 3.1.8 The Authority should: Ensure that all documented pol icies and procedures, including those relevant to imported food control activities, are reviewed at regular intervals and whe never there are changes to legislation and centrally issued guidance. [The Standard - 4.1] Authorised Officers 3.1.9 The Authority had developed and implemented a documented work instruction on the authoris ation of officers. This set out a clearly defined process by which officers were authorised based on their individual qualifications, experienc e and competency. T he power to authorise officers was delegated down, through the Council's Scheme of Delegation, to the Head of Enforc ement and then to the Commercial Services Manager and the Team Leader. 3.1.10 Audit checks confirmed that officers were appropriately authorised for current legislation relevant to import ed food control, in line with their qualifications, experience and competency and that they were acting within their individual conferred levels of authorisation. The officer with lead responsibilities for food hygiene, food standards and imported food had the necessary specialist knowl edge and experience to fulfil their role. 3.1.11 The Authority provided an out of hours duty rota manned by service managers who were EHOs. If a food related matter arose when an officer without the appropriate au thorisation or competency was on - 12 - duty, auditors were advised that they would call one of the food officers to take the necessary enf orcement action. 3.1.12 Officer's individual training and development needs were identified as part of the annual perfo rmance review process and when there were changes to legal requirements and c entrally issued guidance. Audit checks confirmed that, in general, officers had achieved the minimum of 10 hours relevant training based on the principles of continuing professional development. Officers had attended relevant training on imported food controls and the specific officers interviewed during the audit were able to demonstrate an adequate knowledge of imported food legislation. Food Premises Database 3.1.13 The Authority did not have a doc umented procedure for monitoring the accuracy of the database and audit c hecks identified some potential food importers that did not appear to be on the database. Auditors were advised that premises information was obtained through liaison arrangements with other Council depar tments, although this had not been documented. Information sources included: information captured by street enfor cement wardens as part of a Business Property Cleansing programme planning applications property services information on pr emises leased fr om the Borough data received from the co mmercial ratepayers team. Recommendation 3.1.14 The Authority should: Set up, maintain and implement a documented procedure to ensure that its food premises database is accurate, reliable and up to date. [The Standard -11.2] 3.1.15 The Service confirmed that ther e were no Enhanced Remote Transit Sheds (ERTS) located in the Authority's area. 3.1.16 The Authority had in place a co mputer software system capable of providing accurate food law enforcem ent monitoring data to the Agency. The Service had not included third country imported food sampling results and enforcement actions on the imported food section of the Local Authority Enforcement Monito ring System (LAEMS) return for - 13 - 2009/2010. However, the Authority had recognised the need to submit appropriate data on impor ted food activity and the auditors were advised that this information would be provided in the 2010/2011 official monitoring returns to the Agency. Liaison with Other Organisations 3.1.17 The Authority had effective liaison arrangements with other London Boroughs through the Food Safety and Standards North West Sector Food Group and the London Ap provals Group. Auditors were advised that imported food contro ls including sampling were regularly discussed at Food Group meetings. - 14 - 3.2 Imported Food Control Activities Food Premises Inspections 3.2.1 The Authority's Service Plan for Food Safety Enforcement 2010/2011 provided the following details of the Authority's food hygiene intervention programme. The Plan also st ated that officers review the past inspection history, prior to visiting, to deter mine whether a food standards inspection was also due, or would become due before the next programmed hygiene visit. Premises Risk Category Number of Food Premises Inspections A 12 B 136 C 549 D 36 Unrated 120 TOTAL 853 The Service also planned to send out 109 premises questionnaires as part of the Alternative Enforcem ent Strategy for Risk Category E premises. 3.2.2 A database report produc ed during the audit confi rmed that a significant number of higher risk premises were overdue for intervention, namely 1 risk category A, 22 risk category B and 100 risk category C premises. For all risk category premis es, delayed interventions could result in some businesses increasing the risk of t heir food operations in relation to imported foods or changing ownership, without the Authority being made aware of their altered circumstances. Recommendation 3.2.3 The Authority should: Ensure that food hygiene interventions/inspections of higher risk premises in their area are carried out at a frequency which is not less than that determined under the intervention rating scheme set out in the relevant legislation, Food Law Code of Practice and other centrally issued guidance. [The Standard - 7.1] 3.2.4 It was evident from audit checks and the Food Service Plan that the Authority was implementing a risk based intervention programme and - 15 - that imported food cont rol was an integral part of inspections and interventions. The documented work instruction on food safety interventions guided officers to look for imported food records at food premises, including Common Veterinary Entry Documents (CVED) and Common Entry Documents (CED). The procedure also instructed officers to identify whether products were ille gal imports and to take appropriate follow-up action, including enforcement action, where required. 3.2.5 Food premises inspections had been historically recorded on a brief inspection report form which did not pr ompt officers to record sufficient detail regarding their visit to the business. The records relating to previous inspections and other inte rventions, therefore, were not adequately detailed to give a clear pict ure of the size, nature and scope of the business. It was also not alwa ys clear what level of inspection and assessment had been carried out. However, the Service had recognised this issue as part of their Food Safety Improvement Action Plan 2010/2011, developed and agreed by the senior management team as part of their quarterly Enforcement Service Management Team Meetings. Consequently, a new comprehensi ve inspection aide-memoire had been implemented on 1 July 2010 for ev ery food premises inspection completed after that date. This doc ument prompted officers to seek relevant information regarding suspec ted illegal POAO and FNAO third country imports and to ask for relevant documentation from the Food Business Operator (FBO). 3.2.6 The consistent impl ementation of this aide-memoire should resolve the absence of essential information rela ting to food businesses and ensure that detailed records ar e made of each premises intervention. The Food Safety Improvement Action Plan 2010/2011 also incl uded a planned improvement to expand the Alternative Enforcement Strategy questionnaire to include questions about imported foods. - 16 - Recommendation 3.2.7 The Authority should: (i) Assess the compliance of establishments and systems to legally prescribed standar ds. [The Standard - 7.3] (ii) Fully implement the aide-memoire for inspections of all food establishments in its area, to prompt officers to consistently record inspection findings in relation to their assessment of business compliance with legal requirements. Ensure that the records of inspections and key details of business operations are maintained in such a way that they are retrievable and provide complete records of business compliance histories. [The Standard - 7.5] Verification visit to a Food Premises 3.2.8 During the audit a verification visit was carried out at a local food importer with an officer from the Authority, who had carried out the last food hygiene inspection. T he purpose of the visit was to determine the effectiveness of the Authority's assessment and application of imported food controls in relation to third country imports. 3.2.9 During the visit, it was evident that the Service maintained a good working relationship with the FBO, who had clearly taken corrective actions highlighted during pr evious inspections on the majority of issues identified, despite the Service not undertaking revisits to verify compliance. The visit highlighted ongoi ng issues with pests, resulting in hygiene problems throughout the f ood storage area. The FBO retained comprehensive documentation on t he importation of high risk FNAO, however, even though the business wa s the first inland destination, CEDs were not routinely held at the premises. These documents should accompany the food to the first inland destination a nd be retained by that business for one year. Auditors noted that the new inspection aide-memoire included a prompt for officers to check for the presence of CEDs and CVEDs where appropriate. Food Inspection and Sampling 3.2.10 In the Food Service Plan, the Authority confirmed that the sampling activities of the Service would ' continue to concentrate on imported foods, working with and seeking t he assistance from Port Health - 17 - Authorities .' The Service also had a documented food sampling policy which included in its priorities: 'A continuing emphasis on foods im ported from third countries The number of producer s and importers of food and in particular high risk foods within the Borough.' 3.2.11 The sampling programme for 2009/2010 took account of the diverse nature of imported foods so ld in the Authority's area. The Service also participated in the North West Se ctor Food Group sampling programme which included imported food samp ling, partly funded by an Agency imported food grant. 3.2.12 The Service had produced comprehensive, practical documented guidance to officers on both samp ling for analysis and examination. Audit checks confirmed that the official laboratories used by the Authority for food sampling activities were properly accredited. 3.2.13 It was evident that the Authorit y carried out regular sampling of a wide variety of imported food products. Au dit checks were carried out on nine sample records. All the samples had been taken by authorised officers and the results were recorded in every case. However, it was not always possible to determine from the dat abase records the extent or adequacy of the follow-up action taken following the receipt of unsatisfactory sampling results. Good Practice -Sampling methods The Authority's sampling work in structions which detailed the methodology for sampling specific produc ts provided helpful guidance to officers on sampling. Recommendation 3.2.14 The Authority should: Take appropriate action in accordance with its enforcement policy and centrally issued guidance where food sample results are not considered to be satisfactory. [The Standard - 12.7] - 18 - Enforcement 3.2.15 The Authority had developed an Enforcement Services Directorate Enforcement Policy which was origina lly adopted by the Council in June 2002 and subsequently amended in Ap ril 2005. In addition, an Enforcement Strategy 2007-2010 for the Borough had been published which reinforced the Authority's commitment to use proportionate enforcement to help deliver its key objectives. 3.2.16 The Service, had developed formal enforcement procedures in the form of flow diagrams for all formal enfor cement options relevant to imported food control including those for det ention, seizure of suspect food, voluntary surrender and the service of notices. These were contained within the Enforcement Policy and in the documented procedure on Imported Food. 3.2.17 If formal enforcement action was considered by an officer, this had to be authorised by the Team Leader fo llowing the Service's documented procedure on Enforcement Action Decision Making and Offences Reporting. The aim of the process wa s to aid consistency of approach and to ensure that there was an audit trail of authorisation of all formal actions considered, whether or not they were instigated. 3.2.18 A number of formal enf orcement records, taken in relation to imported food, were examined duri ng the audit including: 4 voluntary surrenders 2 detentions under the Food Safety Act 1990, section 9 1 seizure under the Food Safety Act 1990, section 9 1 detention under Produc ts of Animal Origin (Third Country Imports) Regulations 2006-Regulation 8(2) 3 illegal imports Notices under Produc ts of Animal Origin (Third Country Imports) Regulations 2006 - Regulation 24. 3.2.19 It was evident that appropriate follow-up action, including formal enforcement was generally taken in rela tion to illegal food imports or high risk imported food where f ood safety issues had been identified, in accordance with the enforcement policy. However, it was difficult to ascertain whether due legal proce ss had been followed in every case due to the lack of comprehensive reco rds. In the majority of cases examined there were insufficient reco rds to confirm whether seized or surrendered food had been satisfactorily destroyed in line with centrally issued guidance. - 19 - Recommendation 3.2.20 The Authority should: Ensure that formal enforcement actions are carried out in accordance with the relevant le gislation, the Food Law Code of Practice and centrally issued guidance. [The Standard - 15.3] Food Complaints, Referrals, Prim ary Authority Sc heme and Home Authority Principle 3.2.21 The Authority's general risk bas ed policy on food complaints was contained in the work instructi on - Food Complaint Investigation Guidance Criteria. The Service had al so developed a separate work instruction on the investigation of f ood complaints, which stated that the imported food procedures should be considered as part of any investigation of a food complaint. 3.2.22 Audit checks were carried out in rela tion to four complaints and referrals relating to imported food. In general, it was evident that these had been appropriately investigated. However, it was not always clear from available records that appropriate follow-up action had been completed. Recommendation 3.2.23 The Authority should: Take appropriate action on comp laints and referrals received in accordance with its enforcement policy and centrally issued guidance. [The Standard - 12.7] 3.2.24 The Authority confirmed its commi tment to the Primar y Authority Scheme and Home Authority Principle in the Food Servic e Plan. Auditors were advised that, although there were no formal Primary Authority or Home Authority partnerships wit h local businesses, the Service acted in an informal advisory capacity with m anufacturers in the Borough. Food Safety Incidents 3.2.25 The Authority had developed a docu mented procedure for responding to and instigating food alerts. Audit che cks confirmed that food alerts for - 20 - action had been effectively follow ed up with appropriate records maintained. Advice to Business 3.2.26 The Authority was proactive in pr oviding advice to food businesses on imported food requir ements and controls. A variety of activities were undertaken, which included information leaflets and targeted letters, as well as presentations at business seminars and local events. Auditors were advised that import ed food advice was also an integral part of day to day interventions at businesses. 3.2.27 An imported food proj ect was undertaken in 2 009, targeting an area of the Borough where several grocers were known to sell food imported from third countries. The aim of the project was to increase compliance by reducing the volume of illegally imported f ood sold in the Borough. Officers visited the relevant busine sses, examined the food on sale and took appropriate follow-up action to address any non compliance. The businesses were also provided with advice and information on imported food controls and other f ood safety legislation. Good Practice -Advice to business The Authority was proactively involved in providing advice to business in a range of ways to help them comply with imported food legislation. Records 3.2.28 Audit checks generally highlighted a lack of consistency in maintaining comprehensive retrievable records ac ross all areas of imported food law enforcement activities. In the abs ence of paper records, audit checks revealed that relevant documents were not consistently scanned and effectively electronically linked to pr emises records to enable retrieval. - 21 - Recommendation 3.2.29 The Authority should: Maintain up to date accurate re cords in retrievable form on all food establishments in its area and for all relevant checks on imported food, in accordance with th e Food Law Code of Practice and centrally issued guidance. These records shall include reports of all interventions and inspections, the determination of compliance with legal requirements made by the authorised officer, details of action taken where non-compliance was identified, details of any enforcem ent action taken, results of any sampling and follow up action and det ails of any action taken in relation to complaints and referrals. [The Standard - 16.1] - 22 - 3.3 Internal Monitoring and Third Party or Peer Review Internal Monitoring 3.3.1 The Authority had recently produc ed a food safety internal monitoring procedure which required further dev elopment and implementation to include all areas of imported food enf orcement activity. Auditors were advised that recent regular qualitative internal monitoring activities had been limited to case discussions during one-to-one meetings with officers and the authorisation of formal enforcement. Audit discussions emphasised that robust and effective st ructured internal monitoring would ensure that the recently introduced enhanced record keeping would be sustained and promote consistency am ong officers. The Authority had identified the need to clar ify and extend monitoring procedures and this formed part of the Food Safety Improvement Action Plan 2010-2011. This action plan was developed and agreed by the senior management team as part of their quarterly En forcement Service Management Team Meetings. 3.3.2 Other relevant service review and monitoring arrangements undertaken by the Authority included: Officer performance reviews External audit of the Quality Manual Regular documented team meetings that included discussion of performance indicators, consistency issues and work planning, including imported food control Monitoring of business perform ance indicators collected and reported on in the Authority's Food Service and Business Plans.
