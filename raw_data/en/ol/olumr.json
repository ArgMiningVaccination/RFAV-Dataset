Community Clinic Our Community Acupuncture Clinic treatments are streamlined, allowing multiple patients to be seen in an hour. Therefore we are able to make acupuncture affordable, as well as effective. During our clinic, we will treat you either on a massage table, or on a chair while you are sitting up. Providing a healing environment while maintaining your privacy is important to us, therefore we treat in private rooms. Rather than asking a series of in-depth questions, we find out your main concern, then rely on pulse and tongue diagnosis to decide how to treat you. This is exactly how acupuncture is practiced in hospitals and clinics in China. The soothing atmosphere in our clinic exists in part because all our patients create it together. This kind of collective stillness is a rare and precious thing in our rushed society. Maintaining this reservoir of calm requires that no one talk much in the clinic space. If you feel like you need more attention, we will be happy to reserve an appointment, at which time our regular rates will apply.
