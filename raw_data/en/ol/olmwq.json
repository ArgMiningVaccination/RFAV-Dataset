Western herbal medicines are usually made from herbs traditionally grown in Europe and North America, but some come from Asia. Why use it Herbal medicines are often used to help with the side effects of conventional cancer treatments, such as reducing fatigue and improving wellbeing. Evidence shows they should only be used in addition to conventional therapies, rather than as an alternative. What to expect After taking a case history, the practitioner puts together a holistic picture of your health. They will look for underlying reasons for your ill health or symptoms, and provide a herbal mixture aimed at addressing the causes and symptoms of your illness. They may give you a pre-made herbal formula or make up a blend of herbs specifically for your needs. Herbal medicines can be prepared as liquid extracts taken with water or as a tea (infusion), or as creams or tablets and capsules. What is the evidence? There is a wide body of research into the effectiveness and safety of many herbs, and some studies show promising results. Speak to your doctor and herbal medicine practitioner about the potential side effects of any herbal preparations. Using herbs is complex and it's best to see an experienced practitioner rather than trying to treat yourself. Some herbs interact with conventional cancer treatment or medicines, and change how the treatment works or how the dose is absorbed.
