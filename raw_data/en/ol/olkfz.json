She tells us about her journey, and shares a recipe Soon after she got married and moved to Australia, Singaporean food writer and former professional chef Pamelia Chia was forced to confront a gap in her repertoire. By her own admission, she made very good meat or seafood dishes, but wouldn't put the same heart into cooking vegetables. After one too many plates of joylessly blanched greens, however, her husband - who works for a vegetable-breeding company - protested. \"He was the one who said, 'You know, I think you need to learn how to cook vegetables better because they're horrible',\" she says, laughing. The 31-year-old has come a long way since then: she is set to release her second cookbook, Plantasia: A Vegetarian Cookbook Through Asia, next month. The independently published volume features more than 60 of her own recipes as well as contributions from 24 cooks and food writers, representing cultures from across the continent. The result is a kaleidoscope of flavours and influences, from Hong Kong-inspired typhoon shelter mushrooms to zucchini flower fritters with peanut podi. Tying it all together is Chia's vision for the project: celebrating Asia's rich history of cooking with vegetables while challenging notions of what plant-based meals can look - and taste - like. Despite her initial apathy towards greens, produce has been the star of both of Chia's cookbooks. Her first one, Wet Market to Table (2019), celebrates fruit and vegetables that can be found in Singapore's wet markets, ranging from the familiar (lotus root and jackfruit) to the lesser-known (celtuce, chayote and moringa). The book became a national bestseller upon its release and is now in its fifth print run. In a video call from the Netherlands - Chia and her husband recently relocated to Breda, a city in the south of the European country - she explains that Wet Market to Table was about her younger self exploring her heritage.

Not only were the chefs unfazed by requests for vegetarian options, they would whip up dishes that more than held their own against meat-based versions.

Not long after they arrived in Australia, the country was ravaged by the deadly \"Black Summer\" bushfires. Chia and her husband, who were at the time living in Daylesford, a small town in the countryside, had to download an emergency app and monitor fire warnings. Colleagues' families had to evacuate their homes.

Around that time, she decided to hang up her chef's whites and make the pivot to food writing. (Although she still works remotely for an Australian cooking school, Chia runs an online platform dedicated to Singaporean food culture, named Singapore Noodles, in a cheeky nod to the controversial dish.)

Moreover, to her, the bigger issue with defaulting to salads and green smoothies is that it reflects a long-standing Eurocentric approach to food.

Instead, she took an expansive approach to developing Plantasia.

And although Singapore is famed for its multicultural cuisine, Chia chose to bring contributors on board to get as nuanced a range of insights as possible. Many of them were strangers whose work she had admired from afar until she approached them. She interviewed all of Plantasia's contributors about their culinary traditions, publishing the exchanges in the book alongside their recipes.

Recipe: sago dumplings with tempeh and ginger flower By Pamellia Chia; makes about 24 dumplings An underrated aromatic herb from Asia that I wish more people knew about is torch ginger flower. It is one of the most beautiful flowers and has a zippy, citrus-forward flavour that lifts the richest dishes. When chopped and folded into the roasted peanut filling of these sago dumplings, known as saku sai moo in Thailand or saku yat sai in Laos, it almost takes me home. For the dumplings: - 1 cup plus 1 tbsp/160g sago (tapioca pearls), the smallest you can find - 5 tbsp/75ml oil - 5 garlic cloves, chopped - \u00bd small red onion, finely diced - 4oz/110g tempeh, finely chopped - \u00bc 3\u00bc oz/90g Malaysia palm sugar (gula melaka), granulated or shaved off the block with a knife - 2 tbsp soy sauce, or to taste - 1 oz/30g ginger flower petals, finely chopped - cup/40g roasted peanuts, finely chopped [How old Chinese cookbooks helped a Hong Kong chef modernise her food](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/food-drink/article/3231887/how-old-chinese-cookbook-collection-changed-one-hong-kong-chefs-life-empowering-her-cook-modern?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) To serve - A handful of coriander leaves - 1 bird's eye chilli, thinly sliced - 1 small head of lettuce, separated, washed and spun-dry [The best Southeast Asian food in Hong Kong for a big fan of the region](https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/3194871/best-southeast-asian-food-hong-kong-singaporean-and-malaysian?module=hard_link&pgtype=article) Method 1 For the dumplings, cover the sago with a liberal amount of water in a bowl. Soak for 25 minutes before draining. Set aside. 2 To a saucepan set on high heat, add the oil and garlic. Fry the garlic, stirring frequently. When it turns lightly golden, strain the garlic through a sieve set over a bowl. Return 2 tablespoons of the garlic oil to the saucepan and set it over high heat. Reserve the rest of the garlic oil. 3 Add the onion to the pan. Fry until the onion turns lightly golden. Add another tablespoon of garlic oil and the tempeh. Fry for a minute to lightly brown the tempeh, then add the water and palm sugar. Stir the pan briskly to deglaze it and encourage the sugar to melt. Add the soy sauce, ginger flower and chopped peanuts. 4 Cook until the paste sticks together in a single mass. Err on the side of overcooking the mixture; you will not be able to form it into individual balls if the filling is undercooked. Spread the mixture out on a dish, and place it in the freezer for 20 minutes or until it cools down and firms up. 5 Divide the mixture into oz/10g portions, and roll each into a ball. Sprinkle some sago on your palm, place the ball on top, and sprinkle more sago over. As if you are coating something in breadcrumbs, move the ball back and forth between your palms, closing your fist lightly with each pass, until the filling is covered in a thin layer of sago. Repeat until all of the filling is used up. 6 Space the dumplings 1-inch/2\u00bdcm apart on an oiled dish, and steam on high heat for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they turn translucent. 7 To serve, brush the dumplings with garlic oil and sprinkle the fried garlic over them. Top with the coriander leaves and chilli. Enjoy the warm dumplings, individually wrapped in lettuce. "}
