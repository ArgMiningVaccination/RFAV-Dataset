Map: Number of Latinos Completing Health Assessment by Census Block 5 I. About the District of Columbia As the nation's capital, the District of Columbia is characterized by a distinctive international stature and a diverse population. In its 63 square miles, the District is home to a population which represents many world cultures. The 2002 Census indicates that the District's population of 572,059 is 59 percent Af rican American, 29 percent white , 3 percent Asian / Pacific Islander, and 8 percent Other (Figure 1). Resident s of Hispanics ethnicity represent 9.5 percent of the total population. The challenge faced by the Distri ct's health system is to address the needs of all its residents, while recognizi ng the diverse health needs and health status of its numerous subpopulations. Figure 1: Estimated Population by Race District of Columbia, 2002 2002 Population: 572,059 Source: US Bureau of the Census 2002 Ameri can Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau In recent years, dramatic changes, in particular the advent of health care management organizations (HMOs), have occurr ed in the health care arena. These changes have affected the Other 8% (n=43,451) African 9.5% (n=51,068)6 delivery of health care and created new challenges for shaping public health policy. Nevertheless, the purpose for providing health care has not changed. There re mains the need to continuously assess the impact of these changes on public health, on ensuring access to appropriate interventions, on monitoring th e overall health system, and on developing appropriate public policy. In the midst of this changing health care envi ronment, the District of Columbia struggles with a number of health-related problems among its residents. The five l eading causes of death in 2002 were heart disease, cancer, hypertension, cerebrovascular dise ases, and homicide. Expressed in crude rates, thes e deaths occurred at rates of 244.6, 222.9, 61.4, 40.2 and 38.5, respectively. The infant mortality rate in 2002 was 11.5 per 1,000 live births compared with 7.2 nationally. Over the past ten years (1993-2002), there has been an overall declining trend in the infant mortality rate. II. Introduction In the late 1990s, the federal government rel eased draft objectives for a comprehensive 10- year Prevention Agenda for improving the health of the nation by 2010. Named Healthy People 2010 , this initiative (DHHS 2000) evolved fro m earlier Prevention Agendas, notably, Healthy People: The Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (issued in 1979) and the 1980 publication Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: Objectives for the Nation. Prior to the development of th e 2010 Prevention Agenda, national health priorities and objectives were established in Healthy People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives (DHHS 1990). The new 2010 Plan is science-based and is de signed to measure specific areas of progress to be expressed as measurable objectives grounded in local baseline data. The 2010 Plan has two 7 defining characteristics. First, it has two overarc hing goals: (1) to increase quality and years of healthy life and (2) to eliminate h ealth disparities. Second, it spec ifically and explicitly calls for a community-based approach to achieving its basic goals, meaning that local governmental agencies and non-governmental and community-based orga nizations should be fu ll and active partners (DHHS 2000) in efforts to bring the strategies for di sease prevention and health promotion to community residents. The District of Columbia Department of Health (DOH), in an effort coordinated by its State Center for Health Statistics Admi nistration (SCHSA), responded to the Federal initi ative with its DC Healthy People 2010 Plan: A Strategy for Better Health (SCHSA 2000), modeled on the Federal plan, and its subsequent series of 2010 implementation plans with companion Progress Reports: the DC Healthy People 2010: Annual Im plementation Plan Year 2002 (SCHSA 2002), and the DC Healthy People 2010 Biennial Implementation Plan 2003-2004 (SCHSA 2004). A Mid-Course Revision to the DC Healthy People 2010 Plan that will bring the health baselines up to 2000 from 1997-1998 is being fi nalized for release in the fa ll of 2005 (SCHSA 2005). The status of population health in the District of Columbia was also documented in the DC Healthy People 2010 Plan (DC DOH 2000). Following the lead provided at the federal level, the District's strategy is focused on the elimination of health disparities separating resident minority populations from the white population (Public He alth Infrastructure Objective 10 -3. Revised in 2003 to read as follows: Develop data on all raci al/ethnic population groups - i.e., white, black/African American, Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI), American Indian/Alaska Native - residing in the District). However, in order to measure progress in the elimination of disparities, health baseline data on all resident minority populations must be av ailable. To fill this gap in resident minority health baseline data, the SCHSA began work on a model for a targeted community health 8 assessment, the DC Community Health Assessment Initiative (DC CHAI) that had the potential to yield the desired minority health baselines. Un like the standard city-w ide community health assessment models such as Mobilizing Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) and APEXPH, the DC CHAI model would provide a comm unity health assessment based on small area analysis, followed by a community health educati on component with data-d riven health messages. The strategy was put into action when the SCHSA developed a successful application in 2002 to the Centers for Disease Co ntrol and Prevention (CDC) for a Prevention specialist who in her two-year assignment at the SCHSA was focuse d on the establishment of health baselines for resident minority population groups, Latinos and AAPI, unaccounted fo r in the existi ng health data reports and databases at the SC HSA. Early in 2003, the SCHSA c onvened a meeting with partners, including the George Washington University De partment of Global Health (GWUDGH) and the Council of Latino Agencies (CLA), to formulate a plan to apply the DC CHAI model to gather accurate and reliable baseline data on health st atus of different minority population groups residing in the District of Columbia, specif ically with reference to priority health areas previously identified in the DC Healthy People 2010 Plan (SCHSA 2000). In order to obt ain these data, a pilot plan using the DC CHAI model wa s developed to conduct a randomized household survey of a representative sample of the District's Latino p opulation and, based on experi ence gained in this pilot effort, to conduct household surveys of ot her minority population groups as defined in the U.S. Census. Among the reasons for addressing health status in the Latino community first were: (1) it is a large, dynamic, and growing population in the Di strict (and surrounding ju risdictions); (2) it differs from Latino populations in other parts of th e country in terms of countries of origin and socioeconomic status; for that reason so much of the growing literature on Latino health and well-9 being is not necessarily applicable ; (3) approximately three quarters of District Latinos reside in a readily-identifiable and discrete central corridor in the center of the city, so that a household-based survey would be easily designed; and (4) an active network of community-based Latino organizations would be available for collaboratio n. The principal commun ity-based organization identified for this purpose wa s the Council of Latino Agencies (CLA), along with three of its member organizations: Mary's Center for Matern al and Child Care, La Cl\u00ednica del Pueblo, and Andromeda. Together, the partnering organizati ons formed the Latino Health Care Collaborative (LHCC), and a Technical Advisory Board (TAB) of experienced public health professionals from local universities and health organizations was esta blished to guide the work of the partners (See Appendix 1 for TAB membership). III. Health Priorities among Resident Latinos in the District of Columbia Latinos are a population of increasing concern in the United States, and they merit special attention for a variety of reasons. First, ther e are now an estimated 41.3 million Latinos in the country, representing 14.1 percent of the tota l US population (U.S. Census Bureau 2005). The growth of the Latino population is dramatic; the 2000 U.S. Census counted 35.3 million Latinos, representing 12.5 percent of the total U.S. population, growth between 1990 and 2000 exceeded 5 percent, following increases of 61 percent between 1970 and 1980 and 53 percent between 1980 and 1990 (Council on Scientific Affairs 1991). Second, Latinos have poorer socioeconomic stat us than the general population, particularly when compared to non-Hispanic whites. On aver age, educational achievement is lower. Fully 27.7 percent of Latinos in the United States ha d less than a ninth grade education in 2000, as compared to only 4.5 percent of the non-Hispan ic white population, and while 56.1 percent of 10 Latinos had a high school educa tion or more, the comparable fi gure for non-Hispanic whites was 87.7 percent. Moreover, 6.7 percent of Latinos at least 16 years of age are unemployed, compared to 3.6 percent among non-Hispanic whites. Consequently, Latinos are three times more likely to live below the poverty line than non-Hispanic whites (25.6 percent vs. 8.2 perc ent) and over a third of Latino children are poor (34.4 percent vs. 10.6 percent of non-Hispanic white children); (Council on Scientific Affairs 1991). Third, the health status of Latinos is inferior to that of the genera l population in the United States in terms of both mortality and morbid ity, especially among the poor (Lilly-Blanton, Rushing, and Ruiz 2003). Life ex pectancy at birth is lower, wh ile rates of infant mortality, neonatal mortality, and low birth weight are higher (Berk et al. 2000; Morales, Reise, and Hayes 2000). It has been well known for more than a decade that compared to national averages, Latinos have higher rates of hypertension, tuberculosis , HIV/AIDS, diabetes, alcoholism, cirrhosis, gallstones, kidney and liver dis ease, occupational risk, and viol ent death (Council on Scientific Affairs 1991; 1990; Jim\u00e9nez a nd Jim\u00e9nez 1992; Nickens 1991). They also have higher incidence and mortality rates from cancers of the stomach, liver, uterine cervix, and gallbladder, associated with exposure to infectious agents and lower rates of screening (O'Brien et al., 2003). In sum, while there is substantial variation among a nd within subgroups, research has long established a close link between La tino ethnicity and poor health status. Poor health status is exacerba ted by inadequate access to hea lth care, and has been so for many years. For example, 31 percent of Latino children live in families that lack medical insurance coverage vs. 12 percent for non-mi nority children (Collins 1994). Undocumented Latinos are especially vulnerable; compared to other population groups they use fewer ambulatory services (Collins 1994) and have long been more dissatis fied with the care they receive (Scribner 11 1989). Dissatisfaction with care does not occur in a vacuum; recent evidence shows that under the same circumstances, members of minority groups, including Latinos, receive poorer care than others (Lilly-Blanton, Ru shing, and Ruiz 2003). Understanding the cultural and economic dimens ions of health ca re among Latinos is particularly challenging because they are a heterogeneous populat ion, differing not only in terms of country of origin, but also on the basis of durat ion of residence in the United States; levels of acculturation; and formal education; income, a nd other measures of socioeconomic status. Understanding the health of Latinos in the Wa shington, DC area is es pecially challenging, because the Latino resident community is so diverse and dynamic. For example, while Washington, DC's total populati on declined between 1980 and 2000, its reside nt Latino population grew considerably. The 2000 U.S. Census counte d 44,943 Latinos in the Di strict of Columbia, representing 7.9 percent of the District's population, compared to 32,710 in 1990 (or 5.4 percent of the total), and 17,676 in 1980 (or 2.8 pe rcent of the total). A large proportion of Latinos are from El Salvador, but Mexicans and ot her Central Americans, Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, and Cubans are also present in large numbers, as are South Am ericans, especially Bolivians and Peruvians. The District's Latino community is unique for several reasons (Aragon and Lillie-Blanton 2004): Duration of residence is longer than ge nerally thought; the majority of Latino immigrants have been in this c ountry for more than six years. Latino adults are three times more likely to be uninsured than other adults. Latinos have less access to health care, but are not more critical of the health care system than other adults. Compared to Latinos elsewhere in the U.S., t hose in the District of Columbia are more likely to be foreign born and primarily speak Spanish. 12 Among the priority issues identified by the District of Columb ia Department of Health in its Healthy People 2010 Plan 's chapter on Nutrition and Overweight is obesity. The Federal government, through the Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity (US DHHS, 2001) has already identified ove rweight and obesity as representing an \"epidemic\" in America. Approximately two thirds of American adults ar e now either overweight or obese, as measured by the body mass index (BMI), which is based on weight and height. The importance of this epidemic can hardly be overs tated; voluminous literature links overweight and obesity with cardiovascular diseas e, diabetes, and even with the potential fo r decreasing longevity in the U.S. population (Oshansky et al. 2005; Wannamethee, Shaper, and Walter 2005). (For further details refer to Obesity Trends Among US Adults, 1990-2000, a Power Point presentation by Dr. David Satcher, a former U.S. Surgeon General). Overweight and obesity in the U.S. have l ong been associated with poverty and minority status; and recent evidence (Goel et al. 2004; Kaplan et al. 2004) shows that immigrants' duration of residence in the United States is positively associated with higher body mass index. Moreover, the status of U.S. Latino health must be consid ered in a societal context; for example, Popkin (2001) shows that increasing overwei ght and obesity represen ts one of the most important trends in developing countries, and is asso ciated with structural factors such as urbanization and changing diets and lifestyles. Specifical ly, as Uauy, Albala, and Kain (2001) demonstrate, Latin America is experiencing rapid demographic an d nutritional transitions . Overweight and obes ity are on the rise. And associated risk factors, especially cardiova scular disease and cancer, are also increasing. Thus, health status in the Lati no community is not only in part a product of the environment in which immigrants find themselves, but also in part , a product of the lives they led prior to coming to the U.S. 13 IV. III. Methodology A. Study Design The information presented in this report is ba sed on a stratified, probability-based sample survey of 819 adult Latinos living in Washington, DC , who were at least 20 years old at the time of the interview. With technical assistance from the Nationa l Center for Health Statistics and the District government's Office of Planning, a multistage samp ling procedure was designed, beginning with the selection of Wards 1, 2, 3, a nd 4 for the study, because they represented 78 percent of resident Latinos according to the 2000 U.S. Census. City ward maps of Census tracts, Census blocks and household listings by race/ethni city of residents that were provided by the Office of Planning were used to determine the sample frame for the study population (maps available only on hardcopy). The methodology for the determination of the sample frame and random selection of Hispanic or Latino house holds for interviewing purposes was based on procedures recommended by Robert Santos, a pr ofessional sampler with whom the SCHSA team consulted in several telephone conf erences after having worked with the epidemiologist from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assigned to the Department of Health in the Bureau of Epidemiology and Health Risk Assessmen t. It should be noted that according to the federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB ), Hispanic and Latino are interchangeable terms. In this paper, we will apply the OMB definition. The sampling strategy can be described as follows. A multistage sampling methodology provided for the identification of Hispanic populated wards, census tracts and census blocks from whic h there followed the rando m selection of blocks in the designated wards using 2000 census maps. Within the selected bloc ks, interviewers began on the northwest corner and identified every othe r dwelling unit for screening. In the case of 14 multiple-story buildings, the team worked from top to bottom, and moved clockwise around the block until all dwelling units had been identified a nd screened. Selected dw elling units were first screened for Latino inhabitants, ba sed on self-identification. The data collector listed all of the people living in the dwelling unit by first name and age. From the list, the person next in numerical sequence to the last person interviewed was selected. If the first person on the list for the first household was interviewed, the second on the list for the second household would be interviewed. If the third pe rson on the list in the next household was interviewed, and th e fourth household consisted of only two persons, then the second or last on the list would be interviewed . When more than one person in the dwelling unit was eligible (Latino and 20 years of age or more) the one to be interviewed was randomly selected based on age and gender from the lis t of household members. After the selected individual provided informed consent, the interview was conducted (See Appendix 4d for Informed Consent form). If an eligible pers on was identified for the second module, that interview was continued with the application of the appropriate section of Module II. If the selected person was not home, an appointment was made and followed up on. When no one answered the door at selected dwelling units, up to two call-back attempts to arrange an interview were made; the call-backs were made on week days between 9:00AM and 5:00PM, evenings between 5:00PM and 8:00PM, and weeke nd days between 10:00 AM and 8:00PM. Modifications to Sample Size Resulting from Experience in Ward 3 The desired sample size was determined to be 825 (number derived from a desired total of 750 plus oversampling by 10%), as described in the preceding section. At first, this number was to come from the four wards in which most of the Latinos in the District of Columbia reside. 15 However, the data collectors found that conducting the survey in Ward 3 was extremely difficult for the following reasons: -First: the vast majority of Latinos in Ward 3 were not interested in participating in the study. We attributed this to th e fact that Latinos in this ward have a higher income and social status and, on average, have better acces s to health care and a better quality of life (and thus, may have had less incentive to participate in the study); -Second: most of the residences in Ward 3 ar e condos, and the data co llectors were unable to gain access to the buildings to randomly select the dwelling units; -Third: the census figures for Ward 3 Latinos may very well includ e people who are not permanent residents of the District, being eith er students or associated with diplomatic missions or international organizations. It was decided to drop Ward 3 - after having made several unsuccessful attempts with letters to building managers and ward representatives desc ribing the survey and its significance - and to increase the sample in the other wards; the increase was accomplished by increasing the number of persons to be selected from the target blocks by 20 percent, each ward wa s treated as a separate stratum. A Detailed Outline of th e Sampling Methodology is in Appendix 2. Development of Survey Instrument The survey instruments consisted of two m odules. A main module, Module I, was based primarily on the District's 2001 version of the Behavior al Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS ), that was designed to solicit information on demographics, access to health care, and health outcomes related to high-risk behaviors, with pa rticular emphasis on preventable diseases. Additional questions on injury and access to hea lth care were taken from the National Health Interview Survey to complete Module I. Al l of the questions incl uded in the Module had 16 previously been tested and validated. The questionnaire was wr itten in both English and Spanish and pre-tested in both languages. Respondents were gi ven the option of answering in either language; ultimately, all 819 interv iews were conducted in Spanish. This module was designed to be applied in approximately 45 minutes. (See Appendix 4a, 4b, 4c for Module I). A second module, to be discussed in a separate report, wa s designed to provide information on segments of the Latino community of particular interest to providers in the CLA: mother and children, adolescents and the elderly. The instruments were approved by the District of Columbia Department of Health Institutional Revi ew Board for Public Health (IRBPH). It should be explained that the BRFSS is a telephone survey of randomly selected adults living in households with telephones within the Di strict of Columbia. In the District, the BRFSS is conducted by the DOH/ Bureau of Epidemiol ogy and Health Risk A ssessment with funding and guidance from the Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention. However, respondents to the BRFSS are limited to those persons living in hous eholds with telephones and able to understand and communicate in English; thus the probability of including a re presentative sample of Latinos is low. A comparison of prelim inary findings with the LHCC survey tool to Module I and the 2003 BRFSS is shown in a power point presentation in Appendix 7. Pretesting of the instrument Pretesting of the instrument and intervie wing protocol was done on three separate occasions in nearby sites in Maryland. On tw o occasions, the survey and protocol for interviewing were pretested on a group of Lati nos attending classes in English as a second language and on one occasion on members of a Latino church. Pretesting was conducted to identify and correct any language or interviewi ng procedures that were unclear, misleading or 17 culturally unacceptable. Prior to the fieldwork trai ning, errors identified in the pretesting of the instrument and protocol for interviewers were corrected. Training of the Data Collectors A four-day training session was planned and co mpleted as scheduled. A bilingual team of data collectors consisti ng of 15 native Spanish speakers, recruited from the Latino community participated in an intensive four-day traini ng session. The training wa s conducted entirely in Spanish, and consisted of the following elements: The project's purpose and goals. This compon ent allowed team members to understand and appreciate the project's importance and their role in contributing to its overall success. Project logistics and field work, incl uding sampling methodology, identification of selected households and indivi duals within households, rules for call backs, and informed consent. This component provided the necessa ry skills for applying the questionnaires in the field in the most accurate and efficient manner possible. Interviewing techniques, including optimiz ing the interviewer- interviewee dynamic, obtaining informed consent, registering respons es, handling skip patterns, and closing the interview. This component was designed to provide the skills that were essential for successful interviewing and accurate recording of information provided by the respondent. Introduction to the questionnair e, with a focus on each s ection and question. This component familiarized the interviewers with the specific elements of the questionnaire: design and layout, correct formulation of each question, skip patterns, and rules for addressing respondents' questions. Classroom-based practice. This component prov ided interviewers w ith the opportunity to formulate the questions in the questionnaire and to record responses to each question. In 18 general, it provided interviewers with greater familiarity with the questions, the management of skip patterns, and other features. It also gave the GW team trainers the opportunity to observe and eval uate the interviewers. Field-based training at the Nuev a Esperanza Lutheran Church in Silver Spring, MD. It should be noted that the instruments had prev iously been pilot tested at the Community Ministries of Rockville, in Rockville, MD. The training emphasized the following points: correct selection of hous eholds and eligible adults within households, correct techniques for completing questionnaires, skip patterns, presentation at the door, protecting confidentiali ty, how to ask questions, avoiding bias, repeat calls (morning, afternoon, evenings, weekends) a nd appointments, supervision and reporting, handling of completed questionnaires, transportati on, cell phones, and other logistical matters. In addition, techniques for selecting households for the additional modules were reviewed. During the training, the teams were formed on the basis of balancing skills, experience, and gender. Team leaders were also selected using similar criteria and were given additional information on selection of blocks and house holds, assigning team members to households, quality assurance, and submission of completed que stionnaires to the Prin cipal Investigator and project assistant at (at CLA) for submission to the project coordinator at the SCHSA. The basic technique for the training was in teractive discussion. Ha ndouts consisted of blank questionnaires and reporting forms. Flip ch arts were used and placed on walls to record comments and further the discussion. Following th e training, supervisors were interviewed and all interviewers completed a shor t questionnaire in which the differe nt elements of the training were assessed. (See Appendix 6 fo r Evaluation of Training Report). 19 Practice Prior to Fieldwork Monitored practice sessions we re conducted both in house and in the field in order to standardize the applicati on of the instrument. The practice sessions were conducted on a group of Latinos who were not District re sidents, so that the LHCC target population would not be biased. However, the participants selected for the pret esting were sociodemiogra phically comparable to the LHCC target population. Preparations for Fieldwork The data-collectors/interviewers were divided in to five teams; for each, a team leader was selected based on experience and performance during the training. Th ese individuals were responsible for team oversight, l ogistical decisions within select ed blocks, and quality assurance for completed questionnaires. They also acted as interviewers. Each day, the teams were assigned to cover a certain number of households in designated blocks in the selected wards as indicated on small area maps of Census blocks provided by the PI and project coordinator. These maps were drawn from the ward maps provided by the Office of Planning. An important element of training and fieldwork was quality control, wh ich was addressed by ensuring that interviewers fully understood how to fill out questionnaires and answer sheets and to review them before submitting them to the responsible team leaders. The team leaders, in turn, reviewed the survey answer sheets and submitted them to the PI and project assistant at the CLA who again reviewed the completed answer sheets before submitting them to the project coordinator for data entry at the SCHSA. 20 B. Data Entry Data Entry Process The data entry program was developed by a seni or data entry clerk in the Research and Analysis Division (RAD) of the SCHSA, under the supervision of the Division Chief who also is the Director of the SCHSA. A ll data storage, data entry and data quality were done at this location. The project coordinator se rved as data manager. She also reviewed all answer sheets for completeness and quality before they were given to data entry clerks for entry. Informed Consent forms that accompanied the survey answer sheets were detached from the corresponding answer sheets and stored in a locked cabinet on a separa te file before being handed to the data entry clerks. Data entry process included daily quality assurance and verification for accurateness and completeness to a random selection of the daily entries. Data entry clerks were instructed to verify entrie s several times a day. The data manager also performed random checks to verify the accuracy of the data during each day. The senior data entry clerk also conducted periodic checks of the entries for errors. Data entry was completed on its 94% after three weeks. A final data entry day was required to complete the last batch of answer sh eets returned by data collectors two weeks later. After the data entry was 100% completed, more deta iled data quality verifi cation took place. The Chief of RAD completed the merging of data into one file and its exportation to Excel and SAS statistical software. A preliminary run of frequencies for each variable on both Modules (i.e. Module I the core assessment tool, Module II with its three s ections: A, B and C) was done on SAS statistical software. Using the frequency runs, the data ma nager verified each variable of Module I for any incorrect entries due to error in data collectio n or data entry. The necessary corrections were 21 made to the original Excel file and new frequency runs were done . At this point, Module I data are considered to be 100% clean. Data Entry Program The program used to enter data from LHCC assessment tool answer sheets was dBASE. The entries will be imported into Excel for final da ta quality assurance of the whole database, and then imported into SAS for data analysis. Data Entry Clerks A job description was circulated among LHCC partners and Technical Advisory Board (TAB) members. Four applicants who were students on summer break referred by a member of the TAB were interviewed. Th e interviews were conducted at the SCHSA by the project coordinator and her supervisors, including th e program analyst who designed the community assessment model and the RAD Chief. The interview process included review of previous experience in data entry and ability to use comput er programs, especially data entry programs. Some knowledge of the Spanish language was requi red. Applicants were also screened for recommendations. During the interview, the incumbents were debriefed on the purpose and significance of the study. They were also intr oduced to the data entry program and asked to demonstrate their computer literacy by entering data from a sample LHCC survey data answer sheet. Of the four applicants, two we re hired as data entry clerks to work at the SCHSA in positions funded by the CMS grant to the CLA. The data entry clerks were paid $4.00 per entered survey. Daily time sheets were submitted to the CLA as lead agency for the study funded by the CMS. Checks were mailed every week to the data entry clerks. 22 Training of the Data Entry Clerks The data entry clerks were trained by the seni or data entry clerk and the data manager in t the following areas: 1. Entering and negotiatin g the program menus 2. Saving on hard drive and backup 3. Browsing through the records 4. Quality verification based on answer sheets (records) 5. Finding common errors on records 6. Understanding the purpose a nd significance of the study 7. Reading through answer sheets to be entered 8. Entering data on separate files for Module I and Module IIA, IIB and IIC. At the end of each day, data entry clerks went randomly through their saved records with data manager. They submitted a daily time sheet incl uding the Survey ID No. of all records entered each day. C. Data Analysis The data from the 819 surveys were checked for errors and consistency using SAS statistical software. The National Center for Health Statistics provided t echnical assistance by calculating the appropriate weights to the sample size with in each census block within each ward (See Appendix 3 for Memo from Dr. Wilbur Hadden). These weights would inflate the 819 sample respondents to the total Latino population in Ward I (13,097) , Ward 2 (5,781), and Ward 4 (6,257). Descriptive, univariate, and bivari ate analyses were performed using SAS. 23 V. Findings and Discussion This section presents the fi ndings of the survey conducte d by the LHCC in 2004. First, information is presented on the characteristics of the interviewees with respect to gender, age, marital status, country of orig in, education, employment status , household income, duration of residence in the U.S., language ability, race, insu rance coverage and general health status. The next section presents the findings on the five leading health c onditions encountered in the Latino community. The section that follows contains info rmation on access to heal th care and barriers; then data are presented on other health outco mes. Finally, conclusions are presented. A. Latinos in the District of Columbia The single characteristic that most typifies the District's Latino community is its diversity as measured by a variety of socioeconomic and demographic indicators. Figure 2 (below) shows that a little more than one-half of the responde nts were females and just over 40 percent were males. Figure 2.

Department of Health, State Center for Health Statistics Administration The survey results on age of respondents coincide with other studies that suggest that this is a relatively young population (Figure 3 below). Less than three perc ent of respondents were 65 years of age or older, compar ed with those in the younger ag e brackets: 20-24 years old (15.1 24 percent), 25-34 years old (36.8 percent), 35-44 years old (25.3 percent), 45-54 years old (14.0 percent) and 55-to more than 65 ye ars old (less than 10 percent). Figure 3. Self-Reported Age, 2004 Percent 15.1%25.3% old 45-54 years old 55-64 years old 65 years and older Total surveyed N=819 D.C. Department of Health, State Center for Health Statistics Administration As far as marital status, almost half of surveyed Latinos surveyed are married (44 percent), almost 30 percent are single or have ne ver been married and 14.3 percent lives in an unmarried couple arrangement and 14.6 percent are divorced, widowed or separated. (Figure 4 below). Figure 4.

Department of Health, State Center for Health Statistics Administration 25 Figure 5 (below) shows that natives of El Salva dor represent more than half of the sample, but that many other countries are represented as well. Notably, a total of 12 percent of respondents came from El Salvador's Central American neighbors Guatemala and Honduras. Natives of Mexico, who represent around two th irds of Latinos at the nationa l level, represent another 12 percent in the District, while the two other largest groups at the national level, Cuba and Puerto Rico, are much less represented in the District. Figure 5. Country of Origin, 2004 Total surveyed N=819El Salvador 61.8% of Health, State Center for Health Statistics Administration Figure 6 (below) shows that a very large propor tion of the District's Latino community has relatively little formal education; eight percent ha ve never attended school and just over half have only a primary school education. Th is finding has profound implications for the ability of members of this community to have access to high-paying jobs and to be able to na vigate the health care system effectively. 26 Figure 6.

Note also that a very small proportion of respondents reported that they are retired. Figure 7.

Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration 27 Figure 8 (below) shows that th e household income of a large proportion of the District's Latino community is extremely precarious; nearly tw o-thirds of respondents reported total household incomes of $25,000 per year or less, wh ile only five percent reported total household incomes of $50,000 or more. About three in ten DC Latinos survey ed (28.3 percent) is poor based on income below 100% of poverty determined by th e Federal Poverty Threshold for a family of three - $15,260 in 2003. (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2003). Figure 8. Total Household Income, 2004 Total D.C. Depart ment of Health, State Center for Health Statistics Administration Finally, as shown in Tables 1 & 2 (below), show two important indicators (language and duration of residence) that are often used to me asure levels or degree of acculturation support the notion that the District's Latino community is different than those Latino communities found elsewhere in the United States and that it is more diverse. The tables also present an apparent paradox: while a large proportion of respondents speak only or pr imarily Spanish (59 percent), about two-thirds have been living in the United States for five year s or more and only about a fifth report living here for less than two years. 28 Table 1.

Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration Surveyed Latinos in the Washington, D.C. area we re more homogeneous in their response to the question of race (Table 3). Respondents self-report ed their race as \"White\" 10 percent, \"Black or African American\" 0.7 percent, \"Asian\" 0 percen t, \"Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander\" 0.1 percent, \"American Indian or Alaska Nativ e\" 1.0 percent, \"Mixed\" or \"Other\" 88.5 percent (having to specify). Among the specific answers given by respondents to the \"Mixed or Other\" options were: Hispanic or Latino/a (87.8 percen t), Mestizo (of mixed pa rentage, especially Spanish and Indigenous, 7.2 percent), Mixed (3.1 pe rcent), mentioned their country of origin (1.4 percent) and Moreno and Indigenous (both 0.2 percent each). This illustrates that the majority of people in this group think of Hispanic or Latino as a race and not as a cultural, linguistic or anthropological heritage. When looking at the combination of language spoken and duration of 29 residence of the 819 respondents, 20.2 percent who reported living in the U.S. for more than 10 years speak Spanish only, followed by those who liv e in the U.S. for 5-10 years (15.9 percent), and 2-5 years (13.9 percent). Thus, these numb ers translate to 50 per cent of D.C. Latinos surveyed reside in the U.S. for two years or more speak Spanish only and 65.4 percent who live in the U.S. for two or more years speak only Spanish or Spanish and some English (Table 2).

Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration 30 B. Self Reported General Health Status Absent clinical examinations, the survey allowed respondents to self-report on their health status and functional disability. Figure 9 (below) shows that ne arly two-thirds of respondents assessed their own health as excellent, very good, or good; at the same time, over a third view their health as only fair or poor. Women (39 percent) are more likely to describe their health as fair or poor (Table 29). The data also show that with increasing age more peopl e tend to respond in similar terms. Income and educational levels are also important factors in the perception of the person's health status. With decreasing income and education, the proportion of respondents who reported fair or poor health increased across each level. Widowed persons (50 percent) and those unable to work (88.8 percent) had the greatest proportion of perceived fa ir or poor health. Residents who live more than 10 years in the U.S. (44.1 percent) and speak Spanish only (42.1 percent) also have the largest pr oportion of perceived fair or poor health. Table 5 (below) shows that few respondents reported extend ed periods of ill health (between 21-30 days); note that fewer respondents reported experiencing no days in wh ich mental health (defined as stress and depression) (66.3 percent) was not good compared to physic al health (defined as physical illness and injury) (70.6 percent). Also not e that fifteen percent more res pondents reported that bad health did not prevent normal activities than those who i ndicated there were no days in which health was not good (86 percent vs. 70.6 pe rcent respectively). This may indicate that even when sick or when \"health is not good\" Latinos pursue their normal activities at a high rate. 31 Figure 9.

Five Leading Health Conditions Figure 10 (below) shows that, the five lead ing health conditions encountered among respondents are overweight and obesity (60.8 pe rcent), diabetes, including pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes, (18.2 pe rcent), high blood pressu re (16.8 percent), blood cholesterol (13.6 percent), a nd arthritis (7.7 percent). 32 Figure 10.

Depa rtment of Health, State Center fo r Health Statistics Administration 1. Overweight & Obesity Measured by Body Mass Index As reported above, overweight and obesity re present one of the mo st important health problems in the country given both the association with other health problems and the increasing prevalence. As noted earlier, ne arly 61 percent of re spondents were either ove rweight or obese as measured by reported height a nd weight, which were used to calculate the body mass index (BMI), which was then compared to national standa rds. BMI is the weight in kilograms (kg) of the person without wearing shoes divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m2) without wearing shoes ([weight in kg] / [height in meters]2 or / in cm]2 x 10,000). BMI does not actually measur e body fat, but generally correla tes well with the degree of obesity. Overweight is defined as a BMI from 25.0 through 29.9. Pe ople who fall in this group are at a slightly increased risk of weight-related health conditions, such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, hear t disease, and adult-onset of diabetes . Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or more. The risk of heart disease, other weight-related conditions, and premature deaths greatly increases for people in this group. It is interest ing to note (Table 6) that overweight is 33 slightly more prevalent in men (43.7 percent) than women (36.6 percent) while the opposite is true for obesity: 23.4 percent for women compared to 17.9 percent for men. Table 6. Body Mass Index (BMI) by Gender, 2004 Female Male Total BMI Number Percent Number Percent Number Percent Underweight - BMI < 18.5 56 12.1 21 5.9 77 9.4 Normal - BMI 18.5 - 24.9 129 27.9 115 32.2 244 29.8 Overweight - BMI 25.0 - 29.9 169 36.6 156 43.7 325 39.7 Obesity - BMI > 30.0 108 23.4 64 17.9 172 21.0 No response-weight unknown 0 0.0 1 0.3 1 0.1 Total surveyed 462 56.4 357 43.6 819 100.0 D.C. Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration The prevalence or occurrence of overweight and obesity tends to increase with age (Table 31). This risk of being overweight and obese, however, increase from age 20 years until the age of 44, then it decreases. Overweight and obe sity increase sharply from ages 20-24 years (37.1 percent) and peak at the ages of 35-44 (72.9 perc ent), then decrease at the ages of 45-54 (67.8 percent) and significantly at th e ages of 55-64 (17.5 percent) but increase significantly with old age (65 years or older) (59.1 percent). There is no significant relationship between in come, employment stat us, education level and overweight and obesity in general ( p > .05). Nonetheless, people who had an income between $10,000 - < $35,000 and between $50,000 - < $75,000 showed a higher occurrence of overweight and obesity. Homemakers and people who are unable to work tend to be less affected by overweight and obesity (54.2 and 55.6 percent re spectively). Respondents who never attended school or only had a kindergarten level tended to be more overweight and obese (66.2 percent), in general, than people in other education categorie s, but were followed ve ry closely by people who only had elementary (1st - 8th grade) or some high school attainment (9th - 11th grade) (63.3 and 62.5 percent respectively). There is a statistically signi ficant, though weak, inverse corre lation between marital BMI ( p = Married (66.9 percen t), widowed (68.2 percent), a nd separated (66.0 percent) 34 people are more likely to be overweight and obe se than other people in the marital status classification. The risk of being overweight and obese increas es with the number of years Latinos lived in the United States. Latinos who spoke Spanish onl y (no English) were at greatest risk of being overweight and obese, which decreases as more E nglish is spoken. There is little difference between Latinos who are overweight and obese with health care coverage than those who have no insurance. When we look at the distribution of overwei ght and obese respondent s by their ward of residence, the data show that 63.5 percent live in ward 1, follo wed by 60.6 percent in ward 2, and 55.3 percent in ward 4. -Physical Activity and Diet as it Relates to Overweight & Obesity Most of the strategies that can be brought to bear for wei ght control are reducing high caloric and fatty food consumption and increasing phys ical activity. It is interesting to note that only one in four respondents (24.8 percent) reported that a health care professional had advised him/her to lose weight and only 6.7 percent had b een told to maintain their current weight. -Monitoring and Controlling Your Weight In spite of the level of overweight and obesity found in this sample, less than four in ten (37.2 percent) of all respondents reported that they were currently trying to lose weight, while nearly half (47.7 percent) were trying to maintain their current weight. Of thos e currently trying to lose weight, 74.1 percent of overweight and ob ese and 56.3 percent are trying to maintain their current weight. Table 7 shows that less than one-half of a ll the respondents reported consuming fewer calories or less fat to lose weight or to keep fr om gaining weight; just over one in f our reported 35 using physical activity to lose we ight, and only three in ten repor ted using physical activity to maintain their current weight. Approximately 67 percent of Latinos surv eyed who are overweight and obese are using physical activit y or exercise to lose weight and 67 percent are using physical activity to maintain their current weight. Most respondents who were employed or se lf-employed reported at least moderate physical exercise in the work plac e; 63.6 percent said that their work involves mostly walking or moving, while another 8 percent e ngage in mostly heavy labor or physically demanding work. At the same time, more than one in four respondent s reported that his/her work involves mostly sitting or standing. Table 7.

Department of Health, State Center for Health Administration The data presented in Figures 11, 11a and 11b (below) complement these findings. It can be seen that nearly four in ten respondents report ed that they did not re gularly engage in even moderate physical activity (defined as at leas t 10 minutes of activities such as brisk walking, bicycling, vacuuming, gardening, or any other activit y that causes small increases in the breathing or heart rate) or work while over four in ten reported that they did not regularly engage in vigorous physical activities (defined as at least 10 minutes of activ ities such as running, aerobics, 36 Percent 60.9 7.829.741.9 20.4 010203040506070 Total Underweight Normal Overweight ObeseTotal surveyed N=499heavy yard work, or anything else that causes larg e increases in breathing or heart rate).

Department of Health, State Center for Health Statistics Administration Table 8 presents an interesting contrast to these findings. When asked how many days per week they exercised moderately or vigorously, a much smaller proportion of respondents reported 37 that they did not engage in these activities, whil e over one-half do so at l east five days per week on average. This apparent contradiction clearl y reveals the need for enhanced measures of physical activity that could minimize th e inherent difficultie s of self-reporting. Table 8.

It shows that consumption of fruits and fruit juices is well below the recommended five portions per day and that consumption of red meat averages less than one serv ing per day. Fewer than three in ten re spondents (28.7 percent) reported that they are currently taking vitamin pills or supplements, and of those, seven in ten reported taking multivitamins. Overweight and obese respondents either consumed less (62.2 percent consumed 1-2 per day) or more than th e daily recommended fruits and vegetables (78.6 percent consumed 5 or more per day). Table 9.

Diabetes As reported above (Figure 10), 18.2 percent of all re spondents reported th at they had been told by a health care professional that they ha ve diabetes. Of these respondents, 13 percent (Table 10) were diagnose d with gestational diabetes (diabete s during pregnancy). Sixty-six male respondents were excluded from the analyses becau se the survey data collection sheet showed that they checked \"diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy.\" Table 10.

Department of Health , State Center for Health Statistics Administration Nevertheless, women had the highest rate of diabetes (including ge stational diabetes 27.1 percent) compared to men (4.1 percent). In the D.C. Latino community, rates for diabetes increase with age (Table 32). Th e highest rate of diagnosed diabet es is in the 65 years or older age group (33.3 percent). Those who earne d between $10,000 - $14,999 (28.5 percent) were more likely to have diabetes, followed by respondents who earne d less than $10,000 (25.9 percent). Marital status shows a pattern of an increased likeli hood of diabetes. The data show that divorced respondents had the highest rate of diabetes ( 33.3 percent), followed by widowed (33.3 percent), and separated (20.0 percent) people. 39 Regarding employment status, retired (33.3 percent) Latinos, homemakers (33.3 percent), and those unable to work (88.9 pe rcent) had the highest rate of diabetes. Only 15 percent and 10.5 percent of respondents diagnosed with diabetes engaged in moderate or vigorous physical activities, respectively. Sixty pe rcent of respondents with diagnos ed diabetes were born in the United States and 19.6 percent spoke Spanish only (no English). Table 12 shows that 45.5 percent of interviewees with diabet es had not been checked for feet sores/irritations in the past 12 months; 31.3 percent had seen a health professional for diabetes; and 39.4 percent had not been checked for hemoglobin A1c, while 30.3 percent had been checked for A1c and had had 3-4 checks in the past year.

High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) Figure 10 shows that high blood pressure is th e third most prevalent health condition in the Latino community. Eighty-f our percent of respondents repo rted having blood pressure checked by a health care professional (Table 18 ). Approximately 17 percent of all respondents reported having been diagnosed with high blood pr essure. Of those with a positive diagnosis, though, 40.9 percent are taking medication (Table 18). In the District of Columbia Latino commun ity, more women (21.6 perc ent) reported being diagnosed with high blood pressure compared to men (10.4 percent). In creasing age was also 40 associated with a higher risk of high blood pressure (Table 33). Income and educational status are inversely related to the risk of high blood pressure. Widows (38.1 percent) followed by divorcees (34.9 percent) and sepa rated persons (24.5 percent) had the highest rate of high blood pressure. When looking at empl oyment status, people who are re tired (69.2 percent), are unable to work (66.7 percent), or are self-employed ( 25.7 percent) have the highest risk of high blood pressure. Almost 18 percent of people diagnosed with high blood pressure engaged in moderate physical activities, while 13.9 perc ent engaged in vigorous physic al activities. Fifty percent consumed, on an average daily basis, 5 or more fruits and vegetables. Nearly 21 percent has health insurance, 28.5 percent live in the U.S. longer than 10 years, and 35.5 percent speak Spanish and English equally. Ward 4 (19.6 percent) has the largest propor tion of residence with diagnosed high blood pressure, followed by ward 1 (16.5 percent), and ward 2 (11.6 percent). 4. High Blood Cholesterol As reported above, high blood cholesterol is the fourth most prevalent health condition in the Latino community, having been reported by 13.6 pe rcent of all respondent s (Table 13). At the same time, 52.9 percent have had blood cholesterol checked, and of those, 68.9 percent reported having levels checked within the past year, a nd another 21.4 percent, be tween 12 and 24 months ago. Thus, checking their blood cholesterol within the past two years resulted in 90 percent of respondents. Table 13.

D.C. Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration The data show that gender differences are important, since 17.6 percent of females are at risk compared to 8.3 of males diagnosed with high blood cholesterol. Increasing age is also 41 related to a higher risk of high bl ood cholesterol. Latinos in the District of Columbia who never attended school reportedly have th e highest rate of high blood ch olesterol. Like hypertension (high blood pressure), widows, divorcees, and sepa rated respondents had the highest rate of high blood cholesterol. Retired persons (30.8 percent) and persons unable to work (33.3 percent) have the highest prevalence of high blood cholesterol. Only 1 2.5 percent who have high blood cholesterol are involved in modera te physical activity and 17.3 per cent has health care coverage. Two in five persons with high cholesterol ate 5 or more fruits and vegetables daily. Fourteen percent of respondents with high blood cholesterol live in ward 1, 11.9 percent reside in ward 4 and 9.7 percent live in ward 2 (Table 34). 5. Arthritis As discussed earlier, arthritis is one of the most prevalent health conditions in the Latino community, having been reported being diagnosed with arthritis by near ly eight percent of respondents. As shown in Table 14, substantial proportions of respondents currently suffer from arthritis symptoms and have s ought health care fo r their condition (52.3 pe rcent). A smaller proportion, less than three in ten, report limitations due to arthritis, however. Table 14.

Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration 42 More women (11.3 percent) than men (3.1 percent) reported be ing diagnosed with arthritis. The prevalence of ar thritis increases with age. Res pondents 55 or older are more likely to experience arthritis (Table 35). Widows (22.7 percent) and persons speaking Spanish only (8.9 percent) and living in th e U.S. for over 10 years (12.6 percent) tend to have pain, aching, stillness or swelling in or around a jo int. Latinos who are re tired (53.8 percent), out of work for more than one year (12.8 percent) and live in Ward 1 (9.6 percent) report ed having the highest prevalence of diagnosed with arthritis. D. Health Care Access Consistent with national trends, 41.5 percent of survey respondents reported that they do not have access to any kind of h ealth care coverage, including he alth insurance, prepaid plans such as HMOs, or government plans like Medicare. In addition, as Table 15 shows, that 31.8 percent of respondents do not have any one provide r whom they consider as their personal doctor. Nearly three-fourths (74.6 percen t), though, have access to a specific clinic or doctor's office for their health care, while one-four th (24.8 percent) has neither. Table 30 shows that more women (67.5 percent) than men (46.2 percen t) have health insurance. People who are 65 years and older (81.8 percent), earn between $35,000-$49,999 (67.2 perc ent), college graduates (75.8 percent), widowed (72.7 percent), retired (100 percent), live in the U.S. longer than 10 years (65.8 percent), speak Spanish and English equally (71.4 percent), and reside in Ward 4 (64.6 percent) have the highest prevalence of having health insurance. Conversely, people ag es 20-24 years (43.6 percent), who earn less than $10,000 (50.8 per cent), have some high school education (53.5 percent), never been married or single (46.1 per cent), out of work for less than one year (36.2 percent), live in the U.S. less than two years (33.0 percent), speak Spanish only (55.7 percent), and live in Ward 1 (54.8 percent) are more likely to be uninsured. 43 Table 15. Health Care Utilization, percent, 2004 Yes Yes, more than one No No Response Total N Do you have one person you think of as your personal doctor or health care provider? 53.5 14.5 31.8 0.2 819 Is there one particular clinic, health center, doctor's office or other place that you usually go to if you are sick or need advice about your health? 67.4 7.2 24.8 0.6 819 D.C. Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration Almost seven in ten Latinos in the District of Columbia indicated that they would go to a clinic or health center if they ar e sick or need advice about their health. Going to a doctor's office or HMO (24.8 percent) is their second c hoice when seeking health care (Table 16). Table 16.

Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration The use of traditional and complementary s ources of health care and treatments among Latinos has been widely observed. This is a broad category that cove rs a wide range of situations and options that are not mutually exclusive. In Latin America it is common for people of virtually all socioeconomic leve ls to use different combinati ons of \"modern\" or \"Western\" medicine in combination with complementary methods such as herbal remedies, and those customs have found their way into the U.S. Lati no community. Among the respondents to this survey, over 36 percent report using prayer to comp lement standard health care, which reflects the deep religious roots of this community (Table 17). In additi on, nearly 20 percen t report using herbal medicines, nine percent using chiropractic therapy, over four percen t using other therapies, and over two percent seei ng a spiritual doctor. 44 Table 17.

D.C. Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration 1. Routine Care and Preventive Health Given the variability in access noted above (Table 15), it is not surp rising that while over one-half (53.5 percent) of respondents reported that they have a health care provider, 63 percent reported having had visited a doctor for a routine checkup (defined as a ge neral physical exam rather than a visit for a specific lesion or illnes s) within the past year and an additional 13.3 percent reported that they had received a routine exam more than a year ago but less than two years ago; 11 percent had not had a checkup in more than two years. Table 18 provides information on preventive health behaviors. As reported above, high blo od pressure was one of the most prevalent health conditions encountered in the survey, and it is closely related to priority areas identified by the project. A high proportion of respondents reported having blood pressure checked by a health care professi onal; of all respondents, nearly 17 percent have been diagnosed with high blood pressure (Table 33). Of those with a positive diagnosis, though, less than one-half are taking medications (although in some of these cas es medication may not be indicated). At the same time, just over one-half have had blood cholesterol checked; a nd of those, over two-thirds reported having levels checked within the past year, and another 21 perc ent, between 12 and 24 months ago. About 86 percent of respondents were to ld by a health care prof essional that they do not have high blood cholesterol, but this remains one of the more prevalent health problems in this community; a finding that is particularly no table given the relative y outh of the population. 45 Table 18.

Other Preventive Health Beh aviors and Health Knowledge Other important issues related to health be havior include immuni zations, tuberculosis control, dental care, and consum ption of alcohol and tobacco. The survey was conducted during a period of great concern about the flu; at the be ginning of this period, the availability of vaccines was limited, but shortages were soon eased. Less than one in four respondents reported receiving a flu shot in the preceding 12 months; and fewer (12.8 percent) reported having ever received a pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccine (Table 19). Pers ons receiving a flu shot increased with age, where those 65 years of age and older (63.6 percent) received the most flu shots. Table 19.

D.C. Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration Tuberculosis (TB) is a growing concern bot h worldwide and in immigrant populations. Nearly sixty percent of responde nts reported having received a sk in test or X-ray for TB; and 46 about five percent reported having been told by a health care provider that they have TB (Table 20). Table 20. Tuberculosis Awareness, 2004 Yes* % No* % Total N Ever had skin or X-ray test by doctor, nurse or health care provider 59.3 40.5 819 Told by health professional that has Tuberculosis 4.8 94.9 789 *Percentage may not add to 100 due to exclusion of no response (yes + no+ no response = 100 percent). D.C. Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration -Dental Care More than four in ten respondents reported that they had seen a dentist or dental clinic for any reason in the past year; on the other hand; 10 percent had not done so in more than two years, and 12.2 percent in more than five years. Moreover, only about three in ten respondents (31.5 percent) reported that no permanent teeth ha d been removed because of tooth decay or gum disease, while nearly half (45.5 percent) had ha d between one and five teeth removed; 15 percent had had six or more teeth removed and 7.7 percen t had had all of their permanent teeth removed. -Alcohol Consumption Alcohol consumption in the District of Co lumbia Latino community as reported by respondents is very low; 74 percent said that in the preceding 30 days, they had not had any alcoholic beverage and 13 percent reported having ha d a total of one or two. Patterns of drinking are complex: when asked how many drinks we re consumed, 21.9 percent of respondents who had consumed alcohol in the past 30 days reported th at they had one or two drinks, 28.8 percent had three or four drinks, 16.4 percent had five or six drinks, 15.1 percent had se ven to ten drinks, and 22.8 percent had more than ten drinks. This pa ttern is confirmed by the finding that 21.8 percent of those who reported drinking al cohol in the past month had drunk five or more drinks in the same day once or twice in the past month, while 15.8 percent had done so three or four times. 47 This finding suggests that while most respondents do not report drinking al cohol, some of those who do engage in binge drinking (defined as havi ng five or more alcoholic drinks on occasion). -Tobacco Use A similarly complex pattern was found for t obacco consumption. Figure 12 shows that most respondents were non-smokers , defined as having smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Figure 12. Smokers vs. Non-Smokers, percent, 2004 . (Smoked 100 Cigarettes in Entire Life) No 83% (n=678)Yes 16.7% (n=136) D.C. Department of Health, State Center for Health Statistics Administration Of respondents who reported having smoked at l east 100 cigarettes in thei r lifetimes, just over one in four stated that they do not now smoke; while 45 percent smoke every day, as seen in Figure 13. Figure 13. Frequency of Tobacco Use, percent, 2004 Smokes som e days 28.0% (n=39)Does not smoke at all 27.1% (n=38) Smokes every day 45.0% (n=63) D.C. Department of Health, State Center for Health Statistics Administration 48 Among current smokers, 41 percent of responde nts reported smoking fewer than five cigarettes per day; and an additional 44.6 percent smoked five cigarettes or more, but less than a pack a day; 8.1 percent reported smoking a pack a day, but only 2.7 percent more than a pack a day. Also among smokers, 30.1 percent report ha ving quit, while 24.1 percent tried to quit but failed. Fully 40.6 percent reported that they have not tried to quit. Of respondents who reported having quit smoking, nearly two in 10 (19.2 percent) report havi ng quit less than a month ago; 15.4 percent quit between one and six months a go; 3.9 percent quit between six and 12 months ago, 20.5 percent quit between one and five years a go; and the rest quit six years ago or more. Further evidence that smoking is an intractable problem for a small proportion of respondents is the finding that 38.5 percent first smoked before the age of 16 (the youngest reported age of initiation of smoking was eight year s), while 28.9 percent reported fi rst smoking at the ages of 16 to 18 years. It is interesti ng to note, though, that only 30.9 percen t of smokers reported that they had been advised to quit by a health care professi onal. On the other hand, at least six of ten smokers reported that they refrai n from smoking to avoid indoor pol lution when inside the home, to protect children from second-hand smoke, a nd to obey non-smoking policies in the work place. Men have the highest percentage (79.4 pe rcent) among current smokers, while 51.5 percent of women are current smokers (i.e., smoki ng every or some days). The percentage of current smokers decreases progressively among pe ople in the 20-44 age group and then increases among those 45 years of age or older. Latinos who currently smoke are in the youngest age groups, 20-24 years (88.9 percent) and 25-34 years (84.4 percent). 3. Chronic Disease: Knowledge and Practice The high reported levels of overweight and ob esity suggest the particular importance of related chronic diseases, includi ng cardiovascular conditions. Tabl e 21 shows that more than half 49 of respondents are eating components of healthy di ets and that this proportion exceeds that of respondents who were advised by a h ealth care professional in the pa st 12 months to eat a healthy diet. Nevertheless, as suggested by findings reported earlier, fewer are engaged in physical activities; and only around four in ten report having been advi sed by a health care provider to engage in physical activities. Ne vertheless, the frequency of seve re coronary problems is very low; only 0.8 percent, 1.9 percent, and 1.2 percen t of respondents report having been told by a health care professional that they had had a hear t attack, angina or coronary heart disease, or stroke, respectively. At the same time, only 11.2 percent of respondents aged 35 or more take a low-strength aspirin daily or every other day to protect agai nst heart problems. Table 21.

D.C. Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration Asthma is a health condition of increasing concern in some segments of the U.S. population. Among respondents, 6.6 percent reported that they had been told by a health care professional that they had asthma, and of those, 32 percent report that they still have asthma. More women (64.8 percent) report being diagnosed with asthma compared to 35.2 percent men. Asthma affects both the 25-35 years olds and the 35-44 year olds equally (25.9 percent) who have the highest prevalence among all age groups. Ward 4 had the highest prevalence of asthma (8%) followed by Ward 1 (7.3%) and Ward 2 (3.2%). 50 4. Barriers As shown in Table 22, the principal barrier to access to health care when it is needed is cost (30.5 percent); this finding is consistent with the high proportion of respondents who lack health insurance. A second economic barrier that is less recognized is the inability of many people to leave work in order to secure health care services (11.6 percent) , reflecting the low occupational status that many respondents have: th eir jobs provide neithe r health insurance nor time off for health care. The high number of negativ e responses to these que stions indicates that some of the reasons for not accessing health care were not listed in the questionnaire. Table 22. Reason for not Accessing Health Care, 2004 Reason Yes % No % Cost 30.5 69.4 Transportation/Distance 7.6 92.3 Lack of Time Off Work 11.6 88.3 Family Care/Family Responsibility 8.9 93.7 D.C. Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration E. Other Health Outcomes 1. Cancer While the Latino population in the District is relatively young on average, and would therefore be likely to have lower prevalence rates than older populations of such chronic diseases as cancer, this is an area of continued and increasing concern as the population ages, particularly given barriers to sc reening and care. Reported levels of breast cancer in female res pondents (3.1 percent) and prostate cancer in males (0.6 percent) are quite low based on reports of diagnosis by a health care professional. Reported family histories of cancer were also low; 6.8 percent of women and 4.7 percent of men said that they had close blood re latives with breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively. 51 Patterns of preventive health measures in cluding screening are complex (Table 23). Almost one-half of female re spondents reported having ever ha d a mammogram, but more than eight in ten have had a clinical breast exam. Most reported that exams were part of routine preventive care (82.1 percent) wh ile 14.1 percent were for diagnostic measures for problems other than cancer. Only 1.4 percent was sc reened because of a family hist ory of breast cancer, and less than one percent was to monitor existing breas t cancer. Data for wo men who reported ever having a mammogram by age indica te that 79.2 percent of those women were 40 years and older (Table 36). However, women in the 40-44 years of age category were the highest at risk for not having a mammogram. Women 40 year s of age and older who are highe st at risk of not having a mammogram earned less than $15,000 (52.9 percent) , never attend school (24 percent), an unmarried couple (40 percent), out of work for more than one year (41.2 percent), has no health insurance (29.1 percent), live in the U.S. anywhe re from two to ten years (52.8 percent), and speak Spanish only (24.1 percent). It is important to note when looking at vital records data, no Latino woman died from breast cancer in 2001 or 2002 (D.C. State Center for Health Statistics Administration, 2001, 2002). In contrast, of all men who responded, less th an two in ten men report having had either a digital rectal exam (DRE) or a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test to detect prostate cancer (Table 23). However, the American Cancer Soci ety recommends that men ages 40 years or older should have either a digital rectal exam or a prostate-specific an tigen test to detect prostate cancer. The risk of not having a PSA or a DR E among men 40 years and older decreases with age (Table 37). Men who are 40-54 years are more likely to report not having a PSA or a DRE. It is interesting to find that 100 percent of men who earn between $50,000-$74,999 do not have a PSA of a DRE. Men, 40 years and older, who ne ver attended school more likely will not have a 52 PSA (71.4 percent) of a DRE (85.7 percent). Single men, 40 years and older, tend not to have a PSA (81.8 percent) or a DRE (72.7 percent) and men who are out of work for less than one year have no PSA (84.6 percent) or DRE (76.9 percent) . Men, 40 years and older, with no health insurance will not have a PSA (79.2 percent) or a DRE (80.9 percent). Men who speak Spanish only regardless of length of stay in the U.S. or where they live in the District of Columbia are more likely not to have a PSA or DRE. Table 23. Preventive Health Care Utilization for Cancer, 2004 Yes % No % Ever had a mammogram 46.7 53.3 Ever had a clinical breast exam 80.8 19.3 Ever had a Pap smear 94.5 5.3 Ever had a blood stool test using a home kit (HBS) 8.1 91.7 Ever had sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy 9.0 90.5 Ever had a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test 13.9 85.3 Ever had a digital rectal exam 16.8 83.2 Dept. of Health, State Center for Health Statistics Administration With respect to colorectal cancer, fewer than one respondent in ten (both male and female) reported having had a fecal occult blood test (F OBT)/Home Blood Stool Test (HBS) or having had either a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. On the other hand, those respondents who reported having had these preventive tests ge nerally have done so within the pa st year or in more than nine cases in ten, within the past three years (Table 24). The highe st rate of non-response for this question was for the FOBT/HBS and the sigmoidos copy or colonoscopy (Table 23). The former probably reflects confusion as to what constitutes the test (alth ough the question clearly described the procedure), while the latter is done at such long enough intervals that even people who have them could forget. With respec t to age, research has suggeste d, that for both women and men, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy should be done at the age of 50 year s and above. Of the 9 percent who reported having had either a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, 29 percent of those were 50 years and older. More men, 50 years and older, ar e at greater risk of not having a FOBT/HBS (86 53 percent), while women are at a higher risk of not having a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (74 percent) (Table 38). Risk of not having a FOBT/HBS of a sigm oidoscopy or colonoscopy decreases with age; respondents 65 years a nd older tend to have a FOBT/HBS or a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy more than any other age groups.

Injuries and Acute Illnesses Only 4.2 percent of respondents reported that they or someone in their family had been injured or poisoned seriously and that they di d not obtain medical advice or treatment in the preceding three months. Of those who were in jured, 37.5 percent obtained medical advise or treatment just once, 21.9 percent did between two and five tim es, and 21.9 percent did more than five times in the previous three months, includi ng more than six percent who obtained treatment more than 30 times (an average of once per day) . In these instance, an amazing 45.5 percent of cases required hospitalization. Reasons for seeking emergency treatment varied among respondents. Just over one- quarter (25.8 percent) of respondents reported seek ing medical advice or treatment for an injury due to transportation, incl uding motor vehicle/bicycle/motorcycle , pedestrian/train or strenuous movements (12.9 percent); struck, stabbed or physically assaulted by another person (12.9 per cent); accidentally struck by object or person 54 (12.9 percent); machinery (9.7 percent); fire, burn, or scald related (6.5 pe rcent); falls, poisoning, and cut or pierced (3.2 percent each), and other (9.7 percent). Circumstances surrounding reported injuries or poisonings that required medical interv ention varied; most commonly reported were driving or operating a motor vehicle and on the job (29 percent each). 3. HIV/AIDS and Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases The issue of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, is clearly extremely sensitive, particularly in the Latino community. Neverthe less, 65.4 percent of respondents reported that they had been tested for HIV, and of those, 53.9 percent had been tested within the past year and 22.3 percent between one and two years ago. Moreove r, 43.4 percent of respondents were screened for HIV as part of r outine checkups, 19 percent to see if they were infected, 14.7 percent because of pregnancy, 6.9 percent because of immigration requirements, and 6 percent because of employment. Only 2.1 pe rcent reported that they had been treated for other sexually transmitted diseases, half of these in health clinics. Knowledge about HIV/AIDS was tested in th e survey by two specific questions. Of all respondents, 59.5 percent co rrectly stated that a pregnant woman with HIV can get treatment to help reduce the chances that she will pass the vi rus on to her baby, and 82.3 percent stated that there are medical treatments availa ble to help a person who is infected with HIV to live longer. Regarding sexual behavior in general, 17.2 per cent of respondents report ed that within the past 12 months, they had more than one sexual partner; 80.4 percent ha d not. Only about one third of respondents reported usi ng a condom the last time they ha d sexual intercourse, but only 2.1 percent reported having been treated for a sexua lly transmitted or venere al disease. Of the latter, half were treate d in a health clinic. As would be assumed, reasons for using condoms varied: to prevent pregnancy ( 31.5 percent); to prevent diseas es like syphilis, gonorrhea, and 55 AIDS (23.4 percent); for both of t hose reasons (35.4 percent); and for other reasons (2.1. percent). Faith in the effectiveness of condoms varied; 36.4 percent of re spondents judged them as \"very effective,\" 43.9 percent as \"som effective\" and 15 as \"not at all effective\". F. Other Findings -Communications Channels Finally, the survey investigated how member s of the District's Latino community obtain information about health behavior s and practices. The data pres ented in Table 25 paint a vivid picture; more than three in four respondents report that they get health information from television. Slightly over a third do so from radi o, but only around a quarter from newspapers or from family and friends. In contrast, the In ternet remains a little-u sed medium for health information in this population. Table 25.

Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration VI. Conclusion The DC Department of Health's efforts to a ddress health disparitie s separating resident minority population from the white population have b een greatly enhanced by this pilot project-- the Latino Health Care Collaborative (LHCC). The LHCC community health assessment model was created in an effort to fill the gap of resi dent minority health baseline data at DC's DOH 56 State Center for Health Statis tics Administration (SCHSA). The SCHSA along with community and academic partners designed this unique comm unity-based research study. The uniqueness of the model piloted in the LHCC study lies in the ac tual involvement of co mmunity members at the decision making as well as the data collecting leve l. The data gathered in this study, not only reflects an effort by the DC Department of H ealth SCHSA and its core partners, but also, demonstrates the willingness of residents to work towards health improvement in their community. The principal conclusion that emerges from the su rvey data presented in this report is that the District's Latino community is extraord inarily diverse in te rms of demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, access to health care, and health status. This very heterogeneity represents the major challenge to the health care system. This study's major finding, the high prevalence of obesity and overweight as the leading health conditions mirrors national findings as stated in the introduction of this report. When asked about their perception of threats to their heal th, respondents cited a wide variety of structural impediments. Health is viewed not only as the ability to manage biomedi cal conditions within the individual body, but as inherently linked to their own socioeconomic circumstances. From a list provided to the interviewees, Table 26 presents the respondents' pe rceptions of factors that interfere with their ability to maintain good health. Lack of on- the-job insurance covera ge was 83.8 percent is closely related to not having enough money to pay fo r treatment (91 percent). In the District of Columbia, coverage of the uninsured is provided by the Alliance insurance plan of the Department of Health; so this lack of insuranc e coverage for medical procedures may illustrate the need for increased outreach efforts in th e resident Latino comm unity. Furthermore, respondents' perception of their in ability to negotiate the system was also high, (85.8 percent) 57 which may be linked to the high percentage of respondents who reporte d only speaking Spanish (59 percent). This added to the lack of familia rity with institutionalized systems, such as the health care system in the U.S., may represent not only a language barrier but also a high need for health care system \"navigators\".

Department of Health, State Cent er for Health Statistics Administration Respondents also reported immigration related pr oblems as a factor th at interferes with their ability to maintaining good health, having difficulties in obtai ning legal status in the U.S. (81.5 percent). This finding is in sharp contrast with the duration of residence in the U.S. that many respondents reported (41.8 percent). Along with factors related to socio-economic status are cultu ral factors that should be studied further, in orde r to enhance these findings. These cu ltural factors may explain the high incidence of overweight and obesi ty and other major conditions among Latinos of Washington, D.C. We will explore some of these cultural factor s in our report of the pr oject \"Para su Salud\" workshops. Meanwhile, the LHCC findings provide d in this report should be seen as an introduction to the health stat us of resident Latinos, a rapi dly growing minority population and should reflect its uniqueness which has fo r long been an asset to this city. 58 VII. Summary of Key Findings Highlights of the survey findings include: \u00be The five leading health conditions encount ered among Latinos surveyed in Washington, D.C. are overweight and obesity (60.8 per cent), diabetes, including pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes, (18.2 pe rcent), high blood pressure (16.8 percent), blood cholesterol (13.6 percent), and arthritis (7.7 percent). \u00be Latinos surveyed mentioned having health insu rance coverage on more than half of the cases (58.2 percent), and a littl e less than a half reported no t having health insurance. \u00be The Latino community is a relatively young population. Less than 3 percent of respondents were 65 years of age or older, 15.1 percent were 20-24 years old, 36.8 percent were 25-34 years old, 25.3 percent were 35-44 years old, 14.0 percent were 45-54 years old and less than 10 percent were 55-to more than 65 years old. \u00be Natives of El Salvador represent more than half of the sample. Notably, a total of 12 percent of respondents came from Guatemala and Honduras. Natives of Mexico represent another 12 percent, while the two other larg est groups at the national level, Cuba and Puerto Rico, are much less represented in the District. \u00be A very large proportion of the District's Latino community ha s relatively little formal education, eight percent have ne ver attended school and just ov er half have only a primary school education. \u00be The household income of a large proportion of the District's Latino community is extremely precarious; nearly tw o-thirds of respondents reported total household incomes of $25,000 per year or less, while only five percent reported total household incomes of $50,000 or more. 59 \u00be While a large proportion of respondents speak only or primarily Spanish (59 percent), about two-thirds have been living in the Un ited States for five years or more and only about a fifth report living he re for less than two years. \u00be Latinos surveyed self-reported their race as \"White\" 10 percent, \"Black or African American\" 0.7 percent, \"Asian\" 0.0 percent, \"Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander\" 0.1 percent, \"American Indian or Alaska Na tive\" 1.0 percent, \"Mixed\" or \"Other\" 88.5 percent (having to specify). Among the speci fic answers given by respondents to the \"Mixed or Other\" options were: Hispanic or Latino/a (87.8 percent), Mestizo (7.2 percent), Mixed (3.1 percent), mentioned their country of origin (1.4 percent) and Moreno and Indigenous (both 0.2 percent each). 60 VIII.

Sampling Strategy \u00be Desired: 750: based on Hispanic population on Sample Frame (i.e., District Wards 1- 4) 95% Confidence Level 3.8 Confidence Level \u00be Oversampling by 10% yields the Final Sample Size of 825. \u00be Recommended: At least 5 households per sampled blocks = 165 blocks for Wards 1- 4. 2. Sample Frame: Wards 1- 4 \u00be Wards 1- 4 have 39,370 Hispanics. This figure represents 87.6% of all Hispanics residing in the District of Columbia (DC). \u00be DC Hispanic population is 44,953. DC total population is 572,059 (Census 2000). \u00be Ward 1 has 18,109 Hispanics. That represents 45.9% of the sample frame population, and 40.3% of all DC Hispanics. \u00be Ward 2 has 6,997 Hispanics. That re presents 17.8% of the sample frame population and 15.6% of all DC Hispanics. \u00be Ward 3 has 5,027 Hispanics. That repr esents 12.8% of the sample frame population and 11.2% of all DC Hispanics. \u00be Ward 4 has 9,237 Hispanics. That re presents 23.5% of the sample frame and 20.5% of all DC Hispanics. 3. Wards 1- 4 Block Inclusion Criteria \u00be From the ward level, we moved directly to the block level, because it allowed for a more diverse represen tation of the geographic occupation patterns of Hispanics throughout th e wards in the sample frame, while also allowing for a more diverse representation of the different socio-demographic characteristics of DC Hispanics. Going to the Census tract would limit the areas in which data collectors would survey. \u00be > 25 Hispanics in the Block (based on) per Census 2000 data (Rationale: At least 5 (Hispanic) households per block will be interviewed. With 5 Hispanics per household, a total of 25 potential interviewees). \u00be > 10 (Hispanic) Household units in the block per Census 2000 data (Rationale: We would at least be able to select every other Hispanic household in the block). \u00be Ward 1 has 151 blocks that meet these criteria. \u00be Ward 2 has 59 blocks that meet these criteria. \u00be Ward 3 has 63 blocks meeting these criteria. \u00be Ward 4 has 91 blocks. 4. Blocks per Ward Based on Resident Hispanic Population. \u00be Example: Ward 1 with 18,109 Hispanics represents 46% of the sample frame. 165 total blocks to be surveyed 46% of the sample frame (proportion of interviews per ward) are to come from 75 blocks from Ward 1. \u00be Blocks per Ward: Ward 1 = 75 Ward 2 = 29 Ward 3 = 21 Ward 4 = 39 5. Interviews per Ward were determ ined by multiplying the number of blocks to be sampled in each ward by 5 (the number of interviews required per block). \u00be Interviews per Ward: Ward 1 = 375 Ward 2 = 145 Ward 3 = 105 Ward 4 = 195 6. Interviews per block were dete rmined by calculating a probability proportionate to size (PPS) for each block: \u00be Proportion of Hispanics in block divided by Total Hispanics in pool of blocks within the ward = the proportion (or number) of interviews from the ward. \u00be Preferably, only blocks with sample size > 5(PPS calculation) were randomly selected to complete desired sample size for each ward. In the process, we discovered that the situation differed by ward. Some adjustments to sampling strategy had to be made, in order to select blocks to be sampled. The special circumstances in each ward are indicated in a later section (9). \u00be In general, when a ward's pool of blocks with PPS < 5 was too small to complete the recommended sample quota, the recommendation was to look at block clusters that would a llow the data collectors to approach groups of blocks with enough samples for selection. Given that the pool of blocks has already been chosen to include > 25 Hispanics and > 10 household units, we believe that a st andard over sample factor of 20% could be applied to single blocks th at had enough PPS from which to be sampled. 7. Random Selection of Households (Sample Units) \u00be Each team of data collectors was assigned a block or block cluster in which to work. Blocks within block clusters are to be approached as individual blocks. \u00be Each block has a required number of interviews to be completed (sample size). \u00be The data collectors were trained to conform to the following sampling scheme: Go to the Northwest corner of the block and start choosing every other household as a sample unit. From the Northwest corner, continue walking clockwise (looking at the block map). Continue selecting sample units using the same process until all of the required samples (interviews) have been completed. Do not cross the street, for the other side of the street represents another Census block delineation. 8. Random Selection of Participant within the Household to be interviewed, and Data Collection Process \u00be Inclusion Criteria for Sample Subjects (Respondents/Interviewees) Self identification as Hispanic or Latino (interchangeable terms). >21 years of age (21 years old or above). Permanent member of the household (Permanent resident of that household is defined as having been a resident of the household for at least 6 months; not a visitor). The selected adult will answer both Modules of the questionnaire. Module I has questions about the respondent himself/herself, including some questions about the household. Module II has questions about a household member in each of three subgroups: children 0-5 years of age, teens 12-18 years of age, and seniors > 65 years of age who reside in the household. \u00be Data collectors are trained to randomly select participants for the interview based on one per sample unit. Data collectors are instructed to introduce themselves and the LHCC Study to an adult in the household. Data collectors are to use a household listing table to write down the first name, age and gender of all household members. Data collectors are to use the list of household members to randomly select an adult participant for Module I. They must select the adult listed as the first (#1) in the list. Keeping track of the previously selected participant (in the previous household interview), the data collector is to choose the second (#2) on the list (then the third listed in the next household for interviewing purposes, and so on). If in the third household only two household members are eligible, the second (last listed) of the two is selected as the interviewee. If two household members are eligible, then the interviewee would be randomly selected from the household list. Module II contains questions that will refer to a household member in a particular age group (child, teen, senior). The data collector will choose the particular section of questions in Module II according to the availability of a family member in that age group. In case there is more than one subject identified in the household for one of the sections of Module II, the data collector is to use the same process followed in the selection of the adult to be interviewed. \u00be Once the adult who will answer the questionnaire is selected, the data collector should proceed to describe the LHCC Study to the participant and have him/her read and sign the consent form. \u00be Data collectors are to record all responses to the questionnaire on a survey answer sheet that will be entered later into a computer program on a spreadsheet for data analysis purposes. \u00be At the end of each working day, data collectors are to submit their answer sheets to their team leader who will go over each answer sheet to check for accuracy and completeness. \u00be Team leaders are responsible for s ubmitting the collected answer sheets to the Principal Investigator (PI) who delivers them to the project coordinator at SCHSA for quality control before the data are entered into the computer program. 9. Field experience with the four selected wards: \u00be Ward 1: Sampling proceeded according to prescribed methodology. \u00be Wards 2: Some difficulties occurred which required a change in methodology. Blocks were put into groups using the maps from the Office of Planning. So block groups were used, instead of individual blocks, to obtain the desired number of interviews. \u00be Ward 3: Dropped due to inability to recruit a representative sample of residents for the assessment. \u00be Ward 4: As in Ward 2, some difficulties occurred which required a switch from sampling at the individual block level to sampling of groups of blocks. Centers for Disease Control and PreventionDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES National Center for Health Statistics 3311 Toledo RoadHyattsville, Maryland 20782 Appendix 3 Memorandum Date December 15, 2004 To DC State Center for Heal th Statistics Administration From Wilbur C. Hadden, Statistician, NCHS Subject Weights for survey of Hispanics The DC State Center for Health Statistics Administ ration (SCHSA), working w ith the Latino Healthcare Collaborative Community (LHCC) and George Washington University (GW), completed a survey of Hispanics in DC. The desired sample size was 825. At firs t this was to come from 4 wards wh ich have most of the Hispanics in DC. During data collection it was found that for many reasons Hispanics in Ward 3 were difficult to survey and had different characteristics than Hispan ics in other wards that made less rele vant to the purposes of the survey. It was decided to drop Ward 3 and increase the sample in the other wards; the increase was accomplished by increasing the number of persons to be selected from the target blocks by 20%. E ach ward was treated as a separate stratum. The sampling frame in the strata consisted of a list of blocks with at least 25 Hi spanics and 10 households. The actual selection process was somewhat complicated, and precise documentation is no t available, but blocks were selected for surveying from lists of blocks orde red by number of Hispanics and from maps. For purposes of calculating a weight the process may be summarized in this way: in Ward 1, all blocks with more than 125 and every other block with 98 to 124 Hispanics were include d; in Ward 2, all blocks with 75 or more Hispanics were included, as were a number (appr oximately one-third) of other blocks selected from maps; and in Ward 4 all blocks with 45 or more Hispanics were included. This process creates substrata in 2 of the wards, giving 5 substrata in all. Calculating weights begins with calcul ating the probability of selection. The first factor of the probability (see equation below) is the probability of selecting a block. Th is probability is 1 if the number of Hispanics in the block exceeds the threshold for the ward and otherwise \u00bd for Ward 1 and 1/3 for Ward 2. Field workers were sent to selected blocks to recruit and interview the sa mple. They started screening every other residence at the northwest corn er of the block and proceeded clockw ise (on the map), going from top to bottom in multi-unit buildings. Eligible residences were those with an adu lt (aged 21 years or more) Hispanic. The second factor of the probability of selection represents the probability of selecting a household in a block. The numerator of this probability is the number of house holds selected from the bloc k. The denominator is the number of eligible households in th e block. This number is unknown and ha s to be estimated. The approximate number of Hispanic households in a block is estimated by assuming that th e ratio of Hispanic households to total housing units is the same as the ratio of Hispanic persons to all persons. That is, that the number of eligible households in a block is the total number of housing units times the number of Hispanics divided by the total number of persons. This is a bit complicated, but with simple algebra it is repres ented in factor 2, below. Once a household was identified as eligible, one sample pe rson was selected. First the names and ages of all the residents of the household were recorded, th en one was selected to be the respondent. The third factor of the probability of selection is one divided by the number of eligible adults in the household. The whole probability of selection is thus: i = Number of sample persons interviewed from block Tb = Total population of census block Pb = Hispanic population of census block Hb = Number of housing units in census block ni = Number of adults in a household The person weight is th e reciprocal of this selection probability. The final step in calculating the weig hts is a combined non-response and postr atification adjustment. This is done by multiplying the basic weight, estimated from the formula above, by an adjustment factor. The factor is obtained by summing the basic weights within each substratum and divi ding this sum into the number of Hispanic adults in the substratum. Inspection of the weights, calculated as above, showed that in some cases the estimate of the sampling rate of households in blocks produced extreme values which led to a few very large or very small weights. To prevent these respondents from having an undue influence on analyses of the survey extreme values of this variable were trimmed; its range was restricted to .082 - .230, and the weights were recalculated. Note on data The data used in calculating the weights were supplied by the DC State Center for Health Statistics Administration or obtained from the US Census Bureau. The primary source of data was the data file for the survey, from which the number of respondents per samp led block was calculated. Some spreadsheets which had been used in designing the sample contained the population, the number of housing units, and the number of Hispanics in blocks in Wards 1, 2, and 4 with 10 or more households and 25 or more Hispanics. Another useful spreadsheet was one named \"data status april 20\". This spreadsheet provided an alte rnate, although incomplete, list of census tract, block a nd respondent ID numbers which made it po ssible to correct some keying errors in the data file. The number of adult Hispanics per bloc k was downloaded from the Census Bureau web-site. Variance estimation Representing this design for estimating variances in SUDAAN requires some recoding of the data. For simplicity, this is considered a sampling with repl acement design. This is considered appropriate where sampling fractions are small. In this survey, however , the sampling fractions are generally small only in selecting household from blocks; the sampling fractions for selecting blocks and persons out of households are often not small. Nevertheless, making this assumption is reasonable and conservative because it simplifies the estimation of variances and, by elimin ating the finite populati on correction factors, produces conservative estimates of variances. First it is necessary to redefine th e strata and primary sampling units (PSUs) for the program; two variables, strata and PSU are defined. In those substrata where all the large blocks were selected, the first sampling was the selection of household. (Note that th is applies to over 90% of the sample and that within block the sampling fractions are generally small). In th ese blocks, each block is identified as a stratum and assigned the Census tract and block number, and househol ds, identified by the respondent ID number, are considered primary sampling units. PSU is assigned the ID number. In those substrata where blocks were sampled there is a stratum number assigned and PSU is assi gned the Census tract and block number. Second, it is necessary to recode a few individual records where there are blocks with only a single respondent. In five cases where the block is a st rata, respondents were assigned to anot her block in the same Census tract because they were the only respondents from their block. Three tables applying this method are attached. Table 1 estimates the distribution of the population by age and sex. Tables 2 and 3 are prevalence estimates of reporte d asthma and high blood pressure by age and sex. The design effects are generally between 1.2 and 1.8. The required SUDAAN code for this is illustrated below. In the proc statement the sample design is described as wr, with replacement. The nest and weight statements are required. The nest statement lists the design variables strata and psu. The weight variable is named wt. The code belo w produces that attached Table 1. The variables rsex and rage are renamed va riables from the data file giving the respondents' sex and age.

Appendix 6 LHCC Training By William Waters, GWU A four-day training session was planned and completed as scheduled. The training was conducted entirely in Spanish, and cons isted of the following elements: The project's purpose and goals. This component allowed team members to understand and appreciate the project's im portance and their role in contributing to its overall success. Project logistics and field work, in cluding sampling methodology, identification of selected households and individuals within households, ru les for call backs, and informed consent. This component pr ovided the necessary skills for applying the questionnaires in the field in the mo st accurate and efficient manner possible. Interviewing techniques, including optimizing the interviewer-interviewee dynamic, obtaining informed consent, registering responses, handling skip patterns, and closing the interview. Th is component was designed to provide the skills that were essential for successful interviewing and accurate recording of information provided by the respondent. Introduction to the questionnaire, with a focus on each section and question. This component familiarized the interviewers with the specific elements of the questionnaire: design and layout, correct formulation of each question, skip patterns, and rules for addressing respondents' questions. Classroom-based practice. This compone nt provided interviewers with the opportunity to formulate the questions in the questionnair e and to record responses to each question. In general, it provided interviewers with greater familiarity with the questions, the management of skip patterns, and other features. It also gave the GW team trainers the opportuni ty to observe and evaluate the interviewers. Field-based training at the Nueva Espera nza Lutheran Church in Silver, Spring, MD. It should be noted that the instru ments had previously been pilot tested at the Community Ministries of Rockville, in Rockville, MD. The training emphasized the following point s: correct selecti on of households and eligible adults within house holds, correct techniques for completing questionnaires, skip patterns, presentation at the door, protecti ng confidentiality, how to ask questions, avoiding bias, repeat calls (morning, after noon, evenings, weekends) and appointments, supervision and reporting, handling of completed questionn aires, transportation, cell phones, and other logistical ma tters. In addition, techniques for selecting households for the additional modules were reviewed. During the training, the teams were formed on the basis of balancing skills, experience, and gender. Team leaders were also sele cted using similar criteria and were given additional information on selection of blocks and households, assigning team members to households, quality assurance, and submission of completed questionnaires to the project (at CLA). The basic technique for the training was inte ractive discussion. Handouts consisted of blank questionnaires and reporting forms. Flip charts were used and placed on walls to record comments and further the discussi on. Following the training, supervisors were interviewed and all interviewers completed an evaluation, the results of which follow. Evaluation of training The methodology adapted for training th e interviewers was based on prior experience both in the U.S. and abroad (Latin America and East Afri ca). Nearly all of the training (95%) was conducted in Spanish. Basic to this training is a full understanding of the purpose of the project. A second key ar ea involved techniques for interviewing in general and more broadly, management of the interview environment. This portion included techniques for identifying qualif ied households and respondents and the principles of obtaining informed consent. The importance of the team approach to interviewing was stressed. Next, the traini ng included a thorough revi ew of the questions including wording, possible responses, and skip patterns. During this phase, techniques for handling non-response were discussed. Finally, management of questionnaires and quality assurance were discussed. The practical phase of the training included group practice of all modules of the in terview; here, interv iewers engaged in role play as both interviewer and respondent. The last part of this phase cons isted of a field practice, in which the instrument was applied to Latinos in Montgomery County, Maryland. Following the three-day training session, atte ndees were asked to complete a short questionnaire, in which the different elem ents of the session were assessed. Question 1 consisted of five parts, each usi ng a Likert scale of 1 to 5 using the following criteria to answer th e prompt: \"for the following st atements, indicate your level of satisfaction from 1 to 5.\" 1=very poor 2=poor 3=neither good nor poor 4=good 5=very good Mean scores of responses were as follows: Question 1a: physical space: few responses of \"3\" ( Six in total: three from one individual, two from a second, and one from a third; 14 of the 17 respondents an swered this section at the \"good\" or \"very good\" le vels only. There were no respons es of \"1\" or \"2\". This suggests a high level of satisfaction with all aspects of the training. Question 2 asked the participants to agree (yes ) or disagree (no). Frequencies of responses were as follows: Question 2a: The objectives of the traini ng were established at the beginning. Yes: 17 (100%) No: 0 (0%) Question 2b: The objectives of the training were fulfilled. Yes: 14 (87.5% of valid responses) No: 2 (12.5%) (1 missing value) Questions 2 and 3 asked for short answers. Question 3 asked: \"What elements of the training seemed most useful to you?\" Responses were as follows, and suggest that the technique of re viewing questions and answers was well regarded, as was the oppor tunity to practice asking and answering questions through role playing. o The explanation of the qu estionnaire for Module 1 o The discussion on the format of the interviews. o The methodology in general constituted a useful element for our learning during the training. There was good material and an excellent handling of the topic. Good attention to a comfortable ambiance. o Explanation of the reason for the interviews. o For me, all the elements have been useful; it is been an interesting experience. o Techniques discussed, rhythm of work; the group [itself] o Everything was perfect: thanks! o Food for fueling the work; reviewin g the questions; practice; knowing [everybody] o Teams to work on possible problems; practicing the questionnaire o Flipcharts; review of the questions ; the explanation of everything was extraordinary; the conformation of work teams and the discussion. o The questionnaire and the answer s were a little confusing, so that we arrived at an agreement on changing the answer sheet. o Most were basic tools for the interview. o Reviewing the questionnaire. o In general, all of the content was useful because we have acquired new knowledge. o I think that everything was ve ry well carried out; tactics for the training were very clear. o The questionnaire and its content. o Reviewing the questionnaire as a group. Th e \"interview situati on\" sheet that was presented. Role playing. Question 4 asked \"what elements of the training would you change?\" Note that of 17 respondents, five either left this blank or said that nothing should have been changed. One conclusion is that there should have b een more time for practice using different group formats. o The explanation of Module II. I would leave more time to practice and [ask] questions on experiences. o More time explaining how to do the interviews and more practice. o No response o \"Nothing\" o No response o The form of evaluating the questions could be more dynamic, using small groups. o The training should be longer and shoul d include talks about Latin American culture: fashions and habits. o [The training]should move faster. Should have corre cted the questionnaires before the training. o I think: more didactic material [like] blackboard and flipchart. o There is nothing to change; th e training was very enriching. o The answer sheet. o More dynamic methodology. (NB: this person rated methodology 5 (excellent0] o Nothing o I think that the observations we ma de should be changed a little. [?] o I think the schedule: that we could be more punctual [and begin] at the scheduled time. o The space (that is, the place); the vocabulary. o A day of practice with colleagues; more practice with formal groups. Question 5 asked: \"After the tr aining, do you feel capable of doing the work of interviewer?\" The possible re sponses were as follows, s uggesting that the respondents felt that the training had prepared them for the job they were to do. 1. Not capable 2. Somewhat capable 3. Very capable Frequencies of response were: 1. Not capable: 0 (0%) 2. Somewhat capable: 2 (11.8%) 3.
