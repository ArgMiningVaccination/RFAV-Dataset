Keywords: Vitamin B12, Homeopathy, Absorption. Facts about vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 is normally involved in the metabolism of each and every cell of the body. It is one of the water-soluble vitamin which means it circulates through the bloodstream. It plays a major role in the formation of blood cells, functioning of nervous system and brain too. Basically, vitamin B12 can only be produced by a specific enzyme produced by the bacteria present in the gut of the herbivores. The carnivorous animals get it through the herbivorous animals. Also, there are many natural sources of this vitamin because of bacterial symbiosis. Who are at high risk of deficiency? A Cobalamin or vitamin B12 deficiency is one of the leading nutrient deficiencies in the whole world even after following a very good diet. Vitamin B12 is found in animal products like meat, eggs, dairy products or shellfish. Most of the vegetarians and vegans are at high risk of deficiency of this vitamin. Also, due to ageing, heartburn drugs or alcohol, stomach starts producing less acid, and this acid is the key for absorption of vitamin B12. This can be one of the reasons for deficiency in adults and old people. Women who are on birth control pills have a high risk of not absorbing B12. Symptoms of B12 deficiency: Its deficiency can cause a severe damage especially to the brain and nervous system. Because our body can store B12 for three to five years, early symptoms may appear gradually. Initial symptoms may be: - Fatigue - Breathlessness - Muscle aches - Dizziness - Poor memory - Lack of concentration Specific symptoms may include: - Depression - Anxiety - Poor dental health - Abnormal heart problems like palpitations - Tingling and numbness Some of the initial symptoms are so commonly adopted by people in their day to day lives that they have no idea if there is something wrong with them. So, one should not take the small alarming signs too lightly as it can lead to pernicious anaemia which can be dangerous. Treatment: It involves proper diet, supplements as required and support of homoeopathic medicines as per the case. Supplementation Most people take supplements without any proper knowledge. Synthetic form of vitamin B12 is called cyanocobalamin and a natural form of vitamin B12 is called Methylcobalamin which should be used instead of the synthetic one. It actually has cyanide in it which is a toxic substance causing damage to the body system. But since cyanocobalamin is one hundred times cheaper and have much longer shelf life than the methylcobalamin so they are used widely. Homoeopathy and Vitamin B12 Homoeopathy is a body-friendly medicine. It is like a support system, especially to our immune. Any problem in the body starts when the immune gets affected or if prevailing tendencies in the families are present. Homoeopathy does not provide vitamin B12 but it can help in proper B12 absorption. People take a lot of supplements, but still their B12 level in the body remains the same. This can be due to improper absorption. The factors that affect the absorption can be all corrected by homoeopathy. Conclusion: It is very clear that this vitamin is very essential for proper functioning of the brain, nervous system. It cannot be absorbed using the external synthetic supplements. Thus, Homeopathy is useful for the absorption of vitamin B12. Go for a healthy "}
