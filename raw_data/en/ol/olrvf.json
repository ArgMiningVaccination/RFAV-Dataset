We offer innovative cosmetic services including micro needling, non-toxic plant-based stem cell therapy, and prolotherapy for the face and body. Microneedling Microneedling aka Collagen Induction Therapy Benefits What is microneedling and nanoneedling? Microneedling is a clean and safe way to rejuvenate your skin and improve the look of imperfections and scarring. This innovative cosmetic procedure uses tiny stainless-steel needles to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin in your skin. As a result, new skin tissue replaces old damaged skin which reduces the appearance of many common skin concerns. The microneedling treatment may use serums infused with specific Chinese herbal formulas, vitamins, and hyaluronic acid to target specific areas of concern and address underlying causes. Many options are available to help you get flawless and healthy-looking skin. In this way, it promotes smoother, softer, and more youthful-looking skin after just 4-6 treatment sessions! It is often a key piece in our comprehensive Facial Rejuvenation Program.It can be used effectively for a number of concerns, including: - fine lines and deep wrinkles - scars caused by acne or surgery - skin pigmentation issues - skin that has lost its plump, youthful appearance - hair rejuvenation - soften stretch marks - reduce pores - even out skin tone - a youthful glow What you need to know: Patients tolerate microneedling very well, as a treatment session can be performed in 30 minutes or less with minimal discomfort and downtime. Patients can generally resume their normal routine within 24 hours. Avoiding direct sun exposure for approximately 48 hours post treatment is advised. Patients may continue to see improvement four to six months after a microneedling series as collagen remodeling occurs. Typical treatment includes consultation, numbing cream applied to face, followed by the microneedling treatment using custom serums to address your specific skin care goals. How Microneedling Works Microneedling works by stimulating the skin to make more collagen. A needle-tipped device makes tiny, controlled punctures in the skin. The micro-injuries trigger the body to produce more collagen in the affected area. In turn, the new collagen helps to minimize the appearance of scars, pigmentation and fine lines. Microneedling can conveniently be performed in an office setting. Numbing cream can be prescribed and applied 20 minutes prior to procedure followed by LED light therapy. The skin is thoroughly cleansed prior to treatment. The micro-needle depth can be adjusted as needed to treat different skin types and conditions. At Elevate Estethix we offer a unique holistic approach to resolving the root cause of skin concerns. We do this by adding a customized serum formulated to address the underlying cause of skin imbalances. In certain cases we also recommend adding a series of acupuncture treatments to accompany the monthly micro-needling sessions for a more comprehensive and long-term solution to address the patient's goals and concerns.

A topical numbing cream can be prescribed to minimize discomfort. Some patients have some sensitivity in areas like the forehead and upper lip area. Most describe the sensation of microneedling as similar to a piece of sandpaper being passed across the face. What areas of the body can be treated? Microneedling is most commonly performed on the face. How long will microneedling results last? The longevity of microneedling results varies by individual. Regular maintenance treatments periodically can prolong the results. How many treatment sessions will I need to see results? The number of treatment sessions required depends on the specific condition(s) being treated. Most patients will need three to six treatment sessions, spaced four weeks apart, in order to achieve best results. How soon after microneedling treatment can I wear makeup? Usually we recommend patients wait at least 24 hours after treatment before applying makeup. Are there any contraindications? Contraindications to Microneedling treatments are limited but include inflammatory acne, active herpes labialis (cold sores) or other local infections within the treatment area, keloidal predisposition and immunosuppression. Additional care should be taken with concomitant Microneedling near Botox, Dysport or Xeomin injection sites to avoid potential unwanted neurotoxin diffusion.
