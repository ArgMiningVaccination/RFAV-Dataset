Traditional Chinese Medicine is one of the oldest continuous systems of medicine in history, dating back thousands of years. Chinese Medicine does not focus on the symptom, but rather the individual as a whole. This theory explains the body being interconnected, supporting and working together. Optimal health occurs when the body's systems are in balance. The goal of Traditional Chinese Medicine is to restore balance in the body, including both physical and emotional health. The human body has an amazing propensity to heal itself. Acupuncture serves as a natural effective tool to promote the body's self-healing mechanism. Michigan TCM Wellness Center facilitates the empowerment of the community by providing health services and education in a respectful environment. Our client-centered approach provides resources to enable people to gain and maintain health. \"My vision is to bring acupuncture and herbal medicine to the forefront of community awareness, so that it may be used preventatively in maintaining health. Michigan TCM Wellness Center started in 2010. After several years of previous hospital-based acupuncture experience in Integrative Medicine, I continue to bridge the gap between Eastern and Western Medicine. Using a comprehensive plan, I have provided care to people in all areas and stages of health. I believe that well-being can be achieved using a team approach between both the practitioner and client. I welcome us working together in meeting your wellness goals!\" Emily Liburdi Dipl. OM, MSTOM, L.Ac NCCAOM Board Certified Acupuncturist/Michigan Licensed Acupuncturist "}
