This article documents the first phase of a four-stage project on patient characteristics that may influence responsiveness to acupuncture treatment, reporting results from an exploratory practitioner survey. Methods: Acupuncture practitioners from various medical professions were recruited through professional organisations to complete an online survey about their demographics and attitudes as well as 60 questions on specific factors that might influence treatment. They gave categorical (\"Yes\", \"No\", and \"Don't know\") and free-text responses. Quantitative and qualitative (thematic) analyses were then conducted. Results: There were more affirmative than negative or uncertain responses overall. Certain characteristics, including ability to relax, exercise and diet, were most often considered relevant. Younger and male practitioners were more likely to respond negatively. Limited support was found for groupings between characteristics. Qualitative data provide explanatory depth. Response fatigue was evident over the course of the survey. Conclusions: Targeting and reminders may benefit uptake when conducting survey research. Practitioner characteristics influence their appreciation of patient characteristics. Factors consistently viewed as important included ability to relax, exercise and diet. Acupuncture practitioners may benefit from additional training in certain areas. Surveys may produce more informative results if reduced in length and complexity.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2018-08-06", "cleaned_text": "Individual Differences in Responsiveness to Acupuncture: An Exploratory Survey of Practitioner Opinion [https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines5030085](https://doi.org/10.3390/medicines5030085) [Acupuncture - Basic Research and rapid alleviation of their symptoms, although he was not able to define such patients otherwise than by observing that they seemed more likely to be artistic or inclined toward religious belief than less strong reactors. Similar to Mann, some British proponents of medical acupuncture such as Anthony Campbell and Peter Baldry have noted that strong reactors are also often \"good responders\" to acupuncture [ [1](#B1-medicines-05-00085), [13](#B13-medicines-05-00085)], with Campbell following a suggestion by Johnson et al. [ [14](#B14-medicines-05-00085)] concerning transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) that strong reactors could be people whose central nervous system, including the limbic system, is particularly sensitive to sensory stimulation [ [13](#B13-medicines-05-00085)]. Among the present authors, in D.F.M.'s experience over 36 years of clinical practice and in line with Campbell's findings [ [15](#B15-medicines-05-00085)], some patients have certainly seemed to respond well to acupuncture and benefit a great deal from receiving treatment, whereas others have appeared to respond less well, or even poorly, and benefit less from treatment\u2014almost regardless of what that treatment is. [1](#B1-medicines-05-00085), [13](#B13-medicines-05-00085)]. Further aims are to present some preliminary findings concerning such general questions as: \"Are some patients more receptive to acupuncture in general, with a better, faster or more enduring response to treatment than others?\", \"Can acupuncture responders be consistently categorised as 'good', 'average' or 'poor', or does this vary?\", or \"Is placebo responsiveness considered materially to contribute to acupuncture responsiveness?\" [16](#B16-medicines-05-00085), [17](#B17-medicines-05-00085)]\u2014with a view to developing more personalised approaches to treatment or improving outcome prediction. Genomic correlates of the placebo response (the \"placebome\") have also been proposed [ [18](#B18-medicines-05-00085), [19](#B19-medicines-05-00085)], and such an approach has been used, if sparsely, in the field of acupuncture. Thus, response to acupuncture for smoking cessation was found in one Korean study to vary with genetic polymorphisms [ [20](#B20-medicines-05-00085)], and using serotonin transporter polymorphism techniques has been proposed as a method of guiding individualised treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in Chinese medicine [ [21](#B21-medicines-05-00085)]. More generally, genetic polymorphism has been shown to regulate the default mode network (DMN) in the brain, and so to regulate response to acupuncture stimulation [ [22](#B22-medicines-05-00085)]. In a very different approach, poor response to acupuncture used as an adjuvant treatment for In Vitro Fertilisation was found to be more likely in those with high peak levels of follicular stimulating hormone, longer histories of infertility and worse sperm morphology [ [23](#B23-medicines-05-00085)], but a quick PubMed search revealed no other studies that looked explicitly at the effects of such factors on treatment outcome. [24](#B24-medicines-05-00085)] and neurochemistry of acupuncture [ [25](#B25-medicines-05-00085), [26](#B26-medicines-05-00085)], again few are relevant in everyday practice. Therefore, a simpler, more accessible questionnaire-based research protocol was developed in an attempt to assess whether there might be any simple answers to the question \"who responds well to acupuncture?\" without recourse to complex and costly biomarkers (a similar approach, using psychometric data to evaluate the effects of patient personality on their response to placebo acupuncture, was explored by Kaptchuk and colleagues [ [27](#B27-medicines-05-00085)]). Such a protocol might seem not just simple but na\u00efve and simplistic to those used to large-scale scientific research, but its feasibility and limited funding requirements recommended it for the current exploratory work. Development was by D.F.M. in association with a small focus group comprising six other experienced acupuncturists and researchers (one of whom previously published a paper about the effects of attachment style on response to acupuncture [ [28](#B28-medicines-05-00085)]), one neurofeedback practitioner and a retired medical doctor/government advisor. - A - A survey of UK acupuncture practitioners to find why members of the profession think some patients respond better to acupuncture than others. - B - Use of self-report personality scales with around 100 participants who have taken part in acupuncture-related studies conducted at the University of Hertfordshire since 2011, to assess whether there are any meaningful associations between these traits and their electroencephalography (EEG), heart rate variability (HRV) and outcomes data already collected. - C - A (blinded) retrospective survey of acupuncture teaching clinic patients who have responded either well or poorly to acupuncture, using a variety of short, established self-report personality questionnaires to determine whether any of the traits assessed have a bearing on outcome. - D - A prospective study of patients using a smaller selection of self-report questionnaires (based on Phases A-C above), together with outcome measures such as the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP) and perhaps a multiple measure of mood change similar to those developed and piloted by D.F.M. and other collaborators [ [29](#B29-medicines-05-00085), [30](#B30-medicines-05-00085)]. [Section a quantitative analysis of \"Yes\"/\"No\"/\"Don't know\" survey responses is undertaken in [Section 3.2.3](#sec3dot2dot3-medicines-05-00085), with a nested qualitative analysis of the free-text responses in [Section 3.3](#sec3dot3-medicines-05-00085); the main conclusions are given in [Section 5](#sec5-medicines-05-00085). The survey questions and the actual data gathered are provided in the [Supplementary Materials](#app1-medicines-05-00085)( [https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6320/5/3/85/s1](https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6320/5/3/85/s1)). [30](#B30-medicines-05-00085), [31](#B31-medicines-05-00085)], with a further pilot study still in process. 2. Materials and Methods [32](#B32-medicines-05-00085), [33](#B33-medicines-05-00085)], a survey was developed in consultation with the focus group, members of which were recruited informally from among those with an interest in the survey subject matter. The survey was then trialled by the group prior to launch. Several revisions were made at each stage of this process until the survey was finally considered ready for use. 2.1. The Survey [34](#B34-medicines-05-00085)]. The 13-page survey included three initial questions about the respondents themselves, four about their acupuncture training, professional affiliation and practice, and one (Q9) asking whether\u2014before becoming aware of the survey\u2014they had ever considered that patient characteristics (such as temperament or personality traits) might affect treatment response. [Supplementary Materials](#app1-medicines-05-00085). 2.2. Recruitment [Table 1](#medicines-05-00085-t001)), and also to selected training institutions whose graduates tended to become members of these associations. A template was provided for them to inform their members/graduates about the survey using various methods\u2014newsletters (printed and/or electronic), emails, member forums and social media. No incentives were offered for completing the survey. Survey uptake was monitored by D.F.M.; reminders were sent to the associations, and by them to their members, some five weeks before the survey closed. Clearly, the reminder appears to have been effective ( [Figure 1](#medicines-05-00085-f001)); it also seems possible that members of the smaller associations (apart from the Chinese Medical Institute and Register (CMIR)) were more likely to take the survey; although the correlation between membership numbers and percentages of these that took the survey was not significant (rs = 0.464, p = 0.294), the trendline of a scatterplot for the two remaining sets of six numbers\u2014without the CMIR data\u2014shows a tantalisingly clear power distribution, so that overall numbers were low (median percentage of membership 1.43%, interquartile range 0.43-1.94%). 2.3. Analysis [http://justusrandolph.net/kappa/](http://justusrandolph.net/kappa/)), and Shannon entropy using the simple Excel-based method described in a previous study [ [30](#B30-medicines-05-00085)]. 3. Results 3.1. The Respondents [Supplementary Materials](#app1-medicines-05-00085)). One of these was not an acupuncture practitioner, one other respondent was also not an acupuncturist (although trained), and one completed the survey prior to training. 3.2. The Questions 3.2.1. Questions Requiring \"Yes\" or \"No\" Responses\u2014An Overview [Appendix A](#app2-medicines-05-00085). [Table 2](#medicines-05-00085-t002)). This is consistent with the fact that 96 respondents (84.2%) stated that they had previously considered that patient characteristics (such as their temperament or personality traits) might affect their response to treatment (Q9), and that 70 respondents (61.4%) stated their believe that that some patients respond consistently well or poorly to acupuncture, almost regardless of other factors such as the condition treated or their state of health at the time (Q13). 3.2.2. On Specific Questions Requiring \"Yes\" or \"No\" Responses [Table 3](#medicines-05-00085-t003)(with numbers 2](#medicines-05-00085-f002). [Table 3](#medicines-05-00085-t003)). [Table 3](#medicines-05-00085-t003)), as well as gender issues, child poverty, character when young and TCM pattern. 3.2.3. Respondent Characteristics and Yes/No Responses Age and Years in Practice Gender [Table 4](#medicines-05-00085-t004)illustrates differences in response frequencies by respondent gender. [Figure 3](#medicines-05-00085-f003): most women considered NOW that childhood health could impact treatment response, whereas men generally did not (Pearson's 2 = 7.30, p = 0.026). [Table 4](#medicines-05-00085-t004)for the 60 questions considered together, more males than females replied \"Don't know\" to these individual questions. Main Profession [Table 5](#medicines-05-00085-t005)). Professional Association Membership Style of Practice Prior Opinion That Patient Characteristics Might Affect Treatment Response 3.2.4. Associations between the 60 Main Questions in the Survey [Appendix A](#app2-medicines-05-00085). Even so, some groupings have more explanatory value than others. [Appendix A](#app2-medicines-05-00085)). The results of this test indicate that just because questions follow each other consecutively, they are not necessarily answered in the same manner. 3.2.5. Agreement between Respondents, Variability and Variance of Responses [35](#B35-medicines-05-00085), [36](#B36-medicines-05-00085)] was calculated for both NOW and THEN questions and used to derive a measure of \"overall agreement\" between participants on each question. The questions for which kappa exceeded 0.4 (considered at least a moderate level of agreement [ [37](#B37-medicines-05-00085)]) are tabulated in [Appendix A](#app2-medicines-05-00085). Secondly, Shannon Entropy (SE) values were calculated for each question, both NOW and THEN. SE is a measure of the inherent \"informativity\" (uncertainty or randomness of information) in a given string of data, where higher values indicate more uncertainty or informativity [ [38](#B38-medicines-05-00085)]; we have used this approach in previous pilot studies [ [30](#B30-medicines-05-00085), [31](#B31-medicines-05-00085)]. Randolph's kappa and SE are corollaries, since they respectively measure agreement and variability in a data sample. This was reflected by extremely strong negative correlations between kappa (or overall agreement) and SE across all questions in both NOW and THEN responses (rs 0.998, p < 0.0001). This pattern is shown graphically in [Appendix A](#app2-medicines-05-00085). A third measure, a non-parametric version of coefficient of variance (CV), defined as inter-quartile range divided by the median and multiplied by 100, produced significant correlations in the variance of both \"Yes\" and \"No\" responses between NOW and THEN (rs = 0.870 and 0.632, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.006), but was omitted from further analysis due to its lack of convergence with kappa or SE (correlations ns). [Table 3](#medicines-05-00085-t003)( [Section 3.2.2](#sec3dot2dot2-medicines-05-00085)). Only two questions with lowest inter-rater agreement (or greatest SE) appear in that table, both under \"DK\" responses. Thus, our analysis of respondent agreement (or variability) tallies with our previous analysis of consistency of response by question. 3.2.6. Patterns in Survey Completion Assessed from Numbers of \"Yes\", \"No\" and \"Don't know\" Answers of Free-Text Responses [Figure 5](#medicines-05-00085-f005)) show where this second level of buy-in is strongest. [Figure 5](#medicines-05-00085-f005). In what follows, respondents are identified by number (from 1 to 114), and the questions to which they respond by their alphanumeric code (from 9.a to 20); thus, \"11.4.c/63\" refers to Respondent 63's answer to question 11.4.c. [39](#B39-medicines-05-00085)] (p. 275). These occupy a middle ground within the continuum of qualitative data between the \"gold standard\" interview and \"naturally occurring\" texts such as transcribed conversations and fieldnotes [ [40](#B40-medicines-05-00085)] (pp. 669-670). We allow that unique statements have as much potential importance as frequently-found words [ [41](#B41-medicines-05-00085)]. [40](#B40-medicines-05-00085)] (p. 670). Immersion in the data led to emergence of themes, illustrated below by means of in vivo quotes. Mason's tripartite levels of analysis were used to arrange the themes at literal, interpretive, and reflexive levels [ [42](#B42-medicines-05-00085)] (p. 180) to gain understanding of what acupuncturists think about their patients' identity as \"responders\" to acupuncture. These themes apply axially across the different question areas [ [43](#B43-medicines-05-00085)]. 3.3.1. Literal Analysis [https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6320/5/3/85/s1](https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6320/5/3/85/s1)). Respondent 99 is a lone voice opining that neither gender nor age affects response (10.1.c/99 and 10.2.c/99). [44](#B44-medicines-05-00085)]. [45](#B45-medicines-05-00085)], and also with those conditions identified as having the strongest published evidence for the effectiveness of acupuncture [ [46](#B46-medicines-05-00085)]. 3.3.2. Interpretive Analysis [47](#B47-medicines-05-00085)]. Respondent 43 (amongst others) is repeatedly concerned with acupuncture's impact on individuals' ability to cope, emphasising that this is a more important factor than changes to symptoms, in particular pain levels (see, for e.g., 10.12.c/43 and 10.13.c/43). [48](#B48-medicines-05-00085)]. Superficial needling or the application of non-penetrative devices to acupuncture points is recognised to stimulate these points in a manner equitable to a lower dose of the same treatment [ [49](#B49-medicines-05-00085), [50](#B50-medicines-05-00085)] and subsequent research in this area has led to the development of pragmatic trial models which assess the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment against active comparators in ecologically valid settings [ [51](#B51-medicines-05-00085), [52](#B52-medicines-05-00085)]. Awareness of this context is discernible in many responses here. [47](#B47-medicines-05-00085), [53](#B53-medicines-05-00085), [54](#B54-medicines-05-00085)]. 3.3.3. Reflexive Analysis 4. Discussion [Figure 1](#medicines-05-00085-f001)) is that it may clearly be useful, when survey uptake is flagging, to remind potential respondents of its existence. Another finding on recruitment ( [Table 1](#medicines-05-00085-t001)) is that members of the smaller professional associations were more likely to take the survey, suggesting that personal contact with association staff may be an important factor in increasing uptake. Even so, only 114 people completed the survey out of more than 12,000 potential respondents, an uptake of less than one percent. However, in this age of internet marketing, low response rates are not uncommon. As another organiser of acupuncture surveys has stated, \"The number of acupuncture practitioners who respond to electronic surveys tends to be disappointing, but reasons are unclear why this is so\" [ [55](#B55-medicines-05-00085)]. Personal contact may always be useful, but equally may bias responses. [Section 3.1](#sec3dot1-medicines-05-00085)), as in our previous survey on electroacupuncture usage, where this was particularly true for UK respondents [ [33](#B33-medicines-05-00085)]. Again, as in the earlier survey, male respondents outnumbered females among medical doctors and chiropractors (osteopaths in the earlier survey), although numbers were too small for this to reach significance. Medical doctors tended to be older, and physiotherapists younger, than the majority of survey respondents. It is possible that those doctors that did respond had an interest in the subject matter of the survey because of early contact or training with the doyens of medical acupuncture who first proposed the notions of \"strong reactor\" and \"good responder\". Acupuncturists often enter the profession as a second career, but for physiotherapists acupuncture is usually an add-on to their first main career, so it makes sense that physiotherapists would be the youngest group. [Section 3.2.1](#sec3dot2dot1-medicines-05-00085)). Correspondingly, the vast majority of individual THEN and NOW questions were given \"Yes\" answers. This suggests that responses to the main body of the survey were generally made in a manner congruent with existing practitioner attitudes, rather than being arbitrary. The qualitative evidence indicating clear conceptual understanding of relevant patient characteristics supports this, also suggesting that the respondents answered with reference to theoretical frameworks central to their practice ( [Section 3.3](#sec3dot3-medicines-05-00085)). The fact that respondents generally did not make suggestions for additional attributes that ought to be included suggests that the \"long-list\" of 60 questions was quite comprehensive in terms of the factors readily encountered in a treatment context. [Section 3.2.2](#sec3dot2dot2-medicines-05-00085)) merit particular attention. Those characteristics/behaviours which were most often considered to impact on treatment outcome ( [Table 3](#medicines-05-00085-t003)) included what acupuncture author Bob Flaws once called \"the three frees\"\u2014relaxation, diet and exercise\u2014but also self-motivation, willingness to follow advice given, general state of health and openness to new experiences. In the HRV literature on acupuncture, parasympathetic activation or an improvement in sympathovagal balance is often found to result from acupuncture treatment [ [56](#B56-medicines-05-00085), [57](#B57-medicines-05-00085), [58](#B58-medicines-05-00085)], so a pre-existing ability to relax could facilitate this. The remaining items are all quite straightforward and easy to interpret in the context of acupuncture, where for instance patients less open to new experiences are presumably less likely to procure treatment in the first place. [59](#B59-medicines-05-00085), [60](#B60-medicines-05-00085)] to the effect that children tend to respond particularly well, but at the other end of the age spectrum there appears to be little information available on whether elderly patients respond better or worse than those in their middle years, despite the existence of many studies on the use of acupuncture for conditions of old age. This is in sharp contrast with the qualitative findings, where many of the free-text comments regarding patient age and gender emphasised their general significance for treatment response\u2014with younger and female patients perceived as likely to respond better to acupuncture. It is important to qualify this apparently contradictory result by noting that, although both were relatively popular items for free-text commentary, only 23 qualitative responses were given regarding patient age and gender across 114 respondents. [28](#B28-medicines-05-00085)]. Other general characteristics such as level of education and ethnicity were also thought to have little effect on treatment outcome. It is certainly of interest that 50% of respondents were of the opinion that scepticism does not affect outcome\u2014implying a lack of consensus from a quantitative perspective. The qualitative data help to clarify this by showing distinct schools of thought about the impact of belief in the treatment technique, with some mentioning a positive impact, while most respondents acknowledged that patients show different levels of scepticism\u2014whether it is influential on treatment outcomes. [61](#B61-medicines-05-00085)]. Theoretical constructs such as the three major blocks to treatment, namely \"possession\", \"husband/wife imbalance\" and \"aggressive energy\" [ [62](#B62-medicines-05-00085)], further imply that choice of theoretical framework may have an impact on how patient characteristics are expected to influence treatment response. [Table 3](#medicines-05-00085-t003); there was no clear convergence of opinion among respondents about the remaining two-thirds of the questions. The groupings for which the lowest proportions of items were included in the table are shown in [Table A20](#medicines-05-00085-t0A20)in [Appendix A](#app2-medicines-05-00085). Those groupings which produced least consensus (from which fewest items are therefore included in [Table 3](#medicines-05-00085-t003)) were 4 (Trauma), 6 (Beliefs/attitudes), 5 (Social/financial) and particularly 12 (Psychological attitudes 1), whereas those producing the clearest consensus were 1 (Demographic 1), 2 (Demographic 2), 7 (Lifestyle) and 15 (Behavioural attitudes). [63](#B63-medicines-05-00085)] and psychological attitude [ [64](#B64-medicines-05-00085), [65](#B65-medicines-05-00085)]. This gap in knowledge may be pertinent for those who design acupuncture training courses (especially those for continuing professional education). [Section 3.2.3](#sec3dot2dot3-medicines-05-00085)). For example, younger respondents (i.e., those earlier in their acupuncture careers) were more likely than their elders to discount particular patient characteristics as having a possible impact on treatment outcome, whereas older respondents (those likely to have had more experience of actual practice) were less decided (Age and Years in Practice). This may in part be due to changes in acupuncture education over the years, with younger/more recently trained practitioners placing more emphasis on core protocols and theory; older practitioners, on the other hand, may have had less information-rich instruction and so more of a desire to explore for themselves. However, such an interpretation is conjectural, and would need to be confirmed with further investigation. Furthermore, male respondents appeared slightly less inclined than female respondents to consider particular patient characteristics as having a possible impact on treatment outcome. This gender difference was significant for several specific questions (Gender). Medical doctors (who were mostly male) gave fewer \"Yes\" responses than the remainder of the respondents, physiotherapists and nurses more; physiotherapists were unanimous in their view that religious beliefs or practices might be a factor in treatment response, as against only a third of the acupuncturists (Main Profession); however, this could be a chance finding, the result of small sample size and asking a large number of questions, and should certainly not be taken to imply that physiotherapists have a fundamentally more positive view on the influence of religious beliefs. [66](#B66-medicines-05-00085)]. Style of practice (Style of Practice) and prior opinion that patient characteristics might affect treatment response (Prior Opinion That Patient Characteristics Might Affect Treatment Response) did not appear to affect survey responses in any striking or unexpected ways. [Section 3.2.4](#sec3dot2dot4-medicines-05-00085)), from prima facie to cluster analysis to 2 tests. A compromise set of 17 groupings, using three methods, was arrived at, and performed well (using 2 tests) against a set of unrelated but consecutive questions in the survey, indicating that the groupings were not simply the result of perseveration of responses over strings of questions ( [Appendix A](#app2-medicines-05-00085)). When numbers of \"Yes\", \"No\" and \"Don't know\" responses for the groupings were calculated, as a generalisation, respondents appear to have considered Lifestyle, Stress/relaxation and Behavioural attitudes as having more of an impact on treatment outcomes than Early life, Attitudes to religion or nature, basic Demographics and some of the more complex (less behavioural) issues such as attachment or central sensitisation, which clearly did not strike a chord with many respondents. [Section 3.2.5](#sec3dot2dot5-medicines-05-00085)), namely Randolph's free-marginal multi-rater kappa, Shannon entropy (SE) and a novel non-parametric equivalent of the coefficient of variation (npCV). As expected from their complementary mathematical basis, kappa and SE values showed strong negative correlations. [67](#B67-medicines-05-00085), [68](#B68-medicines-05-00085)], although the long-term dynamics of questionnaire mood responses have been studied using a similar measure, approximate entropy [ [69](#B69-medicines-05-00085)]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an explicit association between SE and kappa has been reported, although given that the former is a measure of response variability and the latter of agreement, the negative correlation between them would be expected. Indeed, SE-based measures of consensus and dissention for Likert scale data have been suggested before [ [70](#B70-medicines-05-00085), [71](#B71-medicines-05-00085)], although they do not appear to have been used except by their originators. For both datasets (NOW and THEN), a kappa value of 0.4 corresponds to SE of 1.02; thus, an intermediate or better value of kappa, using Fleiss's definitions, corresponds to a SE of 1.02 or less. Conversely, an SE of 1 corresponds to a kappa value of 0.41-0.42. This suggests a useful rule of thumb for interrogating questionnaire SE data, and further avenues for exploring relationships between other measures of inter-rater agreement and measures of entropy. [Section 3.2.6](#sec3dot2dot6-medicines-05-00085)), although numbers of \"Don't know\" responses did not increase markedly, as can sometimes occur when respondents experience fatigue [ [72](#B72-medicines-05-00085)]. Increases in kappa, as well as decreases in SE and (for the most part) npCV, also suggest that participants were fatigued by the end of the survey, perhaps tending to fall into a pattern of repeating responses without giving each question due attention. [40](#B40-medicines-05-00085)] (p. 686). 5. Conclusions - 1 - If appropriate, reminders sent out a few weeks before a survey is closed could well increase uptake. Authors of acupuncture surveys should not expect enthusiastic uptake unless their survey is of particular relevance to their pool of potential respondents. In addition, members of smaller professional organisations may be more likely to respond than those of larger acupuncture associations. - 2 - Practitioner age and gender influence how they view the importance of patient characteristics, as do the practitioner's main profession and potentially their own ethnicity. - 3 - Attributes most consistently reported to affect treatment outcome were diet, exercise and the ability to relax (Bob Flaws' \"Three frees\"), together with general health, self-motivation and a willingness to follow advice. - 4 - However, a lack of awareness of more complex or difficult psychological and social issues may have skewed the current findings, obscuring the potential importance of some less obvious attributes. - 5 - Attempts to group characteristics according to item response patterns met with limited success, perhaps relating to the aforementioned skewing. - 6 - Survey fatigue was observed in terms of numbers of \"Yes\" and \"No\" responses, as well as changes in response variability, over the course of completing the survey. - 7 - Qualitative data may support different and subtler conclusions regarding acupuncturists' appreciation of factors influencing their practice.

The corresponding agglomeration stage for each NOW association was assessed from a dendrogram of a nine-stage confirmatory cluster analysis (using the hierarchical method, Ward's method and squared Euclidean distances), and is indicated SE and npCV for the 17 groupings. [Table A20](#medicines-05-00085-t0A20)shows the numbers of items from each grouping included and not included in the upper and lower deciles for SE and kappa scores.
