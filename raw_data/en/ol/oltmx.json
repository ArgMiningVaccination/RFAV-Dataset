Article Contents: Hormonal balance in Traditional Chinese Medicine How To Restore Hormonal Balance With Traditional Chinese Medicine Lifestyle Habits for Balancing Hormones Chinese Herbal Therapy at Health Wise Learn more about Chinese Medicine Hormonal balance in Traditional Chinese Medicine Hormonal imbalances rarely occur overnight. They are symptoms of certain perpetual habits that bring the body out of sync over time. In Traditional Chinese Medicine maintaining hormonal balance is closely tied to the concept of Yin and Yang. Two opposing natures that require the other to stay in harmony. If there is too much of either Yin or Yang, the body is destabilized and hormonal imbalances can occur. An example of a case of too much Yin (Passiveness), consider a person who lives a sedentary lifestyle accompanied by poor dietary practices. Over time, this person will develop heaviness and congestion which leads to poor circulation of blood flow and qi. They may develop accompanying health challenges commonly related to pain in the lower extremities and more. The liver can become congested and unable to perform its proper function, leading to the inability to bio-transform hormones efficiently. On the other hand, an example of too much Yang (activeness), consider a person who is overactive without sufficient rest. They place excessive stress on their body, depleting their energy reserves. When these energy reserves are drained symptoms such as tiredness, low libido, and poor appetite are common. The body is unable to function in its optimal states and cannot produce normal levels of hormones. Amongst women, this situation can lead to amenorrhea (no periods) or infertility due to problems with ovulation. How To Restore Hormonal Balance With Traditional Chinese Medicine At Health Wise our registered Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners can work with you to determine the right treatment plan for balancing your hormones and relieving the accompanying symptoms. Each person's body composition is different and the treatments need to be tailored to your constitution accordingly. Through Traditional Chinese Medicine therapies such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, and more, we can work together towards rebalancing your hormones. The principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine differ from Western notions about health, and illness. If you're looking to cure the root cause of your disease in a holistic and natural way, Chinese Herbal Therapy can be a form of alternative medicine. TCM practitioners believe that disease arises from imbalances in the body and Chinese herbs are prescribed to correct these imbalances over time. Each person's body constitution is unique and the treatment modalities and prescription are altered to fit that changing environment. Through continual work, together we aim to treat the underlying issue. Whilst acupuncture has a regulating effect on the body, herbal therapy can help to provide additional support for hormone balancing. Together, these treatments play an important role in achieving your desired goal of balancing your hormones. Lifestyle Habits For Balancing Hormones Lifestyle, nutrition, and exercise habits help to maintain your hormonal balance. Lifestyle changes and improvements are an important aspect of a treatment plan and are tailored to suit your needs. In general, our practitioners can recommend the following habits: Aim to eat organic foods and hormone-free meats. Many products are treated with pesticides and chemicals. Animal products can contain hormones, and synthetic estrogen-like substances, that can negatively impact the body. Add cruciferous vegetables to your diet. Eat more cabbage, broccoli, brussel-sprouts, and cauliflower. These vegetables contain diindolylmethane (DIM) and help to break down estradiol in the body. Too much estradiol (a form of estrogen made in the body) can contribute to weight gain, moodiness, low libido breast pain as well as uterine cancer. Trade caffeine for tea. Stop the intake of nicotine and alcohol. Avoid junk food. Supplements for Zinc, magnesium, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin C can be helpful. Do things that bring you joy - go for a hike, jog, swim, surf, meditate or read a book.
