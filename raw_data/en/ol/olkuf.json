{"title": "The \"Silk Road of Health\" will Strengthen World Public Health through the Diffusion of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2022-10-20", "cleaned_text": "Western Cape In 2016, President Xi suggested the promotion in Uzbekistan to develop medical cooperation over disease control, traditional medical care, and work together to build a \"Silk Road of Health\". This has significantly encouraged the profound external communication and interchange of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and to develop the impact of TCM along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries and regions. A widespread increase in the distribution of TCM along the BRI countries would significantly influence the development of public health throughout the world. Due to the many variations in medical care systems and cultural background, the advancement of TCM faces many challenges. Based on the investigation of the recognition of TCM along the BRI countries, it is contended in this essay to improve bilateral cooperation mechanisms, develop people-to-people communication, and strengthen the innovation of TCM. (The Mission, 2022). Since the launch of the BRI in 2013, the Chinese government has made a continuous effort to endorse TCM to help bring about a healthy lifestyle along the route. Unfortunately, there are still several challenges in the expansion and exchange of TCM. To acknowledge these challenges, people in this field must conduct extensive research and analysis regarding the status quo about TCM along the BRI route and then ultimately delve deeper to look for effective resolutions. Consequently, this essay describes an in-depth explanation of the present strategies of expanding TCM along the BRI countries and the current obstacles involved. Finally, there are a few suggestions to help strengthen the promotion of TCM (The Mission, 2022). The BRI was founded in China, but ultimately it belongs to the world. It is deeply rooted in history, but it is focused on shaping the future for all. The continents it mainly focuses on are Asia, Europe, and Africa but partners from other regions of the world are encouraged to engage. It bridges between numerous countries and regions, various stages of development, several historical traditions, distinct cultures and religions and different customs and lifestyles. Its main objective is to build peaceful development and economic cooperation, instead of a geopolitical or military coalition. It is a gradual progression of open, inclusive, and common development rather than an exclusionary bloc or \"China Club\". It does not distinguish countries by dogma, nor does it play the zero-sum game. All countries are welcome to take part of the initiative if they feel called to do so. The BRI is dedicated to sustaining the doctrines of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. It follows a \"Silk Road\" spirit highlighting peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning, and mutual benefit. It focuses on policy coordination, connectivity of infrastructure, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and closer people-to-people ties. It is an innovative initiative that has transformed concepts into actions and visions into reality and the initiative is a shared product that is widely welcomed by the international community (The Mission, 2022). Due to the COVID-19 containment and post-pandemic recovery, China is expanding its transformation of the BRI with new components. Among these new components is the Health Silk Road (HSR), which is more displayed in China's official documents and diplomatic language is considered as a main priority on top of China's new BRI agenda. Exemplified by the HSR, China is now presenting a framework of Belt and Road 3.0 - an initiative that no longer emphasizes conventional infrastructure projects, but now is more considerate to high-tech telecommunication infrastructure, medical equipment & healthcare services and other medical IoT (Internet of things). Secondly, instead of being dominated by Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which was the case in the old BRI, the new BRI branch has incorporated the steady rise in the number of private-owned enterprises (POEs) engaged in these projects. POEs are generally considered to be more effective and advanced. The Chinese government is encouraging the involvement of POEs in the HSR to develop the initiative's overall proficiency (Habibi & Zhu, 2021). The two important characteristics of the HSR that separate the new branch from the old BRI are: the shift to service-oriented and high-tech sectors, and the expanding the involvement of private-owned enterprises. The HSR was founded in 2015 with the aim of reinforcing the healthcare collaboration between China and BRI members which include Asia, Europe, and Africa. The new initiative has become a major priority since 2020 because of the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 500 million people and killed more than 6 million as of August 2022 (\"WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard\", 2022).This new BRI branch, with an emphasis in the healthcare sector and the medical applications of digital technologies, has helped countries such as Spain, Italy, Egypt, and Tunisia recover from the extensive ramifications of the pandemic at a swifter pace. The HSR has progressed from a pure healthcare cooperation initiative to broaden economic and diplomatic strategy that China uses to reinforce economic and investment relationship with BRI member countries (Habibi & Zhu, 2021). TCM is one of the greatest accomplishments of Chinese civilization which is also a medical science that has progressed over thousands of years. While fighting against numerous diseases, Chinese people established and advanced TCM by trial and error in their daily lives. With its ancient history of absorption and revolution, TCM is not only considered as a process of treatment, but it also made vast influences on people's pattern of life. The medicines of TCM against diseases incorporates a holistic view of harmony, individuality, simplicity, and preventative treatment which is on account of integration from natural science and humanities. TCM is a beneficial contributor to the health status of many lives and the country's Healthy China 2030 initiative concentrates on disease combat and health promotion. Tu Youyou, a Chinese chemist, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2015 emphasised the impact of TCM to her research and raised artemisinin, a Chinese medicine antimalarial substance, to a new status worldwide as \"A gift from Traditional Chinese Medicine to the World\" (Wang et al., 2021). Countries along the BRI route have a long history of using TCM or traditional medicine, and they are rich in local traditional medical resources. In the past few years, with the outburst in Chinese medicine trade, traditional medicine has turned out to be the new economic growth point in various countries. With the new application of the BRI strategy, China and many other countries along the route have wide-ranging hopes for exchanges and cooperation in the field of TCM. The expansion of TCM in South Asia Traditional Chinese Medicine has an extended past of progress in Singapore. This country serves as the perfect foundation for the expansion of TCM in Southeast Asia. There are more than 30 TCM institutions and more than 1,000 TCM clinics in the city state. The Singapore Ministry of Health has recognized the Chinese Medicine Administration and the Singapore Chinese Medicine Coordinating Committee to advance the reinforcement of the management of TCM. Another Southeast Asian country, Malaysia, holds more than 3,000 herbal stores that sell TCM products and over eight hundred members in the Chinese Medicine Physician Union with the majority of them who are performing medical practices that are associated with TCM. The Malaysian Ministry of Health has always taken a keen role in the support of TCM, but unfortunately has not yet recognized the registration of Chinese Medicine practitioners. The Thai government acknowledges the legal status of TCM and only issues temporary licenses for TCM practitioners provided that they pass a board exam. The government approved the Chinese Herbal Medicine Bill officially in 1987. There are more than eight hundred Chinese medicine stores, ten large Chinese medicine wholesalers, and about forty small and medium-sized TCM enterprises in this country (Cao et al., 2019). Vietnam has been a great advocate in the merging of Chinese medicine and Western medicine. There are almost two hundred large-scale TCM stores and small- and medium-sized TCM pharmacies are prevalent in the country. Over 180 kinds of Chinese herbal medicines are exported from China to Vietnam yearly. Currently there are 16 TCM pharmaceutical manufacturers in China that have attained operating licenses in Vietnam. Therefore, it can be gathered from the above that since Southeast Asian countries are not only geographically nearby to China but are strongly connected culturally. Hence, the expansion of TCM in Southeast Asian countries is usually endorsed by governments and people in these countries (Cao et al., 2019). The advancement of TCM in Western Europe can be found in more than 20 Western European countries along the BRI route, mainly Germany, France, and the United Kingdom (UK). Germany is the country that applies majority of the Chinese herbal medicines in the Western European countries, and more than 58% of Germans take Chinese herbal medicine. The Chinese herbal medicines are easily attainable at any pharmacy in Germany and the annual sale of ginkgo preparations in Germany surpasses $100 million. Furthermore, TCM has been incorporated in the botanical drug system at the Quetzut Institute. France presents the second largest market for TCM in the European Union (EU). In 1952, the French Academy of Medical Sciences accepted acupuncture as a scientific medical practice. In 1985, it decided to incorporate the teaching of TCM in the curriculum of medical universities. There are 23,000 pharmacies in the market, of which more than 10,000 are the main sales channels for herbal and natural Chinese medicines. The UK herbal market is approximately valued at 65 million pounds and is the third largest market for TCM in the EU. Fish oil is the most popular TCM product sold in the UK market, as it is greatly used for heart protection. Other commonly used TCM products are painkillers, cough medicines and skin disease products. There are more than 1,200 TCM pharmacies in the UK, and majority of them serve as main outlets for Chinese medicine sales. Furthermore, many of the community hospitals in the British cities make use of a range of herbal medicine to help treat diseases. The three Western European countries mentioned above are acknowledged as the main market for TCM products in the EU. Because of this there is a steadfast expansion in the Czech Republic, Italy, and other European countries. As a result of the cultural variances between China and the West, there is still a considerable amount of development that is needed in the expansion of TCM in Western Europe (Cao et al., 2019). There is no evidence of an extensive record of TCM spreading in Africa, but the development is steady. In the 1950s, China sent a team of medical aid experts to Africa. During that period TCM specialists played a huge part in tackling infectious diseases. In the past 60 years, TCM medical treatment has been integrated into the national medical systems in countries such as South Africa, Tanzania, etc. Acupuncturists have legitimately been licensed to practice in numerous African countries too, several conventional TCM products such as artemisinin have already saved millions of lives in this region. The University of the Western Cape (UWC) in South Africa was the first university to open a School of Natural Medicine in Africa in 2001. The school offered a 5-year training program in four disciplines of natural medicine: Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture, Naturopathy, Phytotherapy (Western Herbal Medicine) and Unani Tibb Medicine. The study of these disciplines is currently divided into two separate degrees. The first degree is a Bachelor of Science in Complementary Health Sciences, completed over three years. This can be followed by Bachelor of Complementary Medicine (BCM) within your chosen discipline (listed above), completed over two years (\"School of Natural Medicine Programmes\", 2022). The school was launched as a response to the re-opening of the professional register for Naturopathy under the control of the Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa (AHPCSA). UWC's School of Natural Medicine was opened until 2018, and it was the only qualified institution with the Department of Higher Education and AHPCSA in South Africa where those with an interest to become Naturopaths, Phytotherapists, Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Unani Tibb Practitioners could be registered and graduated to practice legitimately (\"UWC's School of Natural Medicine Closes its Doors to New Students\", 2018). As of today, the total import and export of Chinese medicine between China and Africa has reached eighty million dollars. More than 2,000 TCM practitioners have been sent to Africa and hundreds of TCM pharmaceutical companies have established branches in Africa to deliver Chinese medicine service industries to Africans (Cao et al., 2019). THE CHALLENGES IN THE SPREADING OF TCM The expanding of TCM in states along the BRI has not been an easy procedure. By collecting and examining the data of medical policies and TCM associated reports in these countries, the researchers were able to gather difficulties in the development of TCM diffusion. i. Medical Policy Restrictions and Trade Obstructions There are over one hundred countries along the Belt and Road route, and the legislation about TCM differs in each country and region. The recognition of Chinese medicine by the world at large is also not at an equivalent degree. Southeast Asian countries have more of an acknowledgement of TCM with an overall spread from the government to the public. The legislation and management regarding TCM is normally not as widespread in other countries and regions, and there are many gaps that persist in numerous countries. The safety of TCM is constantly used as a justification for legal limitations in Europe. Thus far, countries along the Belt and Road route have not yet established a united, specialized international standard and customs concerned to TCM. Given that modern Western medicine is regarded as the international standard medical system, the associated production, testing, and assessment of TCM is often evaluated according to the quantitative principles of Western medicine in most countries. Therefore, the registration and market access to TCM products usually require specialized guidance. In such an instance mentioned above, the exchange and cooperation over TCM in the countries along the BRI route encounters massive trade difficulties. In the past several years numerous policymakers in these countries have actively advanced TCM to meet the health and medical needs of their citizens. In contrast, to protect their interests in the medical industry, there is constant reluctance to offer legislative protection for TCM. The predisposition of the legal and technical limitations of TCM leads to the diminished internationalisation of TCM (Cao et al., 2019). ii. Fundamental Differences between Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine Currently, Western modern medicine dictates the worlds medical system and is considered as the internationally renowned medical standard. TCM is generally regarded as an alternative medicine compared to the conventional medical system of Western medicine. Western medicine highlights more rational analysis and is established based on experimental results, whereas TCM is grounded on ancient Chinese philosophy of simple materialism and thoughts of harmony which have determined its own distinctive medical theory by integrating ancient Chinese astronomy, meteorology, geography, and several other specialties. The Chinese and Western culture serves in turn as the source of Chinese and Western medicine. However, people with the Western culture background usually fail to acknowledge such a fact and their belief of cultural superiority even leads them to believe that Western medicine is the only medical approach in the world. TCM is then viewed as unscientific, unacceptable, and even witchcraft (Cao et al., 2019). iii. Lack of Innovation in TCM TCM as a medical approach and a carrier of Chinese culture requires adoption and modernisation simultaneously given that improvement is the motivating force to keep things renewed. Now, there is a definitive deficiency of theoretical foundation in terms of TCM medical treatment. As a result of the many diversities in history, cultural background and approaches of thinking, Chinese medicine and modern medicine have substantially distinct attributes. Therefore, the scientific connotation of the TCM theory should not be conveyed from that perspective. Meanwhile, the development of modern civilization does not accept the understanding of TCM from the out-dated and even obsolete approach hence drastic and critical modernisation of TCM theories need to be put in place to meet the requirements of the public. Furthermore, the practical theories such as the method of diagnosis, syndrome differentiation and the mode of administration of TCM have not been assessed correctly or utilized in modern scientific research. The applied theories of numerous TCM treatments are still unknown which has led to the withdrawal of collaboration from modern science. In a nutshell, there continues to be a huge gap between the theoretical and technical system of TCM and Western medicine, which demands more commitment and dedication of TCM practitioners to promote its improvement (Cao et al., 2019). iv. Lack of public recognition of ethnomedical services Ethnic medicine is the quintessential form of medicine that has derived from ethnic minority groups to assist in combatting the spread of diseases and is a vital component of traditional medicine. The journey to revive TCM should insist on the policy that no minority ethnomedicine should be ignored. In the past several years the number of traditional medicine hospitals in Northwest China have greatly improved but the number of outpatients and inpatients in ethnomedical hospitals were significantly lower than in TCM hospitals. For instance, traditional medicine hospitals in Qinghai largely consist of ethnomedical hospitals, and there were 14 Chinese medicine hospitals, 7 integrated Chinese and Western medicine hospitals and 37 ethnomedical hospitals in the year of 2019. However, the number of inpatients was 1,572,000 and the number of outpatients was 82,410 in Chinese medicine hospitals, while the number of inpatients was merely 737,000 and number of outpatients was 48,439 in ethnomedical hospitals. This implies that the service capability of TCM hospitals surpasses that of ethnic medicine hospitals (Liu et al, 2021). v. The scarcity of multifactorial TCM talents impedes the internationalization of TCM Health specialists are essential for hospitals to function at their maximum capacity and the absence of TCM talents has continued to be an ongoing obstacle in the expansion of TCM. Considering the national rankings of the \"Number of Chinese Medicine Practicing Physicians (including TCM Practicing Assistants)\" in the provinces and independent regions of Northwest China in 2019, Shaanxi ranks 18th, Gansu ranks 9th and Qinghai ranks 7th, Ningxia ranks 16th, Xinjiang ranks 22nd, and the small population of Northwest China demonstrates that the number of local TCM physicians are not hopeful. The teaching process of TCM is rare and is done in a \"teacher-apprentice\" way. The studying process is time-consuming and there has always been a shortage of TCM talents. Under the facilitation of the BRI more TCM services are being widely recognized in countries all over the world and the requirements and needs for TCM talents have boosted. Domestic TCM hospitals require TCM talents to support BRI projects such as building international departments and conducting medical service assistance overseas. In this way, more TCM hospitals can truly be internationalized and TCM culture be endorsed throughout the world (Liu et al, 2021). SUGGESTIONS FOR THE SPREADING OF TCM It has been long overdue for the people in the TCM industry to completely investigate the budding cooperation mechanisms between the governments to actively encourage the implementation of the signed bilateral cooperation contract on TCM. The government organizations ought to continue conducting high-level interactions between Chinese and foreign governments and international organizations. It is crucial that the policymakers in China increase intergovernmental consultation and coordination mechanism in order to assist in reinforcing interactions amongst senior officials of both sides, broadening cooperation with governments on creating guidelines and regulations concerning TCM market access and supervision. In this manner people will be more inclined to coordinate and resolve important challenges from a global perspective to establish a positive policy setting for TCM to expand along the Belt and Road countries. With this mode of action, the Chinese government will receive a greater responsibility to take part in the innovation of TCM by improving the protection of the long-established brand of TCM, advocating the use of TCM products and services as a display of intangible cultural heritage. They can also offer policy guidance and financial funding for TCM education and cultural exchange programs in countries along the BRI route. In addition to the harmonization of government departments and cooperation with international organizations, TCM practitioners hold the opportunity to build international TCM information centres to improve the distribution and interchange of medical information along the BRI countries (Su, pp.102-138, 2015). Poverty eradication is a worldwide common goal and TCM has played a pivotal role in the success of poverty alleviation. TCM has the unique advantage of being \"simple, effective and inexpensive\". It has been noted that TCM services have advanced the structure of Malaysia's healthcare system and the people's need for Chinese medicine services have increased. The advantages of TCM have the potential to enhance the regional essential health network and diminish the burdens of the poor. Through the establishment of the BRI, distributing the knowledge of TCM poverty alleviation and encouraging global poverty reduction will not only promote the international growth of TCM but also display the responsibilities of a major country. The assistance of the BRI will bring forth TCM medical technical support to disadvantaged areas along the \"Silk Road\", China is required to modify the training plan for Chinese medicine practitioners. TCM practitioners are the key contributors of TCM services, in order to enhance the internationalization of TCM, these medical practitioners ought to overcome language barriers. Through the reinforcement of international training of TCM practitioners, developing their professional skills and refining service awareness will result in better medical services in countries along the BRI route (Liu et al, 2021). TCM organizations and practitioners need to seize the opportunity of the Confucius Institute to help expand the Chinese medicine culture. At the current moment there are more than four hundred Confucius Institutes overseas. By incorporating Chinese medicine culture and TCM science into the education of Chinese, people will be able to improve in the teaching content and gain a greater wide-ranging understanding of TCM culture. With this progression TCM experts can play a pivotal role by assisting in providing lectures, offering medical consultations, and carrying out academic communication conferences with Western colleagues. This kind of cultural exchange activities in the Confucius Institute will influence a great development in the influence of TCM culture through lectures and free clinical services. For example, an international cooperation programme was launched in 2019 whereby an agreement was signed between the University of the Western Cape (UWC), Zhejiang Normal University and Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (Confucius Institute, 2022). The objective of this agreement is to join new friendships, respect and cooperation between China and South Africa. This partnership could set a template for future interrelationships between other countries. Perhaps this could develop into the education of Chinese and the TCM culture. In the meantime, it is crucial to give any necessary assistance to qualified colleges and universities to establish communication centres for TCM in countries along the Belt and Road route in order to mutually develop local talents who will become proficient in both Chinese medicine and Western medicine. For example, the Confucius Institute for Chinese Medicine at the UWC has been granted an overseas \"Centre for TCM Education and Service\" status by Zhejiang Chinese Medical University in May 2022 (Confucius Institute, 2022). With the enormous rise in the popularity of online education, an international English online course of TCM should be funded by numerous universities to attract the interest of more foreign audiences and students who are interested in Chinese Medicine. This can be done whereby the theory aspects of the course are taught online and the practical aspect is taught at the TCM centre as acupuncture requires precision, as not all aspects of it can be taught online. Bursaries and funds should be gathered to support TCM fans to broaden the learning and experience of TCM in China (Cao et al., 2019). Licensed TCM cross-cultural communicators are expected to be experienced in at least three of the following capabilities: they should have well-known information on the culture of TCM, proficient in bilingual or multilingual skills and a great passion for Chinese culture. According to the data received from the questionnaires and feedbacks during the summer vacation in 2017, the author illustrated that majority of Chinese medicine students had the first ability, those who have the second and third ability are limited. For lecturers in Chinese medicine universities, the number of lecturers with the first and third abilities is substantial whereas the ratio of lecturers with the second ability is minor. For overseas students in Chinese medicine universities, their first and third abilities are far inadequate compared to native students and their second abilities are solid. Therefore, it is evident that procedures should be done to improve the abilities for these three categories which play a pivotal role in TCM cross-cultural communication. Hence, the core aim should be on developing high quality faculties and the students' bilingual skills, to expand the lecturers and the students' skills of intercultural communication and translation skills. For overseas students who study at Chinese medicine colleges and universities, the main priority is to improve their understanding of Chinese medicine and enrich their cultural awareness of loving Chinese medicine and being dedicated to spreading the culture of TCM (Qu, 2018). With the tourism 4.0 era driven by the \"One Belt, One Road initiative\", the TCM tourism industry will eventually be incorporated into the internet. With the ongoing expansion and modernization of apps in cell phones, modified and customized tourism are additionally becoming more prevalent amongst people. With the assistance of a specialised app. Functions such as telemedicine, mobile medical treatment and real-time downloading of electronic prescriptions can be done which is the most obvious improvement compared to the previous era in tourism 4.0 era. This will give consumers the ability to be more considerate of their health thus through customized and modified health tourism plans will make it simpler for users to mould the combination of medical information services such as visits to health preservation cultural bases, online buying of health preservation products, convenient access to electronic prescriptions and so on. It is evident that the internet plays a crucial role in this era, thus the formation of Chinese medicine network information programmes need be developed as soon as possible including the necessary web software in order to quicken the advancement of TCM (Qu, 2018). It is important to consider language translation approaches in order to allow the attributes of TCM health tourism to play a significant role for international tourists in order to accomplish the objective of expanding TCM culture. TCM cultural tourism translation does not require in-depth information on the obscure theories and terminology of TCM, which mostly emphasizes the use and influence of Chinese herbs and even some mystery legends. The methods of translation should regard the psychological and cultural response of tourists. The preference of language and content should assist in cultural communication and the progression of the tourism industry. Ge believes that the international spread of TCM should highlight the promotion of \"purpose translation\": it is directed at the audience and concentrates on the effect. \"Target audience\" is a term for translators to incorporate the international acceptance of TCM output into translation thinking and to completely recognize the knowledge and consumption of TCM culture by ordinary audiences. The main goal of \"purpose translation\" is to give emphasis to the culture reception (Qu, 2018). Currently the slow rate at which TCM is expanding is because of the inadequate access to Chinese medical knowledge, the deprivation of the value of TCM products, and the unending downgrading of the status of TCM in the modern medical system. \"Blacksmith needs its own hardware\", therefore TCM practitioners should pardon no attempts to pursue self-improvement, self-innovation of TCM knowledge to take part in the pioneering expansion of Chinese medicine. It is also up to the public to do their own studies on the basic theoretical research of Chinese medicine, forming a theoretical system with clear ideas and reasonable organization. Bearing in mind, the huge role TCM plays in the treatment of infectious disease, frequently occurring diseases, chronic diseases, and in disease prevention, TCM companies should be willing to finance pharmaceutical researchers and products designs to endorse a range of newly branded TCM products and services to accommodate the local market needs. Governmental organizations can assist in creating advancements to hasten the legislation of laws pertaining to TCM, employing severe administration of TCM products and services and assist to generate an environment where TCM does not just continue to exist but truly prosper (Cao et al., 2019). CONCLUSION This essay delved into the current spreading of TCM in countries along the Belt and Road route. Although there are some complications that have been confronted, there are solutions to help encourage its expansion. Traditional Chinese Medicine holds many unique philosophical thinking and values of Chinese civilization, which gives it such a perpetual appeal. The Belt and Road Initiative offers a wonderful prospect for the expansion, interchange, and self-renewing of TCM and the Chinese culture it represents. We should seize the opportunity of the Belt and Road Initiative to promote TCM overseas as it can provide new solutions to global health and contribute to the building of a health community for all. By acknowledging the difficulties mentioned above, the advancement of TCM will surpass its current state and the role of TCM in international health care and disease prevention will be radically improved too.
