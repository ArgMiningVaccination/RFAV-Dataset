Nationally, TeamHealth has approximately 16,000 clinicians delivering care in a variety of hospital-based, post-acute and ambulatory sites of care, 230 of whom staff nine Covenant Health acute-care hospitals across East Tennessee. Through the collaborative efforts of both companies, TeamHealth clinicians are already receiving the vaccine each day. TeamHealth's Emerging Infectious Disease Task Force (EIDT) examined both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna data released by the Food and Drug Administration and reached a unanimous conclusion in support of both vaccines, believing both to be highly effective and recommending it be administered to adults, including TeamHealth clinicians, unless clear contraindications exist. TeamHealth Executive Vice President Dan Collard said that in addition to local efforts being coordinated with Covenant Health, the company is also facilitating clinician vaccine efforts with hospital partners across the country. \"We are pleased to see that TeamHealth clinicians across the country are being included in early hospital efforts to vaccinate frontline healthcare workers. We have maintained an open dialogue with both our partners and our clinicians, encouraging early adoption of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. With a presence in nearly 700 hospitals across the country, not including our post-acute and ambulatory footprint, we believe it is vital that we are transparent in our support for this national vaccine rollout.\" Covenant Health's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mark Browne, echoed the importance of including frontline clinicians - such as those staffing the system's emergency departments - in early vaccination efforts. \"It is critical that our emergency medicine physicians and advanced practice clinicians be included in the first wave of vaccines, and we appreciate the collaboration of TeamHealth and the encouragement they provided their clinicians in being part of this initiative. The early adoption of the vaccine rollout is an extension of our comprehensive commitment to keep our patients and our caregivers safe, and we value TeamHealth's participation in that program.\" TeamHealth is the nation's largest integrated physician practice, with 16,000 clinicians caring for patients in hospitals and other partner facilities across the country. TeamHealth has strongly recommended vaccination to all clinicians to lead by example and communicate that vaccination is a public health imperative during an unprecedented pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control [recommended](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations-process.html) that healthcare workers at high risk for exposure be among the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as doses become available.
