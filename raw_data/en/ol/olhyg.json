PM 17/6/1997 Speaker Stuart 'White Title Setting the Sails: Ecological Tax Reform and Factor Four Outline Ecological tax reform means taxing 'bads and nuisances instead of goods and services. It can swing the tax burden away from taxes on employment, and onto production and activities that use a lot of resources, generate a lot of waste or impact negatively on communities. Ecological tax reform is only one tool for moving along sustainable pathways, and we still need other economic measures, regulation, education, public participation and the use of performance indicators. There has been considerable interest in the use of ecological taxes in Europe, and recent developments will be outlined and discussed in this presentation. Factor Four means doubling productivity while halving resource use, and will be a minimum requirement for moving in a sustainable direction. It is the title of a recent book by Ernst von Weizsacker and Amory and Hunter Lovins. The principles of Factor Four will be discussed and examples provided.

El SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT against mining in areas of high conservation value Major sections of the mining industry in Australia have never attempted to hide their wish to have access to areas of high conservation value such as national parks, state parks, World Heritage Areas (WHAs) and wilderness areas, for the purposes of exploration and mining. Industry hopes appear to have been boosted with the election of a Federal Coalition Government whose attitude on the issue appears at best ambiguous and at worst fully supportive of enabling exploration and mining in high conservation value areas. THE PUSH FOR MULTIPLE USE The push into areas of high conservation value is usually couched in terms of 'multiple land use'. The concept has already been applied in a number of forms around Australia to achieve both a downgrading of the 'protected' status of existing reserves and a lower protection status for new reserves. Examples of this include: the creation of Regional Reserves (South Australia) or Resource Reserves (Queensland) which allow for mining and exploration in high conservation value areas; joint proclamation of national parks so that new national parks can be subject to exploration and mining (South Australia); the creation of national parks with 'holes' or other arbitrary boundaries (Northern Territory - Kakadu); the excision of land from existing national parks and reserves to allow exploration and mining to occur (Western Australia); amendments to the legislation governing national parks to permit resource development activities (Victoria - oil and gas exploration and development). ACF is concerned that the renewed multiple use push by the mining industry and governments will acceler- ate this trend. WHY MINING SHOULD NOT OCCUR IN HIGH CONSERVATION VALUE AREAS The mining industry has pushed the multiple land use concept on the grounds that it should be entitled to 'access' high conservation value areas. The industry argues that resource development activities can occur simultaneously with the protection of conservation and cultural values. These arguments are rejected for the following reasons: exploration and mining have been demonstrated to have impacts which are incompatible with the pro- tection of high conservation values; conservation reserves generally protect a range of additional values (such as tourism, scientific research, water catchments etc.) which would be compromised by exploration and mining - conser - vation reserves are already multiple use areas, it is mining that is a single use; currently the proportion of land area fully protected for conservation purposes in Australia is, at best, only 4.2 11o; scientific assessment suggests that at least 15% of Australia's land area needs to he placed in a compre- hensive, representative and fully protected reserve system to protect Australia's full range of hiodiversity; flUmeroUs OpifliOfi polls have shown that 75-95 0/o of Australians do not want exploration and mining allowed in high conservation value areas; the sustainahility of the Australian mining industry is highly questionable if it requires access to high conservation value areas in order to survive. WHAT ACF IS SEEKING ACF argues that governments must demonstrate their commitment to the protection of high conservation value areas. This requires: governments, through the Council of Australian Governments, to proscribe mining, exploration and other intrusive development activities in agreed protected areas; the establishment of a comprehensive, representa- ' live and adequate national reserve system by 2000; the introduction of a national wilderness protection program, including Commonwealth wilderness protection legislation; and the Federal Government to maintain and, where necessary, use its external affairs powers to protect high conservation value areas from exploration, mining and other resource development activities. 2 U 5UNBURY 4COIIIE Rd . k.J.aulP\\ KEY - Major Road Park Access Road Shannon Park and DEntrecasteaux National Park . .....

This project grew out of the Conservation Councils and Environment Centres Annual Conference in Adelaide in July 1996. This project is coordinated by Chris Harris of Cycad Consulting in Sydney. We are seeking to gather a regisler of skilled trainers and consultants who could provide a range of services to activists and groups working on Environmental issues. Many of these People are volunteers or work for organisation with very limited budgets. However the work they do is complex, requiring much skill and knowledge, demanding, often stressful and of course, very important for all of us and our future. If you have skifls and resources you could offer in the area of training, we would appreciate you filling out the form eiiclosed and returning it to the address above. Please spread these forms around as widely as you can or let us know where we could spread them. This register is one strand in a wider strategy to pool resources and coordinate between groups to do workshops and training intensives in regional areas. We are also interested in accessing resources from other sectors such as the community development and welfare sectors that provide training which can be relevant to environmentalists. Any information about this would also be useful. Katrina Shields Training Register Coordinator 7. INHABIT a bioregional journal for Australia issue#4 Autumn 1996 S.

Articles by 1st September, 1996 bioregionalism and the non-human One of the focuses of much bioregional literature is the attempt to 'place' humans back into 'nature'. Does this mean everything gets reduced to being a 'resource'?, what about intrinsic value? deep ecology? potential conflict between human and non-human needs? What would an appropriate spirituality look like? Articles by Dec 1sf, 1996 \"Biogeography\" is already on the way to becoming a fad, with it's new terms, but the fundamentals are: it relates to knowing land directly, not just intelectually; with one's body, committment, time, labour, walking. Maps, charts, botanic lists, histories, are just the menu. You'd starve on that. Also: biogeography is political. It destroys the nation states pretensions. It cuts off exploita- tion. It discourages senseless travel-for-sensation. It is business like and playful.... Although it is clear we cannot again have seamless primative cultures, or the purity of the archaic, we can have neighbourhood and community. Communities strong in their sense of place, proud and aware of local and special qualities, creating to some extent their own cultural forms, not humble or subserviant in the face of some \"high cultural\" over-funded art form or set of values. No amount of well meaning environmental legislation will halt the biological haulocaust without people who live where they are and work with their neighbours, taking responsi- bility for their place, and SEEING TO IT: to be inhabitants, and not retreat. This is happening already: a mosaic of small towns and rural places where people are digging in and saying \"if not now, when? If not here, where?\" Theprocess becomes educational, even revolutionary, when one becomes aware of the responsibilty that goes with \"rootedness\", and the way the cards are stacked against it. Aims of the Journal *To encourage the articulation of bioregional ideas and promote bioregionalism as a viable frame- work for social and environmental change. *To encourage and celebrate the development of place-centred cul- tures that are reinhabitory rather than exploitative. *To promote bioregionalism as a world view that is concerned with personal, spiritual, social, cultural, political and economic change. To encourage articles which reflect this diversity. Editorial guidelines *In terms of accepting articles, we strive for gender balance. We encourage articles from less populat- ed (and hence often under-repre- sented) bioregions. Ideally written contributions would be on MacIntosh compatable 3 inch discs, but typed or hand written is fine. Please state what you want returned and label clearly with name and address. *We welcome new members on the editorial collective. The structure of this will unfold as new people get involved. We also seek regional cor- respondents, and are interested in hearing from people who want to contribute a 'regular' column on a specific area - permaculture, poetry, music, book reviews, etc. *We welcome any manner of input; articles, reports, photos, poems, drawings, graphics, maps, etc. There is no copywrite unless specified, in which case copyright rests with the individual author.

A kind of dread (and I am not subject to such feelings) came over me as I gazed upon it. It looked like the entrance into hell. Mr. Browne stood horrified \"Did man\", he exclaimed, \"ever see such a place?\" \"It is bad enough indeed,\" I replied. (Waterhouse 1984). This was Captain Charles Sturt's response to his first sight of the Simpson Desert in 1845. If he had arrived in 1974, he could have launched his boat on the inland sea he sought. But he would still have been hor- rified by the disappearance of those waters in subsequent years. Australia presented to invading Europeans an environment which was rad- ically different from anything they had experienced. In some ways, we still haven't got over those initial impressions. In particular, we haven't accepted the most out- standing characteristic of this environment - its variability. We still respond to drought, for example, as if it were a perverse trick of an aberrant and malicious continent. We have learned to suffer and endure, but not to accept, much less to cherish. This is particularly obvious in our attitudes to the Australian and zone, which is 70% of the continent. And it is especially true of the rivers of the arid zone - the rivers of the Lake Eyre Basin. Many of the Australians who even think about of and zone still consider these rivers no more than \"a lot of dried-up creek-beds\". But perceptions are changing, and there is a growing appreciation of the uniqueness and living diversity of the rivers in what used to be called \"the dead heart\" of the country. An element in this appreciation is the growth of scientific evidence for the extraordinary qualities of these rivers. Rivers and streams are among the most variable ecological systems on earth, and those in and zones are the most variable of all (McMahon 1979) CoDper Creek, for example, stops flowing in most years, and contracts to its deep, permanent channels in dry years. But in floods like 1974 the maximum flow rate at Innamincka is as great as the seasonal maximum flow rate of the Nile at Khartoum, and at Currareva upstream it is three times as great (Knigh ton & Nanson 1994, Rzoska 1978). You can sit in the Innamincka pub and watch the Nile swirl past. The great variability of and zone rivers is because of the variability of and zone rain- Many of us, like fall. This variability is magnified by the high rates of evaporation and the nature of Barron Field , have been brought up on Northern Hemisphere ideas about how rivers work. \" vegetation in desert areas. This variability is greater in Australia than in any other continent (McMachon & Finlayson 1991), and it is at its extreme in the flood patterns of Lake Eyre Basin rivers like the Cooper and Diamantina (Walker et al in press). William Lines (1991 p. 51) quotes an early 19th century geographer, Barron Field, who accused on New South Wales river of \"spending the rains in flooding a barren coun- try, instead of improving its own channel ....as a river should.\" Many of us, like Barron Field , have been brought up on Northern Hemisphere ideas about how rivers work. We think of rivers as regular, linear systems, flowing in a well defined channel - a sort of natural canal. Only recently, with the study of tropical rivers, have ecolo- gists begun to recognise the importance of the lateral spread of floodwaters beyond the river channel onto floodplains (Junket all 989). They realise now that it is the floodplaing which feed the channel, not the other way around. At the same time, they have begun to recognise that variation in flow - or flooding - is the way the river spreads out and feeds itself from its flood- plains. And the period of drought are just as important as the periods of flood, because is is during drought that the river's food - the plant matter and other litter accumulates and decays on the floodplain. Rivers which have extensive floodplains and high flow variability are the most productive and the most biologically diverse. The Cooper and Diamantina are out- standing on both counts (Puckridge 1922). Some idea of the diversity and complexity of the floodplains of the Cooper, may be given by a few examples. At a large scale, there are striking differences between the middle Cooper, in Queensland, which forms the enormous braided system of the Channel Country, and the Cooper just over the South Australian border, where the river is confined by stony tablelands, and forms an incised channel with riffles and a relatively narrow floodplain. Immediately INHABIT #4 / Autumn 1996 / page 2 of RIVERS and DESERTS downstream of Innamincka the main Cooper spreads into the dunefields of the Strzelecki Desert in a vast floodplain covering 15,000 qu. km . Because of the low relief and low gradients in the desert, the pattern of water flow is extremely complex, and forms a bewildering mosaic of channels, lakes, swamps and deltas. All these floodplain features are different every time you visit because of the variability of the flows Channels, for example, become lakes as flow stops, then dry I and become part of the floodplain. At different stages of a ) flood pulse backwaters become anabranches, swamps become billabongs, meadows . i I_______ become swamps. Often hugh areas of the floodplain will be completely dry, at other times equally hugh areas will be totally inundated and impassable. This can be frustrating, and can be seen as perverse and hostile. It can also be seen as M - extraordinary, distinctive and fascinating, and there are increasing numbers of people in Australia and overseas who think so. An indication of this is that the lower Cooper flood- OLD plain is the largest freshwater wetland in the world to be list- - - - - - - - - cd on the Ramsar Convention for the protection of wetlands Al of international importance. These rivers are probably of world significance because of 171 this physical distinctiveness alone. But from their unique physical features has evolved distinctive communities of ' plants and animals. The study of these has only just begun, but there are already indications that these plant and animal NSW communities are very diverse and abundant. For example, a recent comparison of the number of vertebrate species in the Channel Country and Cape York showed that the Channel Country equalled and in some respects exceeded the Cape York region in vertebrate species numbers (McFarland 1992). There is evidence that invertebrate species numbers are also LAKE EYRE BASIN Clive Rosewame very high, and a recent vegetation survey of the Kanowana wetlands on the Cooper floodplain reveals an extraordinary diversity of vegetation patterns (Gillen & Drewien 1993). These communities may also be spectacularly abundant. A 1990 survey of waterbird densities where the Cooper and Diamantina flow Lake Eyre found densities as high as Kakadu (Kingsford & Porter 1993). A breeding colony of Australian pelicans on Lake Goolangirie on the Cooper floodplain in 1989 was estimated at 80,000 birds (J. Reid pers. comm.). Such diversity and productivity is extraordinary in the heart of an and zone. These rivers also have significance for the conservation of terrestrial animals. Nutrients, essential for plant growth, are extremely scarce in the Australian and zone. Water-courses accumulate scarce nutri- ents in run-on areas. Many terrestrial animals are dependent during drought on these fertile refuges created by water flow. In fact, the loss of so many and zone marsupials in South Australia is probably due to their defeat in competition for these refuges with introduced animals (Morton 1990). River sys- tems are major creators of such refuges, and conservation of and zone river systems is therefore a crit- ical part of overall and zone conservation. The rivers were once the heart of Aboriginal civilisation in the arid zone. Thousands of Aboriginal people were living on the lower Cooper when Burke and Wills arrived. The record of Aboriginal occupation is ubiquitous in this country - in mid- dens, burial sites, quarries, rock engravings and ceremonial rock arrangements. You can scarcely set foot anywhere with- out trampling shell, bone, ochre and worked stone. This is an are as worthy of protection. exceptional record of a culture which has lived with these rivers for tens of thousands of years, and has accepted and has adapted to their variability. Although the sur- vivors of white invasion are now depleted and scattered, there is a growing movement to re-establish some of their rights to this country. The Lake Eyre Basin rivers are physically, biologically and culturally remarkable. What is even more INHABIT #4 / Autumn 1996 / pacie3 the Cooper and Diamantina are still largely intact. In this sense these rivers are as \"wild\" as the famous Franklin of Tasmania, and of RIVERS and DESERTS remarkable is that they re relatively unmodified. In Australia and worldwide, major rivers have been regulated, chnnelised, separated from their floodplains, diminished by water diver - sions, polluted and crammed with exotic species, their catchments and banks cleared of vegeta- tion, their swamps and deltas drained. In the United States, a recent Federal assessment of the state of rivers found only 2% were any longer of sufficient quality to be worth Federal protec- tion (Benke 1900), Australia's greatest river system, the Murray-Darling, has been ecologically crippled. In South Australia, one of the driest states in the world, only 11% of the wetlands of the South-East remain, and the wetlands of the Adelaide plains have totally vanished (Conservation Projects Branch 1983). Yet the Cooper and Diamantina are still largely intact. In this sense these rivers are as \"wild\" as the famous Franklin of Tasmania, and are as worthy of protection. But developments in the basin are proceeding in a variety of areas - in transport and infra- structure, vegetation clearance, tourism, mining, introduction of exotic species and fisheries. Other developments, such as upstream systems of wiers and water diversions, and new agri- cultural initiatives like cotton farming are being suggested. The world of the Lake Eyre Basin is changing, and will continue to change, probably at an increasing pace. But there is no overall view of the implications of these changes, or adequate coordination of them, or research and monitoring on which to base management. As the experience of the Murray-Darling shows, it is not use waiting until the damage is done. Sturt's journies probably were hellish. But that had more to do with 19th cen- tury English culture than with the country itself. There is much to cherish in and Australia. Sit on the bank of the Northwest Branch of the Cooper one evening. The wind sub- sides, redgum limbs glow and their canopies turn gold. Galahs and corellas cruise in from the western dunes, shrieking and quarrelling over perches. Caspian terns stroke easily overhead, heading west to their nesting colony on Lake Apachirie. The evening chorus of white-plumed honeyeaters, ravens, whistling kites and red-runiped parrots begins to overhead, heading west to their nesting colony on Lake Apachirie. The evening chorus of white-plumed honeyeaters, ravens, whistling kites and red-rumped honeyeaters, ravens, whistling kites and red-rumped parrots to quiet. Corellas are now querulous, like drowsy chooks. A distant pair of bark- ing owls wakes across the river. They call to each other, the male's voice deeper. Beginning slow and growing faster they reach a crescendo, stop. The first bats flicker overhead, their calls the click of beads. In the Lake Eyre Basin, as in English meadows. \"...nature is never spent; Jim Puckridge There lives the dearest freshness deep down things.\" (Gardner 1973 p. 786). References Benke A.C. (1990).

It comes from \"Bio\" - life, \"Region\" - a physical or geographic boundary, and \"ism\" - the human part- the practise of how we relate to and live with a particular place. Although you can trace the idea of bioregionalism back as far as you can trace the story of humanity, as a theory, it has it's recent roots in the popular move- ments of the 1960's. Two names in particular have been linked with the word itself, and an equally important second concept- that of 'reinhabitation'. Peter Berg and Raymond Dassman are usually credited with coining the words, and they certainly are the ones responsible for polarising them. In many ways their work was based on the simple, yet surprisingly profound understanding that political and administrative boundaries are not based on any real (ie, natural) basis. When you start to ask what constitutes natural boundaries, you see vege- tation, land form, watersheds. Peter and Raymond used a map of the biomes (dominant vegetation communities) of north america to give an entirely new view of where they were- no longer just northern California, but within a vast and interconnected series of identifiable ecosystems, each of which was the product of natural forces. They then took a great step forward in understanding by incorporating a cultural component- namely that humans interact and are affected by the natural sys- tems that they live within. So, the question that becomes apparent is- if we are to see that there are natural regions (bioregions) and if we are going to try to live within the constraints of what the region offers, the question that arises is, what would this culture look like? Bioregionalism seeks to move beyond the current focus of the environment bioregionalism movement, which tends to be issue specific, and by necessity, re-active, i s simply a new Because of this, it often causes polarisation and tends to focus on short term gains or 'rear name for an old guard' actions. Bioregionalism talks about ecological rather than environmental thinking- seek- practise. It ing solutions that are holistic, diverse and with the largest possible number of possible out- comes from comes. It is based on ecological/natural laws rather than human ones, and is often seen as being NBJO - life 'biocentric' - that is holding a view that humans are only one species amongst millions rather 1egion - a than the overlord or master of the earth. Yet it also brings the human and cultural back into the physical or attempt to build a better world, hence bridging the gap between environmental and social issues. By honouring values that allow us to live with the land it offers potentials to find allies geographic in a way that current environmentalism cannot do- whether those allies are timber producers, boundary, and farmers, or people who fish, there is the potential for common ground. \"ism\" - the Bioregionalism puts 'place' back on the stage of human history at a pivotal human part- the time in our history. Never before has the earth seen such globalisation and homogenisation practise of how of natural systems and human societies. In the last few years of the 20th century you can we relate to and already feel the groundswell of change and rising expectations that seems to come with western live with a ('Christian') cultures at the end of the millennium. In Australia we have debate about the particular place Republic- why settle for window dressing changes when there is the possibility of a dramatic restructure of society into a bioregional federation, with continental, regional and neighbourhood government? Bioregionalism raises new concepts as it merges politics, culture, ecology and per- sonal change. It speaks to the human need to belong to a community, and at a time when our societies are increasingly beset by fear, isolation and social breakdown, offers a vision of a rich and vital human society within the extended vision of a global community that takes in the human and non-human world. Because it starts with an increased personal awareness of our home place, it is twice as powerful as a tool for social change; firstly because it starts at the level of personal experi- ence rather than allegiance to a creed or dogma. Secondly because it gives added richness to individ- ual lives through a heightened connection to place, and hence provides a vision that is most likely to feed us in the long run. In particular, unlike many worldviews, it offers greater 'results' the harder we 'work' (as I learn ever more about my home region, i feel my life become more grounded and ful- filling). In many ways bioregionalism is a perfect expression of the old adage 'the personal is politi- cal'. A further offshoot from this is that bioregionalism is fundamentally positive. This is in a world where we are constantly offered visions of post holocaust worlds via music, film, mainstream media and even fashion. Basics It is interesting that Bioregionalism is only just appearing in dictionaries. There are many definitions continued over introduction to of what constitutes a hioregion, but a good starting one would be \"a place defined by it's life forms or life territory as opposed to human- imposed legislative boundaries\". Basically, bioregionalism encourages us to realise that we live on a dynamic, vibrant and real world that is composed of thousands of inter related but distinct regions. A practical ramifica- tion of this understanding is to determine what our home bioregion is and how far it spreads around us. The next logical outcome is to seek to live within the constraints of what that home place offers by striving for regional self sufficiency in basi: commodities from what the region offers. This means developing cultures that are responsive to that place, which is the opposite of what we are seeing on a global scale at the present time- homogenisation's of human soci- eties to meet the needs of the world market. Raymond Dasmann introduces a useful concept- that of biosphere versus ecosphere peoples. Ecosphere peoph' draw their resources from their home region. This means that they can more easily becon responsive to how well they are managing that region. He suggests that most people have lived this way for most of human history. In contrast, biosphere people draw their resources from around the earth. There are no builtin feedback loops to give an idea of how well land systems are being managed. Biosphere cultures are the original expansionist empires that now find expression through the forces of capital, which seek to develop a single world market. Bioregionalists are seeking to once again become ecosphere people- that is drawing their resources essentially from their home region. This in many ways, is a development of the earlier notions of individual self sufficiency, which failed because it failed to acknowledge that people are social, not individ- ual in their makeup. It is also a very legitimate response to the forces of globalisation, which are slowly destroying cultural and biological diversity arcund the world. As a further corner stone of bioregionalism, I also see the designation of core nature conserva- tion reserves. The work of Dave Foreman and the Wildlands project in north america point the way here. Within each region, the community needs to determine the core 'wilderness' reserves. Then address the areas that need to be regenerated and restored to 'wilderness' val- ues. Outside these areas there will be buffer zones where human impacts are controlled so as to be sympathetic with nature conservation. These areas will then need to be linked via corri- dors- often these areas will also need to be restored. Conservation biology shows us the size that is needed for these core reserves to be viable- there is also the added issue of global warming and climate change- we simply don't know enough to adequately model how ecosystems will respond, which means that we will have to use the precautionary principle, and err on the conservation rather than development side when designating reserves. Wilderness is put in brackets here because there is no suggestion that it should exclude Aboriginal control or ownership- it refers to regions where the dominant land use is nature conservation rather than extractive industry and land use Carrying capacity Once a community has developed an understanding of the size and boundaries of their biore- \"discussion about gion, it means that they can more adequately determine proper and sustainable land uses . for the region. The Vancouver model which outlines the 'ecological footprint' of particu- P0P\"q , aL V,, - lar lifestyles can be used to determine how much land is needed for particular lifestyles. srabilisatson IS If you have a region covering 500,000 hectares, and have designated 100,000 ha for nature difficult because the conservation and the average lifestyle consumes 4.8ha, then the carrying capacity for that parameters of what region is 8,333 people if you were to draw your resources from that region.

As it stands, and discussion about population stabilisation is difficult determine. This because the parameters of what constitutes a sustainable population is difficult to deter- model changes that mine. This model changes that debate for ever. It also places the focus on consumption as debate for ever\" opposed to population as the critical issue. It also empowers communities to make informed decisions about population growth within the region (as it is, there are legiti- mate fears that the 'developed' world will seek to impose population limits on 'develop- ing' countries, and debate often blames these latter countries for environmental destruction while ignoring the impacts of high consumption lifestyles). At some point, westerners will II:1:] b ioregionalism need to deal with the fact that they consume a totally disproportionate proportion of the world's resources. This model provides us with a tangible direction to move in. This is not to suggest that trade should or could be curtailed totally. Merely that trade should he based on ecological surpluses (ie, exported products should not permanently deplete the resources of the home region). Any attempts at sustainability would focus on reduction, reuse and recycling before the further development of any non-renewable resources. Although we are obsessed at a national level with the balance of payments, the issue of import replacement is not the subject of informed debate. A bioregional republic? Australia approaches the year 2000 with increased debate about the future direction of our country. A biorcgionalist approach would be to call for a dissolution of the state governments in favour of regional government, which would be invested with similar powers as the state governments usually hold. The federal (continental) governi except that the bioregions would function more like independent nations in that they would be far more independent in terms of eco- nomic and political structures. Local governments would evolve in neigh- bourhood/watershed councils that would deliver services at the local level. In terms of national issues- defence, human rights, trade, aid and development issues, diplomacy, national standards on education, health care, etc- this would have to be negotiated between the two levels, however, basic fundamental powers of sovereigrty would need to be assumed by the bioregional govern- ments (ie they would become more important than the federal govern- ment, which would become more like an ombudsman and secretariat than a government). More theory Going back to a bit of bioregional theory, it is worthwhile noting that thitigs are really still in their early stages. However, there are many excellent writers that will become known as the grandparents of bioregionalism- Peter Berg, Gary Snyder, Judith Plant, Kirkpatrick Sale to name a few. They, in term draw on the earlier work of those who talk of a land ethic- perhaps Aldo Leopold is the most prominent of these. Common threads of bioregionalism include the notion that we need to go back to natural boundaries in determining where we are. Bioregionalism is based on the laws of ecology- that we live on a planet of limited resources. It sees humans as part of nature rather than overlords (Aldo Leopold's concept of 'plain citizenship'). It begins with personal understanding of place; which offers amazing richness as it overcomes the lack of rootedness and alienation of our societies. This is equally useful in both western societies (where people are struggling to understand who they are) and non-western soci- eties, where many are increasing moving from traditional to western, consumer-based lifestyles. This is also something that differentiates bioregionalism from many current theories of social change- it places equal emphasis on cultural, political and personal understandings and action. Kirkpatrick Sale, a bioregionalist from the north eastern seaboard of the United States suggests that bioregionalism encourages us to \"become dwellers in the land, to relearn the laws of Gaia, to come to know the earth fully and honestly; the crucial, all encompassing task is to understand place; the immediate specific place where we live\". b ioregionalism ...continued Sale goes on to discuss what he considers are the paradigms of bioregionalism: Element Bioregional Paradigm Industrial-Scientific Paradigm Scale Region State Community Nation! World Economy Conservation Exploitation Stability Change/Progress Self-sufficiency World economy Co-operation Competition Polity Decentralised Centralised Diversity Uniformity Society Symbiosis Polarisation Evolution Growth! Violence Division Monoculture Further to this he sees that current boundaries are artificial, that smaller communities are appropriate as they are more efficient and responsible (he sees one million people in a city as being too big). He suggests that the aim of a bioregional society is to adapt to and conserve the environment rather than consume resources. Society should depend on a minimum num- ber of goods and minimum ecological disruption. The goal should be sustainability, not growth. We should move towards different ownership patterns, seeking more diversity and increased communal ownership and exchange of goods and services. He sees that trade in future will concentrate more on information exchange and less on material items as regions become more specific. A bioregional society would be decentralised (with the local community as the primary loca- tion of decision making). Decisions are more likely to be 'environmentally competent' if made at the local level and will best reflect the needs and aspirations of all people involved. The more remote the body making the decision, the greater the chances it will be inappropriate. Relationships between regions would be more likely to be based on co-operation and mutual aid because each region will essentially be independent in termsof it's needs. Australia Australia has a history of bioregional thought and development. There have been two main strands based around: a) land management, and b) personal perspectives, where people have attempted to live bioregionally in their own lifestyles. One early development was the Australian Association of Sustainable Communities (AASC) which sought to promote the idea of sustainable rural and urban communities throughout the 1970's and 80's. Barrie Griffiths, Marg McLean, Strider and Michael Petter would be names that many people familiar with this stage in BR development might recognise. AASC pub- lished 'News from Home', which published regional reports on activities around Australia. It used the main drainage basins of the continent as the defining criteria for bioregions, although this developed as time went on. It focused on land co-operatives, environmental issues, water- shed management, and was an early advocate of computer networking as a way of sharing information. AASC and Green Alliance co-ordinated regional gatherings of activists, and these two groups constitute the most organised stage of grassroots bioregional thought to date. The Manning River Bioregional Association is one of the groups in Australia that uses explicitly bioregional concepts in it's organising. Urban Ecology in the Tandanya bioregion (SA) is another. Parallel to these grassroots initiatives, there has been an interesting history of government interest as well. There have been a number of attempts to map Australia by natural criteria. An early one was the National Mapping Program that identified 233 major drainage divisions. In 1974, the CSIRO identified around 300 distinct bio-physical regions. In 1981, the Department of Home Affairs identified around 300 regions. This work is hard to find, but appears to have included cultural rather than just biological/natural data- a key component of continued on page 26 Tasmani _a \"the mountains are alive; they breathe, they feel, they give life to the people\" - a Dine elder. Seen from any direction Quamby Bluff stands out. It has a solemn air about it, and whether you see it against the backdrop of the tiers from Deloraine or from within the Jackeys Marsh valley, it has some sense of specialness about it. In any sane culture, it would be the place where young people would go to seek a vision for their adult hood. You hear stories that the local Aboriginal people used it for this, but also tales of massacres by white invaders. I feel sad that i don't know the stories, but everytime i pass i say quiet prayers of thanks for the specialness of this place. in many ways the bluff is like Mt Wellington, which sits over the Derwent estuary and Hobart. There, the mountain is always above you, even on those days when the clouds sit low on the slopes and that cold tang in the air tells you it's snowing. It has a grounding effect for me, always being reminded of it's presence, and this gives some kind of reflective angle to life. For someone who grew up on the Nillumbik plains- stringybark forests with tight creek valleys and only glimpses of distant hills (the Dandenongs), Hobart was like a crisp and lucid dream suddenly jumping into real life. In all my years and travels, i have never gotten over my first love. If bioregionalism was going to \"work\" in Australia, surely Tasmania would have to be the place it would take hold.... There is definitely more regional consciousness then in Victoria (and most other places i have been). By \"work\" i mean community-controlled local regions whose culture is reinhabi tory rather than exploita- tive, living within the parameters of what the local places offer (oh, god, no avocados!). Tasmania, being an island, has a discrete border; and it is small enough to be knowable, while still having identifi- able regions within it. Its weather comes in off the southern oceans, so there are no next door neigh- bours pumping lots of waste into their rivers or air shed, and it has large areas that are basically un- modified or substantially natural (understanding of course, that Tasmania as we know it was a product of thousands of years of interaction between the original people and their environment). It has a liv- able climate, no shortage of water, well established agriculture and income from tourism. And it is beautiful- it attracts so many people who come for a visit and find they just can't leave. And these people are often the ones who end up in the front lines: establishing sustainable businesses, co-ops, LETS schemes, political groups, and standing in front of the bulldozers. On the down side, there is certainly the entrenched values that are hasM o n the iinderstandino- that B A S S S T R A I T k.,j I C.\u00ad 6 1~\u00ad I C EddyUoo. POAnI p-A SWC.T S ( C.p. 146\" there was no one here before 1820, that hydro dams are a good thing, and that woodchipping is a bonus for the country. There is resistance to new ideas, and you can feel the stranglehold grip of the mining and pulp corporations. The manufacturing base is small, and tourism is dependent on the economic fortunes of the source-countries. Land abuse is atrocious- widespread poisoning via pesti- cides and baits, and the pervasive attitude that sees forests as woodchips on stumps and the denud- ed hills around Queenstown as a tourist attraction. But this in itself is interesting- that sharp contrast between old and new ways of seeing things. There is also that pride in being Tasmanian - a good thing, but it often expresses itself in a parochial way. Internationalism and bioregionalism should be compatible, but bullshit nationalism are too often expressions of right wing tendencies and entrenched anti environmental values. Another thing that struck me (coming from Melbourne) was continued the 'anglo ness' of Tasmania. next page INHABIT #4 / Autumn 1996 / Page 9 Another distinct opportunity for 'bioregional planning' is through regional agreements. The recent Cape York agreement, which was negotiated between Aboriginal Land Councils, envi- ronment groups, and the Cattlemen's Union, was a historic watershed for co-operative land management in Australia. Regional agreements, which are negotiated between Indigenous people and governments (and other stakeholders, as appropriate) are certain to impact strongly on the future of many parts of Australia. One of the most important aspects of these agreements is that they allow local Aboriginal people to reassert control over their traditional lands. Both the Kimberly and Cape York regions are leading the way in the development of these agreements, and are preceded by similar negotiated agreements in Canada. As they involve the widespread canvassing of the needs of local communi- ties, and are initiated and driven 'up' from the region rather than 'down' from the federal government, they represent a manifestation of bioregionalisrn at it's very best. They offer opportunities for equi- table settlements to be made between indigenous and invader cul- tures, and should be seen for the historic events they are. Ta,smania The potential is there, but the question is, how likely is it? I see many people, new settlers and long timers alike, seeking to live with the land. I see the strangle hold of the corporations and that Australian desire for exports (no matter what) that will allow us to maintain lifestyles that are simply not sustainable. I don't see much thought about import substitution or local suffi- cency. The Tasmanian voting system, of course, offers greater opportunities for green and pro- gressive people to have representation in Parliament. I see people digging in and becoming real inhabitants of the island, and strong support from progressive people around Australia. Tasmania is seeking to establish itself as a leader in 'clean and green' production. Leaving aside debate about the sustainability of exports, there is no doubt that developing this idea could be a great bonus for the state. It would need to be taken seriously, of course- at present it is little more than a clever marketing ploy, and hence fairly transparent for that. A good starting point would be to develop watershed councils that would seek to combine the various community and interest groups in each main drainage. These councils could develop long term visions for their regions and then act as 'shadow governments' within their regions, acting as both watchdog and creditable community authority. A state wide federation (that went far beyond 'environmental' issues) could start to co-ordinate long term strategies and visions. Then, bioregional congresses to ensure and fine tune co-operation between the regions.... REGIONAL AGREEMENTS There is increased interest from Australian government agencies in bioregional planning. The interim biogeographical regionalisation of Australia is a co-operative approach between state and federal government environment departments which has sought to identify natural regions as the first stage in developing a comprehensive reserve system throughout Australia. As was discussed in the last Inhabit, this represents a 'top down' approach to bioregionalism, which is generally perceived as being at odds with the philosophy- ie, that local people 'know best' and have the greatest incentive to manage their land in a sustainable manner. However, having developed a regionalisation of the continent that identified 80 distinct regions, the commonwealth has gone about fostering community participation in this form of bioregional planning. Approaches to bioregional planning The Approaches to Bioregional planning (a framework for biodiversity conserva- tion & ecological sustainabiity) conference was held in Melbourne in October/November 1995. It was hosted by the Department of Environment, Sports and Territories. The speakers and workshops were very interesting. Roger Kitching from Griffith University in Brisbane argued that scientists should also be critics and advocates rather than 'impartial' actors in planning. There was a roundtable on the federal government forest assessment processes and it's con- tribution to bioregional planning which was highly stimulating. A good opportunity to bring up the excellent work being done by the Wombat Forest Society in the Midlands forests in Central Victoria. The Australian Nature Conservation Agency had many publications available on planning and biodi- versity issues which are useful resources., including one called Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander involvement in Bioregional Planning. Victorian state government and local government representatives were conspicuous by their absence. The conference was wall-to-wall feds with very few Victorians coming to the party. Bob Pressey, National Parks and Wildlife Service, NSW talked about bioregional planning and the need to put theory into practice, saying it should take a regional perspective on the needs for conser- vation action, and that these actions should be relevant to the needs of local communities. Bioregional planning should incorporate a wide range of management approaches within each region. This sentiment seemed to resonate throughout the conference and is not the same as our definition which includes Total Catchment Management as a basic management tool. There was really no dis- cussion of the spiritual or cultural dimensions of bioregionalism and in general the ideas discussed were not as sophisticated and well developed as they could be. The venue was a very unfortunate choice- the Royal Exhibition building, which was a boring and vitality draining place. Given the theme of the conference, more thought could have gone into the location and the way it was catered, which was very traditional fare- showing the spilt between thee- ry and lifestyle that needs to be overcome if we are really to live bioregionalism. Friends of the Earth had offered to cater using regionally grown seasonal foods. For me the highlight was the talk by Terry White where he gave simple community-orientated ses- sions to formalise public monitoring of the Streamwatch program. This emphasis on community involvement was not followed up enough in other sessions. Perhaps a variety of different conferences or catchment-based conferences or groupings would have been better. Once again, we need to not just talk about bioregionalism, we need to operate in a way that is bioregional. While it was excellent that the federal government funded the conference, it needs to be said that the conference itself man- aged to make an exciting topic boring. Karri Giles Marine and coastal biodiversity protection and management - the potential for biosphere reserves Introduction Coastal and marine areas are amongst the most heavily populated and exploited ecosystems on Earth. In Australia, there has been a large number of inquiries into the state of the coast, yet concern persists over the future. Such concerns include the lack of knowledge about the coast and the lack of knowl- edge about the consequences of resource use decisions. Greater integration in decision making has always been put forward as one of the solutions, as have more research, monitoring and community participation. However, governments have struggled with the challenge of achieving integration for a variety of I - INHABIT #4 / Autumn 1996 / Faqe 11l reasons, one of the most honest being the sheer complexity of making decisions in Biosphere an arena of multiple and conflicting expectations, needs and uses. The expectations of the community include rertainty of outcomes in a world which they believe is predictable and contrcliable. Such expectations collide with Re s e rire s the real world of variability and uncertainty. Why the biosphere approach? co nt \u00b1 nue d The Drotection and manaeement of biodiversitv involves more than the setting aside of a representative sample of protected areas. Off-park biodiversity manage- ment is probably more critical than the protected areas due to a number of reasons: Parks cannot expect to sample all of the species diversity (including genetic variations). the opportunities for setting aside whole ecosystems in an undisturbed state are very few. Interactions between the off-park area and the park are significant, particularly in many marine areas. Thus, the challenge for those interested in the management and protection of biodiversity is to ensure that human use of the environment is conducted in a way that is sustainable in the long term. One issue that those who want to manage human use ir. the context of biodiversity have to contend with is having a reference by which to manage and interpret change. The Man and Biosphere (MAB) Program(sic) was established in 1971 because of the emerg- ing need to understand and manage the changes ansirg from the use of natural resources. Indeed it was the approach of combining a multiple-use/multiple function role under a sin- gle framework that separated the Biosphere Reserve from other types of protected areas. The MAB Program explicitly incorporates humans into the ecosystem and provides for pro- tection, use and restoration of the environment. The MAB program also focuses strongly on scientific research and training so that the results of monitoring human use can be factored back into management methods. This adap- tive approach is increasingly being viewed as the only way of dealing with an environment that is more complex than we can ever understand and for which we do not have all the answers in terms of managing use in a sustainable manner. The program is also co-operative in nature and, where utilised properly, involves local com- munities by integrating their needs with the services and skills of scientists and managers. Features of a Biosphere Reserve Three roles have been put forward for Biosphere reserves, namely: Conservation The primary purpose of this role is to provide a reference area against which the effects of different usages can be assessed. Logistic The primary purpose of this role is to provide research and monitoring facilities so that information can not only be input to the decision making process but exchanged world wide via the network of Biosphere Reserves sites. Development The development zones are those which are evaluated with reference to the core and in which ecological sustainability is pursued. These areas are currently undeveloped or, more likely, existing use areas in which modifications to use may occur as a result of scientific feedback. The Biosphere Reserve approach makes use of a variety of tools, the most notable is that of zoning. The types of zones that have been put forward in the MAB literature in the past have included: The Core - the conservation/preservation area. Restoration - the area which is in need of repair and the core or other use areas are a refer- ence. Buffer zone - areas in which sustainable use occurs. However the Biosphere Reserve concept was developec by terrestrial ecologists and much work has been conducted in recent years in adapting it to coastal and marine areas. One variation on the terrestrial theme has been to design in multiple cores areas and to embed FINHABIT #4 / Autumn 1996 / Page 12 them in a 'sea' of zoned usages of varying intensities. Has the Biosphere Reserve approach worked? Some Biosphere Reserves are nearly 20 years old and the literature that evaluates their value is over 10 years old. One of the early criticisms of the first round of Biosphere Reserve declarations was that they were totally or almost totally synomous with protected areas. Thus the central value of a Biosphere Reserve, that of assessing use in relation to the core(s) was foregone. Biosphere Reserves continued Other criticisms that have been put forward in the past include: Lack of a statutory basis Statutory mechanisms for integrating decision making are rare and the evidence suggests that the leg- islation that Parks and Wildlife agencies have used to declare Biosphere Reserves has been inade- quate for dealing with multiple use management. Rather than make such modifications it would be more appropriate to have legislation that integrates the planning and management of a protected area (or areas) into the surrounding landscape. Lack of scientific evaluation Scientific assessments and monitoring can be expensive and, especially in Reserves which have no usage component, there is little opportunity for manipulative experimentation and no incentives for information exchange with surrounding land usages. Lack of adaptive management (keeping the status quo) One aim of biosphere Reserves is to put Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management into practise by feeding the results of monitoring programs back to decision makers so that progress towards goals or with reference to standards can be evaluated and, if necessary, changes to usage patterns initiated. Inability to deal with economic factors there are documented cases where economic factors, driven by land use, have resulted in unintended consequences. The clear message from this experience is that economic forces not only have to be understood but utilised to ensure that conservation and sustainability outcomes do not get distorted. Not involving the community Protected areas commonly have a poor reputation amongst rural communities due to perceptions of the autocratic management and 'fence out' approach of parks management agencies. It can be argued that if the boundaries of a reserve are enlarged so that the people are included and the core area is seen as a resource then this situation could be addressed (with the pot ential for obvious conservation implications, which would need to be asssed- ed). None of the above criticisms create insurmountable problems. Indeed, it would have been surprising if the Biosphere Reserve approach had worked perfectly first time. Has the Biosphere Reserve approach been used in Australia before? As of 1983, there were 12 Biosphere Reserves in Australia, 6 of which are located in coastal areas, such as the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Macquaries Island Nature Reserves. In common with the international experience the majority of Australia's Biosphere Reserves have boundaries which are the same as the National Park (or similar protected area) they are centred on. ie, there has been a focus on the conservation role at the expense of the logistic and development roles. ironically, the area where the philosophy and practises of Biosphere Reserves has been put into prac- tise in a marine/coastal area is the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) which is not itself a Biosphere Reserve. The GBRMP has the following attributes: It manages a whole (or very substantial part) of an ecosystem. It has legislation that it is integrative in nature and has objectives that specify conservation and sus- tainable use. It employs a zoning system that utilises core zones surrounded by nodes of varying usage pres- sures. It has human activities inside the park and the people are active participants in the management process. It employs adaptive management techniques that provide direct tests of management decisions. Although there are threats to the GBR that are beyond the reach of the legislation that drives the \\bIT #4/Autumn 1996 / Page from the foothills SOME NOTES ON THE JAITMATHANG TRIBE - BOUNDARIES P. D. Gardner * The Jaitmathang tribe, also known as the Kandangoramittung and the Onieo tribe, occupied a region in the Australian Alps [now in the state of Victoria] for many hundreds of years. As far as I am aware no studies have been made to determine accurate- ly the age of occupation of this region but Josephine Hood's studies of high country shelters in the ACT give estimates of about 3000 years compared with the lower altitude, but much nearer, sites at Buchan and New Guinea cave on the Snowy Riv- er with estimates of about 18000 years. Future discovcncs will probably push Flood's estimates hack, and thus also the period of Aboriginal occupation and exploitation of the high country. This question of occupation of the alpine / sub-alpine region is further complicated by major climatic changes within the time scale considered. According to the boundaries outlined by Tindale the Jaitmathang tribe, along with the neighboring Minjambuta, (Mt. l3uffalo) al- most solely occupied alpine /sub-alpinc country. The Omeo tribe have been most commonly thought of as representing the moun- tain Aborigines of Victoria. It should he noted that although the Jaitmathang and Minjambuta can basically be considered moun- taiii tribes there were a further eight tribes who claimed moun- tain tcrntory and had access to both high plains and peaks. The Jaitmathang country included the high country of Cobun- gra, Mt. Hotham and the Bogong high Plains to Mt. Stawell and Tongio on the lambo river in the south, across to Mt. Tambo and Limestone Creek in the east and Tom Groggin on the mdi in the north-east and included the present day towns of Tawanga and Mitta Mitta on its northern extremities. The Jaitmathang country adjoined the l)uduroa and Djilamatang tribes to the north, the Ngarigo to the cast, the Brabiralung to the south and the Minjambuta to the west. The notion of fixed and rigid geographic boundaries appears to he a European conception that is probably not so easily applied to the prc-European era. In eastern Victoria it seems that the boundaries often overlapped, and there is also one possible in- stance of the opposite - a 'no-mans land' which was basically un- occupied and unclaimed. The boundaries between allied and re- lated tribes (language and cultural links as well as agreed common ancestry) appear to have been the more clearly defined and approximate the European idea. However the political boun- daries between allies and relations often did not apply to the movements of small groups and individuals. This rather fluid definition of a boundary was often of little relevance when laws granted special access and rights to neighboring tribes. This seems to be especially so with regards food laws. Flowin gives a good example of this in Gippsland when he described how the l3rahiralung tribal members [whose claimed territory went from Mt. Ilotham to the Gippsland I..akes] as having sole rights to the swan's eggs on Raymond Island, even though the island itself was part of the Tatungalung tribe's territory. The salient point be- ing that the two tribes were closely related - culturally, ancestral- ly and linguistically. Such types of food laws that transgressed political boundaries probably originated out of a climate of abundance. Almost certainly similar righLs of access after partic- ular foods existed within the Jaitmathang territory although as far as I am aware none has been recorded. Almost certainly the Duduroa and possibly other Upper Murray tribes had access to Bogong moths in specific parts of Jaitmathang territory as well as probably harvesting the moths co-operatively with them. The Bogong moths were seasonally abundant and harvested from the crevices of granite boulders in the high country. Early European observers were obviously intrigued by this unusual example of insectivorous man and some made written references to the various aspects of gathering and cooking. As the Omeo Plains appears to have been one of the main congregating points both prior to, and during, the moth season the practice has con- sequently been closely associated with the Jaitmathang. Flood and others have noted that a number of other tribes in Victoria had access to the high country requisite for moth harvesting and probably also were moth hunters. But perhaps the most interest- ing aspect of the moth season was the large numbers of Aborigi. nals observed on the Omeo Plains with estimates as high as one thousand along the upper reaches of the Mitta Mitta River. These figures indicate a seasonal movement of associated tribes and allies into Jaitmathang territory. 'l'hey also suggest co- operation in moth gathering and common camping places. Whilst the moth season tends to show that borders as we under- stand them were almost non-existent between friendly and relat- ed tribes, all group and individual activities were probably closely governed and directed by custom. To the south the Jaitmathang were in complete enmity with the Brabiralung tribe. Common sense seems to suggest that the bor- ders in the Upper Tambo Valley were overlapping and that each tribe may have had as many three different boundaries - histor- ic, geographic and actual. Assuming that in 1835 the l3rahira- lung were at the end of a period of expansion, the Tongio boun- darv may have been both their historical and actual one. Their geographic boundary would have included the hcadwatcrs of the Tambo and all the country south of the Great Dividing range. The Jaitmathang boundaries were the actual at Tongio, a geo- graphic boundary which topography would suggest ran along the Angora and Fainting Ranges to the south and a historical one of no known location but just possibly beyond the geographic one to include the Tambo Crossing country. It is clear that some boundaries defined by Tindale are wrong. When all the addition- al complications above are taken into account and the fact that even the definition and usage of the word tribe is very loose both in its historical and contemporary contexts, then it can be seen that the boundanes drawn by academics and others are useful as guides only rather than being definitive or the \"correct\" or \"last\" word.

Community Shared Agriculture (CSA) is a way of feeding people that allows both growers and con- sumers to share in the many responsibilities of growing food. In CSA, farmers grow food for a pre- determined group of consumers (guaranteed market). CSA is a way consumers have personal contact with the grower of their food. Unlike a farmer's market or U-pick operators, consumers usually enter an agreement (e.g. money in exchange for produce) with a grower before the season begins. Such a relationship ensures consumers of high quality, nutritious and fresh food, while ensuring growers of a fair and stable income(e.g. pre-payment at retail prices). Both farmers and consumers share responsibility for the success and failure of crops, th natural weath- er cycles that produce \"good\" years and \"bad\" years. They share the responsibility for cultivating good quality food year after year, generation upon generation. The responsibility for sharing a farmer's financial investment seen, equipment and soil preparation. The responsibility for ensuring a decent standard of living and working conditions for the farm workers. CSA is a way for people to experience directly how their food is grown - \"putting culture back into agri- community shared agriculture cont'd culture\". CSA is a way for people to re-establish a social community around food - a mutually beneficial partnership of urban and rural. Locally-based food production reduces the need to transport long distances. By keeping money in the community, CSA supports the local family farmer and the local economy. It also enables individuals to participate in the marketing and distribution of food. CSA fits in well with bioregionalism because it demands that local resources - human, social, natural and economic - be used. It brings out a celebration of food produced and experienced more intimately by it's eaters. The prepayment arrangement is a trust and community building idea in practise that can expand to other areas than just food. How does it work? CSA has many different forms. Basic to all, is the farmer and a consumer group. In most cases, a consumer purchases a \"share\" of the harvest through pre-season payment, and is commonly referred to as a \"sharer\". A \"share\" can be equivalent to a weekly supply os vegetables for a family of four during the growing season (mid-Jime to mid-October for southern Ontario Canada) and root storage crops during winter (e.g. onions, potatoes, carrots, etc.). Half-shares are usually available. Many CSA farms have expanded from vegetables to include fruit, berries, eggs, and meat. The pre-season payment helps the farmer with the high cost during spring start- up. An average share in Canada is $400 for a seasons worth of veggies. A CSA can be initiated by either a group of consumers finding a willing farmer / gardener and a piece of arable land or an existing farmer offering shares to prospective consumers. The size of CSA projects range from a few families to several hundred. Once a formal relationship is established (i.e. through contract, incorporation), pick-up and delivery systems and the extent of consumer participation are worked out. Most CSA projects combine a regular pick-up at the farm and delivery to an in-town depot. Most CSA projects have some way that shares can help out (e.g. \"work days\"). CSA Farms CSA is a relatively new idea in Ontario and Canada, but has been around in various forms in Japan and Europe for several decades. The number of CSA farms in the US is now over 300. In the Canadian Prairies, there are 22 farms in Quebec and the Maritirnes.

After more than two centuries of invasion, dislocation, attempts to recre- ate Australia in the image of our original homelands, and long attempts to define what it means to be 'Australian', we are finally seeing the emer- gence of a culture that actually reflects what it means to live on this conti- nent. Australians have made many attempts to define a continental-wide nationalism, through the arts, culture and politics, but this has usually fallen short of the mark, partly because it has attempted to make a defini- tion that speaks for all the differing parts of the land. Australia is com- posed of radically varying ecosystems, and hence agriculture and human societies, from tropical grasslands to the glaciated mountains of central Tasmania. Any real attempts to define ourselves needs to acknowledge that we are residents in a distinct part of the continent. New myths need to be formed beyond those that reflect the 'outback' nature of our psyche. Most Australians live within 100 kilometres of the ocean along the wetter east- ern seaboard and green southern triangle of West Australia. Yet we con- sume resources as if we had a vast green and productive hinterland. Fundamental to this understanding of ourselves is the need to acknowl- edge whose land we stand on. No Aboriginal group ever ceded their lands via treaty, yet non-Aboriginal Australia lives without acknowledg- ing this fact. So, this is the first step- to research, comprehend and embrace the history that has brought us to where we are now. The next stage is to join with Aboriginal people to solve the problems that still exist and finally resolve the history of dishonour that we carry with us. Then we need to understand where we are- on a continent in the middle southern latitudes; an old continent that carries the remnants of ancient systems and lifeforms. In particular, we live in particular parts of the con- tinent within a broader pattern of systems that change as you move north or south, east or west. This is where the idea of mapping becomes funda- mental to where we are.... maps and boundaries become a tool to allow us to make sense of our discoveries as we learn the stories of our place The following represents some starting points for defining place and boundaries to those places.......

Watersheds can change the way we look at a region. A cursory glance at Spencer Gulf (SA) usually makes the Eyre Peninsula stand out. But if you look at the catchments, the perception of that region changes- and the focus becomes the gulf and Lake Torrens basin to the north- after all, the gulf is part of a drowned river system and the ocean has a moderating influence on the climate of adjacent land.

Climatic change meant changes in dividing features and sometimes loss or regaining of traditional lands (what is now Port Phillip Bay was rich hunting lands when higher mountains were covered in ice sheets. There were times when the You Yang ranges, now on the plains north east of Geelong, were surrounded by a shallow sea). To have survived and flourished for so long, First Nation boundaries are obviously important reflections of ecological realities. ( \\ ri vn i.- I The South East corner: the Bogong Eco region.

There are many definitions of what constitutes a bioregion: a simp'e Ofle mighi be a defined by it's lifeforms or life territory as opposed to human imposed legislative boundaries\" Bioregionalism seeks to provide a world view that allows us to fully live in our place and to acknowledge that we live on a planet that is composed of thousands of inter related but dis- tinct and definable regions. Defining place A number of bioregional thinkers have suggested criteria that might be useful in defining our home place. Kirkpatrick Sale (New York): He sees three levels of 'natural' organisation- the largest is the ecoregion, and these constitute large natural regions such as an extensive mountain range or huge grassland. One example in Australia would be the south eastern cor- ner, from Melbourne up towards Canberra. the next level down is the georegion (or biome). A georegion is a particular plain, valley or mountain range. A biome is a large, well defined ecological community such as Victoria's basalt grasslands. Biomes and georegions are made up of a series of bioregions. In some instances, a bioregion may straddle a biome/georegion boundary (see map below). the third unit is the bioregion. These tend to be catchment based. The Melbourne example might be the Yarra bioregion. It is perhaps at this level that we should be aiming for regional economic and political self sufficiency. Jim Dodge (north California/Shasta bioregion): biotic shift. This is the percentage change of fauna and flora species from one region to another. Where the percentage difference rises over a certain point, it can be assumed that the regions are fundamentally different. watershed landform- geological patterns and corresponding soil and climate types. Geographic regions sometimes also need to be broken up into regions to make more sense. For example, while the Great Dividing range is a continuous range of hills from western Victoria to northern Queensland it is composed of a number of discrete and identifiable geographic regions. spirit places - what aspects of the region would affect the development of a place-centred spirituality elevation Doug Aberley (British Columbia): boundaries of Indigenous peoples historic political boundaries- these chart the ebb and flow of colonial expansion and then the stages in the development of cities, agricultural areas, etc. current political divisions watersheds physiographic regions climate biomes current land uses An excellent The definition will depend on what size is \"knowable\" to someone who lives there- ie, we will reference for instinctively know when the region we are defining is too large. bioregional map- Gene Marshall: ping is He sees a series of smaller regions that fit into ever larger ones, giving a sense of how the Boundaries of entire planet is ultimately connected.

The Bays, swamps, creeks and Yarra River have yielded fish as a staple for generations, and now the multi-million dollar fishing industry and recreational fishing supplies fish to thousands of people, both here and over- seas. Fish is a good staple food to eat in the Yarra Yarra bioregion. Fish and eel traps and fishing at night with a little fire on the canoe has been widely practiced by Aboriginal people in Victoria. It is good to eat fish but which fish caught by whom? where? how? We want to eat fish from a sustainable fishery. I am gather - ing people who are interested in helping put together a 'sustainable' fish eating guide. It is the governments job to regulate fisheries and it is a failure of government that they have not done so adequately. Recreational fishers threaten politicians ( Mr Coleman, the previous Minister for Conservation and Natural Resources was threatened by this lobby) who may monitor and regulate adequately. Although maintaining staple foods may be seen as an important priority to taxpayers; com- pared to transportation, for example, the amount of taxes used by the fisheries department is very small, and they no longer have any scientists on the payroll. They have not been effective due to bullying, lack of resources and self interest, as much of fisheries income is derived from license fees. Because most fish have a high level of fecundity and a small number of adults can have hundreds of young, overfishing is not the only or indeed main threat in many fisheries. Influences that interfere with the reproductive cycle of the animal including; habitat destruction or introduced predators such as carp threaten fish the most. Carp is an introduced fish which is a big relative of the goldfish. Very few are eaten as they are generally disliked. Carp eat the eggs, young and main food source of shrimp and other fish. They are abundant, and a serious pest. They are also a source of nutrients, as at least one operator realises. There is a commer- cial operation out of Wentworth, in the Darling river- orange growing region, that uses electro- harvesting to stun fish; which then float to the surface, allowing the carp to be select- ed, mixed with orange rind, (a waste product from the local industry), and composted. The Murray Darling Association have initiated a interim Task Force on Carp. It has been set up with representatives from all affected states including Tasmania. This will recommend long term funding for sup- port for initiatives that reduce carp numbers; such as the Wentworth operation and an initiative to use Carp as cray fish bait. It will also recommend research monies for CSIRO who are asking questions such as: how many times can you stun a Murray Cod safely? And, at certain times of day am I likely to find carp alone and not native fish? Eels are the ideal staple food fish for consumption in the Yarra Yarra hinretirrn Thv J-------- ----- ---------....-, Victoria but not in the north flowing Murray -Goulburn catchment. They are abundant and easy to catch. The eel cannot be propagated artificially. Eels only spawn in the coral sea, then the little glass eels float down on the currents and swim up the creeks along the NSW and Victorian coastline, but never as far west as the Murray. At present almost none of the commercial eel catch in Victoria is eaten here. It is exported. Eels are worth $80 per kilo in Germany. Nineteen men have licenses for fish nets in specific south flowing creeks in Victoria. The Framlingham Aboriginal community also has a license for their creek, for their purposes. Eel are rich in oil and need to be cooked in a way that drains off the oil. Slow cooking on a fire outside is recommended. Fish rich in oil are high in vitamin D, which is very good in a cold climate. Try one this winter!

Rather, it presents an environmental threat which was unknown at the time when the legislation was promulgated and which requires a management solution. Indeed the management approach of the GBRMPA (Park Authority) has been one of Australia's most successful exports and advocated by marine management experts, international conservation organisations and some industry groups alike. Probably the greatest threat to the marine Park Authority is the tall poppy syndrome. Although marine and particularly fisheries management has been criticised of late as being too narrow there are indica- tions that a much broader view is rapidly developing, many fisheries (particularly Commonwealth fisheries) have been managed on a regional basis such as South East Trawl and the Gulf of Carpentaria Prawn Trawl Fishery and it could be argued that the species assemblages targeted by these fisheries have defined the ecosystem of interest. The Large Marine Ecosystem concept has evolved to enlarge the ecosystem components of interest to the management process to include non-target species whether they are of economic interest or not. Such an integrated approach is a stark contrast with the highly species specific management interventions that are marking the rite of passage for some fishery managers into the world of ecosystem management. the North West shelf a long term Adaptive Management experiment is under way to evaluate the effects of demersal trawis and to devise trawl harvest strategies that protect ecosystem integrity. This project involves studying the effects of different trawl strategies that protect ecosystem integrity. This project involves studying the effects of different trawl strategies on target and non-target species. Such a 'real world' and large scale experiment is vital to decision making about sustainable resource use and embodies the main thrust of biosphere reserve management. Conclusion The coastal and marine. as of Australia are under pressure and demands for better management are an almost daily occurrence. Despite numerous calls for integrated decision making the current system is characterised by its static nature that is both resistant to change and bogged down in bureaucratic turf protection. Delivered at the National Conference on Approaches to Bioregional Planning held in Melbourne, Oct/Nov 1995. Duncan Ledbitter, Executive Director, Ocean Watch, P0 Box 247, Pyrmont, NSW, 2009 introduction to bioregionalism continued from page 8 bioregional thinking. At the present time we are seeing the development of regional terminology under the Better Cities program but there are no set criteria for determining regions and the driving force is mainly development rather than sustainability. At the present time, we have seen an excellent program called the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia (IBRA), which has been co-ordinated by the Federal Environment Department (DEST). The IBRA process, linked to the National Reserve System Conservation Program (NRSCP), is part of a three stage program, which has identified natural regions, then determined what percentage of each region is protected in nature reserves, and is now making recommendations about what areas should no be included in the reserve system. The IBRA program has identified 80 regions, based on biomes; these constitute geomorphic units that include climate' soil and vegetation. It originally used a definition of bioregions that included cultural considerations: \"areas of land and/or water whose limits are defined not by political boundaries but by geographical distribution of biophysical attributes, ecological systems and human communities\". Other recent developments include a federal House of Representatives Standing Committee on Australia's carrying capacity and long term strategies. In October 1995, DEST hosted a conference on bioregional planning. There are now state-based catchment management structures in place, such as the Catchment and Land Protection Legislation in Victoria. The move towards regional agreements between stakeholders (such as the recently announced Cape York agreement) heralds a remarkable confluence of government jurisdiction and grassroots concern, and is going to be the main way forward for most of Australia in providing practical ways of developing bioregional control over the next decade or so.

Questions about the Natural Heritage Trust National Weeds Strategy National Feral Animal Control Strategy Property Management Planning Coasts and Clean Seas The Natural Hcritae Trust (NHT), promised as a result of the Teistra sell-off, is a complicated tangle of funding arrangements including commu- nity grants, partnership arrangements and Commonwealth grants. As the first round of funding decisions near comple- tion some questions can be answered, but many remain. How much money? $1.25 billion over five years (varying in scale with $177m this year and $357m in 1999/2000). What will NSW get? This is still unclear. Onl y Tasmania was guaranteed a minimum sum. AllNational Vegetation Initiative states will bid under the various pro- Farm Forestry grams funded by NHT (see table). As a Murray-Darling 2001 rough guide NSW has received 25% of Jjional Rivercare Initiative federal funds in past years. How is NHT different from Wetlands Program Tasmanian Remediation normal Government programs? The NHT has allowed greater sums National System of Reserves to be put into largely established Endangered Species Program programs. The key difference is that this Notional landcore Program money is guaranteed and not subject to -' National Land & Water Auuit annual budget squabbles. However, core funded services may be cut\u2014leaving an emaciated environment budget as the real legacy of the NHT. What is a regional strategy? It is intended that most of the NHT will be allocated in accordance with regional strategies. Regional strategies are to be developed and implemented by Regional Organisations (ROs). Regional strategies are a few years away but prototypes already being developed include catchment management strate- gies, land and water management plans and estuary management plans. What is a regional organisation? ROs may be a \"regional statutory body, formalised consortia based on State/Territory agencies, or a consortia of local government or other responsible organisations\". In NSW, three pilot ROs were created in 1997: a collection of councils, a Catchment Management Trust, and a Catchment Management Committee (with expanded member- ship). ROs will need to endorse the regional strategies. The shape of the final Australian State of the Environment Report which listed loss of biological diversity as \"perhaps our most serious problem\". The ecological impact of cities, the poor shape of inland waters, soil erosion, salinisation, logging of old growth and the patchy reserve system were other top priorities. Other funding programs have been criticised for their lack of focus on conserving biodiversity and little demon- strable improvement 'on the ground'. Landcare, for example, ha claimed success based on 30% far er participa- tion when it appears th:'ly a fifth of these landholders are a v implement- ing new conservation t iues. Properly focused StatL i National guidelines, pruarcd with input from the environmen \\'ement, will be essential to the achie cm of bi versity and conservation outcomes. . ,e Common- wealth's attitude to compliance with such guidelines remains unknown. Will it refuse to fund a state permitting large scale native vegetation clearance when protecting native vegetation is a priority issue? Will the criteria established in the guidelines be linked with State of the Environment Reporting and reflect Commonwealth and International legislation, conventions and policies? Meaningful and properly enforced guidelines need to underpin the NHT expenditure. Balanced environmental representation on assessment panels and ROs will also be essential to the delivery of best outcomes. The NHT is an emerging vision. The final vision depends on the resolution of many of the above questions. The critical issue is the degree to which regional organisations and strategies will advance nature conservation. The NHT could be pivotal in shifting communities and institutions towards ecological sustainability. It could also be a cynical political exercise, achieving the degrading of core government environmental responsibilities whilst propping up unsustainable land uses. John Connor, Executive Officer, Nature Conservation Council ROs for NS\\V is still tinder review. How will our application be assessed? Projects are first assessed by a panel in a region or catchinent who prioritise projects after assessing whether they contribute to a catchment or regional strategy and meet state guidelines.

The recommendations of regional panels are then reviewed by a State Assessment Panel (SAP) according to state and national guidelines. The Commonwealth Ministers for the Environment and Primary Industries make the final decision. Will the NHT achieve biodiversity and conservation outcomes? The priorities under this program compare poorly with those in the 1996 6 Winter 1997 Environment NSW I I The NHT and '-- the NSW Environment For the NSW environment to actually benefit from the Natural Heritage Trust the Commonwealth and NSW Gos'- ernments must resist the tempta- tion to shift core programs into this temporary funding bonus. They will also need to improve on the 1997/98 transitional arrange- ments in the following key areas: Assessment Panels Protecting our Rivers, Coasts and Oceans:NCC Seminar Series NSW responded to complaints about a lack of balance on similar panels under Landcare and other programs and allowed some extra environmental representation. This must continue but also ensure that catchment management committees which have membership biases towards primary producers either have a balance or do not make assessments. Regional Organisations Similarly, ROs will need balanced membership. NSW is currently reviewing the Total Catchment Management Act and this may result in major changes. Regional Strategies Prototype strategies have already been developed by catch- ment management or other committees dominated by landholders. There will need to be a mechanism to ensure ecological sustainability, including biodiver- sity conservation, is the basis for these strategies. National v State Guidelines One key mechanism will be the devekpment of a set of guidelines that will be agreed by the Com- monwealth and NSW Govern- ments later this year. These guidelines will need to express clear biodiversity and conservation outcomes and must be prepared with input from the environment movement. After decades of reports, inquiries and inactior, a new range of tools is emerging to protect our rivers, coast; and oceans. The Nature Conservation Council, in assoction with the National Parks Associatior and the Marine and Coastal Commurty Network, is conducting a regional seminar series on how to best use these tools. Marine Parks As Tim Anderson reports on page 3, the NS\\V Government has now created the legislative stricture to protect marine areas. The failings of this legislation increase the need or the environment movement to vigc rously participate in the development of marine parks to provide adequate sanctuary and habitat protection zones. NSW Coastal Policy After much de:ay, the NSW Goverr.- ment is close to releasing a Coastal Policy. The value of the policy will be tested by its perfermance in a number of priority areas. Wi .1 it initiate an environ- mental inventory of sensitive coastal Sites? Will it protect the whole coast? Will it include protection of wetlands? Will it ban mining in environmentally sensitive sites? Will it provide for an independent Coastal Council? The role of the Coastal Coincil will be critical ii determining wietier this is a plan of action or more cii pty promises. The Chair of the Coastal Committee will be addressing each 0: the seminar series. NSW River Objectives The NSW Goverrmcnt will also shortly release its Water Reform Package which will include interim river flow and water quality objectiies, and a program to begin long overdue reform of water resource management. The reforms are :o address coastal rivers, as well as groundwater and inland rivers. Commonwealth Ocean Policy During 1997/98 tle Commonwealth will he developing its Ocean Policy to guide the management of Australia s immense marine jurisdiction (over 11 million square kms).

H April I May '97 A stroke oft/ic p m by John O'Brien Just towards the end of March an incident occurred in Nimbin which, like many I suppose, will not have been re- ported by the establishment media. It was after all, just a small popular uprising and could hardly have competed with such gripping stories as the old woman's house burning down or the twins born to a couple in Casino. Any popular uprising in this country is important if only be- causc there are so few of them, its catalyst was the same as all the others throughout history - brutal and autocratic enftrce- ment, by the authorities, of an unpopular law. Two people, resi- dents of some years standing, had been arrested and taken to be charged with drug related offences. They had allegedly been smoking a prohibited substance, or as we know it, pot. Now the police are in a tricky situa- Lion here. Their sworn duty is to uphold the law, it is not their task to assess the merits of any particular law and act ac- cordingly. If they see an offence being committed they must carry out their func- tion or invoke complicity. At the same time they know that their actions will in- crease the level of ill feeling towards them from a lar ge section of the community, making their task that little bit harder. So the police can't be blamed for injustice, nevertheless the people saw them as the upholders of draconian legislation and as- sembled outside the police station to voice their displeasure. The mob was not unruly or threaten- ing, they sat peacefully out on the foot- path and raised their 'weapons'\u2014 small Holy Smoke? - white paper cylinders. At a signal from the megaphone wielding co-ordinator the fires of insurrection were lit and the paper cylinders were burnt in ceremonial fash- ion, including sucking on the end of them to keep them alight. The police were repeatedly invited to join the proceedings but, not surprisingly, they stayed \"i\\fter scratch- inside the station. Perhaps they were too busy with the paper- ing its ear the work generated by the two pre- vious arrests to overly concern mano'y dog themselves with the thirty or b so violations of the criminal that is this code occurring out the front of the building.

Thieves may steal through need or com- pulsion but always with the knowledge that they are doing wrong. A pot\u2014head will pick a few sprigs to chop up with less an air of skulduggery then their mother pick- ing mint for the Sunday roast. Apart from cases of mental dys- function everybody knows what the real crimes are. They were recognised as crimes long before Moses, even before humanity had discovered writing, by every disparate culture throughout the globe. Beyond these few basic commandments lies the realm of governmental convenience. The laws here are not written in stone, they are created, moulded and cast aside as the evolution of society dictates, by legislators who represent the interests of the country or region they inhabit. Some of these laws are just and some not but all of them exist only for a time without amend- ment. A person's freedom to smoke marijuana is a human rights issue, they are harming no\u2014one (I accept they may be doing themselves no good but only to the extent of smoking any plant material, prohibited or not). Sooner or later the lawmakers ac- cept that a particular statute has become inconvenient and modify it. The Nimbin annual hemp festival is a lot of fun. The town comes alive with music and colour and the kids spend a few days in fairyland. The serious side is that it is the single biggest show of public support for national drug law reform. In years to come it will be looked upon as a big contributing factor to the formalisation of fair and rational drug legislation. Nimbin Nec ons of the weed. That's a very conserva- tive estimate yet it yields us nine hundred thousand criminals, nearly the population of the capital city. of West- ern Australia. All these people could be restored to decent citizenry at the stroke of a pen. Only the Judicial System (and Microsoft\u00ae) can afford to lose this many customers. It can be argued that this would he the case if murder or theft was made legal but not effectively, as here is obviously a dif- ferent class of action. Two important con- ditions for any crime are the persons rec- ognition that an action is wrong and the intention to cariy out such an act even with this knowledge. Even the most callous The future will be the judge '\\LA\\ A Short history of the Mardi Grass IN. from the Nimbin HEMP Embassy's *Iiles Nimbin is host to the most unique grass roots festival held in Australia - our annual . \"Let It Grow!\" Mardi Grass, the classic underground drug law reform rally and fiesta del 7' locoweed held each year on and around the first weekend in May 1997 will be the 5th Annual Mardi Grass. Like many things revolutionary, the Mardi Grass had humble beginnings. In March 1993 the Police made yet another raid on the town dealers. This time. after one put up a bit of a fight, the local, predominantly young street people followed the police back to S0the station and there unleashed a torrent of frustration, rotten tomatoes, eggs and toilet paper. The Nearly NORML Nimbin group (which later became Nimbin HEMP - He/p End Marijuana Prohibition which good and that the time was ripe to channel the increasing discontent into a fun, celebratory and non-provocative form of political action. The \"Let It Grow!\" May Day Rally, and street parade was conceived as an opportunity for everyone to come together in a combined strength and peacefully, responsibly indicate their opinions about the drug laws and their impact on society. Despite the refusal of permission by the local council the Rally was planned to be held on Saturday, May 1st 1993. At 1:00 pm, it took off up Cullen St from the Bush Theatre car park. By the time the parade hit the CBD of Nimbin the numbers had swollen to well over 1000. The ecstatic crowd assembled at the Hall for the Let It Grow! People's Summit on Prohibition. The Plantem made his first known public appearance and distributed joints to the crowd. David Heilpem made rousing sense about the ridiculously unjust nature of the legal situation as pertains to cannabis. Many other speakers contributed considered insights into the evils of the drug laws and the overall feeling that day was one of ultimate empowerment and heady optimism. The feeling prevailed that together we could do something to change these laws that hang over so many lives as a helicopter of paranoia. The Rally determined to hold a further Mardi Grass each year until the repeal of prohibition. The National Aboriginal Flag flew in the park all day and has flown there throughout all subsequent Mardi Grasses. 1994 included the Beyond Prohibition conference with speakers such as Dr. Alex Wodak, Prof. Paul Wilson, Tina Van Raay and Richard Jones MLC participating. Also from that conference came the stirring of a coalition of Hemp groups on an Australia wide basis. That year the Mardi .. Grass street party on Sunday May 1st (again refused permission by council) established itself as an occasion of pure Nimbin culture, the town alive with colour, green 'Let It Grow!\" helium balloons, Pot Art 2, Cafe Cabaret and The Nimbin Hemp Harvest Festival Ball Ed Rosenthal flew out from America and it was a wild, free and unapologetic occasion. The attendance of the crowd for the march and rally (addressed by Andrew Katelaris) had grown this . year- to well over 3000 people. i q 1995 and for the first time the 1St of May didn't fall on the weekend. We'd just been involved in running two separate state election campaigns and with only a little over a month to go we had to pull together a festival that by now was going to happen whether we created it or not. Co-operation with the police was working well. Despite our lack of official Council approval (we hadn't even bothered applying this year), the local cops' calm approach and cooperation towards maintaining a smooth flow of the 7000-odd people who attended town for the Parade was a credit to them and the Jungle Patrol. The police were impressed with the overall co-operative behaviour and peacefulness of the crowd ('That's pot for you\" we said, and the police agreed). The Mardi Grass was also becoming an important date on the drug law reform calendar of events.

The first Hemp Trades Trade Fair was on in the Hall along with forums, market , stalls. a culinary expo and the inevitable bongo-madness drummers. There was a joint rolling contest, the hemp Olympix, (including bong obstacle course relay, bong throwing, the marijuana-growers iron person event and the Commissioner Woods Bent Cop Cross- country Steeple Chase), a screening of the updated The Hemp Revolution, and Pot Art 3 happening in the f shopfronts throughout town.

The Mardi Grass is a major underground ritual and series of events focused on living our lives in truth, integrity and self determination. It is also about raising public awareness and proposing feasible alternatives about an issue which affects almost every household in Australia in some way or another. Be part of this unique, peaceful, joyful and productive play on politics. This year looks like being a landmark event, unencumbered by elections and operating parallel with the precedent being set by the Visions of Nimbin team. With five weeks to go pre-planning is well underway and the programme is already bulging with delight. The Grass MOB (Mardigrass Organising Body) is being co-ordinated by Freja Leonard, Michael Balderstone and Binna Pownall and assisted by a strong support crew. Outside interest is again building up helped along by the spectacular poster rendered by Elsbethe Jones and widely distributed throughout Australia, along with the Embassy's 1997 \"Let It Growl\" Calendar. The MOB has been working with Council's staff to overcome any downside problems encountered in previous years and the local police are involved in a scheme helping to prepare and train the Jungle Patrol - the Mardi Grass Marshals. 1997 is set to explode in a wild array of diverse events kicking off on Thursday night May 1st. The legendary Picker's Ball this year joins in the Mardi Grass celebrations. With a history stretching back into the late 70's, the Picker's Ball personified the Marijuana Culture in the Nim bin area for years. The Loose Joints ensemble led by local reggae legend George Scott will be doing their homegrown thing on stage at the Town Hall after the arrival of the Kombi Konvoy and the lighting of the Hemp Olympix flame. A more official opening ceremony will have been held earlier that afternoon presided over by local Bundjalung aboriginal people Another prominent feature of this year's Mardi Grass is the Harm Reduction and Awareness Seminars. Filled with many and varied pertinent drug related topics designed to educate, network peak bodies and raise the drug law reform debate in Australia. From Legal Issues to How to Deal with a Marijuana Habit, the seminars will be a people's summit on drug issues. Anyone wanting to organise and facilitate workshops please contact Freja on 891 024. Debate on Prohibition is planned to take place in Lismore and the crew, who disabled the drug squad in the helicopter raids of January this year, go before the Lismore Court (this is purely coincidence, honestly!) on Friday, May 2.

It's where we affirm pride in ourselves and together demand a change to these silly counterproductive laws. Ann Symonds MLC will be the principal speaker at the rally. As the leading advocate in the NSW State Parliament for Drug Law Reform, we are proud and priviledged to have her here with us this Mardi Grass. Prepare your floats, dust out your costumes for a 1997 upgrade and exercise your creative imagery for a mad revel for sanity. Needless to say we need you to support the work we're doing to help us keep it going, and any personal or financial assistance is appreciated (Also. by the way, relatively rare). The nature of prohibition compromises almost eveyone. We have no sponsors - the drug industry as such relies on Prohibition. The Mardi Grass' current organizers are a few dedicated freaks who so clearly see the role that Prohibition plays in distorting our society's healthy functioning that they're prepared to do something about it, but they're stretched to the limit. Everything done costs money. In order to run a great Grass we need financial support. In order to accomplish that we're presenting you with an offer you can't afford to pass up. You can join us and become a card carrying sponsor of Mardi Grass: just $50 can make you a individual sponsor supporting the Mardi Grass. Yes folks. just like the local businesses most people expect to support us, now you too can declare your support and become an official Mardi Grass Sponsor. Your money gets you a special Gold Pass Mardi Grass T Shirt as well as free admission to three separate events of your choice at the Grass.

They also have another daughter, Carol, and four beautiful grand-daughters and a grandson. For many older folk this would be more than enough to keep them busy. Not these two! Winifred is well-known for her many community activities and Norman, at the age of 84, is working on a Ph.D.! Winifred The couple came to Nimbin in February. 1991. building it home next (1001 to Kathy in Gungas Road. Winifred was very soon in- volved in the community. As a historian she was pleased to work with Diana Arrnstead to compile the Nimbin Central School Cente- nary book. Then, in 1992, together with Fayc Scherf, she founded the Nimbin Older Women's Forum. Originally envisaged as a discussion group it soon became active in community matters publicly supporting the needle exchange and methadone clinic, drug law reform and hous- ing for both aged and youth. Along with organising the Soup Kitchen. Winifred does her fair share of cooking and serving too. She is also active in the Mulgum Creek Landcare Group of which she was founding secretary in 1993. This group has been regenerat- ing the creek bank and has just received a $1 2.000 grant to continue the work. An active worker for the purchase of the old school site, Winifred is currently engaged in preparing it display of historical material for the Visions of N imbin Exposition. She participates in International Women's Day, the Seniors Week activities, and still manages to find time for a Gentle Exercise class. And she has just celebrated her 80th birthday!

With no money left, jumping trains was the only option and after two days in a freight car with no food or water he arrived at Bowen. Sailors on board a merchant vessel gave him a feed but there was no job so it was back to jumping trains. \"The technique was quite simple in those days of slow steam trains. You'd walk up to the nearest hill on the railway line and when the train got to the top of the hill it would be going at a running pace. So you'd run along beside it, put your foot on the step and pull yourself on board. The hardest part was to undo the rope and release the tarpaulin so you could crawl up into the tnick.\" He eventually arrived at Mt isa and the dishwashing job before being taken on at the mine to work underground.

Norman is interviewing people who came local organisations and interview people who have lived on MO's from the very beginning. Norman has written his autobiography, a most entertaining work which deserves publication but he feels to keep it within his family. He has also undertaken the task of rendering the Old Testament into simple, straight-forward language. \"After years of church and Sunday School.\" he says. \"I am con- vinced that the majority of the congregation became mesmerised by the beauty and sonority of the language and so did not really absorb the actual events and incidents related in this magnificent work of prose, almost poetry.\" His version is an uncomplicated account of these events and makes for astonishing reading.

Here is a balance between conservation and food production with fruit orchards merging into rainforest regeneration areas - all having been created within 15 years. The community has worked with nature rather than against it, us- ing wattles and nitrogen-fixing ground covers like pigeon and cow pea, pinto beans and lab lab and placing cardboard mulch over the kikuyu grass. The wattles were interplanted with eucalypts and rain- lorest trees, the total trees planted to date, being 15,(X)0. No herbi- cides or artificial fertilizers were used but manure from the composting toilets and the two horses, was utilised. The orchards were carefully planned with over 200 varieties of tree, including: coffee, tea, banana, pawpaw, tamarillo, feijoa, mango, black sapote andjackfruit. The 3 acres provide virtually all the fruit for the 7 people of the community and some species are already self- propagating! As well as vegies from the vegetable garden, free range chickens and goats provide them with eggs and milk. The goats are especially important in keeping the weeds down. Buildings are mud brick, stone or a wall construction of a mixture of sand, sawdust and cement. Each house has solar hot water and solar panels. To-day, community work days have been replaced with people having different areas of responsibility, reflecting their general in- terests. The community wants to inspire others to promote similar life- styles and so they promote open days. Whilst encouraging visitors, they do ask that people make an appointment first.

April I May '97 7 Nimbin News Nimbin Older Women's Forum On Monday March 17, the NOW Forum was honoured to be presented with the Premier's Community Service Award by the National Party Member for Lismore, Mr Bill Rixon. Nominated by Diana Roberts, the NOW Forum was given their award in recognition of their constant work for the community. Not only do these ladies provide free soup each Friday, and a wonderful Christmas dinner, but also they have been the prime movers in the Aged People's Housing project and the Youth Ilousing project. The NOW Forum sees the Friday Soup as an opportunity for the older members of the community to meet with the youth who often ask their advice and confide in them as they would their own grand- mothers. The presentation ceremony took place at the Bowling Club where several members and friends had gathered for the Gentle Exercise Class, followed by morning tea. Bill Rixon paid tribute to the work of the NOW Forum ladies and was introduced to each of them personally, taking the time to speak individually with anyone who had a question to ask him. The NOW Forum is at present raising money to furnish the communal area of the Aged People's homes and any donation, either of cash or furni- ture, will he most gladly received. They meet on the 2nd and 4th Thursdays at I pm at the Commu- nity Health Centre. Visitors are always most welcome. Radio Nimbin (2NIM) Nimbin Independent Media will be presenting a mock broad- cast at the Visions of Ninibin Exposition and also at the Mardi Grass Festival. This is a great opportunity for members to prac- tise their broadcasting skills (or learn the art!) so get in touch with us NOW if you have an idea for a program or have some music you think should be aired.

This means that if your program is accepted it would he broad- cast nationally to he picked up by other community radio stations. Anyone with any ideas for an ear-catching program? We are still looking for a site for the antenna and transmitter. We tried the tower at Mt Nardi but found it would cost us megabucks which, of course, we don't have. A site on private property is being considered. We are hoping to begin broadcasting about the end of June or early July. We have had several items of equipment donated but still need many things such as CD players, amplifiers, speakers. cassette players etc. Any donations will he warmly welcomed. Owing to personal commitments and changes of address we have a couple of vacancies on our committee. Any volunteers? Now is your chance to get involved in Nimbin's own community radio sta- tion. It has come to our notice that the other radio group (C.O .N.A.R) are claiming to have an aspirant radio licence but we have been in- formed by the Australian Broadcasting Authority that this is not true. However, it seems they do have a licence from the Australian Per- forming Rights Association which allows them to play recorded music when they do get a test transmission licence.

It was a colourful parade; about 50 women, many with their children, were dressed appropri- ately in purple and green. They marched along Cullen Street to the music and rhythm of several instrumentalists and drummers. The marchers returned to Memorial Park where there was dancing and singing by performers from the EKLEKTA and THEM groups. Then all the participants joined hands in a circle and sang \"Woman, Hold My Hand\", in itself a moving event. The group included members of the Nimbin Older Women's Forum; most of the participants were, however, young women. The event was yet another indication of the community spirit with which Nimbin people, old and young, respond to public gatherings. Winifred Mitchell, (Secretary N.O. W. Forum.)

New Housing Option A group in Byron Bay wants to pioneer 'co-hous- ing', a new lifestyle option pioneered in Denmark and now spreading throughout Europe and N. America. They have been meeting for about 6 months and a spokesman said that it was unlike Multiple Occupancy as individuals would own their own homes. They would also have a share in a com- mon-house used for meals and activities. Dwell- ings would be situated around the common-house with parking areas restricted to the perimeter and houses would be linked by pathways. Contact Simone on 855 723 or Denise on 853 379. (The N.N.

MEN - Can you talk about your real concerns with your mates? With your wife or partner, or even your family? You are doing well it you can say 'yes' to that. But there may be times when the answer doesn't seem so clear. Perhaps we are all too influenced by the tough guy, 'stand alone' version of what a man should be. Men may feel it is giving - in to admit, even to themselves, that they are stressed or in need of support; it can seem an admission of failure. The men of MENSLINE believe in the impor- tance of having someone to talk to, someone who doesn't have their own axe to grind. MENSLINE doesn't try to be another welfare service. Some- thing different was needed. We all need it.....and we provide it. We use skills generously taught us by a wide range of local health professionals, but we operate at a more person-to-person level. This is the great strength of a voluntary peer support system, by and among \"ordinary\" men. For our experience is that\"ordinary\" men are quite \"extraor- dinary\" in their capacity for care, mutual support, and insight. MENSLINE PHONE NO: 222 240, 7pm to 11pm every night.

In fact, they have had a sister-city relationship with Yamato Takada in Japan for nearly 35 years! Their publication called 'The Bamboo Shoots' has a message from the Japanese Mayor which says:- \"We have to keep unsullied the great interna- tional honour which the pioneering citizens of both cities have won by establishing the first Austral- ian-Japanese sister city link in 1963.\" He mentions especially the deep ties of friend- ship between the younger generations in both cit- ies and adds that his municipal government has just subscribed to \"The Northern Stars\" (sic) to be kept in the local library...

Also we had the good luck and bonus of having the legendary new age global troubador, Fantuzzi giving a concert and workshop last month in the Nimbin flail. He took part in the famous Woodstock I and 2 festivals, inspired and influenced Paul Joseph and the White Company, who took on his songs for the 1973 Aquarius festival. These songs and others are now classics of the growing global Rainbow movement. I have had the great privilege in participating in a number of events with him here and the USA.

All the ancient mystery schools taught their students the use of sound as a creative, healing force! Sound is the oldest form of healing and was part of thc teachings of the Greeks, Mayans, Chinese, Egyptians, Aztecs, and the Per- sians. The Essenes, a sect of the Jews, alive in the times of Jesus, were dynamic healers and trained in the art of healing with sound and nature. Their name comes from \"Asava\" meaning to heal or doctor!! Sound is still being used today by ancient tribes, like the Native Americans, whose Shamans still use \"KIVAS\" (buried sound cham- hei's), Tibetans, Alaskans and many African and South American tribes! Our voice is a manifestation of our inner being, which is here to be celebrated !! In singing we don't have to limit ourselves to the idea ollyric, rhyme and melody, but should experience it as ajoyous and uplifting outpouring of our voice! When I travelled in the Mid- dle East and heard women \"ululating\" at the top of their voices, I thought: YES, that's what expressing is all about! Here in the west, we women have never learned how to express grief, sorrow or joy I think it's time we started expressing our Feelings, instead of hold- ing all \"that stuff\" in! Keening & wailing are more sounds of lamen- tations which actually \"release\" grief & sorrow ! ! I just helped a friend of mine who lost a son recently to express her pain & grief. She also received a lot of help from many other friends. In the playshops I hold, one means of expressing I teach, is the use of \"groaning! !\" Apart from when we stub our toes, when do we allow ourselves to groan'! I also work with individuals, using vibra- tional sound for healing. I voice the sound that I sense from the tissue. & what I consider an emotional memory (grief. pain, loss etc.) which has not been completely integrated or released from the body. In other words it has not been expressed and is still 'buried in the living tissue of the skin\"! MAKE A SOUND & LET IT GO !! I encourage the individual person to use sound ,whenever appro- priate!' Teaching the use of sound to balance the chakra energy cen- tres in the body is vital because that is where most of our holding patterns are stuck!! Sounding the chakras is very cleansing, centering and induces calm and peace! I also sing a person's spirit song on occasions, when it comes through! A tone (or sound) is a living cell that has the power of reproduc- ing changes, of re- balancing, being activated and finely tuned!! Toning enables sound to permeate the body, vibrating the imbalanced areas and affecting a restructuring of the molecules in the dis-eased areas of the body ! For every tone that is sounded, a series of harmonics occur simultaneously. This is a natural phenom- enon with all sounds !! An Ayruvedic teaching says that primordial sounds are threads Ken Chelsworth Registered Surveyor Boundaries Marked Building Set-Outs Contours Identification Surveys. Subdivisions.

The body is held together by sound, and the presence of dis-ease indicates that some sounds have gone out of tune So next time you're singing and humming to yourself, know that you're re- balancing your body & be assured that 10 mm. a day is all you need to restore all your brain cells! At Shands Hospital on Gainesville, Florida, patients with a vari- ety of illnesses are joined by some 200 artists and performers in painting, sculpting, dancing, singing, toning and writing! What a wonderful method to get better and healthier fast! And one that has been proven once more !! Chanting is another medium of using our voice.

Its scope is enor- mously wide, the adveris small and unobtrusive, the cartoons funny and, above all, the standard of writing excellent. On page 21 was a headline that caught my eye uThe Alternative Society Loves a Conspiracy!\" It so happened that I had been reading a book the same week whilst staying on the Gold Coast called \"Mystery 666,\" by Don E. Stanton. It contained the same quotations made in your brief article but the book itself expanded the writer's theories to 160 pages. Unfortunately his thesis is not based on rational fact but on Biblical prophesy. His con- clusions are similar to those expressed by the armed militias in the USA. He believes that the conspirators are not just an alliance of Commu- nists and Capitalists (which I would agree to) but that its leaders are Satanists led by 'The Beast' or 'Man 666'. Mr Stanton, through the medium of Revelations, blames the whole of society's ills on Satan and his legions of followers. His extremist, fundamental- ist, message is that we should all follow Jesus and all will be well. This obviously excludes a huge section of the world's population but such is the way of fundamentalism. My reason for referring to the article is to pass on a warning to the good folks of Nimbin as to how some conspiracy theorists see all current problems as being generated by Satan, rather than the nor- mal greed of humanity. On page 135 of his book he lists some of the sins which he perceives as being sponsored by the United Nations, the EEC, the World Council of Churches, the World Bank, the Catholics, the Anglicans, the Episcopalians, the Jews, atheists, members of peace groups, etc. etc. The sins include sex orgies, homosexuality, group sex, X-raled films, pornography, free love, permis- siveness and sado-masochism. May I suggest that, should the followers of Mr Stanton take over the world, Nimbin would be a very dull place indeed. Michael Priceman Dear Editor, I do not know if dopes have moods of 'intro- spection' but they might consider what visitors to Cullen St., Nimbin, think of them in their psych- edelic surroundings and the spooky 'Museum', etc. My guess is with amused indifference and sorrow rather than any kind of admiration. Or, the dopes who pathetically kid themselves they have found Utopia? What do they find? Alas, no 'Big Arnie' torsos and physiques but emaciated tattooed sticks of humanity, some with dreadlocks who may have AIDS. In reality, poor victims of the pusher-drug-ped- dlers making money out of their self-deluding hal- lucinations. This writer has no knowledge of the circum- stances of those who live in the communities in the foothills. Perhaps perfectly wholesome lives? Why do dopes imbibe marijuana when there are legal alternatives available like Hottentot and Damiana? Why does not the respected gentleman lawyer wearing a suit, advising youngsters on Helicopter Protest Day in War Memorial Park, push for legal alternatives? Surely men and women know that the drug is bad for your libido and sex drive - to near impo- tence? Damiana is an anti-depressant, good for your kidneys and an aphrodisiac. Its smell is close to marijuana. These are plants which can give legal highs, good or better than opiates and pot, grass/joints (at a fraction of the cost) with no harm or toxicity and no bad side-effects. Whilst the Collective may think dopes of the Age of Aquarius are the draw cards to Nimbin, this is false! Nimbin can make a name for itself through: A. Alternative energy, B. scholastic records of your school children, C. the advancement of Permaculture, etc., D. prowess in sport, particu- larly soccer, E. health farms, legal high drugs, herbs and research farms, F. no- hassle living for artists, poets, musicians, etc., away from the stress of the rat-race, G. budget tourist accommodation with pure air and lovely countryside. Peter Temperton, (Gold Coast). Dear Sir, Growers, Their Armies And The Smoker I have always been taught by my hippy father, 'Smoking has its benefits - it's great, I still do it and I'm 45!' But it's a private thing, either with yourself or other laid-back smokers. A true smoker does not brag about it publically. I have never met up with a cop (yet!) who aims at busting a personal smoker but there are laws to protect our children from flakes alter a big buck. A smoker has a few in a pot, chops up and sits back; an ego-maniac who's a greedy farmer, cre- ates bad karma - and not always just for himself, unfortunately... Our own space is what we are learning to pro- tect; cleansing our environment of energy that has been left to manifest into a dark greed. The old souls in Nimbin who are achieving spiritual bal- ance deserve high recognition but they also de- serve a hand from us later souls. Locals! - paint the signs and ask the question of your guests to your special town, 'Are you entering this beautiful town to purchase buds or are you entering with due respect?' But in turn, let's all show some respect to the people that do turn a blind eye, because in truth, we do know it's against the law. It's not the sand- pit kids, this is not 'cops and robbers'. Look in the mirror for spiritual gurus who may be smiling back at you. Is your child-like ego full of fear out to prove something? If it is, your sweet soul should be hold- ing a peace pipe and not a sack of money. If this were not so, nobody would know what you were doing because you would want to keep the dollars you make. Instead you flip to the inner child and the he-man energies and forget the road rules! It's illegal - it's part of history today'and the future. Nimbin! - what a spiritual landmark, freeloving, carefree and spiritually accommodating; t 'per- fect' are open to the spiritual guru. We meditate to protect Mother Earth and yet we stand on Her in our own denial of our true selves and expect Her to swallow and process the misconceptions. A true smoker has a quiet life in his or her space, enjoying the light seen in others and situations - the peace pipe is comforting.... However, this intention is not being smoked up in the pipe but burned in the party cone. It's not a party, it's the law and it affects too many people. Advertise it, talk about it, smoke it but do not involve all - some people do not need it in their lives. It obviously does not mean that visitors are not spiritually evolved enough to want to share such a beautiful town with its privileged community, in this case. Get back to attracting the recently aware and the Mums and Dads; most of them more than likely, middle aged hippies who were an honest part of Nimbin's history. Make them feel welcome! However, the true smoker does not trust a total stranger on the street, they trust their intuition that something is 'not quite right'. The best way to send someone out of business is to stop purchasing. It hurts me to say this, but the new or unbalanced smoker lives in a huge misconception and most of them will rip you off if they get the chance! Nimbin has these amazing shops and merchan- dise; I honour the beautiful souls that own them and provide for us, for many have put their mate- rial possessions into the town. To some visitors this is an unbelievable donation of time and en- ergy. Do not look at Nimbin as a place to criticize, but more of a town where you can visit and feel totally comfortable within, and amongst, true peo- ple and friends. Smokers should move casually in their own space, Honesty and self respect is the difference between the big green monster (money) and the big green bud (marijuana). Carmen. Nimbin News April/May'97 13 by Len Harper The Catchers of Heaven - Dr Michael Wolff The time is certainly coming according to all the reports in Nexus and other sources, when the US scientists and researchers in high places are going to come clean about UFOs and aliens. Wolff has spent many years studying alien technology, and reckons that some nine or more spaceships are possessed by the National Security Council. He wonders whether they were deliberately given to us to see what we would do with them, and as for the bodies of the occupants for instance, could we combine our DNA and an alien's to produce a hybrid? He insists that the US government has already had secret relations' with aliens and he talks of separate groups of aliens rather than a single 'master race'.. Obviously he has something to say about the abductions question but as we haven't seen the book yet, no comments can be made. He feels that the time is right NOW to get the truth out and in this instance, the reviewer feels this is such an important issue that somebody among our readers may like to send for a copy.

Fabulous Organic Hemp Oil Beauty Products Available at Health Food Section somewhat mythical man-god first presented by St Paul? Scholars say that the Gospels are notoriously unreliable - the Acts not much better, and both could be termed a 'historical vacuum' bearing in mind the fact that no momentous happenings (we know from other sources) were mentioned that occurred at the same time. Jesus himself is said to be a Pharisee drawing heavily on their doctrines and at the same time being strongly influenced by his mentor, John the Baptist, who was an Essene. He had a Zealot and a Sicarii among his followers, both of whom were fiercely political. In fact, he could well have been quite a revolutionary! At least the Romans thought he was... What the authors unravelled in their researches among the scrolls were facts that are violently challenged by present-day orthodox Christianity and this, really, constitutes the book's reason for being written, I believe.

Inevitably, it has been a matter of fits and starts, of following numerous false trails, of rushing into blind alleys, to say nothing of wandering off into vague amorphous cop-outs of 'personal development' or 19th century concepts of class war. Suddenly a new initiative has emerged which has all the qualities of a dynamic catalyst for change! The International Forum on Globalisation is a coalition of a new comprehension of where we are and where we need to he going. A body of academics, activists and authors is focussing on the threat to the environment, the eonorny and cultural diversities of the planet, being mounted by corporation capitalism. There is a growing awareness that politics itself is only part of the game and that there are bigger and more powerful forces at work which are light years away from any semblance of democratic control. The policy of head on confrontation beloved by would-be socialist revolutionaries calls for gigantic structures to match those to which we are opposed. Thus, the same problems of democratic denial and abuse of power are thrown up. As ever, the factor of scale, where operative moral judgements can prevail and the democratic ethos can actually work, is omnipresent. That scale cannot be other than a human scale, where we can work, play, hope & dream with our neighbours in a given locale limited by its own pedestrian cletinitions. So what exactly do we do at the neighbourhood-empowering level to create one particular live cell in the body politic. One that will begin to counter the blight of political and economic leukemia which results from the absence of the small scale & which now holds all of us in its thrall. A Community Journal.

Down to earth feminist \u2014 Edna R!jan Mostly the lives of truly great people are lived without due recognition. It is only when they die that people are forced to stop and reflect on their achievements. Most Australian women would never have known the name Edna Ryan. Yet she has had a prol'ound affect on their lives. Ms Ryan was involved in the early equal pay for equal work cases before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in 1969 and 1972 (CT, 15/2/97 p3). She uncovered information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing that before 1974, 130,000 families were solely dependent on women's wages (SMH, 1112/ 97 p8). She was a feminist who campaigned on issues concerned with the economic aspects of women's lives. She learned young the necessity of the financial contribution of women to the lives of their families. Ms Ryan was born in Sydney the 10th of 12 children who grew up in poor circumstances. Although she excelled at school, she was forced to leave formal education to contribute her share to the family income. For all of her working life she was a clerk and after her husband died became the sole provider for her three children (SMH, 11/2/97 p8). So she was only too aware of the difficulties of raising children on the unequal (two thirds of a male wage for the same job) wage of a woman. She expressed her views through many articles and two books, Gentle Invaders (1975) and Two-Thirds ofa Man (1984) (SMH, 11/2/97 p8). Her political activism began with the Communist Party but she quickly became disillusioned and moved on to join the Labour Party and was made a life member in 1987. She was unsuccessful in becoming a Parliamentary member in 1953 but was very involved in the Fairfield Council from 1956 to 1965 being a Councillor and Deputy Mayor (SMH, 11/2/97 p8). Ms Ryan became involved with the Women's Electoral Lobby (WEL) and continuously strove to make women aware of political issues. Over the last few years her main concern was to ensure that any industrial legislation involving enterprise bargaining did not disadvantage women. Edna Ryan is a heroine of mine because she focused her energy on improving the economic lives of all women. She recognised that it is only through economic independence that women can truly be equal in our society. Economic independence allows women to make choices about their lives. It is only when women have the economic security and stability to take control of their lives, can they achieve their true potential. Ms Edna died in Canberra on 10/2/97 at the age of 92.

Anonymous A Moment of Reflection ...Enjoying the spell of some good literature, my eyes are enticed from the printed page by a delicious warble coming from a featl\u00ecered friend within one of the many close by shrubs and trees. I glance through my open doors and windows and not only notice the birds but the dragonflies, the butterfly effect, the glitter as the sun reflects from and through a myriad angles of clustered leaves, the young trees compliant to the gentle breeze. The older trees, stiffer more rigid and unbending, acknowledge the little zephyr with a dismissive flutter of peripheral foliage. A moments reflection on this fantasy, reveals an inhuilt danger in that 'dismissive flutter'. A gale, a hurricane, it tornado may he just a 'little breeze' infuriated by just such it show of arboreal poor manners. An incensed breeze, after countless such indignities may become enraged enough to embark upon a furious tirade, capable of stripping leaves, breaking limbs, knocking down the stiff and unbending while the pliant and compliant spring hack up with renewed vigour.

Not incarceration in incarnation just yet. Let me float along, free in the ether, Let me dance the colours of the upper worid Don't want to be wrapped up in skin again... Too late My Mado's body pushed me away and into the worid of form And I knew that it was my choice. It was I who was game enough to slide down the love vortex Nine months ago, on Bastille Day, it was me aliright. But now squeezed into my body-self I don't like it. It's so narrow, so restricted, so diminishing I'd rather die which is the way to go back to the freedom of the formless. But it's too late...

Mado was weak from the tearing apart of her flesh from her flesh And relieved that it was over. She was alone, my father was not at her side. Single mothers were helped but also made to pay for the sin those days They showed her me, screaming and raging under their forceful care. 'We take her away for the night, you need to rest...\" I, me, myself felt it all. And fifty years later Undergoing healing with Joy. The buried pain came into focus.

Thanks Joy. It is a Joy to know you. Daniele Marie Lucie April / May '97 19 Nimbin News SOUND as a Modulator of Consciousness by Tom Kenyon, M.A. For the last decade or so I have focussed on the use of sound to produce altered states of consciousness. It is in these states, char- acterised by heightened alpha and theta activity, that we have access to the more creative aspects of awareness. With the normal day-to-day censors suspended, non-ordinary ex- periences often occur. Such experiences often have physically-heal- ing, emotionally-transformative and even spiritual effects. The Vedic Rishis of ancient India coined a term that conveys their experience of the world as vibratory in nature. The term 'nada brahniin' means literally \"the world is sound\". And modern quan- tum physics would agree with this basic tenet. The science of 'mantra' which has evolved over thousand of years, directly seeks to affect consciousness itself and, in some cases, mat- ter, through the use of specilic vibratory keys. These vibratory keys or 'hijas' (seed sounds) can profoundly affect awareness. It was in the course of this work that I stumbled upon a study that showed that shamanic drumming produced strong theta activity in the brain. This intrigued me. and I began to explore indigenous meth- ods and instruments for altering consciouscness. While drumming is an effective tool to alter brainwave patterns, I have hound that this is greatly enhanced by using the human voice. Most intriguing is the ability of modulated sound, as in overtone chanting, toaftct a sub- ject's physiological processes while he is in an altered state (trance). A dramatic experience in this regard, was a woman suffering from a compound fracture in the leg who was in constant pain. I instructed 50 people in how to use sound for healing and after tile 'treatment' she reported no pain and was walking without her plaster cast! Incidentally, it has also been documented that mantras or chants can affect external events, especially weather, and some indigenous American tribes have been known to affect rain - even into this cen- tury.... An ethnohiologist has reported how sound can seemingly al- ter DNA activity during trance states produced by plant hallucino- gens. What seems to be required is more fluidity in the individual - our day-to-day perceptions and actions tend to he rigid. Methods for freeing up the attention without relying oil hallucinogens has become a research interest for me. The essential questions is: \"Can the pur- ported changes in physical and neurological structure, as a result of shamanic sound, he measured - or are these changes more in the or- der of a mythology?\" Even as I continue research. I often use these methods clinically or in group training sessions and I am constantly awed by the power of sound to touch, to inspire, to heal.

They are also an integral part of the macrobiotic diet. Perhaps not in OUR oceans though, for two organic growers on a property 300 km south of Sydney dreamed of marketing seaweed from the local beaches only to be knocked back by laboratory tests! They had 3 analyses done at 3-monthly intervals in '95 and '96. The results were shattering: there were high levels of toxic heavy metals like arsenic and cadmium present which vaned from one test to the next. Needless to say, they were refused certification by NASAA. Imported seeweed and kelps are randomly checked by the Australian NZ Food Authority and there appears to be no difficulties in this area. However, the Herb Grower 'zine hopes that there are no repercussions for organic growers who use seeweed sprays, most of which are certified organic in any case.

Using conventional economic indicators, a Biodynamic dairy farmer in Victoria, is said to be making more profit than his surrounding neighbours. Ray Quigley says that while his gross income is less, so are many of his on going expenses such as animal health costs and energy bills. The real difference of course, is the $15,300 his rivals spend on fertilisers and the $2,750 on weed control. Ray spends nothing... Although his income is estimated at $34,880 less than the average conventional farmer, his input costs are $50,000 lower. Source: Acres 411 via Going Organic Jan '97.

Copenhagen Meeting The latest conference of intemational organic agriculturists (from 92 countries) stressed that organic practices should be prioritized in order to create global food security, protect human health and the environment. Furthermore, it said that training farmers in these methods in developing countries, can increase yields 200-300% over previous levels. It was pointed out that poverty and unequal purchasing power are the true causes of food insecurity and the official UN organisation was to be criticized for stressing increased production rather than improved distribution.

Lowering Standards The US Dept. of Agriculture is attempting to lower organic standards by allowing the use of food additives and processing which may decrease the integrity of the products.

Scientists have found out why smokers put on weight when they quit: nicotine suppresses the appetite hormone in their brains! Apparently the brain becomes less sensitive to a recently discovered hormone called 'leptin'. This controls appetite, so they eat more resulting in a considerable weight gain. The study was conducted by 3 Melbourne researchers in 3 countries and they described the results as being highly significant in the fight against obesity. Source: W/End Australian 112 March. UN Against Nuclear Power The UN now rejects nuclear power as a viable source of energy in the future and says environmentally clean alternatives should be developed -especially wind and solar. It is significant that this report has been issued before the 5-year review of the Rio Summit to be held in June. It stated that nuclear power poses security challenges (because of the link with nuclear weapons) and at this time accounts for about 5% of the worid energy. It also provides the worid with about 15% of its electricity with France mentioned as a country heavily dependent upon it. From the security point of view, the costs of ensuring that the Power does NOT go to weaponry, is far greater than the costs of developing renewable energy... Source: W/End Australian 112 March.

Each year in Australia an estimated 10,000 people become infected with HCV. Nimbin is one focus of this epidemic, with an infection rate about 14 times higher than the NSW average rate (see Chart). IICV becomes chronic in 80-85% of cases and is often symptom free, however it leads to liver damage in 20-25%, and possibly liver cancer in up to 10% of cases. HCV is mostly transmitted via blood eg: shared drug injection equipment (needles, syringes, spoons, filters, swabs, water, tourniquets): infected blood products (mostly pre-1990); unsterile skin penetration (eg tattooing, skin piercing, acupuncture); needle- stick injuries; and even minute amounts of blood on shared toothbrushes or razors. People with HCV should cover any cuts or abrasions with a waterproof dressing, wipe up blood spills with laper towels and bleach, and place any blood stained items in plastic bags before disposal in the garbage. HCV is not easily caught if blood exposure is avoided. It cannot he caught by sharing eating utensils, toilets, showers, towels or washing machines, or by ordinary social contact (eg hugging, kissing, shaking hands). Biting insects do not transmit it. Sexual transmission appears to he rare, but may increase with menstruation, anal sex, high viral blood levels (often during early, acute infection), or if other sexually transmissible diseases (STDs) are present. Transmission from mother-to-infant is also rare, the risk again increasing with high viral levels and STDs. l-ICV has not been found in breast milk, but cracked or bleeding nipples may allow transmission to infants. Persons with HCV should seek medical advice regarding their health risks and infectivity. Some people with HCV find avoiding certain faods (eg fatty foods) helps to reduce their symptoms.

Certain Chinese herbs have been shown to lower raised liver enzymes caused by HCV infection. Partners, family and friends can play a big role in supporting people with HCV. Between 60-95 1/o of injecting drug users (IDUs) are infected with HCV, and re - infection can occur with different strains of HCV, causing further, acute infection and increasing the risk of liver damage. The Needle and Syringe Exchange Program (HIT team) is thus essential for HCV prevention. It provides sterile injection equipment from the Community Health Centre (9-I Oam & I 2-2pm), and on the street (10-I 2am).

Overdoses could he reduced or treated promptly, and injecting drug use would he removed from public places such as the public toilets and park. If such a venue were to be established, there would need to he methods of preventing a \"honey-pot\" effect of attracting more lDUs to Nimbin, perhaps by firmer policing of street drug dealing. Innovative strategies are needed to prevent l-ICV transmission, and to assist IDUs with safer injecting practices. Setting up a safe-house might be one such strategy. Ultimately any decision to do this lies largely with the people of Ninibin.

I believe child neglect and sexual assault to be the issues at the root of much of what is disturbing us about our community today. It is the single most damaging practice performed in our society today outside of murder. Children who are living with the damage, and resulting trauma, associated with being a sexual assault victim. are often driven to suicide anyway. Which is worse, to die or to live with having been crushed and crippled mentally and spiritually? Psyche Death (The Feeling 01 Healing, 1996) \"Death comes in many ways. Through the body, through the heart, through the psyche, through the soul. Children who are raped, abused and exploited suffer in ways that can bring death to the human soul.\" Nimbin groans under the weight of an enormous level of excessive substance usage and addiction. Many in Nimbin are now angry that their town is allowed to be used as a rural shooting, snorting and toking gallery. If a behaviour is a good and positive one, it will be known by the good and positive behaviours produced by it. So, if the drug culture was good for Nimbin, the town would he overwhelmed by good and positive things as a result. But is it? Why Is it that so many feel they are tinab Ic to live without the inhalation, ingestion or injection of toxic substances into their bodies? For many, the use of drugs is the attempt to escape or dull the pain of thought processes generated by past traumatic life events. I am not trying to excuse dependent and abusive behaviours but merely to display the facts of the life experience of many. We are no strangers to coni lict in our community and this is usually the result of competition and lack of understanding. A recent visit to Richmond Clinic has reinforced my passion to stand against the tide of drug related carnage on local young people. Findings from a 1995 case load survey by Northern Rivers Regional Juvenile Justice indicated that 100% of female clients had histories of sexual abuse. Within the heroin using community alone, statistics show that in excess of 75% have suffered sexual violations. They have been interfered with sexually by individuals driven by a selfish need to have their own wants gratified at the expense of the young victims. Of course, not everyone who has been sexually damaged has been completely consumed by the experience. People deal with trauma in different ways depending on the level of support structures available and whether they trust and use them. Many live their whole lives in denial of the event ever happening. Their minds have locked the painful thoughts and feelings away in subconscious storage. Prisoners (The Feeling of Healing, 1996) \"1 kept the inner child a prisoner, chained to the dun geon walls of my mind. I blocked out the painful memories of childhood to survive. Trouble is the walls became thicker with each passing year. By the time we reach adulthood the walls become a fortress and we. in turn, become lonely, lost and frightened people with pain hurt, anger and guilt trapped inside.\" I took a call late one night from an elderly person from it local nursing home who, in her later years was confronted with the knowledge of her lather interfering with her when she was a child. Her body no longer had the mental energy necessary to suppress the information even though she had been able to do so previously for over eighty 80 years. The process of temptation is familiar to us all. An enticing thought comes and although, deep down, we know that it isn't OK we still have a wish to enjoy that forbidden thing. We then either give in and do it or find the strength to stand firm and not compromise. When an older person comes in contact with a child and then abuses their trust in a manipulative uncaring manner the child will come to know fear, anxiety, guilt, shame, anger and resentment. Children who have been sexually violated have little hope of forming healthy relationships for they interpret the sex act as one of fear and guilt. Their partners will find the reaction frustrating and confusing. For a relationship to work people must meet each other's emotional needs with good communication, loving actions and unconditional acceptance. In this environment sex can exist and flourish naturally. This is the difference between having sex and making love. Drug abuse is often the resulting behaviour of those who haven't the courage or support to face life straight owing to the trauma caused by sexual violation. In the hook \"1-low to Really Love Your Child\" Dr Campbell defines inappropriate love as that which hinders a child's emotional growth by failing to meet its emotional need and which fosters an increasingly dependent relationship upon a parent and hampers self reliance. A seven year old child who lived alone with her father was seen at a psych clinic for frequent masturbation and poor school performance. It was noted that the father often held the child, caressing her and fondling her in such a way that seemed to bring sensual enjoyment to both himself and the child. 1-le claimed he didn't fully realise what he was dining. Loving parents would do well to remember that: 1. Every child. regardless of age, needs appropriate physical contact; 2. To have occasional inappropriate sexual feelings regarding a child is not uncommon; 3.The parent should ignore these inappropriate feelings and give the child what it needs in the way of non-seductive physical contact. This is a huge issue and getting bigger by the day.

You mayhave garden beds that are finished producing and for which you have no immediate plans. This is the ideal time to lay them to rest, to let them recuperate. What I do: I cover them with either lots of comfrey leaves, kitchen scraps, reject Koala Tea bags, or dolomite and Organic Life, water them well and cover them with cardboard or a thick layer of ne\\vspa- pers. I water them again and cover with thick hay or straw and give the whole lot another good watering. A few months later I'm guar- anteed to have a rich bed, ready for new sowings or plantings. You don't have to weed either before you treat your soil to its beauty sleep. 7 0 New Moon. 8-14 A week to Plant and sow leafy annuals: chervil, coriander, dill, anise, borage, cumin, lettuce, cabbage, silverbeet. endive, pars- ley, etc. All annuals being required to grow, mature and produce in a short period of time, need good soil and regular feeding.

Now, the implementation of the require- ments is virtually nil! According to the Bank's own findings, only about half of its agricultural projects are achieving their goals and only about one third of research and extension projects are implemented satisfactorily.

Bovine Somatotopin (BST) - US Consumers Oppose k Europe Bans t Canada Exposes Company Bribery The genetically engineered hormone used to increase dairy cow milk production is ne\u00e1essitat- ing greater use of antibiotics for mastitis. Milk from BST- treated cows contain higher concentrations of insulin-like growth factors which could increase cell proliferation in the bowel wall, leading to tumor growth. American consumers are increasing their campaign against BST, and in response to cam- paigns by consumer and animal welfare groups the Agriculture ministers of the European Union have banned its use until the next century. They have not, however stopped production and export of the hormone from the only two BST factories in the world, both in Europe!! In Canada, one government official admitted he was paid by Monsanto, one of the two compa- nies marketing BST, to lobby for BST within the Canadian government. Another official admitted that the same company attempted to bribe Health Canada with \"several million dollars\" to approve BST. BST has been twice rejected by Australian authorities, but only \"for trade reasons\" because Europe would not take our dairy exports if they came from BST treated cows.

April / May '97 27 Nimbin News Dress up for the Parade! 28 PROGESTERONE - WHY YOU NEED IT!! A documentary screened by the ABC late last year raised awareness of increased sterility and cancer in male ani- mals around the world as a result of increased absorption and intake of synthetic oestrogens. This is also the situa- tion with men and women, especially women on the con- traceptive pill, or HRT, or those pre/post menopausal. OESTROGEN DOMINANCE and the lack of BALANCING PROGESTERONE can cause a wide range of conditions in women, including pre-menstrual tension, fluid retention, weight gain around hips and thighs, depression, mood swings, mi- graines, fatigue, blood sugar irregularity, loss of libido, infertil- ity, osteoporosis, blood clotting/thrombosis, uterine fibroids, endometriosis, breast cancer, fibrocystic breasts, ovarian and uterine cancers. Oestrogen is produced naturally in the body and regulates the first half of the menstrual cycle. It is also prescribed medi- cally to women, especially as they approach menopause and in the mistaken belief it prevents osteoporosis (it only delays it for around two years). Oestrogen dominance is also caused by the intake or absorption of oestrogen-tike substances over the last 50 years from all petrochemical products, including pesticides, plastics, microchips, medicines, clothing, almost all foods, soaps, even perfumes. This is resulting in an epi- demic of reproductive abnormalities, in males as well as fe- males. Natural progesterone protects the body from these condi- tions by balancing oestrogen in the second half of the men- strual cycle. A study over 40 years has shown that natural levels of progesterone protect women from nine-tenths of all cancers that might otherwise occur. It has been proven to reverse osteoporosis, increasing bone density, even in women in their seventies. Synthetic progestins in the contraceptive pill and hormone replacement therapy do not provide this protection and stop production of natural progesterone in the ovaries. Women's ovaries are now ceasing to produce progesterone, whether they are taking synthetic progestins or not, at around age 35 rather than at menopause (around 50). This age is decreas- ing with each generation. It is essential that women start to provide their bodies with progesterone. Men have also benefited from it for osteoporosis, prostate problems, and low sperm count. Lismore Classical Herbalist, Maureen Calear, will be screen- ing a video presentation on this topic by Dr. John A. Lee. Dr. Lee is an expert on progesterone and is responsible for rais- ing awareness of this situation around the world for over twenty years. He has written a book on the subject to educate the medical profession and another for women, called What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Menopause'. The video will be screened, free of charge at Nimbin Hall on Tuesday, April 22 at 7pm. Maureen will talk about the availability of proges- terone and answer any questions.

The Foundations of Health by Anthony Stillone (Fundamental Foods, Lismore, ph: 066 222 199) The Digestive System The health and vitality of all tissue is dependent upon the body's ability to assimilate and utilise nutrients and remove toxic wastes. Essential processes for life such as the generation of energy, ti3sue build- ing and repair, healing and detoxification are reliant upon the cc-ordinated functions of the digestive system. Thus, dysfunction or diminished activity of the digestive system can af- fect our state of health. Some herbs that will help restore digestion are: STIMULANTS Normally bitter herbs that stimulate the functions of the digest ye system and improve assimilation and elimination of wastes; will help promote the production and secretion of digestive juices, including hydrochloric acid, gas- tric enzymes, and pancreatic enzymes and hormones and enhance pen- stalsis (passing food through the gut). They also help promote th3 microbial environment of the gut and repairing the wall. Examples - Barberry, Goldenseal, Agrimony. Some indications would be:- anorexia, lack of appetite, dyspepsia, food allergies, hypoglycaemia, poor bowel flora. ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY Cellodial minerals, Sodium Phosphate - acid balancers, Potassium Chloride - congestion. A well-balanced diet includes lots of raw vegetables, especially, carrot, celery, beetroot and cabbage. This is only a guideline. Consult your health professional if problem persists.

Ph: 217176 News Why All The Fuss? The MABO case largely concerned native title on Crown land. The WIK case concerned land which is, or has been, subject to pastoral leases. In WIK the High Court decided that the native title and pastoral leases can co-exist. This decision followed action in 1993 by the Wik people of Cape York claiming native title co-existed with current pastoral leases: and by the Thayorrc people claiming native title on neighbouring Crown land which used to be subject to pastoral leases. The rights of pastoralists take priority over the rights of native title holders. Indigenous people cannot interfere with the rights ol pastoralist to operate their cattle stations. Dossier Sent To Europe Foreigh Minister Alexander Downer refused to sign a proposed Trade Agreement and Joint Political Declaration in January this year. vtii Ic it contained human Rights provisions. Now. The Northern Lands Council has sent a dossier to the Luro- pean Union outlining its concerns of breaches to international obli- gations. The NLC chairman asks ''Just what is the Australian Government trying to hide from? The European Parliament should know that by attempting to extinguish native title, the government would he dem- onstrating scant regard lor the human rights of indigenous Austral- lans.

A few people I have shown this article to have been rather horrified, yes, its graphic in its description of 'The Dark Side of Recycling.' Many simply refuse to acknowledge that such practices are being carried out here in Australia. I re- member well as a (country) child being told that 'the old hags gone to the glue factory' when an animal, especially a horse had died. Rendering plants play a role in the commmunity by dispos- ing, via a process of extracting and melting, the excess waste of supermarkets, butcher shops, poultry growers, and road kills. This is where 'Blood and Bone' comes from. The basic ingredient for most animal foods is meat meal or bone meal. One of the most dis- turbing aspects of this whole business is that many such substitute feed, is fed to animals that humans will eventually eat. With all the recent concern regarding 'Mad Cow Disease and how it was passed from sheep to cattle via feed, it's time to question all practices that allow dead animals to enter the food chain. How many are still unaware that 'gela- tine' is made from horses' hoofs? Following the article we have re- printed a recipe for making your own pet food.

Ed.] The rendering plant floor is piled high with \"raw product\" thousands of dead dogs and cats: heads and hooves from cattle, sheep, pigs and horses; whole skunks; rats and raccoons - all waiting to be processed. In the 90-degree heat, the piles of dead animals seem to have a life of their own as millions of maggots swarm over the carcasses. Two bandanna-masked men be- gin operating Bobcat mini-dozers, loading the \"raw\" into a 10-foot-deep stainless-steel pit. They are undocumented workers from Mexico, do- ing a dirty job. A giant auger-grinder at the bot- tom of the pit begins to turn. Popping bones and squeezing flesh are sounds from a nightmare you will never forget. Rendering is the process of cooking raw animal material to remove the moisture and fat. The rendering plant works like a giant kitchen. The cooker, or \"chef', blends the raw product in order to maintain a certain ratio between the carcasses of pets, livestock, poultry waste and super- market rejects. Once the mass is cut into small pieces, it is trails- ported to another auger for fine shredding. It is then cooked at 280 degrees for one hour. The continuous hatch cooking process goes on non-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week as meat is melted away from bones in the hot 'soup'. During this cooking process, the 'soup' Produces a fat of yellow grease or tallow that rises to the top and is skimmed off. The cooked meat and hone are sent to a hammermill press, which squeezes out the remaining moisture and pulverises the product into a gritty l)Owder. Shaker screens sift out excess hair and large bone chips. Once the batch is finished, all that is left is yellow grease, meat and hone meal. A Meaty Menu As the American Journal of Veterinary Research explains, this recycled meat and hone meal is used as \"a source of protein and other nutrients in the diets of poultry and swine and in pet foods, with lesser amounts used in the feed of cattle and sheep. Animal fat is also used in animal feeds as an energy source.\" Every day, hun- dreds of rendering plants across the United States truck millions of tons of this \"food enhancer\" to poultry ranches, cattle feed-lots, dairy and hog farms, fish-feed plants and pet-food manufacturers where it is mixed with other ingredients to feed the billions of ani- mals that meat-eating humans, in turn, will eat.

Paul Watson The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has been researching the idea of creating an industry using naturally molted baby harp seal hairs. After four years we are showing the following re- sults: They can be plucked without causing injury or trauma. They are quality heat retaining fibres ideal as insulating materials. Better than eiderdown, they also have water repellent qualities. Two companies are willing to invest in natu- ral bedding materials, etc. They can be marketed as cruelty-free prod- ucts. 60 seals could provide a bedspread worth about $4,000 (Canadian). Seal collectors could receive about $200 per kilo of hair. Unfortunately, the Society is having difficulty getting permits to start this commercial venture as traditional sealers are opposing the scheme. There is nothing noble or endearing in bashing a seal pup over the head and what we are offering can provide jobs and inject money into a depressed economy. Why do some seal killers, bureaucrats and politicians find fault with this concept? Source: Animal People, Jan/Feb '97. Trouble in Greenpeace Sixteen members of Greenpeace at a meeting marking the 25th anniversary, demanded in an open letter, that the organisation should make 'a ceiling on salaries and a levelling out of the hierar- chical structure'. They were chaired by David McTaggart who was 'retired' or 'kicked upstairs' - versions differ - in 1991. Uninvolved, was Paul Watson who was at the formal foundation of Greenpeace in 1972 and was forced off the board of directors in 1977. He founded the Sea Shepherd Society in 1978. Watson is of the opinion that Greenpeace has become \"nothing but the Avon ladies of the envi- ronmental movement, knocking on every door ask- ing for handouts'. Global membership has declined from 48 million in 1990 to 30 million today. Source: Animal People, Jan/Feb '97.

Dugongs On The Reef In response to reports that 70% of the dead dugongs discovered in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park during the past 18 months were killed by gill nets, the Environment Minister issued a veiled warning to the fishing industry. He indicated that the Commonwealth has various options that could be invoked, including creating sanctuaries under the Marine Park Act or taking action under the various Endangered Species and Conserva- tion Acts.

A three year process has begun, to negotiate details of the protocol, Public Interest Groups want a ban on all commercial transfers of GEOs un- til the Protocol is in force but this has been rejected to date. The Protocol's strongest support is from the Group of 77 (G77) less industrially de- veloped countries, custodians of most of the worid's natural biodiversity who have little scientific exper- tise to manage and protect it from GE organisms. Protocol opponents include industrial groups, coun- tries with big gene tech research and development programs -USA, Japan. and Germany. Australia acts as a surrogate for the Americans who can't fully participate as they are still not members of the Biodiversity Convention. Our delegates. officials from the Department of foreign Affairs and Environmental Australia, argue the protocol should cover only technical issues and the Advance Informal Agreement of countries re- ceiving GEOs. They ignore many legal, social. economic, and financial matters, such as the li- ability of transnational companies the main trad- ers in GEOs - for organisms that run amok. They also argue for a Protocol that would facilitate inter- national free trade in GEOs, not put bio safety first.

If You Can't Stand the Heat, Go Shopping Researchers from the Centre for Disease Con- trol and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, USA, com- pared 339 Chicago citizens who died during a se- vere heatwave with a sample of people matched for age and general state of health who survived. It was found that the only really effective safeguard was air-conditioning. Fans made no difference to survival as they only move hot air around. The importance of checking on elderly people during heatwaves was stressed and it was suggested that they could be taken to shopping centres if air- conditioning was not available at home. Source: New Scientist #2039 Upstairs I Downstairs Ten minutes of simple exercise three times a day is more effective than 30 minutes three times a week. This was the finding of David Owies from the School of Human Movement at Deakin Uni- versity who devised an exercise program for 23 sedentary women aged between 19 and 54 who worked at a large Melbourne hospital. Their per- formance was compared with that of women who exercised three times a week but for 30 minutes at a time. His research suggests that exercising less rigorously for shorter periods is just as effective John Inglis Electrician CL 16693C Robb Road, Lillian Rock NSW 2480 897275 014681463 and offers the same cardiovascular benefits as the more strenuous program. The cardiovascular fitness of the 23 women improved by 25% over a six week period. For each session they walked briskly for 10 minutes, climb- ing stairs and stretching their upper body, neck, shoulders and wrists. At the end of the session they exercised their hamstrings, quadriceps and calf muscles. Source:New Scientist #2047 Sports Drinks Don't Perform Well A researcher at Monash University in Melbourne has questioned the idea that sports drinks boost athletic performance. Those exercising or compet- ing intensively for up to 90 minutes would gain as much benefit from drinking water, says Glenn McConnell, a lecturer in exercise physiology. And for events or exercise of longer duration the ath- lete would do just as well with water laced with a dash of sugar, 6 grams of sugar for every 100 mIs of water with cordial to taste. Sports drinks normally consist of water with a 6% concentration of carbohydrates and salts called electrolytes which are supposed to improve per- formance by maintaining blood sugar (glucose) levels during exercise when stored glucose levels run low. In McConnell's laboratory welt-trained ama- teur athletes rode an exercise bike at an intensive pace for about an hour during which time they drank a placebo or a 6% carbohydrate solution. They be- came exhausted before their muscle glycogen (stored glucose) levels be- - came critically low. Although the carbohy- drate drink increased blood glucose levels it did not contribute greatly to energy needs and therefore did not improve performance. For elec- trolytes to make any difference the concentration would have to be increased to a level that would be too salty to be palatable. Source:New Scientist #2047 Schizophrenia Breakthrough? Researchers have just finished a trial on 50 schizophrenics with some dramatic responses. They used unsaturated fatty acids extracted from mackerel, herring, sand eels and a fungus found in carrots. It is now thought that the cause is a defective nerve cell membrane and the researchers have concluded that up to 80% may be deficient in un- saturated fatty acids. There is now real hope that this disorder which affects 1 in a 100 people, may be alleviated. Source: Syd. Morning Herald Sept '96 via Australian Wellbeing No 66.

They found that the single greatest factor was not cats, house mites or air pollution, as had been expected, but cockroaches - specifically cockroach droppings and carcasses. Smoke for Weak Bones A 1995 study of fractured shin bones showed that the average time it took for smokers' bones to heal was 276 days, nearly twice as long as the 146 days needed by age- and risk-matched non- smokers. Another study that focused on broken ankles found that smokers were four times more likely to suffer a failure of the bones to knit prop- edy. Eat Meat for More Cancer Studies going back 20 years have linked a meaty diet with cancers of the colon, rectum, pan- creas and prostate. The latest study shows that a diet high in red meat doubles the risk of lymphoma. Eat Less and Live Longer It has long been known that laboratory mice on a kilojoule-restricted diet are healthier and live longer but now a study of 200 monkeys shows the same results. Of a group fed an unrestr diet over a period of years, half died pre maturely, but of those who ate 30% fewer kilojoules only 12.5% died early. The food-restricted monkeys develped less cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Veg & Fruit for Hair Although male pattern baldness is g netic researchers now believe that the rate of hair loss can be moderated by a vegetarian diet. DHT, a potent form of testosterone, contributes to hair loss. A high-fat, low-fibre meat diet boosts the level of testosterone available for conversion to DHT whereas a low-fat, high-fibre vegetarian diet has been shown to reduce levels of testosterone (though it doesn't affect sex drive).

Mad Cow Disease The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in the US warned that melatonin supplements - often taken as a 'natural' sleeping pill - are most commonly made from the pineal glands of cattle. Accordingly, they should be viewed as a possible BSE'CJD nsrnission vector, especially if they origi- nated from a nation where BSE occurs. Synthetic melatonin is available, however. \"Natural\" calcium supplements are often made from cattle bones, which may also be a vector for BSEI CJD transmission. Also, cattle bone calcium may contain dangerous levels of lead from car exhaust. The lead content of food supplements, is not fed- erally regulated. Rabbits Revenge?

Beautiful, warm, sunshiny day and the birds are call- mg.. calling... The Tuntable Falls AGM from hell turncd out to he a tough but not unpleasant two days. I think we were all on our best behaviour really, not wanting to open up old wounds from an hori'ific year of recrimination, misunderstanding and paranoia. The hug in the bed was of course - the Rainbow Cafe To explain the situation I shall revert to grossly inclusive labels. There are two main camps and lots of other small groups & indi- viduals. The Economic Rational iSIS' tlti uk that the Rainbow Cafe, as an asset, should earn income for the co-op. The 'holders of the dream' feel that the Rainbow is a coninlunity space and should not he governed by monetary concerns.., and then there are the rest of US. AIL of us are mighty sick of hearing the arguments & rational i sat ions of the issue, but teal ly. the Rainbow problem has brought into focus a much deeper problem: that of the authority to govern ourselves and accountability. Now, we have always had monthly - open to everyone - 'tribal' meetings. where issues are discussed, decisions made and voted on: and t hen acted on by ott r elected co-ordi mites, (the Board): if they are legally enactable. Benig a co-operative, we have to conform to certai it standards and there are requirements that we have to meet. I call it 'hoop jump- ing' . These hoops have changed over time until now the 'tribal' meetings have no authority at all and all decision making is vested in the Board. The Board alone being held legally responsible. one of the hoops we have to jump is that all our rules and by - laws conform to what the Co-op Act dictates: and we've found that the written sentence that used to give some power to the tribal meet- ings to make decisions and give direction to the board has been elimi- nated from the text. Ostensibly because it would not get past the Co- op administrators. I know that claims can be made that the tribal meetings can he stacked, and that not enough people come to make them democratic (apathy rules). But really, this adherence to being 'ruled' brings it lump to my throat. I mean, it's just like 'out there' in the 'real world'. How embar- rassing! To think that this coin munity that helped bring about the sharing of land - vIO's, and changes in the building regulations is now tied hand and loot and denied a legitimate say in decision maki 11g. ex- cept at an AGM. The shame What can we do'? Firstly we can challenge the Co-op Act and insist on the changes we requ i ic: and if . that doesn't work, we may have to choose a form that better reflects what we want to do.

P0 Box 242, EUROA, 3666 April / May '97 Meanwhile in town Visions of Nimbin is happening, It seems ironic that while the 'Vision' is being celebrated in town, the 'reality' bites us on the bum at Tuntable. Not that there is any- thing wrong with reality, so long as you can have a say in its crea- tion. It's now 330pm and I'm sitting in the NN office, which is awash with water from the storm that just passed through. I walked around the 'Vision' and was impressed by the many and varied aspects of what we are. It shows the world what we have achieved since moving to this beautiful place. A much different re- ality to the dope hustling up-town, which is what most people see when they come here. The Vision shows what happens behind the scenes, in peoples homes and workspaces. etc. Solid achievements brought about through hard work. Pity about the rain! Anyway, back to the meeting. There were enough of its there to decide not to sell the Rainbow Cafe, But I must confess, being a Libran. I vacillated from the position of selling to not selling and hack again several times during the year, seeing good reasons for both courses of action and still hadn't decided when I arrived at the meeting. B itt I fiiu nd in y hand shot it p (ott its ow ii accou rut) when the vote was taken, to give 'The Dream one more chance. You may have noticed that the cafe was open over Easter, and I popped in there for a while. The vibes were positively benign and I noticed that a lot of my friends were there. The people running it were keeti and competent, the food quite uiice and the entertainment low keN, and pleasent. I hadn't realised how much I'd missed the place and I hope it will be open soon for good. Meanwhile, hack on the farm, I'm eating the cortu that Wolfy made possible by devising a string spider-web over the vegie gar - dcii, to keep the hush turkeys out.

Nimbin News has spoken with both Faye and Russell and you can read about them on pages 6 and 7. In it recent edition of the Community Quarterly it was reported that Greens' Senator Bob Brown had commented on BHP's salary grant of 2.2 million per annum to its chief executive. He said it was an appalling sign of the growing gap between rich and poor in Australia and he wondered how much BHP is going to get on a plate from the government's diesel fuel rebate. He would also like to know how much is taken from unemployed youth to he spread over to the overpaid, middle-aged in corporate comfort. The present government seems to be heavily cutting back on all the reasonable gains of the recent past.

On every visit to Nimbin I've had a feeling of deja vu. I first came here in the winter of 1992. We then lived in Lismore and the long drive to Blue Springs, past Nimbin Rocks, reminded me of the landscape around Goa, known to visitors from abroad. These first impressions appealed to a purely visual sense. In 1993 when my son moved to Nimbin from Lismore, I stayed long enough to be \"converted\" by the spiritual ambience and ethos of the place. For now I had time to study my surroundings. I was agreeably surprised, for they were very much like the peace and quiet I had known when I visited Dhanastala, headquarters of the Dalai Lama, nestling in the Himalayan foothills. It is said that people make places, and much about Nimbin and its residents reminded me of home. For instance, I met a number of people who were familiar, and who had pleasant and rewarding experiences of Rajneesh's ashram in Poona and holy places like Benares and Hardwar. And, surprise of surprises, many of them had adopted Indian names, associated with sages and mystics. I must admit I am not a religious man, but I am drawn to those who have faith in religion. Hence, it was soothing and relaxing to discuss what the visits to Indian ashrams had meant to those who live under the Southern Cross. There was also a meaningful approach to life, rejecting the superficial, mate- rial, indeed artificial, values of a civilisation that equates development, and its attendant evils, with progress. I saw for myself a healthy way of life, which we could achieve not by harnessing (what a word!) but by living in tune with, Na- ture. All this was confirmed by a visit to the Rainbow Power Company. I saw for myself the marvellous manner in which energy from the sun had been tapped; entire households served by solar power. Here, I felt, was something we in India could learn from Nimbin for most of our cities are subject to regular blackouts disrupting industry and interrupting the normal tenor of urban life. That solar power interests the intelligentsia was evident, for on my return to India, I wrote an article on the Rainbow Power Company which evoked greater response than any of my contributions on other subjects. I learnt later that quite a few queries were addressed to the Rainbow Power Company. In some respects Nimbin reminded me of the land where Ulysses was be- guiled by the soft air and sunshine and captivated by the landscape, which was \"forever afternoon\". But it would be misleading if this conveyed a picture of Nimbin as \"lotus land,\" for I have known and seen people who have been as busy as bees the livelong day, laying out their organic vegetable gardens and planning and building their own homes. Some of these are a tribute to their remarkable imagi- nation and ingenuity, like the railway compartment which has been converted into a neat, artistic dwelling. And I have been greatly impressed and amazed by the fortitude and resilience, the strength of body, soul and spirit of men and women who have turned their backs on the cities to spend the evening of their lives to live a full life, all by themselves and at one with nature. It needed Mahatma Gandhi to evoke a similar response in the early years of India's freedom struggle. Alas, that spirit is now dead. It is encouraging to find it kept alive, here so far away from home. Dec/Jan '97 3 Nimbin News Dear Sir/Madam, During September 1996, David Hallett, President of the Nimbin School of Arts and well-known poet and organiser of community and cultural events, made an \"official\" visit to Woodstock in upstate New York, USA. This visit was to assist in acknowledging the Sister Village Con- nection which has now been formalised by both Lismore City Coun- cil and the Woodstock Town Board. Through the excellent or- ganisation and promotion by the Woodstock Museum and White Buffalo Multi Media, an extensive contact was made throughout the Woodstock community. There were meetings, readings and liaison with a great diversity of community, local government, arts, education, media and business groups. The premiere of the highly-rated documentary, \"Nearly Normal Nimbin\" (which screened nationally on SBS, Australia, earlier this year) proved to be a great promotional and informative \"tool\" in introducing the unique history and culture of Nimbin to the people of Woodstock. The Woodstock community was entranced and fas- cinated by the documentary and by the obvious associations be- tween the two villages, both in their festive backgrounds and in the concentration of arts and tourism shared by both villages. Nimbin's \"ambassador\" was able to meet, discuss and relate sto- nes and poetry of Nimbin to Woodstock audiences, many of whom were unaware of our landscape, our communities, climate, the extent of tourism and visitors in the area, and many other factors which were raised, questioned and discussed with great interest by people in Woodstock. Woodstock Museum arranged appearances at the Woodstock Town Board, Woodstock Library, Woodstock Youth Theatre, tel- evision stations TCI of New York and Woodstock's Channel 3 (twice), Radio WDST Woodstock, together with several appear - ances and performances (in conjunction with the Nimbin docu- mentary) at the Woodstock Museum. One of David's major ap- pearances was to 1200 members of the Jewish community at the Yorn Kippur celebration in Woodstock. In all of these and other meetings, David Hallett was most graciously and hospitably re- ceived as Nimbin's official visitor, and members of the Town Board were most interested in furthering the NimbinlWoodstock Con- nection, and they were pleased to receive the official proclama- tion of the Sister Village relationship. Moreover, Lismore City Council's gift of two framed photos of the Nimbin valley were most appreciated and they are now on display in the Board's cham- bers. Two members of the Board have also expressed interest in visiting Nimbin during our 1998 festival anniversary. Woodstock Museum conducted a very effective media campaign in radio, television and print media throughout their community, and this attracted further interest in the regional and national me- dia in the USA, just as the Nimbin/Woodstock Connection has ittracted national media attention in Australia in recent months. The media information campaign was so well executed that it is most unlikely that anyone in the Woodstock community remains unaware of the connection between our two famous villages. Moreover, David's appearances and the popularity of the Nimbin documentary have considerably increased community knowledge and awareness of the attractions and beauty of the Nimbin valley. Forward planning for a major visit to Nimbin by 300 members of the Woodstock community in May, 1998, has been co-ordinated for some months now, and during David's visit to Woodstock, there was considerable promotion and information regarding the cel- ebration of Nimbin's 25th anniversary of The Aquarius Festival. Woodstock Museum has been negotiating with Qantas (and some other airlines) regarding a specially chartered (and fully painted) \"Peace Plane\" to carry the visitors from Woodstock to Nimbin. David Hallett reports that there was a great interest expressed by many of Woodstock's artists, writers and musicians in visiting Nimbin (and Australia) during the anniversary celebrations of May 1-12, 1998. The Nimbin School of Arts believes that the Nimbin/Woodstock Connection is a very positive, creative and powerful international alliance. Woodstock, like Nimbin, is a village that attracts thou- sands of national and international visitors every year, and they are both bustling centres of cultural and community life. For more information on times of meetings etc: Phone 89 1577 BENNY ZABLE RAVE AND THE NIMBIN WOODSTOCK CONNECTION. On Monday 21st October a bus load of activists travelled to Brisbane to protest outside the Sheridon Hotel against Ross Mining over the desecration of Bundjalung dreaming sites at Timbarra. The Bundjalung custodians together with sup- porters put on a strong presentation only to find out that the mining companies AGM is taking place next month. The Bundjulung elders invited us to a full moon gathering to fur- ther discuss action strategies over at the Timbarra action nerve centre. A black green alliance has been formed with Bundjalung to save Timbarra David llallett is back from his official visit to Woodstock. I would like to wish you all a happy healthy end of year holiday break and hope you keep on subscribing to the Nirnbin News for the latest on the Nimbin Woodstock connection. Dec/Jan '97 4 NimbinNews P Pan 7 unityounci1 Im P0 Box 102 Nimbin 2480 Dear Community member We recently had two Pan Corn meetings. This was an attempt to reach out to the wider community, but unfortunately drew a very small attendance. They were however very inspiring and effective. We now want to reach back into the communities and establish a strong network between us. It seems there are no identified networking representatives on communities. Or maybe there are, but we'd like to reactivate and stimulate this network. We are asking if your community is interested in nominating a network representative to become involved in Pan Corn by: 1) stimulating wider participation within the area and within the communities and 2) letting the world know more about the inten- tional communities on the North Coast. Stimulating wider community participation would mean you're network representative would inform most people on your community about Pan Corn events, and similar important events. This could be by distrib- uting leaflets and or talking with people and feeding in- formation into the community meetings. Letting the world know would mean your network representative would staff the stall at the Channon mar- ket - with others on a roster system. From the Pan Corn meetings a stall has been established at the Channon market every month. We will also use this as a gather- ing and meeting place. There are many more ideas and reasons behind why we need to network together however the above two ideas are practical and workable. The following are some of the other ideas and question that were raised at the last Pan Com meetings. They try to capture some of the 'in- tention' and why we want a network. It was thought that we have reached a new era - it is now 20 years that communities have been established on the North Coast. The \"new settlers\" are maturing and the children who were born on communities have reached or are reaching adult life. We are witnessing the first generation of alternative communities. Young and Old Are the youth in the community going to move away and communities will mostly be older people? Or will the young stay or come back and want to buy land or buy shares? How will the old fend for themselves on com- niunities? Are we going to move off our communities to retirement homes in Lismore or the coast? How do we continue to interact with each other so- cially and politically? Is there a need to come together at all? What is the future role of Pan Corn? What is the future of Communities? For the short term Sepp 15 needs to be reinstated so that new people arriving or the 'youth' can establish MO's. Sepp 15 won't be reinstated easily, if at all. We will need to organise a campaign strategy. MO's were displaced from under our very noses. A strong network may have mobilised to stop this? For the long term future (the next year) there could be work shops at communities to gauge the feelings about networking with other communities. What would we want from such a network? Do we want to feel like we belong to a wider community that is growing and is a part of the changing world? Other workshops could be an inspiration for innova- tive future community development and be an active part of the 'new social movements'. Is it possible to claim our achievements and show the outside world that we have something to offer them? From the practical level the Channon stall is a good start - as a gathering point for the network representa- tives and other interested people. This can lead to other possibilities that look at some of the questions raised above. From all these ideas we can organise around a common intention and help build a stronger network and stronger community. Do you want to be involved? We also want to do an update of our mailing list and would appreciate your informing us if you want your name and address kept on our mailing list. Russell Anderson, Simon dough, Alan Hill.

Now the real work begins! We are now eligible to register with the Australian Broadcasting Authority as an aspirant radio station and can apply for a test transmission whenever we are ready.With a bit of luck this will be early in the new year. To do this we need equipment and, you've guessed it, this takes money. Lots of it! We have had incredible support from the community and it is clear that everybody thinks Nimbin needs a commu- nity radio station. We now have over eighty members, many of them with considerable technical and programming skills but not many with any spare money. We need sponsors, donors and ideas for fund raising. MEMBERS - Prominent among our members we are proud to include:Winifred Mitchell - A tireless worker for community projects and one of the founders of the Older Women's Forum whose members work to provide Friday soup and a wonderful Christmas dinner to any who want to come along. Vale Mendelsohn - local wildlife carer who is never too busy to attend to sick and injured animals and who also writes short stories, poems, plays and filmscripts. Vale is planning to work with Nimbin Players to produce radio plays for us. Diana Roberts - Local Councillor who never fails to fight for the rights of the Nimbin Community and is at the fore- front of the campaign to acquire the Nimbin School Site. Rita Tarraran - Resident of Paradise Valley and teacher of Italian at Lismore Heights Primary School. Rita has had experience in radio and hopes to help in presenting pro- grammes.

Continued on P.35 Dec/Jan '97 5 Nimbin News Profile OMSMOR by Tamaso Local resident Faye Scherf recently travelled to Sydney to lunch with Premier Bob Can who presented her with the 1996 Premier's Seniors Achievement Award, plus a beautiful flower arrangement, in recognition of her work within the Nimbin Community. A Busy Girl. Faye is best known through her role in establishing the Friday Soup Kitchen together with other members of the Older Women's Forum but this is by no means the extent of her activities. She co-ordinates Meals on Wheels, is presi- dent of the hospital committee, is involved in the Falls Pre- vention Programme, is a member of the committee work- ing to acquire the Nimbin School sites, is a driver for the aged, a regular churchgoer and a member of the Ratepay- ers Association. In her \"spare\" time Faye makes jams and pickles to raise money to provide the community Christmas dinner which will be held this year in the hail on December 20. Early Days Nimbin News talked to Faye and found that she was born in Melbourne and grew up in Mt Macedon where she attended State School but was tutored to Intermediate standard as there was no High School available. She trained as a welfare worker and for many years lived in Yamba and worked at the Women's Refuge in Grafton. She is still friends with some of the women whom she was able to help at that time. Faye and her husband Baden moved to Nimbin about eight years ago and for the first year she continued her job at Grafton. After retiring she was soon looking for some- thing to keep her occupied and joined the Hospital auxil- iary where she served as treasurer for two years before be- coming president, a position she still holds. \"After that,\" says Faye. \"Things just snowballed.\" The Church's Mission A staunch Anglican Faye would like to see local Angli- cans becoming more involved with their church rather than simply seeing it as a place for weddings and funerals. Controversy arose when she proposed to open the church to provide shelter in the adverse weather during the Mardi Grass. Some folk saw this as a desecration of their sacred building. Faye disagreed. \"The church's mission is to reach out to the wider com- munity and this was what we were doing.\" she said. \"The community was in need and we reached out and serviced that need.\" Faye believes that there are many deeply spiritual peo- ple in Nimbin who are shy of expressing their feelings for fear of ridicule or rejection. These are the folk who could benefit from the fellowship and support to be found within the church. We Are All One Asked about multiculturalism Faye said she didn't know what all the fuss was about. \"We're all people. We're all one,\" she said and then went on to tell of how she had once lived next door to an Italian family, with a Greek family next door to them. They all had daughters who played together from babyhood and who were all able to speak the three languages. Dec/Jan '97 6 \"Multiculturalism wasn't a buzzword then. It never en- tered my head. We were just living it.\" As for the young people of today Faye said she was sad about the lack of opportunities for them, but felt that there should be more voluntary projects available such as a com- munity garden where vegetables, fruit and flowers could be grown for the benefit of people in need. Speaking about aborigines Faye said that her daughter had been friends with aboriginal children in Yamba and still maintained some of these friendships. She said that attitudes needed to change; attitudes of whites to aborigi- nes and also of aborigines to themselves. Faye feels that because whites have treated black people as inferior this belief has become ingrained into aborigines, many ofwhom have very low self esteem. They have been branded as lazy and useless and other derogatory terms but they are in fact very beautiful people. \"They looked after this continent a lot better than we have,\" she said. Loving Yourself Faye feels that a sense of self-worth is very important and that everyone should love and nurture themselves. \"If you don't love yourself you can't expect other people to love you.\" she said with a laugh. Congratulations on the award, Faye. We're all proud of you. NimbinNews IIIII()1IL1 Advist i I 10 N lk it-01 I ~ I I I V 6 V ~ 111 V ~ Proffle by Tamaso Local activist Russell Anderson was one of the Australians who were deported from Malaysia early November for taking part in a World Conference on East Timor. Nimbin News talked with Russell to get a tme picture of the incident but first we wanted to know just how he originally became involved with East Timor. Early Days Russell was born in Goondiwindi, grew up in Tamworth and then lived for four years in Sydney before travelling overseas for five years. He lived in London, Berlin, Barce- lona and then in Amsterdam where he met Saskia, his part- ner who then returned with him to Australia. \"We spent some time travelling around looking for the best place to live in Australia and decided it was Nimbin,\" he said. Diii Massacre In 1991, travelling again to Amsterdam, they went via East Timor to report on a United Nations/Portuguese in- vestigation which was to take place there. Russell was at this time doing freelance radio work and Saskia was work- ing for the Dutch press. To the dismay of the East Timorese people the investi- gation was cancelled so they decided to stage a demonstra- tion while they had foreign journalists on hand to report it. The demonstration took place at the commemoration serv- ice of a boy who had been killed for protesting against Indo- nesia's oppression and simply took the form of banners and the chanting of slogans. About a thousand people were gath- ered at the cemetery when the soldiers arrived and, with- out warning, opened fire on them. Russell was chased and fired upon. \"I started to run and felt bullets whizzing around my head and hitting trees and things as I was running.\" Many people were killed and others were beaten to death, stabbed or run over with trucks. Some were taken to hospital but it was later discovered that they had been fed poison tablets. 270 East Timorese died that day. After a frightening couple of days Russell and Saskia managed to smuggle out tapes, film footage and photographs of the massacre. Realising that the official political attitude to East Timor in Australia was not sympathetic they travelled instead to Europe and spent a year lobbying the United Nations Hu- man Rights Commission, the British House of Commons and the European Parliament Special Forum on East Timor as well as talking to universities all over Europe. Friends of East Timor Upon returning to Nimbin they got together with other people and formed the Lismore Friends of East Timor group and a similar group at the university. An off-shoot of this was the formation of a local group of Amnesty International. The Malaysian Fiasco This last year has been a busy one. Russell has attended six conferences on East Timor, the most notable of which was the recent one in Malaysia which at first seemed to be a peaceful event. Although the government was not in favour of the con- ference the organisers had been advised that it could go ahead provided that it was held in private behind closed doors. Following these guidelines it was held on the fourth floor of a hotel. About an hour into the conference a great commotion was heard outside and the doors were smashed in by a cou- ple of hundred pro-government youth organisation yelling abuse and threatening violence. They stopped short of ac- tual physical harm but demanded that the people leave. The conference participants responded by sitting in a cir- cle, arms linked, and refusing to move. \"It was the best example of a non-violent action Fve seen be- cause none of us were provocative in any way,\" Russell said. However, it soon became obvious that they were about to be physically thrown out so it was decided to leave. This was when the police arrived. The demonstrators immedi- ately left and the police arrested the conference people, all 114 of them. They were not told why they were arrested and were subsequently held under armed guard for twenty- four hours before the foreigners were deported. John Howard and Alexander Downer openly declared that the Australians had gone to Malaysia to attend an il- legal conference and therefore deserved all they got. It has since been decided by the Malaysian High Court that the conference was not illegal and there is a possibility of the group suing for faise arrest. What Next? Russell is convinced that East Timor will one day be- come independent. In the meantime, however, he urges Australians to voice their opinions to the government and join their local support groups. One third of the population of East Timor has already been annihilated and many more will die before the battle is won. Dec/Jan '97 7 Nimbin News NIMBIN OLDER WOMEN'S FORUM LISMORE REGIONAL ART GALLERY by irena Hatfield The Nimbin Older Women's Forum are mostly known for their work in distributing soup on Fridays.ln December there will be soup on the 6th and 13th and then the Christ- mas Dinner will happen on the 20th in the Hall. All comers are welcome. The ladies will then take a break till February. What is not so well known is that this dynamic group of ladies hold informal meetings twice a month where a wide range of topical subjects are discussed. Interesting speakers are invited and recent topics have included a pictorial tour of In- dia, euthanasia, birds of our area, police meth- ods, wild life caring, alternative funerals, bush tucker, eye exercises, and the plight of the chil- dren in Zaire. This last item was delivered by Judy Aiken of Calurla Tea Gardens who is presently planning on spending three years in Zaire as an aid worker. The Nimbin Older Women's Forum meets on the second and fourth Thursday of the month at 1 pm in the Community Health Centre cottage. The Annual General Meeting will be held on Decem- ber 12th. Everyone brings a plate of delicious munchies which are enjoyed in a party atmos- phere before the \"serious\" discussion begins. If you are interested in coming along do not be discouraged by the name of the group. The key word is \"older\", not uoldn! TAMASO The Lismore Regional Art Gallery was es- tablished in 1953 and is the third oldest regional gallery in New South Wales. The Gallery is primarily funded by Lismore City Council being a cultural community service. As a Public Gallery it is a non- profit organisa- tion and therefore attracts community support through financial donations, donations in kind as well as volunteer staff. The government offers taxation incentive to public galleries with all do- nations being a tax deduction. This taxation in- centive is also extended on to donations of artworks suitable for inclusion into the gallery's permanent collection of art. (Call the Gallery if you want to know more.) In August 1995 Marie Nelson was appointed as Public programs and Education Officer. Marie works closely with the region's schools, commu- nity interest groups and the gallery's volunteers. The Gallery has also participated in several traineeships which have offered work experience to technical staff as well as reception and cleri- cal employees. Successes in 1995/1996 The implementation of a comprehensive education program include a quarteriy Educa- tion Newsletter and student art work sheets dis- tributed to all primary and secondary schools. These are based upon current and forthcoming exhibitions and events at the Gallery. Many community groups such as seniors and special interest groups also receive Gallery exhibition and events information. Both of the above initiatives have resulted in a broader audience attending the Gallery. Improved security with the installation of a video surveillance system in the three ground floor gallery spaces has permitted the safe dis- play of the Gallery's Permanent Collection as well as offering a more secure venue for high profile and the Nation's valuable art works to be dis- played. The floor of the Left Bank cafe (in the Gal- lery building) was created by Nimbin artist Maxx Maxted. Maxx's expertise and time was a greatly appreciated donation and has contributed to the uniquely artistic cafe decor. Gallery Merchandising A modest gift shop has been established in the Gallery's foyer where high quality local made arts and crafts are available for sale. L'RAG newsletter The L'RAG has also been revamped and is now a regular quarterly publication. Whilst Marie Nelson steers the operation the newsletter is realised by three vigorous volunteers Shaun Boyd, Lisa Jacka and Margo Dell Rose. Articles are sourced from within the community with sto- nes, artists interviews and national information about the state of the arts being disseminated. In summary, a dynamic year of development and expansion for the Lismore Regional Art Gal- lery ensures that the Gallery continues to pro- vide cultural excellence in community service.

Nimbin's John Hunter has given us a good example of what the Net' can achieve. Martin Butcher, an ex-Melbourne architect, was on an aid project in the Afncan nation of Swaziland when he 'surfed the net' to research enviro-friendly communities where his family might live when their Swazi stint was over. The Sey- chelles and Zimbabwe were apparently among the prospects. However, Martin also found the home page for Nimbin's Permaculture-oriented Jarlanbah community and called John from Metboume when he returned to Aus. Now he's bought a block here, moved to Nimbin with his family and is designing their house and surrounds. He also has some great ideas for sub-tropical architecture designs. Source: Echo, 24.10.96.

He works in Lismore and ignores Nimbin be- cause it is an unattractive town. He bought a house on a hill and a couple of acres which was part of a dairy farm that was subdivided. The weather- board house was trucked down in halves from Brisbane by the original owners who planned to establish an organic herb farm. Its dark stained-wood picture rails make it feel like a set for Summer of the Seventeenth Doll. The first owners planted a lot of herbs and other plants, native and exotic, much of which still survive. At least five Paulownia trees, a Chinese species, each about lOm tall, dominated the scene in more ways than one.They had dropped their leaves, exposing elegant, slender branches, but creamy bunches of flowers remained to dose the afternoon breeze with a lovely perfume. In the morning we saw the neighbours, a German man and an Asian woman.They were walking through their two- acre haven full of Australian native plants with sensible hats on to do a bit of gardening before it got too hot. In Nimbin at 8.30am on a Thursday morning I parked the hired red Magna with Queensland plates outside the pub. In wrap around sunnies, T-shirted belly and clean jeans I thought I was a deadringer for a copper on undercover duty. I thought the ferals would steer clear. But I walked into a Nimbin cliche. The first people I passed were a couple of skinny girls who were probably supposed to be on the way to school. One was anorexic skinny in black the other sitting with her feet up on the seat, revealing an expanse of floral underpants.With them was a skinny boy with bleached hair who might have been sired by Johnny Rotten on an early Sex Pistols tour. \"How ya goin?\" I said to the boy who was lingering in the path and looking me in the eye. \"You wouldn't be looking for any smoke, would ya?\" he asked as I passed. I realised I look like a journalist, and he probably says that to all the journos to maintain Nimbin's image. Nimbin is like the worse end of Darlinghurst planted in paradise.The hippy decorations on the central shops are now a jaded horror-show set and the knots of people and dogs on the street before the chemist and the bank open were all pinched and hassled. Twenty-five years ago a beautiful idea about a new kind of Australian identity had a crazy birth here. Now it is a ruin, a local dead- end, like the Scottish theme in Maclean.\" Nimbin News has answered this article with the following letter. Simon Grose. The Canberra Times P.O. Box 7155CA1%IBERRA MAIL CENTRE 2610 Dear Simon Grose A copy of your article Travelling Somewhere (The CanberraTimes, Oct 5, 1996) has recently come to our at- tention and we wish to take issue with you over several comments you made on our little village. \"Nobody wants to live in Nimbin.\" How strange! A Skills Survey conducted in 1994 inter- viewed over 2000 people all living in and around Nimbin. Most ofthem still live here and more people are coming. Why, if nobody wants to live here?. \"It is an unattractive town.\" We disagree! Nimbin has many very attractive craft shops,eating places, an environment centre, a birthing cen- tre, a museum, bakers, butcher, general store plus health food,organic green grocery, chemist, laundromat, hotel, serv- ice stations, newsagent, two banks, hospital, community health centre, post office etc. etc. etc! All these establish- ments are scrupulously clean and their products are attrac- tively presented. Nimbin houses havewell-kept gardens, many with very old flowering treesand shrubs. \"Skinny girls.....one was anorexic skinny\" We suspect that anyone with a \"t-shirted belly\" would naturally assume that a slender young girl was anorexic.Would you rather she was over-weight and pudgy? \"Nimbin is like the worse end of Darlinghurst\" We can only assume that you know as little about Darlinghurstas you know about Nimbin. Personally we have lived in Darlinghurst and can assure you there is absolutely nosimilarity. \"Hippy decorations.., now a jaded horror show set\" It would seem to us that the observer is the one who is jaded! Our shopfront hoardings are regularly repainted and form part of the colourful attraction of the village.. \"Knots of people and dogs ... pinched and hassled\" Yes, we have street people as do most regions of Aus- tralia in these hard times and, early in the morning, they might not look as good as you who slept in a warm bed all night.. \"A ruin, a local dead -end\" A libellous statement and one that deserves to be challenged.Nimbin is alive and well, vibrant with health, talent and creativity. Accept the challenge, Simon Grose. Come here and stay for awhile instead ofjust passing through. Then you will be able to experience the true wealth of our lifestyle which is not measured by monetary acquisition. Finally may we say that we found your entire article extremely negative. You seemed unable to find anything good throughout the whole northern region (unless it was the\"Australian native plants with sensible hats on\"!) What a pity you had such a terrible holiday! Perhaps it is some- thing to do with your name, Mr Grose. Do you always findthe world a gross place? Best wishes NIMBJN NEWS COLLECTWE We all signed this letter and invite other Niinbin residents to write to Simon Grose with their own answers to his gross article.

Roll Over Moses... A well-known writer on Atlantis and Mu, James Churchward, met an Indian Rishi who was a bit scathing as to how the Chris- tians couldn't understand their own Bible! Rishi: You regard the fact that Moses' created a serpent that swal- lowed up the other serpents, before Pharoah, as a miracle. But it was only mass hypnotism. Churchward: How so? Rishi: The Priests raised their vibrations so as to hypnotise the audience but Moses raised his much higher - and he controlled the audience AND the priests so that his staff became a devouring snake for all to see. Churchward: This is difficult to believe. Rishi: Very well, I'll give you a demonstration. Do you see those two coolies handling those dropped branches? (At this point, the coo- lies dropped the branches shouting, \"Snakes! Poison Snakes!\" and thrashed them with bamboo sticks to try to kill them). Rishi: Watch, as I lower my vibrations and things return to nor- m al... Later, Churchward saw a similar demonstration when an arrogant Professor visited the Rishi. Professor: Now go ahead old man, I'm ready to hear all you know. Rishi: It would be better for you to ask questions. Professor: Well, tell me about - Rishi: Our temple records say - - Professor: That's all wrong - In Professor Y's History of India it says - -(And so it went on, the questioner contradicting everthing). Professor: You know absolutely nothing - I could've found out 10 times as much as you know, in an hour in our library. He snatched up his hat and cane in disgust and then, with an awful yell, threw the cane across the compound, shouting, \"Great Heavens, it's a snake!\" Alter recovering from what he thought was a touch of sunstroke, he left.

Their early morning chorus earned them the name of Bushman's Clock from the pioneers but the aborigines have legend that says that the morning call is signal to the sky people to light the great fire that warms the earth and that to imi- tate the call is taboo for fear of offending the sky people and condemning the earth to perpetual darkness. Kookaburras are very territorial and each family group lives in the same area for many years and will not tolerate a bird from another group en- tering their territory. Their laughing cacophony is sim- ply a way of advertising to other groups that \"this is our territory and you other guys stay away\". 4 Kookaburras pair for life, which may be 20 years in good conditions, but have a very low birth- rate because of their family structure. Young adult birds stay with their parents for up to four years, helping to rear successive broods of young, rather than starting families of their own. This slow reproduction rate makes the birds very vulnerable and the species would find it hard to recover from any major disaster. They were severely threatened by the earlier use of DDT which built up through the food chain and led to them lay- ing thin-shelled eggs which broke easily. Kookaburras feed on insects, small mammals and birds and their eggs, snakes, lizards and frogs and will also take goldfish from garden ponds or chickens from the fowlyard, but they are valued as predators in times of insect plagues. Easily tamed with table scraps and meat, kookaburras are commonly seen around picnic areas where they have learned that titbits are often available. Long prey is beaten to death on the ground or against the branch of a tree and they have been seen to do this with - lengths of spaghetti, bacon rind or apple peel- ing. Kookaburras are widely distributed over eastern Australia and have been introduced to the west. They nest in hollow trees or termite mounds and lay one to four white eggs in spring or early summer. Incuba- tion takes 24 days and the young fledge in 36 days and are then cared for by the fam- .y for another eight to thirteen weeks. Con- it is rare for more than one clutch to be reared The kookaburra is recognised as a symbol of Australia all over the world and the call has been used to introduce newsreels and Radio Australia broadcasts. The kookaburra who made these recordings was named Jacko and would turn on a laugh on request. He became famous as a radio broadcaster, recording star and movie actor. He went on a tour to assist in nature lectures and later a book was written about him. He died in 1939 at the age of fifteen but his call was used for many years after that.

From Business Cards to Colour Brochures MURWIUJJMBAH PRINT SPOT 40 Wollumbin St, Murwdlurnbah Dec/Jan '97 12 NimbinNews Letterf Dear Sir/Madam, An explanation is long overdue. Many years ago, following an initial campaign by the Nimbin Greens, a public meeting at the Nimbin Hall debated the restoration of the Old Terania Shire as the tentatively named New Terania Shire.\" Those present voted to set up a 6-month long feasibility study into the de-amalgamation of Nimbin from the Lismore City Council. Chainng the meeting was the newly elected Lismore City Councillor, Diana Roberts. Bob Hopkins and Diana were notable for their opposition to the idea that Nimbin could run its own democratic council as had been done during the era of the Terania Shire. Members of the 60 or more Green Parties around the globe are committed to the principle of grass-roots participatory democracy. The Nimbin Greens as part of that commitment, first promoted the New Terania Shire at a Nimbin Hall meeting in 1989. This campaign coincided with the estab- lishment of the group now known as the Commu- nity Independents Party which wished to be elected to the Lismore City Council. This group, of which Diana Roberts was a member, were antagonistic to the Green Party and the Nimbin Greens. Bob Hopkins antagonism can be ascnbed to his planned marijuana campaign being adversely affected by the publicity involved in the creation of Nimbin's own shire. As a former member of the Australian Marijuana Party, I have been involved in a campaign to elect a candidate, so Bob cannot claim any originality for his political activities or his motives. They are not clothed in mystery - just more politics. Now these many years later, the feasibility study into the New Terania Shire\" has not yet been reported to the people of Nimbin. Nimbin's share of grass-roots participatory democracy is restricted to the fact that three of the twelve Lismore City Councillors live in the Nimbin Area. One belongs to the National Party, another is a member of the Developers Party and the third is a member of the Community Independents Party. These three councillors therefore represent Lismore, not Nimbin. Dec/Jan '97 The result of the campaign against the Green Principle of Grassroots Participatory Democracy in Nimbin has been to deny the people of Nimbin any effective democracy at the local level. The culprits have maintained an embarrassed silence on this subject but their actions show those who are not committed to grass-roots democracy are actively against this principle. i airi I mi&ii 1II' - So, how about the long overdue explanation about the unfinished business of the feasibility study into the de-amalgamation of Nimbin from the Lismore City Council? The campaign to acquire the old school site for a community centre should include the objec- tive of establishing some workable level of grass- roots democracy. Or are there continuing political agendas in Nimbin which find the principle of de- mocracy to be a threat to the shadowy figures who cannot bring themselves to debate the subject? Speak - or be condemned by your silence. James Hill.

Community Quarterly The Community Quarterly Has A New Ad- dress. In its latest edition (No. 40), it made the following statement:- Community development includes the concept of self-help, participation and empowerment and can be described as a form of 'community poli- tics'. Community politics does not define politics in a party political way, but rather in terms of power and resources. It is an alternative form of politics, bubbling up from within the community and creat- ing alternative power structures which return the control over power and resources to the people. This ensures that decisions can be made from the bottom up, rather than being imposed from above. Information sharing and the building of com- munity networks are fundamental to the process of community politics and community development and are assisted by this journal.

Happy New Year to you all C.O.N.A.R Commitee Nimbin News TE The reviewer in Greenpeace Australia 'zine asks the rhetorical questions 'Will crushing aluminium cans crush the environment?' and 'What if using lead- free petrol only fuelled dangerous divisions in the Green movement?' Dobson's book seems to highlight the idea that small changes such as these may undermine the more permanent big picture! He's a professor of Politics and tries to re-define ecologism and environmentalism, the former word seeming quite un- familiar to us in Oz. He claims that 'ecologism' means a radical change in our relationship with the natural world and also with our so- cial and political life. Environmentalism, on the other hand, take a manage- rial approach which believes that the problems can be solved without fundamental changes to production and consump- tion. Thus our governments do things, such as step up recy- cling programs and provide tax relief on lead-free petrol which deal with symptoms and not the cause. This is an erudite overview which suggests that the great- est potential for the Green movement could be its ability to shape our culture rather than our politics.

SCRATCHES AND DEEPER WOUNDS By Rob Harle, Reviewed by Gail Rob Harle, a local artist and writer, asks the reader to contemplate, \"Is life a literal or metaphoric illusion? Is reality that frozen moment in the psychotherapeutic process of living where conscious and unconscious collide?\" In this his first volume of poetry, Rob has contemplated these perplexing questions of the mind. From the opening lines of the first poem we begin a journey. Ajourney we all must or will take at some time. The journey of seeking our truth, comprehending the complexity of the world we find ourselves in. This offering of one's soul, opened wide, gullible, vulner- able yet with a strength of conviction that the journey will constantly surprise and uplift one along the way, is a true treasure. These words of Rob's, inspired by his life and the chang- ing of time and ideals, is a gift for the lover of fine verse to enjoy. Local events and characters are interwoven through- out the verse. Nimbin and its people are there, easily iden- tified by the uniqueness that is this special place. If you are looking for that special gift or simply want to share with another the love of poetry, or introduce someone to the magic of poetry then this volume would be ideal.

He wittily extols the virtues and the glitz of Nimbin and By- ron from Aquarius to the present. A book of amusing insights and well worth a read. (The above two reviews by Richard C. Bingham). The Tibetan Book of Living & Dying - Sogyal Rinpoche (Random House) A masterly book that carries on the work of Kubler-Ross from a Buddhist point of view. It also throws some light on the current Euthanasia debate. About life-support systems the Dalai Lama is quoted as saying: \"If a dying person has any chance of having posi- tive, virtuous thoughts, it is important for them to live for even just a few minutes longer. If there is no such chance, and in addition a lot of money is being spent by relatives simply in order to keep someone alive, then there seems to be no point. But each case must be dealt with individually, it is very difficult to generalize.\" And again: \"Your suffer- ing is due to your own karma, and you have to bear the fruit of that karma anyway in this life - or another - unless you find some way of purifying it. In that case, it is consid- ered to be better to experience the karma in this life of a human where you have more abilities to bear it in a better way.\" Incidentally, if you always wanted to read the Tibetan Book of the Dead, first published in the West in 1927, and realised that it was too 'heavy' for you - your troubles are over! The author deals with fairly complex material in a very readable manner and brings everything up to date. I be- lieve the blurb on the front cover, 'a new spiritual classic', and you can't go wrong with $22.95 at the Noah's Are Book- shop for a go at meditation and enlightenment, together with some really basic stuff in handling relatives and friends who may be passing on. Len Harper SHARED VISIONS SHARED LIVES Community living around the globe by Bill Metcalf (Findhorn Press) The introduction to Shared Visions Shared Lives ex- plains the methodology - 15 communards from 11 coun- tries offer frank and informative accounts of what it is like to live communally today. The communal groups represented in this book are Riv- erside in New Zealand, Yamagishi Toyosato in Japan, Auroville and Christavashram in India, Kibbutz Elnat in Israel, L'Arche in France, UFA-Fabrik in Germany, Findhorn Foundation in UK, Community Alternatives and Emissaries in Canada, The Farm, Padanaram and New Meadow Run Bruderof in USA, Los Horcones in Mexico and Lothiorien in Brazil. Dr Bill Metcalf admits to being a social scientist but has lived on communes for much of his life including \"Aus- tralia's most famous communal group, Tuntable Falls.\" The final chapter looks at all the contributions and finds the common themes and perspectives. My favourite is about the Findhorn Foundation which is probably the best known intentional community in the world. This account follows the humble beginnings with Peter and Eileen Caddy and Dorothy Maclean to the present day. Dorothy received guidance from \"the God within\" to start the commune. This book debunks myths about com- munal living while acknowledging \"the God within\". Lovely photographs illustrate the book accompanying a really good read. Highly recommended.

In the back of a van the creature thought to himself, \"Who are they? What do they want me for?\" The scientists stopped the van and took him into the labo- ratory. Inside, the creature was put into a cage. He was given food and water. By then it was time for the scientists to go home. The creature tried to chew through the bars of the cage. He succeeded after a few hours. The creature jumped out of the cage and fell into a plasma net. The next morning the Scientists found the creature in the plasma net. They named the creature Snaky. Snaky tried to get out of the cage but he got zapped. Snaky was feeling sad because he wanted to go home. When the scientists went out of the room Snaky slipped his tail through the bars of the cage and pulled out the plug. He jumped out and flew out the door. He flew outside. The scientists drove after him in their van. Snaky flew into the bush. The scientists couldn;'t see him so they drove back to their lab. Snaky went to a special place and his ship beamed him up and he flew home. THE BLACK RAT One day a cat was chasing a rat. I stopped the cat and picked it up. It was a pet rat so I took it home. Luckily I had a cage for it because I already had a rat whose name is Coconut. I named the new rat Vinegar. When I put Vinegar in the cage she ran up to Coconut and it looked like they were making friends at first The two-headed wolf howled, the owl screeched and the full moon got covered by the dark cloud. The silent wings of the black thing swooped down and with its poisoned fangs bit into a rat's neck injecting the poison. It took it off to its home in a high thin rock with a small cave in it and then ate its prey. It curled up covering itself with its wings, then with its tail wrapped around its face, leaving out the ears so it could hear. The black thing is what the humans called it from what they've seen. It is black with short fur, a type of cat face, big ears, feathered wings and an extra long tail, human hands, long claws, back legs similar to hands, also with long claws. Some say that it is a witch's pet and must never be trusted because with long fangs and a tinge of metalic green in the moonlight it takes hens, dogs and even small cattle to where they can never be found again. But what the humans didn't know was the black thing wasn't all that evil. It played about in the moonlight and loved to play pranks on anything that came its way. It even had a name, and that was Shadow. But all of that was almost destroyed when some night hunters were lost. They had an eight-eyed eagle, a bear as big as a mouse and a rabbit which had snake poisoning. But their biggest catch was a three headed stag with a lion's body. Shadow decided to play a small prank by letting the bear which was as big as a mouse go which was still alive and by making the eight-eyed eagle look like it was still alive. When Shadow released the mouse bear it bit her with annoyance. She took a big bite but what Shadow did not know was that the hunters had wanted the black thing to come. So they let off some special gas which turns animals senses off. So when Shadow bit the mouse bear she didn't know that it was injected with sleeping potion. Shadow suddenly felt dizzy. Then everything went black. When Shadow awoke bright lights burned her eyes. \"What! This is not night! I wake up and it is dark! Oh, I see a clearing\" Then Shadow felt a rope around her neck and bars all around her. She went to stand up but she fell down. One day she got the keys with her tail through the bars and let herself out and went back to the enchanted forest to live away from the mouse bear. by Ronnie We would like to feature children's writing in future, also graphics and anything else you'd like to put in the paper.

It gave unequivocal official en- dorsement to PHONICS as the sole, effective foundation to the teaching of reading. It says that, instead of being taught to guess at words or recognise them by their shape, children should learn to sound them out. Their report says that phonics pro- vides pupils with the knowledge to decode and build words and gives more confidence when they need to tackle new texts. Incidentally, the situation in the US has worsened after a whole gen- eration of children have been watch- ing programs like 'Sesame Street' and this has led to an increase in families adopting home-schooling where thay can teach a phonics reading system. Phonics were abandoned in the UK in the '70s and teachers who persisted with it were hounded by the bureauc- racy. Now it is being introduced in Aus- tralia by the 'Spalding Method' by teaching kindergarten pupils the 45 sounds of the English language, with the help of 70 'phonogram' cards.

G & C is not a suitable stop gap until plantations come on line because it a) reduces economic returns, b) increases environmental impacts, c) reduces yields in the short term. G & C is not economically justifiable for increasing yields, long term. Silviculture cannot mimic natural changes in fauna diversity, e.g. trees with hollows and hollow logs are progressively eliminated. There's a high probability that operations will disturb and possibly eliminate threatened fauna unless surveys are carried out. Average cluster size is too small to support one individual of a bird or mammal species. Under 0 & C there will be an estimated reduction of 57-93% in arboreal mammals. Inpacts on the landscape cannot be predicted with any certainty. A reduction of the abundance and variety of vertebrate fauna could be 18-30%. Grazing and frequent fire with G & C may have accumulative adverse impact on biodiversity. The committee cannot reliably assess timber yields at this time. Here are some of the recommendations:- 0 & C should only proceed on a trial basis until sufficient evidence has been collected. It should consider alternatives such as larger gaps upto Sha, in a matrix of unlogged forest. It should be planned over 3-5 years or longer.

She lived in the next street up the hill from me and we often walked home together and became quite good friends. Even so, I did not know a lot of this story until later as Katie was a placid sort of girl, happy enough with her lot and not expecting any more from life than home and fam- ily. She loved her husband and children, kept her home neat and clean, did her bit for the school and never looked for other outside interests. She never complained about Brad the way most women did about their husbands Brad was a typical ocker bloke, going to the pub each evening after work, mowing the lawn on Sunday, doing handyman repairs to the house, kicking the football around the backyard with his son, Stevie, and his mates and not giving his wife too much attention. His daughter Judy, a five-year-old petite blue-eyed blonde, was his little princess and could usually get anything she wanted from him. But as for the boy, Stevie aged ten, he was expected to be tough. It was no use for him to complain that someone had pinched his apple at lunchtime, or tripped him over in the playground. 'Don't come whingeing to me about it.' his father would say. 'I don't want to know about your troubles. I've got enough of my own. You've got to learn to stick up for yourself, mate. Fight your own battles. Don't take any bulishit from anyone. If some kid picks on you, just put up your mits and give him a good stiff whack on the jaw.' My brother worked with Brad and told me how bad-tem- pered he could get, especially after a few beers. After more than a few his aggression led him into fights where some- one ended up with a black eye, a bloody nose or a few miss- ing teeth. He once broke a man's leg and was barred from the pub for six months. As far as I know he never hit Katie but Stevie got a few beltings if he didn't toe the line. Fighting was not in Stevie's nature. He tried to avoid fights and the bully boys at school always found him an easy target. They were bigger than he was and there were more of them so Stevie tried to keep out of their way but this was not easy. He was tripped, pushed and shoved, pinched, punched and kicked, called names, tormented and laughed at and generally made to feel miserable. When Katie asked about his bruises, skinned knees and grazed elbows he made up excuses about tripping over loose bits of footpath or bumping into desks or falling in the gym. Katie thought he must be accident-prone, the latest buzz- word that was being bandied about on radio talks and health reports in the women's magazines. It was near the end of the year and preparations were in hand for the school concert. Teachers were rehearsing kids for class plays, the choir was practising its repertoire and all the mothers were busy making costumes. Little Judy had a part as a fairy but Stevie didn't want to know about making a fool of himself up on the stage with all the bully boys laughing at him. The day before the concert they ganged up on him on the way home from school. He ran and they began throwing stones at him. One hit him on the head. Hestumbled for a moment but picked himself up I and ran harder arriving at the safety of his gate before they caught him. His head hurt terribly and he could feel a big lump under his hair. At tea-time he didn't feel like eating. rWhats up with you?' growled his dad. 'Nothing,' said Stevie looking down at his plate and push- ing some mashed potato around. 'I've got a bit of a head- ache, that's all.' Katie glanced at him briefly. He often got headaches. He looked a bit pale. Maybe he needed a tonic. 'Go and have your bath and get into bed,' she said kindly. 'I'll bring you an aspirin.' 'Stop mollycoddling him,' snapped Brad. 'Do you want him to grow up to be a pansy? What's a bit of a headache? Nothing! Gawd'strewth! I've got a headache every bloody day of my life. You don't hear me whingeing, do you?' Maybe you wouldn't have a head- ache if you didn't drink so much, thought Katie but she knew better than to say this out loud. The next morning Stevie felt sick but he didn't dare ask to stop home. His dad would hit the roof, he knew. Any- way, school would be easy today with the concert on tonight. He stayed in bed until his dad had gone to work, with- out coming in to kiss him goodbye. Stevie guessed he was still mad at him. At school the bully boys cornered him down at the back of the toilet block. He tried to run but one of them shoved him and he fell backwards hitting his head on the brick wall. The bell rang and they all trooped into class but Stevie felt sick. He daw- dled in and was chastised for being late. Halfway through the morning he threw up on the floor and was sent to the sick bay, a bed in the corridor outside the headmaster's office, where he fell asleep. A holiday air of excitement pervaded the school that day. Everyone taking part in the concert was practising their part. Teachers were drilling the performers and checking costumes and props. A team of people had been sent to the Town Hall to get the scenery, lighting and seating in order. The Headmaster was away at a meeting all afternoon but Stevie's class teacher checked on the boy once and finding him asleep left him in peace. School closed early and everyone went home to prepare for the big night.When the cleaners arrived they found Stevie still asleep. They could not wake him up. An ambu- lance was called and Stevie was rushed to hospital. The little fairy had to perform without her parents in the audience and was surprised to find that she had to stay at my place for a few days. She didn't go home until after the funeral and I don't know if she ever really understood why her big brother wasn't there any more. My brother told me that Brad was a changed man after that. He stopped drinking and never got into another fight. Katie said he never talked about Stevie but she did tell me that the part that hurt him most was that he had not kissed him goodbye that morning.

People only want to live in peace.\" It was Bodo's simple philosophy not to hate anyone, whether friend or foe. That was his recipe for happiness and the ingredients for making friendship even with the enemy. However, Dean mistrusted Bodo. There was something about the Jerries which he could not swallow, like efficiency, punctuality and other \"hocus pocus\". Besides, he had no- ticed that Bodo had an eye on Helga and that Helga gave Bodo preferred treatment. Worse still, she gave Bodo such an unmistakeably seductive smile that was unbearable for poor Dean. Being of typical English sober and unromantic descent, he lacked Bodo's charm and charisma. Was it any wonder that eventually Dean started to con- spire, confiding himself one day to Bodo plans for escape?Bodo was horrified, reminding him of his oath.

It happened at my grandfather's place, in the village of Exten on the Weser river in Germany. Since there was war, and my father was at the front, my mother had decided to move out of the city and to take us children to stay at my grandparents' farm. I was six years old, and my grandfa- ther, who loved me very much, had built me a big rocking horse. He put it outside near the front gate and the road, so that I could see all the people passing by and say \"hallo\" to them. That's where I first met Bodo, the hero of my story, a man who, after fifty years, I have never forgotten. Bodo was young, only eighteen years old, when he was taken prisoner of war by the Germans. It was his good for- tune that he did not have to take his vacation in those no- torious prisoner-of-war camps. How did this happen? Bodo told us that when he was interrogated by the Ger- man officer he was given the choice to stay for the rest of the war in a prison camp behind barbed wire or go to live with a private family and work as an unpaid farmhand. Naturally, there was no question in his mind where he would rather go. The farm would provide better food, fresh air, blue sky and a little hope of escape. The \"Jerries\" must surely be monks to believe that he wouldn't take the next opportunity to run for his life to freedom. But then the officer asked him if he knew the meaning of the word \"honour\". Bodo was not so sure what this of- ficer was driving at. \"Well,\" he was told. \"If you give your word that you will never try to escape, (as is your right according to the Ge- neva convention) and, on your word of honour, never break your promise, you will stay with a family on the farm, have good tucker and be well looked after as if you were a mem- ber of the family. You will stay there for the rest of the war. Let's hope it will not be too long.\" \"But there is one hook,\" he continued. \"Should you break your word of honour, and run away, and we catch you, there is no pardon. You will be court marshalled and shot. I must warn you to think it over carefully. In wartime different rules apply and we have no time for chasing you. Now, it is your choice, young lad.\" Bodo did not have to think it over. It was clear to him. With a strong handshake he agreed to honour his word and never retreat from this bondage. He was happy to have been given the alternative to the dreadful prison camp, to work under the blue sky amongst civilians who would treat him with fairness. After all, war was on and many good men, as young as he, had been killed while he was alive. Bodo was brought to the Buschmeiers. The head of the family, Mr Buschmeier, was away at the war and never saw his family again. Mrs Buschmeier was a solid ener- getic woman capable of running the farm with the help of her parents and Helga, her sixteen-year-old daughter. Bodo got his own room and settled in. He spoke an amusing bro- ken German and was, in spite of his gruesome wild looks, a good-hearted fellow. The officer must have spotted his sin- cere characteristics when he offered him the alternative. People could not help liking Bodo. His long black hair was always blowing in his Slavic face and his strong body impressed all the girls. I would often see him racing up the road from the village with wild calls at the two black stal- Dec/Jan '97 18 Nimbin News ever they like,\" he said. However, Bodo was not in the mood to join his partner, reminding him that he could have stayed in the prison camp according to the Geneva convention. He told him: \"What- ever they are, those Nazis, I will not break my word. They have given me the best possible chance to survive this war. I have shaken hands with them and I will honour my word.\" Dean was qwet. The years went by and the war took its toll. One day a courier brought mother Bushmeier the news that her beloved husband had fallen at the front deep in Russia. For the next three months Mrs Buschmeier was seen in black, she was pale and would not talk much to anyone. Sometimes you could see red rings around her eyes from sleepless nights and mourning. That is the universal plight of war widows when they suffer the loss of their most beloved one. One day in January 1945, Bodo had an encounter with a Spitfire. These planes were by now commanding the skies and firing at anything that crawled LL. or moved on the ground.

When the Germans eventu- i t have one ally fired their last shell it was quiet. le limit. Now again, Dean insisted to ithaveone pack in and run for freedom. Bodo realised that all his persua- siveness would be fruitless. Wor- rying about his own position as a prisoner and that Dean's disappearance could also have grave consequences for himself, he slipped quietly away to the village burgomaster, Mr Hoppe, an old man who had lost an arm in Flandria in World War One. \"Good for you,\" Mr Hoppe said. \"That you report this to me. We might just have saved Dean's life by putting him behind bars. Why can't that fool just wait another fortnight when everything is over and not risk his life?\" The village gendarmry came and arrested Dean. A few days later the Americans entered the village and Bodo's liberation had come. Five years of his life he had spent in captivity. But now he did not want to leave his oppressors. What can I say? He had fallen in love with Helga who had by now grown to be an attractive twenty-one year old woman. When the American jeep came to pick him up he was not allowed to stay. \"I will be back,\" he cried. Helga knew by instinct there would never be another woman for Bodo. The war had come; the war had passed; there always would be wars again. The war wouldn't have affected the village a pip had it not been for the loss of so many young men, many of them teenagers who would not return from the battle fields. There were many tears to be seen and sad stories to be heard. Many children were deprived of their fathers. And, from now on, the enemy was in command so there was also the uncertainty of the future. But my grand- father used to say: \"there is always a tomorrow\" and people regained their hope. And what had become of Bodo? He went back to Poland and found his country now occupied by the Russians. He had fought the Germans for the liberation of his country only to find it occupied by a worse enemy, an enemy which imposed communism onto his fatherland, and all that with the consent of the Western democratic allies. However, Bodo's soul was only longing for Helga and he knew he was needed at her side, now more than ever, while the oversexed and overpaid Doodle Yankees roamed around in German fields to have their heydays. He had not a peace- ful moment until he left Poland to march to Germany, one thousand miles on foot as there was at that time no trans- portation existing. Only a desperate man would do that. Who can imagine the joy of the Buschmeiers when he set foot through the door? No eyes kept dry and Helga fell into his arms never to let him go again. The whole village welcomed him as one of their own. When the wedding was about to take place someone asked Bodo: \"what about your religion, Bodo? Aren't you a are all Lutherans!\" And he said: \"God damn! If I worship the Pope or if I worship Luther, what's the difference?\" They were married and her name became Pivinski and that new blood of his did no harm to the villagers. Bodo loved children but mostly he wanted one of his own. That caused no problems and he had many of his own. Once again you could see Bodo, now with his new crew, and his black stallions racing through the village and the people opened the windows and screamed: \"here comes wild Bodo with his gang. He brought us truly a challenge.\" Trouble with Potentials by Valence ZhafI Gulliver Loomstone pulled his particles together and observed the spot where reality had occurred last time he'd measured it. This time all he found were potentials. He tried a few on for size, had trouble finding one to fit. First he became a rock-star, out of sheer nostalgia and just for kicks. Of course the fans went bananas and split his pants - his personality too, in two. From there he leapt across synaptic gaps and landed in the Cadillac of a multi-millionaire, crashing it spectactularly on the first sharp curve. Then he tried a host of variables: politician, gigilo, Olympic triple- medal winner, brain-surgeon, author of ninety-nine best sellers, cyber- punk, priest, surfie, artist, pilot, detective, guru, engine-driver and archeologist (solving the mystery of the Pyramids at last). But nothing even vaguely resembled reality. Gulliver Loomstone was having trouble with his potentials. So he swapped genders and became a mother. He found the screaming intolerable. He went to Covent Garden as a ballerina and was acclaimed, and maimed. In all of his later potentials his toes were never quite the same again. He went rhrough all the above professions as a female feminist and blocked his own successes because of paradoxical feelings of insecurity. Eventually Gull transmutated into fourteen birds on 140 branches. He selected branches at random and, waving his particles around, settled down contentedly; now on one branch, now on another. \"Back to reality at last!\" he chirped.

I'll give you a proflie on each of us so you'll know what you're dealing with. MOONIE 1. A TAWNY FROGMOUTH (PODARGUS STRIGOIDES) sometimes called a mopoke. 2. Not an OWL though she resembles one a bit. Her beak is much wider and she has weaker claws than an owl. 3. Nocturnal. Hunts at night for insects and mice, but expects an evening treat from her closest friend, or version thereof. 4. Rescued after being found wandering dazed and disoriented on the road. Reha- bilitated and released. Absolutely free now but refuses to go away and stays close to the house. 5. Strictly not allowed indoors, but sometimes totters in sideways when I'm not sup- posed to be looking. 6 Not a pet! Moonie would indignantly deny this too although she tries to behave like one. 7 Capable of odd behaviour. Receives and transmits messages between species and sometimes acts like a possum.

Have seen fairies,especially in my child- hood, with long gaps between sightings while such nonsense was being educated out of me. Now happily seeing fairies again in my second childhood. 4 Obsessed with the idea of everyone living 'free', people as well as animals. 5. Fully aware that not everyone wants to be 'free'. they are free not to be 'free' if they don't want to be. 6.Painfully aware that I still don't have enough knowledge about caring for Wild- life, but trying very hard by reading up on it, going to training days, seeking advice from more experienced carers, and above all, following the lead of the birds and animals themselves, whose knowledge on the subject is vast. 7. I love Moonie but have no idea whether she loves me. This is not a priority for me. The lov- ing is important. Being loved is, of couse, a wonderful bonus if it happens, but it can never be forced. 8. Moonie is still a mystery to me, one I may never solve. Moonie and I have known each other for 7 months now. We have learned to accept and live with the fact that the other is hopelessly crazy and may never change.We can always look each other straight in the eye. We have never been shy or evasive about this. Moonie's eyes are large round yellow-orange orbs with black pupils capable of rapid and varying degrees of dilation. Her he CHat %4 Hats from recycled materials created C? by Vale eyes have an extraordinary range of expressions, some easily deci- pherable, like anger, indignation, compassion and greediness. Other expressions are unfathomable to me. You can get lost in Moonie's eyes and find yourself again in another dimen- sion, a timeless greeny-blue and silvery bubble existence which is sharply aware of the slightest movement or faintest sound. In this existence you somehow know things you didn't know before and forget about later. Moonie adores terrorising visitors and most of the visi- tors adore being terrorised. They believe my preliminary as- surances that Moonie is perfectly harmless and trust both of us. Moonie swoops in silently at dusk, wings thrashing and eyes flashing. She does something ferocious with her vocal cords as she lands on shoulders, heads, arms or an outstreched hand demanding dinner. She gets small portions of minced meat to sup- plement her usual diet of moths, beetles and the odd mouse she catches herself. Moonie's table manners are atrocious! She snaps and growls at her food, killing the implement that shoves it down her throat, then shrieks for more. It is an important and very satisfying ritual for all concerned. However, Moonie understands and ac- cepts the words \"all gone\" when the food is finished and always settles down quietly for a pleasant after-dinner chat. The highs and lows of the day are discussed and grievances are shared. We are convinced we understand each other, Moonie and I, though our spoken languages are only vaguely similar and we often have to resort to actions. Recently I had to go away for ten days. Close friends of Moonies were on call for the - evening rituals and after dinner chats dur- ing my absence. The night before I left, Moonie told me what she thought about me trying to sneak off without letting her know. She went into a tantrum and expressed her rage by spitting out her delicious dinner and swooping off into the Sandpaper Figtree, only to return in- stantly and snap at my nose, missing it by a well-calculated two millimetres. Of course I didn't flinch. I apologised and told her all about my trip and her prospective dinner engage- ments. She glared at me horribly and swooped back into the Sandpaper Fig, turning her back on me. She didn't say good- bye in the morning, but then, I hate good-byes too. It was well after dark when I returned home from my trip. I read the note on the kitchen table and was reassured that Moonie had already had her dinner, so I went upstairs to bed. Just as I was settling down to sleep, there was a thud on the roof, a sound I can never resist, so I opened the window and looked out. - Something silent flew onto my shoulder. \"It's good to be back Moonie \", I sighed. She blinked at me with her lower eyelids and leaned against my ear, then I felt a sharp tug and Moonie flew off. I could just see a strand of my hair floating away in the quarter-moonlight. I wonder what on earth Moonie's up to this time. Looking at it objectively, I'm sure Moonie is psy- chic. I gave her a test I found in an old 'zine in the op 'shop. It was headed: \"How Psychic are You?\" Moonie answered all the questions except one which was N/a I(1i1.lJI'['1'1 because it concerned driving a car. Of coseshepa.edthe test with flying colours!

One of the most spectacular designs ever to appear arrived in June'96, measuring 648 feet in length and having 90 sepa- rate circles ranging from two feet to 50 feet in diameter! In another case, a man was camping out on a hill in Wiltshire and at dawn saw a small, white-lighted sphere move across a field below him. He managed to film two of the spheres spiralling across and within seconds a large, compl.x crop pattern materialised. A second pair approached and one of them appeared to lift out of the cereal field and join its partner. They then proceedec to form the elaborate 'snowflake' patterns in the pathways and smaller circles.

Mainstream media will have you believe that any thought of an international conspiracy to control us all, is laughable. Yet others throughout history have rung the alarm bells. So were they all wrong? Winston Churchill: For centuries this worldwide con- spiracy for the overthrow of civilisation, and for the recon- struction of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence and impossible equity, has been stead- ily growing. It played a recognisable role in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement of the 20th century. Alexander Soizenitsyn: There also exists another alli- ance - at first glance a strange one, a surprising one, but if you think about it, one that is in fact well grounded and easy to understand. This is an alliance between our Communist leaders and your Capitalists. Woodrow Wilson: There is a power so organised, so sub- tle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it. Lord Hewart (former Lord Chief Justice of Eng- land): A mass of evidence establishes the fact that there is in existence a persistent and well contrived system, intend- ing to produce, and in fact is producing, a despotic power which at one and the same time places government depart- ments beyond the sovereignty of parliament and beyond the jurisdiction of the courts. And now for OUR pet conspiracy, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). It supposedly is a group of 3,000 Ameri- cans who hold 85% major political appointments with David Rockefeller as a member and huge companies, banks, the Senate and the military, well represented.

Mary Magulagi Yarmirr. Aboriginal Rights by Monica Morgan From early times, the Yorta Yorta people on the River Murray have relied on fish as an economic resource. Since colonisation, they have sought a greater say in river man- agement to protect their cultural heritage, but successive governments have ignored them. The Murray cod holds an esteemed place in their lifestyle, not only as a SOUfCC of food, but as part of creation. Certain sacred water holes are prohibited for food acquisition. As long ago as 1886, a clan of the Yorta Yorta approached the Protection Board with a request that the then Governor levy ten pounds ster- ling on each steamer passing up and down, to make up for the fish that had been driven away. They did not succeed. The High Court ruled in the Mabo case that Australian law must recognise land and water rights. Consequently the Yorta have applied for Native Title and the Federal Court hearing is to commence soon. There IS a place for Indigenous People in the management of our waterways and collec- tively we would share a responsibility that our wetlands and rivers are ecologically main- tained. If we fail we face the wrath of futtjre gen- erations. Source: Habitat Australia, Oct '96.

This was done because of its exceptional natural value as low- land and mountain rainforests. It was only declared thus, af- ter protracted conflict between conservationists and pro-log- ging groups. The management of the land is controlled by the Wet Tropics Management Authority (WTMA) and it has faced many obstacles over the years, both from local antagonism and the Queensland Government. In fact, the latter has suggested that the planning is too 'green' and has advocated bringing in people unfriendly to- wards conservation! The Daintrec is threatened by roads, subdivision and tourists. The Port Hinchinbrook development and the Tully hydro-electric scheme, also add substantially to the risks. Minimising the dairy- ing and sugar production is also a task to be managed successfully in the future. The Commonwealth's recent cut to its funding also contributes to the weakening of the Authority's capacity towards conserva- tion of the Wet Tropics. Source: Habitat Australia, Oct. '96.

There is nothing remotely mystical about it; everyone, possessed of a degree of will power and application, can do it.

Whilst this produces a generally much desired psychedelic or 'stoned' short term effect, it also leaves long term, irreversible effects that that are not so desirable. The following is a short summery of some of the effects of the use and overuse of drugs and marihuana observed through working with rebirthing and aura balancing sessions and other transformational work. Dope Expansion of the mental realm into higher mind con- cepts which are beyond the individuals normal personal experience. Insights received while stoned are often very relevant and sometime cosmic in nature. However, because the mind is stretched artificially beyond its normal func- tion, it pushes feeling into the background. When the ef- fect has worn off and the insights are viewed with and ex- pressed through the mind in its normal function, they are empty raves, separated from the normal feelings and ac- tions. The long-term effect manifests as an inability to ground personal insights and creative ideas in a tangible functioning form useful to self and others, except perhaps for entertainment This effect is not reversible. Rehabilitation is possible through prolonged, intensive inner work. Through this work the physical, emotional and feeling bodies need to mature to a compatible level of the over-stretched mind. When all parts of the individual have reached this compatibility in expansion, the dif- ferent parts can begin to reconnect and come into relationship again. An example to illustrate this is: a university professor and a process worker meet. The university profes- sor has some chance of understanding, the process worker however would find it hard to be con- tented only with process work. The process worker would be able to talk to the professor about his/her own field but not have much interest or connection with that of the pro- fessor's. When the mind is stretched out of proportion to the feelings or the physical body (as in teenage dope addiction), there is little inter-communication or co-operation possible between the mind and the body and feelings. The result is a malfunctioning human who has much difficulty in find- ing suitable fulfilling life situations. In order to achieve such integration, and restore har- monious interaction of mind, body and feeling, much inte- gration of personal biographical stuff and soul karma has to take place. With prolonged use of dope the mind gets stretched to highly transpersonal dimensions. Energetically sensitive people are effected faster than others. It took me nine years to integrate the effect of five joints!... Acid Acid also expands the mind irreversibly. It creates holes in peoples' auras unbeknown to the person. The auric field is greatly expanded under the influence, and the person is hopelessly delivered to influences from the outside and has no control over his/her outer boundaries. Belief structures can leave and enter and create distortion in the personal- ity. The holes ot cracks do not close when the influence has worn off and are not consciously experienced by the person. They leave vulnerable openings for all sorts of psychic matter that is generally floating around in places where drugs are taken frequently. The effect of expansion is not reversible. The auric field is damaged and polluted. The damage can sometimes be repaired with intensive prolonged transformational work. Again the rest of the person has to catch up in openness and maturity corresponding to the state of expansion from the drug. After removing the impurities through much bal- ancing work, the cracks can be healed with spiritual work and meditation. The length of time for rehabilitation de- pends on severity of damage and state of mind and matu- rity before commencement of drug taking. Ecstasy This drug seriously raises my concern. Its long term ef- fects have not fully shown up yet. It opens the crown chakra, not the heart chakra!, as most people seem to think. Under the influence people experience a large amount of divine love. The crown chakra stays open in a right form which looks quite different from naturally opened crown chakras through well integrated in- ner work. The drug experience leaves people with a knowledge of states of divine love and consciousness which make ordinary living consciousness seem dull and unfulfilling. It take a long time to open oneself to such a state through inner work. Many personal experiences have to be lived and integrated to attain such realms on a more permanent ba- sis. Once the ecstasy has worn off the person is left with an effect similar to being in prison whilst having a beauti- ful loving family and kids outside. Prison life is hard to adjust to and hardly fulfilling. My concern about the drug is that it interferes with peo- ples' spiritual development and its effects are not so read- ily physically or psychologically noticeable to the untrained eye. A dulling of the spirit and an underlying, lingering sadness are some of the symptoms. These symptoms are not unique to the use of ecstasy, they belong to a series of conditions connected to our relationship to the divine. Not many people have recognised the effects of the use of ecstasy and have done enough inner work on the subject to report any satisfying results. Heroin Not many people with prolonged addiction of heroin come to workshops or transformational therapy. This is not a good sign as it implies that the addiction is stronger than the will to take responsibility for one's life. Rehabilitation is only possible through prolonged feeling integration if some of the function of the will is intact. Dec/Jan '97 24 Nimbin News I t I J r4p , 7/ t.. hAL., 10 x 20 - _j - FRUIT FLY TRAPS YOU CAN MAKE About 80 native species of fruit flies live in Australia but only six of them have a significant impact. The Queensland fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni is by far the most serious pest. The introduced Mediterranean fruit fly occurs only in Western Aus- tralia. A grower wanting to trap Queensland fruit flies faces two main problems: to have the right lure to have the right trap As far as I know there is still no proper lure to selectively trap the female fruit fly. She is the one you really want to catch because she lays the eggs. A sex attractant (pheromone) is available to lure male flies so that they can be trapped in great numbers, but that is still just a monitoring system - it does not by itself prevent fruit fly damage. Protein hydrolysate, yeast autolysate and huon pine oil lures males and females. But none of these lures are very reliable because they rely on their appeal as food. Success depends on what else the fruit flies can eat in an orchard. They like to graze on the bacteria on the skin of fruit and may prefer that to your lures. A sex attractant is selective in that it traps male fruit flies. Protein in different forms, which the fe- male fruit fly needs to have before she can lay eggs, is non-selective and is likely to trap a lot of other insects as well. Illustrated are three different traps I have used in the orchard. All three can be made easily from scraps. Fruit flies are supposed to be attracted by yel- low, orange and red so painting one of these col- ours around the entrance holes may help. This trap is good to use with a sex attract- anl. The flies can get in easily. They then fly up- wards inside the larger container towards the light. The flies don't know how to get out. If you note many flies buzzing around inside the trap every day you know they must be active - trapped flies die of starvation after about two days. This simple trap works on the principle that fruit flies are very poor swimmers. If protein is used the liquid will be brown, making it hard to see what you have caught. With water and sex attractant (three drops) or huon pine oil (10 drops) you can see what you have caught. If you see flies floating they are fresh - they take a few days to sink to the bottom. I am not keen on this trap. It seems to catch too many other insects by accident. Source: Going Organic Lead kills Spanish birds as hunters shoot wild. Poor marksmanship is to blame for the record numbers of waterfowl poisoned each year in Spain's wetlands. A report commissioned by the Spanish government says stray lead shot is re- sponsible for the deaths of between 25000 and 30,000 birds every year. Waterbirds are not the only victims. Vultures, eagles and buzzards have died after eating poi- soned birds. The weakened fowl are easy prey for mammals and birds of prey. Several cases of sec- ondary poisoning in raptors and carrion eaters have been detected, including two golden eagles, one of which had 40 pellets in its gizzard. Hunters and their families are also at risk if they eat the birds. The liver of a single poisoned bird can contain enough lead to push a person's blood lead level over the limit recommended by the World Health Organisation. It was found that every season the countries 1.3 million licensed hunters leave behind around 3000 tonnes of lead. For every bird bagged, at least two shots miss the target. These pellets end up in the marshes and wetland, the birds eat grit to help digestion thus swallowing the lead too.

The authors say new ways to deal with city mn-off must be found to tackle the pollution. They report, up to 70 per cent of the chemicals found in San Francisco Bay come from everyday activities of ordinary people. Such pollutants include oil from leaky cars and copper-laden dust from their brake pads, as well as garden fertilisers and pesticides. These are washed into storm drains untreated and eventu- ally end up in rivers and oceans. Source: New Scientist, #.1980 Hungry enzymes thrive on toxic slime. Toxic blue-green algae may have met their match in a bacterium that destroys their poison. Microbiologists in Australia have found a group of enzymes in the bacterium that will break down the toxic from Microcystis, a common blue-green alga. They plan to grow the bactenurn in bulk, freeze- dry it and release it into waterways and treatment plants. Blue-green algae are not really algae at all, but bacteria that obtain their energy from sunlight, through photosynthesis. Because of their blue- green colour they are also known as cyanobacteria. In summer, a combination of warmth, calm water and a build-up of nutrients can trigger blooms of cyanobacteria. Any toxins that they produce appear in large amounts in the wa- ter, and can cause fatal liver disease in livestock. The toxins produced by Microcystis have also been blamed for the exceptionally high rates of liver cancer in people in China. A student from the University of Queensland found the toxin-beating bacterium, an asyet un- named member of the genus Sphingomonas, in river water in 1993. Working with the CSIRO's water division, David Boume found the bacterium makes three enzymes that break down the most powerful toxin produced by Microcystis called microcystin LA. The findings will be presented to the First International Congress on Toxic Cyanobacteria in Denmark. Source: New Scientist, #.1980 A sound treatment for dirty petrol stations. Oil spills that contaminate the soil around pet- rol stations could soon be cleaned up more easily using sound waves. At the moment, the dirty soil must be dug up and replaced, so buildings must be demolished if the soil under their foundations needs cleaning. Techniques that can clean the soil in situ, such as pumping out the ground water or using oil-digesting bacteria, tend to remove only the shorter hydrocarbon chains which are more soluble in ground water. The longer, heavier hy- drocarbon chains often stay trapped in large drop- lets between the grains of soil. Researchers have discovered the use of sound waves to break up these droplets. They set up two columns of wet sand contami- nated with diesel fuel. They passed sound waves through one of the columns at a number of fre- quencies, and then compared the amount of oil that could be removed from each by pumping wa- ter through the two sand beds until no more oil emerged. After five days, 71 per cent of the diesel fuel was removed from the vibrated column, com- pared with 40 per cent in 11 days from the un- treated column..

Use your herbs to make some insect sprays if you need to. Try tansy against the dreaded flea beetle, wormwood for caterpillars, garlic which will make most plants seem disgusting for a lot of pests, or as a last resort pyrethrum. If you've never made herbal sprays, I should explain here that basically you just make a strong tea with the herbs, strain the herbs out, dilute it by another part of water and add a squirt of liquid soap to make the liquid stick to the plant. Derris dust is a good preventative against all sorts of pests, but as you have to buy it, it does get quite expensive. It's also reported to kill ' fish, so don't let it get into your pond or creek if you have one with * fish in it. Getting into companion planting is a better idea. Even though it's not a 100 110 proof (but - what is?), it does help to cut down or on pests. If you usually get troubled by aphids, scale insects and caterpillar, during your growing season, you can try and attract predator insects, like lacewings and little wasps, .......- by spraying a yeasty substance like diluted vegemite on your crops before the pests arrive. T ii e predators will hang around your garden, knowing they're on to a good thing and will he there to deal with any nasties should they dare come onto your plot. 1140 New Moon. 12-17 Days to Plant or sow leafy annuals. Still time for basils, coriander, borage, anise, caraway and other annual herbs, as well as the other usual greens like lettuces and silverbeet. If it's already getting wet in your area, it would be a good idea to regularly apply a seaweed spray against fungi, with the added advantage of very speedy growth of your plants. Chamomile flowers, turned into a spray, will protect young seedlings against the infamous 'damping off', a fungus disease which frequently occurs in seedlings. 18 t First Quarter. 19-24 Flowering and seed bearing annuals time: tomatoes, cucumbers, melons, marrows, zucchinis, squashes etc. If you want your vegies to fruit early, you might consider sowing some dandelions with them.

In fact, the Dutch are planning to switch their imports of hardwood from WA to Africa as they say that the production is more environmentally sound, there. The Authorities in WA are incensed by the Dutch criticism of their management practices but the local Conservation Council is delighted that this has happened, as they have been at logger- heads with the Department about this matter for some time.

Greenhouse Finally 'Official' The US Government has recognised the ex- istence of the Greenhouse Effect by calling for tough international action aimed at cutting green- house gases. In a reversal of its former position, the US has called for legally binding targets for the reduction of Greenhouse emissions to be set by next year. The US call came at the Climate Change Sum- mit held in Geneva in July. This decision puts Aus- tralia further on the fringe - as a country which still resists cutting its own emissions of greenhouse causing gases. Weeds Resist Glyphosate Australis's worst weed, annual rye grass, has been found to be resistant to glyphosate, usually sold as Roundup or Zero. Other weeds may (WILL) also develop immunity to glyphosate and this is poten- tially a very senous threat to conventional chemical farming practices, according to several Australian scientists. Australia's leading weed ecologist, Profes- sor Roger Cousens of LaTrobe University in Mel- bourne, said Australia needed to adopt a far more ecological approach to weed management. Source: NASAA News Bulletin National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) There's an urgent need for this in Australia say the toxic campaigners. The amount that chemical companies pay for their 'right' to pollute vanes considerable from 20c a tonne to nearly $20 a tonne. In a letter to Greenpeace, the NSW Environ- ment Protection Authority (EPA) indicated that this licensing system is NOT designed to provide any significant financial incentives to reduce pollution! In 1994 the chemical and plastics companies spent less than 1% on pollution control despite record profits and it appears that we spend more cleaning up the mess' than on preventative meas- ures to protect the environment. A National Pollutant Inventory would thus make uniform reporting on toxic chemicals man- datory and could provide a base for calculating accurate licensing fees. The NSW EPA totally agrees! It is noted that a similar inventory in the USA has resulted in a 42% reduction in the amount of chemicals released.

Jobs are impor- tant - but do we really want to see our native for- ests plundered to support fewer employees than a medium-sized factory? \"Over 20,000 jobs depend on logging NSW's native forests...\" Over half this number work in processing oc- cupations in Sydney, using plantation or imported timber. Thousand of others are in the expanding plantation sector, which already accounts for the majority of sawlogs in NSW. All up, there is an estimated 6,000 jobs directly related to logging - and most of them will survive! \"Timber workers are getting a raw deal...\" Many industries are now shedding jobs and most workers have to put up with this. For exam- ple the knw,rd nrwro. ment may shed 30,000 public service jobs in the near future. Quite generous provi- sions have been made to the native forest timber in- dustry workers affected by conservation decisions. Federal & State have given $120 million to help with re- Envro-news training, etc. together with assistance to sawmillers who wish to adapt to new circumstances.

The Amazon's Rainforests The German Chancellor branded the G-7 countries as 'pathetic' over their inaction after their promises at the Earth Summit in Rio in '92. On a visit to Brazil he severely criticised them for their failure to contribute to the protection of the Amazon. He said, \"The motto seems to be: 'the others talk but we pay,' - after all, we are talking about protecting the future of a whole generation.\" Germany has funded a program for protec- tion measures designed to promote sustainable forest development together with safeguards for indigenous tribes. The European Union agreed in July to help, but the Chancellor says his country has contributed 60% of the funding for the pro- gram, so far. He thought it was not for him to criticise other developing countries simply because Europe had all but eradicated its own forests! He said, ults not our job to force our help on others, but we can offer it.\" Source: World Rain forest Report, Oct '96. Lord Vestey Rides Again After Prince Phillip had decried McDonald's for assisting in 'tearing down the Brazilian rainfor- ests and breeding cattle' Lord Vestey, the real live cattle Baron, assured the world that this was not so. But at the famous McLibel trial he had to ad- mit that out of 150,000 head of cattle slaughtered annually at Sao Paulo, many could have come from ex-rainforest areas. Lord Vestey was a major protagonist in the dispute which gave rise to the Australian Aborigi- nal Land Rights Movement. His Aboriginal stock- men conducted an 18 year campaign to gain own- ership of the land. They finally triumphed when Gough Whitlam was Prime Minister.

NIMBIN MUSEUM phon& Nimbin News Helpful Hint There is a lot of discussion about insulation when build- ing or renovating a house. What sort is best? There are many types available: simple silver paper, wool batts, fibreglass batts, polyester blankets and cellulose insulation are the most common. Fibreglass and cellulose hold by far the greater percent- age of the market, but many people fear a health risk from fibreglass, and others fear a fire risk from cellulose, which is effectively pulverised paper. Generally wool batts are accepted as the most desirable, but then again they usually cost more as well! The argument with fibreglass is largely to do with the loose fill that filters into your home environment. In Australia the size of the fibreglass fibres is around four to six microns, larger than the one to three micron size that caused the silicosis that coal miners suffered from, but still an unknown quantity and of some serious concern to researchers. Also there is residual formaldehyde in fibreglass, though this is often denied. People worry that cellulose, being mulched paper, will burn. It will if not treated with borax decahydrate. (Not the stuff you do your washing with!) Borax retards the burning capability of paper dramatically and also tends to keep out bugs. In point of fact, only three percent of house fires start in the ceiling, and only treated wool or treated paper will help retard one if it does start. Few people realise that the wool batts are treated with borax as well to fire retard them, because, contrary to popular opinion, when you get to the contained 700 degree plus heat of the house fire, untreated wool bums very well indeed. It is not the fat content, the wool itself will burn. So don't just throw those old fleeces into the ceiling! Dust them thoroughly down with borax decahydrate first. 1-lowever there is a way for you to insulate your entire house (when building) for virtually no cost. It is safe, effec- tive, and very simple to do. You can also insulate the roof of an existing house, but walls of existing houses are difficult in this situation. How do we do this? You read newspapers, don't you? Your friends read newspapers, your neighbours read newspapers. Well, get them to drop them over to you when they are finished. You can also use old yellow pages books, but these are more time consuming to install as the sheet size is small. Then you go buy a bag of borax decahyd rate (from a chemi- cal supply company), which fire retards the paper very effec- tively; 40 kilos should cost around $60 to $70 and this is more than enough. As well, if you are in a rat area, you might also consider a bag of boric acid. (Mix as 50 percent of the amount of borax used.) This can be irritating to people with asthma, however, so be sure to seal the walls well after installation This of course should keep out the rats anyway! After this all we need is a pair of gloves, a bit of chicken wire (some might use ply), a large tub, water, and we are ready to roll. We need to look at the house in the framing stage. Fill your Window Tinting , Cut heat, fade& glare Home, office, shop, car. Free Quotes 218 720 or 014 897 073 tub with water and add borax until the solution is saturated. Three kilos to a 200 litre drum is usually sufficient. Add boric acid as well, if you are going to use it, at this stage. Boric acid and borax have little residual effect on the human system, but wear gloves anyway. If you get some in the eyes, wash thor - oughly. WALLS Tack up a length of chicken wire to one side of the section you are going to work on, and then simply take sheets of news- paper, wet them in the solution, and pack them into the frame. The chicken wire acts as a form, but don't worry if you don't get the edges perfectly straight, as you can saw them back later when it dries. Now you can leave the chicken wire in place, and this is a very effective pest barrier by itself. You can leave it 'raw' but the sun will dis- colour the paper in time, or you can cement render it, which can look stunning. Others might intend a more conventional finish and use a ply form which they can shift to each section as they get to it, and lay weatherboard or similar over the fin- ished product. Some might even like to add cement to the basic solution in the drum. At around ten percent cement to water this gives an even stronger overall finish, but really as a filler between the walls the paper is quite strong all on its own. In fact, when you are finished you effectively have a fire retarded papier mache home. This process has been used in France for hundreds of years to insulate walls for both tem- perature and sound control. Packed paper like this is a very good sound insulator as well and if you are near a main road it can be very effective in reducing sound emission levels in the home. The roof is a little more tricky. ROOF Ideally we should spend a little money and get some shred- ded paper for this purpose, but if this is not an option, we can still do it. Obviously, if you have a plaster ceiling you do not want nice wet paper soaking through it. Similarly, if you have a nice wood ceiling you may not like the idea of wet borax solution running down everywhere and swelling your timber (even though your ceiling will never want to burn if you do soak it in borax solution). The simple solution is to create a 'mock' ceiling, which is a wooden form that mimics the width of your rafters. You only need one, for it is a 'stamping' process. Lay the form on a flat area, a concrete floor is fine. Wet the paper (and here you will discover how much easier shredded paper is) and fill up the form. When the spaces are filled and levelled, lift the form, place next to the last 'mould' and do another one ... andso on. You can lay black plastic sheeting between each mould, and do them in layers as well, but they will tend to distort and take a lot longer to dry. It is fine if you have the time but lim- ited space, the paper cuts to shape easily, but if you have the space, (preferably under cover), lay them separately as they will dry much faster. Now you have effectively created paper batts. Just slot them into the ceiling cavity when the roof and ceiling are fit- ted. Preferably do this before the sparkey does your wiring. but only because it's less fiddly. Alternatively you could cheat and just buy cellulose loose fill insulation and spread it in the ceiling once the house is complete. As an other odd thought, if money is tight, you can actu- ally use newspapers as a lining for the inside of your home. The process is to simply wet the paper without scrunching it and apply it as sheets over the insulation you have already installed in the walls. It is difficult to do this on the ceiling, however, as the paper tends to suffer greatly from the effects of gravity. Happy papering! Cellulose Fibre Insulation by Michael Wallace Dec/Jan '97 28 Nimbin News The Treatment of - Cause or Effect? Cancer in by Dr. Sir John Whitman Ray, founder of Body Electronics Perspective It is wisdom to consider that due to the fact that cancer is increasing consistently among the world population that, perhaps the direction we have pursued in the treatment of cancer over many years is probably in error. It is wisdom to treat the cause of disease rather than to continually pursue the correction of the symptoms of disease. For many years in our clinic we have not been treating cancer, yet thousands of people have been cured of what has been diagnosed as cancer. In our opinion we have taken the time to examine the cause of cancer and other disease symptoms and have attempted to correct what appears to be the cause of these symptoms and the symptom of cancer disappears. Time and space will not permit us to go into detail as to what procedures must be followed and we all acknowledge that a little knowledge is a very dangerous position to main- tain. Nevertheless, what we have found over many years of research and treatment is that several factors must be care- fully considered in order to regain and maintain health. These are to be presented in part as follows: We must first correct all enzyme deficiencies in the hu- man body that health and vitality may be regained and main- tained. In our opinion, it is folly to disrupt the normal activity of the body by using enzyme blockers or any other drug which disrupts normal body functions. These enzymes must be natu- ral and derived from vegetarian sources as the results we de- sire cannot be obtained by the use of enzymes derived from animal substances or from synthetic laboratory procedures. We must then realise that the presence of enzymes are a prerequisite to utilise minerals and vitamins in the body. Min- erals must come from natural sources in either a chelated form found in plants grown on highly mineralised soils or from a source of colloidal minerals which the body can absorb and utilise. This must be a broad range of colloidal minerals, and this information is fully explained in our Literature and books. This will serve to correct mineral deficiencies wherein it has been suggested by health authorities that 99% of the world's population are mineral deficient due to the consumption of processed foods or eating food which is grown on mineral deficient soils or on soil that has been treated with various agricultural chemicals which destroy the ability of the soil to function normally. The physical body cannot function with- out correcting these mineral deficiencies. All cancer patients are protein deficient due to faulty digestive processes and the faulty function of the pancreas. We know that cooking destroys amino acids such as tryptophan and lysine. These are two of the eight essential amino acids that are needed to produce or synthesise within the body the remaining 12 amino acids. People who eat cooked food are all protein deficient thus we recommend eating raw food that has NIMBIN BUILDING MATERIALS Blade Road, near the tip Broad Range of new and used materials at cc*ietitive prices frcn the: Ninibin Recycling Centre.

A raw uncooked protein source is essential for the normal func- tion of the endocrine system, as Dr Maurice Finkle stresses, health begins in the kitchen. Much more needs to be said on this subject alone as a disrupted hormone function is a main cause of cancer and for that matter other disease symptoms. Information on pre-digested protein wherein all of the amino acids are freed for immediate assimilation through a unique fermentation process from vegetarian sources is available upon request. Essential fatty acids derived from linseed in the form of 'flaxoil' which is protected from sunlight and oxygen will help with the cancer problem. Dr Johanna Budwig of Austria has proven conclusively that flax oil in this manner along with other supplements helps to dissolve tuniours and she has been nominated six times to receive the Nobel Prize as a result of her work. Vitamins from fresh and raw vegetables are a necessary requirement and must have the presence of enzymes and min- erals to assimilate and utilise them. Oxygen is a necessary requirement for good health. Due to the chemical binding of free oxygen by man-made pollut- ants. the oxygen in cities such as Tokyo and other large cities, has been seriously depleted and for that matter depletion of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere everywhere has been scien- tifically acknowledged. Dr Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize for proving that cancer cannot be maintained in an aerobic environment. This information is available upon request. Oxy- gen supplementation is therefore essential and justified to maintain health. Using the technique of Body Electronics it has been found that when nerve supply to each cell of the body has been re- stored, the circulation is returned to the diseased portion of the body and nutrients from natural sources are then made available to the cells and through what is known as the 'heal- ing crisis' all symptoms disappear and the body is returned to normal health. Body Electronics information can be acquired from the International Body Electronics Academy. There are many others factors such as living water and exercise that must be considered which we discuss in our semi- nars, videos, audio tapes, lectures and literature. We have trained practitioners and instructors in every continent and nearly every country. Nearly every state in Australia is repre- sented.

In 1992 Australian Standard AS 2070\"Plastic for Food Contact Use\" reflected the findings of the NHMRC's 1987 report and contained a warn- ing to food manufacturers of the dangers of biologically active sub- stances (phtha!ates) migrating into food products via plastic packag- ing or wrapping materials, including possible toxic or chronic effects to consumers.Exactly the same warning had already been issued in 1977. AND WHAT OF MEDICAL DEVICES? The World Health Organisation also published a report in 1992 on DEHP (di(Zethylhexyl)phthalate and p-nonylphenol) a deadly cocktail of compounds and chemicals. It found that DEHP is readily absorbed in soil; is more soluble in blood than water, is highly lipophilic (i.e.loves fat) is persistent and accu- mulative. Blood transfusion and medical treatment using plastic devices were listed as sources of involuntary human exposure to DEHP, the most consist- ent side effect of DEHP being testicular atrophy. A number of questions re- garding the types of plastic used in blood bags and intravenous tubing and medical products were recently directed to members of the medical industry. Spokesperson for the Red Cross Blood Bank, Dr Richard Kimber, stated he was unaware of any problems associated with PVC blood bags and sug- gested contacting the manufacturers.The Multinational Baxter Health Care, supplier of blood bags and plastic products to Australian hospitals and medi- cal centres recently stated \"we (Baxter Health Care) are not in a position to speak on behalf of the industry regarding plastic products for medical use. In 1992, WHO recommended that disposal practices for DEHP be improved and that steps be taken to reduce the release of DEHP into the environment and that medical products which contribute to the body burden of DEHP be scrutinised to reduce exposure. AND BABY MILK? The UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) found phthalates present in every sample of food sample taken since 1993 includ- ing meat, fish, eggs, milk and milk products. MAFF estimated that daily in- take of phthalales in adults averaged between 018mg per day and up to 1.6mg per day. Baby milk formula tested included phthalates and the most contaminated baby milk had concentrations that gave a total daily intake of 0.023mg per kilo of bodyweight. BREASTCANCER? In 1995 doctors from New York's Strang-Cornell Cancer Research labo- ratory suggested that xeno-oestrogens found in plastics and pesticides in- creased breast cancer rates. The Nursing Mothers Association voiced its concern about lack of public awareness concerning phthalates: \"We would be surprised if many mothers were even aware of the potential problems.\" READ ALL ABOUT IT A new book Our Stolen Future prompted the plastics industry to hold a seminar to discuss its implications: \"Our Stolen Future is so dramatic, per- suasive and comprehensive it is likely to become the foundation of dozens of attacks on industrial products and processes.

A CSIRO study commissioned and financed by FACIA was due for release 12 September 1996. Greenpeace was not asked to contribute to the study's findings and has called CSIRO's independence into question.. OR ARETHERE? Matt Ruchel, national toxics co-ordinator for Green Peace Australia believes industry should stop using phthalates before it's too late: \"regula- tors and industry must adopt a precautionary approach and seek to elimi- nate pollution from these chemicals now rather than wait for conclusive proof of harm.\" This would mean ceasing the manufacture of PVC plastics which are the main source of hormone-disrupting chemicals like phthalates and dioxin.The future of human reproduction and development is too im- portant to us aIl.The petrochemical industry insists there is no proof of any links or chronic health health risks associated with the use of PVC. Mean- while, Australians on a per capita basis rank second only to Americans in their consumption of PVC products. Long term research into PVC and phthalates would involve millions of dollars. There might not be an immedi- ate risk but what of the risk to future generations? Source: Nexus, Oct/Nov 96 The Dobkin Technique This is an emergency procedure that can help save the lives of heart attack and suffocation victims even cot deaths and stroke victims . until the arrival of medical assistance. Itis a simple technique that can reduce or even avert the possibility of brain damage and brain death for up to an hour or more. Medical research has shown that irreversible brain damage begins when no oxygen reaches the brain after four minutes. Yet case after case has been reported of people deprived of oxygen for up to an hour with no ill-effects or brain damage. Obviously some oxygen must be reaching the brain in these situations even though no external oxygen has been avail- able. In all vertebrates there is an automatic reflex called the \"mammalian diving reflex\". It occurs naturally as a life-preserving mechanism during cold-water submersion. More commonly called the \"diving reflex\", ills a protective, oxygen-conserving reflex to keep brain and body alive in the event of submergence in cold water. The body prepares itself to sustain life. It is a totally natural, protective mechanism. In triggering this reflex the Dobkin Technique may help the thousands of vicims of heart attack or suffocation who are in life or death situations but not near any people trained in CPR. The technique may also work in conjunction with CPR to save lives. It is also possible that it may not work at all but the author's research puts a very convincing case for its success. The Dobkin Technique is very easy to initiate. In natural surroundings, the diving reflex is triggered if you fall into water with a temperature of 58 degrees Fahrenheit (approx 14 degrees Celsius) - the mean temperature of the world's waters - or colder. But this reflex may also be triggered by just a facial immersion in cold water. The Technique involves application of cold water, wet towels or wet ice-packs to the victim's head to trigger the diving reflex in the event of heart or respiratory failure. This procedure starts the oxygen-conserving mammalian diving reflex. Dr Linus Pauling suggested in a letter to the author in 1992 that ice or cold water could also be applied to the neck so that the blood, and there- fore the brain itself, can be cooled in the region where anoxic damage occurs. The author concurs with Dr Pauling and recommends that after the patient's face is immersed in cold water or ice-packs, cold water be applied to the neck and the base of the hairline at the back of the head.

Dec/Jan '97 30 Nimbin News Animals You Can't Blame a Mad Cow The British organic movement has been warn- ing for years that methods of modern agricultural production are destructive to the environment, animal health and humans. So, alarming as the outbreaks of Mad Cow disease in Europe have been, they are no surprise. The Soil Association, the leading certifier of organic farms and produce in the UK, banned the feeding to sheep and cattle of products containing animal material when they began appearing in 1983. These products resulted in the outbreaks of BSE (Mad Cow disease). There are no known outbreaks of BSE in herds where full organic standards have been in opera- tion since before 1985, and where no animals have been brought in from outside sources. However, it is impossible for the organic in- dustry to be isolated from mainstream agriculture and, just as some pesticides have been found in organic crops, so BSE has found its way onto some organic farms. These cases are far below the national aver - age and very few in recent years. In another development, a UK farmer-re- searcher has told a recent science conference that excessive use of an organo-phosphate pesticide 10 years ago may have caused the Mad Cow dis- ease epidemic. Mr Mark Purdey said regulations forced farmers to use phosnet (a blend of organo- phosphates and the base of the drug thalidomide) to combat warble fly infestations. He believes this affected the animals' nervous systems. Mr Purdey said it was significant that Switzerland - the only other European country to insist on the use of phosnet - was the only other nation with major outbreaks of Mad Cow disease. Meanwhile in the USA, there was a 25 per - cent increase in the use of organic dairy products in the two years up to 1993 following the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of the use of synthetic recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) and recombinant bovine somatotrophin (rBST) for cattle. In addition, the demand for organic beef has risen by 60 percent despite there being no reports of Mad Cow disease in the US. Sociable shrimps join the crowd Shrimps have much more in common with bees than anyone thought. The social organisa- lion of some shrimp societies is similar to beehives, in which individuals co-operate to survive. Several animals - among them African mole rats, termites and some bees - live in communi- ties with complex social structures. Some individu- als forego their own reproduction to fulfil other roles, such as defence, foraging and most impor- tantly the care of the young. We now have the first example of a marine animal that exhibits this be- haviour. It was found that in each colony of 300 indi- viduals there was only one reproductive female; the 'queen\", and most of the other shrimps were her offspring. If a shrimp of a different species intrudes on a colony, resident shrimps kill it, but like bees, they recognise members of their own colony and do not harm them. Source: New Scientist #2033 Brazil's ants turn over a new leaf Leaf - cutting ants are one of Brazil's biggest agricultural pests by eating their way through crops. Their saving grace is that they can make the soil more fertile in places where the primary forest has been cleared. The ants are particularly destructive in euca- lyptus and citrus plantations, with their nests oc- cupying up to 50 square metres and containing three million ants. Apparently the decomposition of plant mate- rial stored by the ants increases the pH of the soil & increases the ability of the soil to hold onto nu- trients.

The discovery of live mam- moths upstaged the August 19 departure of Japanese researchers Kazufumi Goto and Shoji Okutsu for Yakutsk, Siberia, where they hope to recover frozen sperm from the bodies of woolly mammoths preserved in ice, recover the DNA, and create half-mammoth hybrids with Asian elephants, believed to be the woolly mammoths' closest living relatives. Now that actual mammoths have been found, the Goto/Okutsu project may shift to- ward diversifying their genetic base: if sperm could be taken from long-dead mam moths, and eggs could be drawn from living mammoths, embryo transplants to Asian elephant hosts could produce new mammoth lines - and young woolly mammoths might soon be in zoos.

Prosposals in Europe to limit the level of ni- trates in lettuce may be based on outdated theo- ries about the chemicals' physiological role. A researcher in Londo -n^ has found that far from be- ing dangerous to health, dietary nitrates are actu- ally an essential part of our mechanism for neu- tralising toxic bacteria in the stomach. Nitrates occur naturally in all green plants, especially let- tuce and spinach. Since the 1970s there has been concern about the level of nitrates in our diet because of links to a rare condition in babies called'blue baby syndrome'.

Anorexia - A Common Plight Anorexia nervosa (stress-related refusal of food) affects one in every hundred girls in their late teens, girls exhibiting the illness 20 to 100 times more than boys. Bulimia also occurs in a similar number of girls and young adult women (one per cent), escalating in incidence in some communities, such as American college students, where as many as 20 per cent may be bulimic. Binge eating and self-induced vomiting may be acceptable activities within some groups of women. Among men, alcohol binging is perhaps their way of expressing this condition, whereas anorexia itself is often seen in the male homosexual community. Precipitating factores for anorexia: Puberty, parental marital problems, physical illness, school exams, peer conflicts, romantic is- sues, sibling rivalry, grief or loss. Appearance: emaciated, alert, pale, intolerant of cold with poor circulation, fine hair, bruising eas- ily, swelling of extremities. A low blood pressure, slow heart rate, dehydration, acetone breath\" due to tat tissue breakdown, low thyroid function and scanty or absent menstwal periods are also symp- toms.

Alternatively pour some Clove oil on cotton wool and put this near the tooth. QUESTION: Why is it that, from birth to death, the individual always wants to be loved, and that if he doesn't get this love he is not as composed and full of confidence as his fel- low beings? KRISHNAMURTI: Do you think that his fellow beings are full of confidence? They may strut about, they may put on airs, but you will find that behind the show of confidence most people are empty, dull, medio- cre, they have no real confidence at all. And why do we want to be loved? Don't you want to be loved by your parents, by your teachers, by your wife, by your husband, by your children - or by your guru? Why is there this everlasting craving to be loved? Listen carefully. You want to be loved because you do not love; but the moment you love, it is fin- ished, you are no longer inquiring whether or not somebody loves you. As long as you demand to beloved, there is no love in you: and if you feel no love, you are ugly, brutish, so why should you be loved? Without love you are a dead thing; and when the dead thing asks for love, it is still dead. Whereas, if your heart is full of love, then you never ask to be loved, you never put out your begging bowl for someone to fill. It is only the empty who ask to be filled and the empty heart can never be filled by running after gurus or seeking love in a hundred other ways. Extract from: The Krishnamurti Reader.

Medical Scientists are alarmed by a potentially lethal bacterium that is resistant to all available drugs. Fives cases involving two strains, have occurred in QId and NSW in recent months. Studies in Denmark show that pigs and chick- ens fed on a growth-promoting anti-biotic called Avoparcin may be responsible. Australian farm- ers use about 100 tonnes of this in cattle, chicken and pig feed per year so naturally the Medics. are particularly interested in seeing whether organisms resistant to this antibiotic, is also emerging in Aus- tralian meat products.

According to tests, the acid content in the children's brains is likely to be associated with higher intE gence. So - who knows? - we might be able to artificially raise the pH levels in the future, and produce geniuses... (This was an accidental finding during a study of children with muscular dystrophy.) Sources: Sunday Telegraph via Nexus Oct. Global Scarcity of Food The U.S. World Agricultural Outlook Board warned that global grain stocks are at their lowest ebb in recorded history. Potentially deadly scar- city results not so much from human overpopula- tion as from neglect of warnings that the earth is warming, the ozone layer is thinning and aquifers are depleted. Humans could still grow enough food - in theory- to feed 10 times the present numbers, but at the current rate of resource use they can no longer feed even present numbers the familiar flesh-centred diet. Belatedly aware of the possible consequences of growing meat consumption combined with drought, government officials and business execu- tives from Bangladesh, Bolivia, and Malawi are spending the summer attending the International Soybean Program, learning production techniques to encourage farmers to raise soybeans instead of livestock, and consumers to eat homemade soya products instead of meat.

Although the claim is often made that Roundup is inactivated rapidly in soil, it is more accurate to say that it is usually absorbed into soil components. A sandy loam treated with glyphosate at recom- mended rates was found to drastically reduce trogen fixation, growth and nodulation of subter- ranean clover planted 120 days after treatment. Roundup clearly remains ACTIVE in soils that do not absorb it readily. Other studies have re- vealed indications of high residues when soils low in organic matter and clay content are involved. Because it is a non- selective herbicide, vegeta- tion must be completely protected from drift, mist or drip. As Monsanto notes on its Roundup label uminute quanties of this herbicide can cause se- vere damage or destruction to the crop, plants or other areas on which treatment was not intendedAll long term health and environmental damage testing (eg cancer, reproductive effects, birth defects)is done only on glyphosate, not the full formulation of Roundup. Cancer tests are simi- larly performed only on the active ingredient. Roundup itself has never been tested for can- cer. People have experienced conjunctivitis, der- matitis and flu-like symptoms following exposure to glyphosate. Studies still missing for full registration include 19 or 20 types of environmental matters. It includes studies leg movement, accumulation in water/soill air, fish, irrigated crops, aquatic systems and for- ests, chronic toxicity, cancer and metabolism. Source: BFA Journal April 95.

Certainly food-borne infections have hit the headlines with increasing regularity. It would come as a surprise to many that much of the meat that turns up on our plates has itself been fed animal protein. Intensive farmed animals, from chickens to cattle and pigs, have diets which are supple- mented with animal protein - meat meal or blood meal made from abattoir waste. Although cereals still comprise the major pro- portion of their diet, up to 30% can come from animal protein. Meat and bone meal has routinely been fed to cows in dairies, as well as to chickens - even under organic standards - because the modern chook needs the protein boost to lay the required number of eggs. Eighteen months ago - long before mad cow disease hit the headlines last March - it was pre- ed that a quarter of the British popula- n would be vegetarian by the end of the decade. As we become more aware of what is fed to the animals we eat, more of us may wish to eschew meat too.

She believes the condi- tion is made worse because these feelings are ta- boo. About 20% of women suffer a deep and lin- gering depression after they have a baby. This is distinct from the short-lived slump suffered by most mothers within a few days of birth, dubbed the baby blues' - which is thought to be due to the sudden hormonal shift that follows the end of pregnancy. Ruth Paradice argues that more research should be done into the causes of postnatal de- pression - and not just in women. If her theory is correct, there may be an unrecognised problem among fathers, many of whom are also presum- ably struggling to adjust to a new lifestyle.

It's sweltering hot with little breeze, which means a reprieve from the constant pounding of quandong nuts on the roof. Over the years the trees have become taller so that now the noise is shattering. I might have to don a crash helmet whilst walking around here. Not that I'm complaining. I prefer this noise to cars or planes, or someone's footy on the radio; and it's fixable at least ... just a few minutes with a chainsaw. My attempts in the vegie garden haven't been successful so far. It's 3 / nil to the bush turkeys. Three attempts to grow corn and three successful annihilations. But I won't give up - it'll have to be portable wire cages for the beds until I can sling wire over the top. Noth- ing is going to stop me growing my own food! You may he wondering how I'm go- ing with the jumping ants? Well, so am I! I've been to the allergy man three times and the bio resonance machine indicates that I am not aller- gic anymore; but I haven't been stung recently to give my treat- ment the acid test. I'm sure it won't be too long before I know, but my avoidance techniques are working and I simply can- not invite a sting. And to tell the truth, I've spent so much time in front of the NN computer that they haven't had much chance to get me. It's now Saturday morning. Hot, sultry and the pot plants are drying out. It's so beautiful here. I'm looking forward to the Headers fireworks display tonight, but first I type this in, the last item to finish the Dec/Jan edition which is expected at the printers by 8am Monday morning. Then it will he all systems go to get the Nimbin & Environs finished before the printers shut their doors for Christmas. It's 'in the bag' actu- ally, lots of new stuff and a really good map. You can get it sent to you for $3. posted. Walking around the garden this morning I noticed the 'walking lilies' are really thick, and this year they looked spec- tacular when they flowered, although I actually prefer them just before the petals come open as they look like miniature tulips. Meanwhile the currawong nest in (another) quandong tree is very lively with both parents keeping the food up to the many nestlings. There is a rainforest tree that I saved from the lantana years ago which seems to be Mecca to butterflies. White wings with dark edges and the female smaller and duller in colour. They cavorted around this tree for days with the poor (or some may say, lucky) female being continually pursued by many males. Such is life! I heard the Rainbow Gathering, at Om Sha- lom, was a place for renewing ones dreams for an alternative life. I would have liked to go but commitments, commitments... But I do intend going to the Community Gathering at the Common Ground Community in Seymour, Victoria in Janu- ary. A long way to go, but sometimes you have to make the effort. I'm hoping to get some insights into resolving the in- soluble problems that life on a community brings about. Well, I hope you all enjoy the holiday, don't spend next years money on presents and see you next year. bye for now, Gloria xx A Reminder About Bush Clear timber, vegetation & rubbish from around house Cut grass short Make firebreaks to the adjoining bush Flammable liquids away from house Overhanging branches removed Taps & hoses ready Clear gutters and fill with water Close up openings under house, eaves, etc. Garden refuse and household rub- bish can be burnt in the Nimbin area between 7pm and 7am with a space of 4.5m all round.

Freeholding or freeloading? The biggest land grab since 1788 . . . . ; * * * *,,+ The pastoral lands of Australia are generally public lands leased for the purpose of the extensive grazing of sheep or cattle (pastoralism) on native vegetation. The pastoral industry is using the High Court's \\Vik decision as a smoke screen to hide their real agenda, namely the conversion of public land into privately owned land. The leasehold system was developed in Australia as a way of controlling landuse in areas where squatters has originally taken illegal possession of Crown Land. Covenants on the lease were used by governments to protect the land, to allow its continued use by other interests and to restrict the range of uses pastoralists could engage in. Leasehold was also a useful form of tenure for areas where the best use for the land had not yet been determined. The crux of the current push for freeholding is not about uncertainty caused by the Wik decision, but about who has the right to pursue alternative land management activities in areas where pastoralism has proven to be unsustainable and environmentally damaging. by the Wik decision. A pastoralist retains the full benefit of the grant for pastoral purposes which was issued to the pastoralist by the government.\" \"That grant includes the right to do all the things which a r e consistent with or incidental to the USC of the land for pastoral purposes, including: running cattle; L creating maintaining and developing Rn&nds .: fencing, dams, .,windmflls :-; troughs, living / quarters, roads, . - airstrips and other improvements incidental _( to running a pastoral propcnty(scc 1 r Gummow J at p166) As the pastoralist retains the same rights as they did prior to the \\Vik judgment. M cIntyre argues \"that there is no legal impact on: the value of the interest the value of the security which the interest may provide for the purpose of borrowing money secured by that interest.\" (MCintyre 1997) So why is the pastoral industry causing such a fuss? While management of leasehold lands leaves a lot to be desired, freeholding leads to much greater levels of environmental disturbance. A recent CSIRO report shows that national clearing rates on freehold land are The current push by the pastoral industry to secure freehold title is yet another attempt in a long list. During the 1980s a number of states and the Northern Territory responded to pressure from the pastoral industry to convert leases to freehold. The subsequent inquiries held in South Australia, Western Australia and the NT all found that freehold title was not an appropriate title for the management of extensive grazing lands. One of the main arguments put forward by the pastoral industry was that leasehold title was too \"uncertain'; did not encourage lessees to manage land in a sustainable manner, and that the ,fT' \"insecure\" nature of the title prevented lessees from securing adequate finance. An examination of rural borrowings clean) indicates that rural businesses have had little trouble gaining loans Betneen 1970 and 1992 total farm indebtedness rose from $998m to $6248111 from a range of funding sources including banks and pastoral agents. (Ledgar 1994 p 67) Just as the pastoral industry in the 1980's tried to claim that uncertainty was affecting their ability to manage land effectively, they are once again making the same claims with respect to the issues raised by the Wik judgement. There is no uncertainty as a result of the Wik decision. In a recent examination of the Wik decision, West Australian Barrister Greg McIntyre states: \"There are no identifiable economic consequences for pastoralists following from the legal position declared twice as high as on leasehold land. The draft National Rangeland Management Strategy prepared last year has identified the need for landuse reform in the rangelands. The Strategy recognizes that significant degradation has occurred and that in some areas current pastoral activity is unsustainable and an alternative form of management must be implemented if we are to achieve ecological sustainability. What the pastoral industry is seeking through conversion to freehold is for the current lessees to have the exclusive right to benefit from a move to alternative uses. Historically and currently pastoralists have only ever had the exclusive right to graze domestic animals, as the Wik decision has confinned.

It is intended that all activities, events, actions, rallies, etc, wherever they are in Australia, will be logged in and co-ordinated from the Clearing House. All co- operating organisations will be advised of all activities. It is vital that the National Indigenous Working Party on Native Title be consulted on tiese plans so that the national campaign supports their aims and strategies. The Edmund Rice Centre for Justice and Cnmunity Education, where the Clearing House is situated, has a support group in place and the Clearing House is up and running. LWhat Can Individuals Do? Join one of the organizations in ANTaR; join an ANTaR sub-committee; attend all ANTaR events; form an organisation and run a support event; write to MPs, Senato's, The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, or to city dailies, local, regional or rural newsppers; lobby your local couril to organise and run a local event; sign a Citizens Statement or one of the petitions being organised; attend the planned National Day of Action Activity; provide a donation to support ANTaR activities ( we will need a great deal of money to conduct a successful campaign and, remember, this operation is entirely voluntary); as little as a few dollars will certainly assist.

ANTaR believes that the legitimate rights of Aboriginal Australians, as confirmed in the High Court's Wik judgment, are in danger of being taken away and that this action would leave A ustralia, in the words of our Governor General, Sir William Deane, \"a diminished nation \". Aj 5ITaR is developing a major, national community education and awareness raising campaign, a major component of which is a signature drive to collect at least 250,000 Australian Citizens Statements for presentation to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Leaders and Senators by October. This will be one of the culminating actions of ANTaR 's campaign which includes multiple local initiatives and a National Day of Action in all capital cities. \"We appeal to all Australian. politicians National State. and Territory -. to endorse publicly and unequivocally the High Court's native title decisions as just and correct.. decisions.

Leasehold land isnot freehold, and should not he the subject of a \"land-grab\" by any sectional interest.

Bordered by thl spectacular Nightcap Range and watched over by the sacred Nimbin Rock's, the valley has traditionaNy been a meeting place for the local Bunjalung aboriginal commJnity. After decades of forestry and dairy activity, Nimbin played host to the Aquarius Festival in 1973, spawning an influx of students, drop-outs and at native thinkers. Today, Nimbin survives as an example of social ir all its forms: Its redents have pioneered alternative house building and community developments for both residential arnenrtv and public facity.

The NRRS aims to provide a co-ordinated, strategic framework for the many different strands of planning occurring in our region (at State. regional and local levels) to manage growth and development. whilst maintaining our natural advantages and lifestyle. The NRRS planning process is comniitted to finding better ways to make planning work for our communities. The strategy is building upon work already being carried out by DUAP (such as (he North Coast Urban Planning Strategy and Rural Settlement Guidelines) and councils in our region (including the Tweed Shire 2000+ Strategic l'lan. Lismore 2020 Study, Byron Shire \"sustainable\" Local Environment Plan and the joint planning exercise being prepared by Clarence Valley councils). It is the first time that a regional planning strategy has been developed as a partnership of business. State and local government. The partnership has encouraged the development of a wide range of networks to promote awareness and facilitate the development of a \"whole of government\" approach. The value of this approach to the NRRS has been the development of a range of processes which are enhancing the integration and co-ordination of land use planning, economic development and environmental management in our region. A Co-operative Approach The Tweed, Byron. Ballina, Kyogle, Lismorc, Richmond River. Casino, Maclean, Ulmarra, Copmanhurst. Nymboida and Grafton councils have been active participants in the development of the NRRS. both directly and via NOROC's valley committees. Our region's communities have been able to become involved through workshops. task forces and the valley committees. Other participating organisations include: Australian Business Chamber NSW Department of 1-lousing NSW State Forests NSW Department of Mineral Resources NSW Department of Land and Water Northern Rivers Regional Development Board NSW Environment Protection Authority Conservation Roads and Traffic Authority Extractive Industries Standing Committee NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service Royal Australian Planning Institute Greening Australia NSW Department of Transport SEQ 2001 - Queensland Department of Local North Coast Environment Council NSW Farmers' Association Government and Planning NSW Agriculture NSW Premier's Department State and Regional Development A COMMUNITY DIRECTION FOR OUR REGION The NRRS was initiated in August 1995 with a community workshop to identify the major issues facing our region and the desired future trends for growth and development. Since then, a range of strategic partnerships and networks have been developed to enable communication, research, debate and understanding. This has helped us to identify and clarify the major issues facing our region and to determine strategies and mechanisms to address them. Many of the issues identified have required further research and investigation. Discussion papers. land audits, planning recommendations and specific task forces or working groups have been established to find new and better ways to address the major issues facing our region. February. 1998 Version for Management Committee Review Part I Guiding Proposals for it Sustainable Future Northern Rivers Regional Strategy Phase One Final Report Community Consultatio,z Development of the NRRS has involved the most comprehensive and most successful consultation program in our region. State and local government, business, community and professional organisations and the public have all been actively involved. The consultation to date has focused on the issue of sustainahility principles as the basis of the NRRS, and how those principles might be applied in practice. It has not been easy to ascertain and incorporate the diverse views and opinions from all these interest groups. This report is significant, as it highlights those elements that have gained broad-based support - the vision and principles for the NRRS and our region. Consultation has included: monthly meetings of the management committee, which oversees the development of the strategy: establishment of committees in the Tweed, Richmond and Clarence Valleys with local government. community, business and environmental representatives. The valley committees meet regularly, provide a collaborative sub-regional approach and enhance community involvement: working groups of individuals and organisational representatives with particular interests or expertise, to discuss specific issue areas or research findings and their application within our region: our region's communities, through a series of community workshops and forums. informal discussions at exhibitions and displays, involvement in specific strategy projects and awareness exercises (such as the Photographic Competition for high school students): and an information dissemination program involving newsletters, media and press coverage, information stalls at trade shows and expos and a strategy website. The contributions of our region's communities have been critical in raising our understanding and awareness about the importance of sustainability principles and to find new ways to apply these. The consultation process has helped to gain broad levels of genuine community support from different sectors of our community. It has taken time for our region to reach agreement about sustainability as the fundamental basis for what occurs in our region. The involvement and support from it wide range of interest groups (including State and local government, business, community. professional organisations and the general public) increase the credibility of the NRRS. particularly as a tool for lobbying and promoting our region's needs and interests at State and national levels. IMPORTANCE OF SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLES - THE KEY TO OUR FUTURE Sustainable development is a high priority for our region. The NRRS is the first strategy in our region to use sustainability principles as its foundation. The principles of the NRRS provide a platform to guide the many other planning and management decisions and activities occurring in our region. The NRRS is adopting the principles of sustainable development to guide our actions towards the outcomes we want: long term economic viability, social harmony and a healthy and attractive natural environment. Incorporating sustainahility principles in the NRRS demonstrates that we acknowledge that the economic and social well-being of our region depends on the continued health of our natural environment. We intend to follow a path of social and economic development which maintains the integrity of the ecosystems on which we depend. In order to maintain our quality of life in the Northern Rivers, we must live within the carrying capacity of our region's resource base and its supporting ecosystems. The management committee, valley committees, working groups. comniunity workshop no 2 (April 1997) and the valley workshops (September 1997), have all endorsed sustainability principles as the foundation for the NRRS. February. 1998 Version for Management Committee Review Part I Guiding Proposals for a Sustainable Future Northern Rivers Regional Strategy Phase One Final Report The sustainahility principles which have been endorsed by government and environmental organisations, nationally and internationally include: inter-generational and intra-generational equity - involves accepting that the current generation should not leave a degraded environment for the next generation. and recognition that equity within the present generation is a legitimate and necessary goal integration of the economy and the environment - acknowledging the linkages between the health of both the economy and the natural environment dealing cautiously, yet anticipatory with risk, uncertainty and irreversibility - adoption of the prec1utionary principle with respect to potential impacts conservation of biological diversity - maintaining the variety of life toriiis and ecological integrity recognition of the global dimension - accepting that the impacts of national, state and local policies and activities are not spatially or temporally confined Sustainable development in practice Sustainable development is as much a process as it is an end result. The term \"sustainable development\" has been used since the 1970s. It describes development which does not automatically lead to environmental degradation and does not lead to large inequities in society. The terms \"sustainable development\", \"ecologically sustainable (Jevclopnlcnt\" and \"economically sustainable development\" have all been used as interpretations of the challenge to reconcile our social and economic development with maintenance of a healthy, functioning biophysical environment, upon which all life depends. The NRRS is an integrated regional approach towards applying sustainahilitv. THE FIRST PHASE - A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK In August 1997. the first phase in developing the NRRS resulted in the Northern Rivers - Frameivo,kJr a Sustainable Future. We have used the findings from our research and consultation and the principles of sustainability to develop the Framework. The Framework included a vision for the future of our region, a set of guiding principles, suggested policies, specific results we want to achieve by the year 2016. a list of possible action plans and a schematic structure plan setting out a possible settlement hierarchy and important regional resources and planning principles. The Strategic Framework was attempting to make a suggestion as to what a comprehensive strategy. based upon sustainahility principles for our region might contain. It was used to seek feedback about what the broad direction for the future might he in terms of the suggested ideas and approaches it contained. February. 1998 Version for Management Committee Review Part I Guiding Proposals for a Sustainable Future Northern Rivers Regional Strategy Phase One Final Report Feedback on the Strategic Framework The Strategic Framework was on public exhibition during late July to September 1997 and included a brief questionnaire for public comment. Over 27() completed survey forms have been received. Detailed Comments or submissions are attached to a third of these. Community groups. business interests and State and local government agencies have provided an additional 59 submissions. This has resulted in a total of 136 written responses to the Framework document. This range of interest groups is an indication of the influence that the NRRS could have on the future management of growth and development within our region and highlights the importance of grass roots participation in strategic and integrated planning. Specific aspects of the feedback to the Strategic Framework arc included in the Final Report for Phase One of the NRRS, which is in three parts. l'art I provides a general summary of the consultation findings, the revised vision, principles and schematic structure plan for the NRRS. A brief summary of the priority action areas as endorsed by the community is also described. Part II includes a work program for future development of the NRRS with recommendations for NRRS content and priorities, monitoring, future consultation. management and administration. I'art III is a detailed summary of the findings of the consultation process and associated research and serves as a detailed resource document for further development of the NRRS and other planning exercises in the Northern Rivers region. Our region's communities have: indicated a strong degree of support for the aim and concept of the NRRS: endorsed the adoption of the vision and sustainability principles as the foundation of the NRRS: expressed a desire to see the continued refinement and implementation of the proposals in the Framework. The NRRS partners. NOROC, NOREDO and DUAP, and the management committee are, subject to adequate resources, committed to implementing the principles and processes in the Framework, by adopting the work program in Part II of the Final Report. February. 1998 Version for Management Committee Review Part I Guiding Proposals for a Sustainable Future Northern Rivers Regional Strategy Phase One Final Report VISION The vision represents the ideal state that the strategy is aiming to achieve for the future of our region. The vision gives the people of our region something to aim and aspire for. The INTENT of the vision which was proposed in the Framework was supported by 90.9% of respondents to the Framework survey. Written submissions and other responses indicated general agreenient with the intent, but also recognised a need to clarify (lie definition of the term \"sustainable futureS' used in the vision. The vision for the NRRS. as endorsed and supported by the management committee. the valley committees, Comniunity Workshop 2 and the community is: A healthy, prosperous and sustainable future for the communities of the HEALTHY, PROSPEROUS means: The NRRS is aiming to ensure that the people and natural environments of our region are healthy, there is a high level of mutual trust, co-operation and support within our region's communities, and there is sufficient material wealth to satisfy basic needs and wants (acknowledging that some people aspire to higher levels of material wealth than others). Northern Rivers region SUSTAINABLE FUTURE means: Recognising the links between our economy, environment and quality of life, now and in the future. Acknowledging that ecologically sustainable development. economically and socially sustainable development are synonymous. By striving for a sustainable future, the NRRS is aiming to achieve a balance between economic, environmental and social goals. As agreed at Community Workshop 1. in August 1995: \"Sustainable development needs to be based on community planning which takes into account land use capacity as well as the ecology ... * and social/spiritual aspirations to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations\". COMMUNITIES OF THE NORTHERN RIVERS REGION means: The people in our region do not form an hornogenous group. Communities can he defined by spatial boundaries, such as the Tweed. Richmond and Clarence Valleys, or by particular characteristics, such as people adopting differing lifestyles. definition of sustainable development at this workshop included reference to \"a population limit'. This term has been excluded from the definition in the vision as the consultation and research since 1995 indicates that a population cap does not acknowledge per capita consumption, violates the equity objective and excludes oilier important information which should he considered if using suslainahilily criteria. February. 1998 Version for Management Committee Review Part I Guiding Proposals for a Sustainable Future Northern Rivers Regional Strategy Phase One Final Report SUSTAINABILITY PRINCIPLES The Strategic Framework included a set of \"Guiding Principles\" which were based upon internationally accepted principles of sustainable development. The role of the NRRS Principles is to provide the overall direction for the NRRS, to help interpret the vision and to establish best practice in our region. The principles provide us with a consistent set of criteria to evaluate planning objectives and strategies, policies and plans within our region. The Guiding Principles in the Framework represented an attempt to: adapt and translate the sustainahihity principles to the needs of the Northern Rivers region: and expre&s these principles in a simplified k)rm for ease of understanding and interpretation. The feedback and comments received from our region's communities on the Framework suggested that: there is strong support for the adoption and implementation of the internationally accepted sustainability principles: the Guiding Principles, as a simplified version of the original principles do not accurately convey the meaning of the internationally accepted sustainabihity principles: the Guiding Principles may be useful in assisting with raising awareness and understanding of the sustainability principles (ic. as an educational tool), but should not be used as the \"guiding\" principles or foundation of the NRRS: the implications of these principles for the Northern Rivers region need to be more specific: the principles of the NRRS must be consistent with the Local Go'L'rnnent Amendment (Ecologically Sustainable Det'elopineni) Act 1997. Our region's communities have agreed that the NRRS needs to be based upon the internationally accepted \"Sustainahility Principles\" with implications that are specific to our region. The implications can be used to help raise awareness and understanding of the sustainabihity principles. February. 1998 Version for Management Committee Review 6 Part I Northern Rivers Regional Strategy Guiding Proposals for a Sustainable Future Phase One Final Report The sustainahility principles for the NRRS. as endorsed and supported by our region's communities, including the management committee, the valley committees, Community Workshop 2, and CONSISTENT with those in the Local Government Amendment (Ecologically Sustainable Det'elopmnent) Act 1997 are: SUSTA INABILITY PRINCIPLES IMPLICATIONS FOR TIlE NOR TIJERN RIVERS REGION Precautionamy Principle We do not always know what the effect will be of the things we do.

Inter-generational Equity Everybody in our region's communities is entitled to \"quality of life\". Equally, future generations of people in our region should not be prevented from having a high quality of life because of what we do now. The present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the Decisions should he made which benefit the whole community, not just particular groups or sectors. environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations. We must ensure that our children's children are at least able to enjoy what we have - socially, economically and environmentally. All people have the right to an environment that supports and improves their health and wellbeing. Conservation of Biodiversity and Ecological Integrity Conservation of biodiversity and protection of ecological integrity should he a fundamental consideration. The non -evolutionary Toss of species and genetic diversity needs to be halted and the future of evolutionary processes secured. Improved Valuation, Pricing and Incentive Mechanisms Environmental factors should be included in the valuation of assets and services, such as: polluter pays - that is, those who generate pollution and waste should bear the cost of containment, avoidance or abatement: the users of goods and services should pay prices based on the full life cycle of costs of providing goods and services, including the use of natural resources and as.scls and the ultimate disposal of any waste; environmental goals, having been established should he pursued in the most cost effective way. by establishing incentive structures including market mechanisms, that enable those best placed to maximise benefits or minimise costs to develop their own solutions and responses to environmental problems. February. 1998 Version for Management Committee Review The natural environment provides society with a wide range of useful goods and services which we use to engage in economic activity. It also provides us with a range of intrinsic values which do not directly support human activities (such as genetic and species diversity in natural systems and habitat values). If we do not have healthy water, soils and air we will not be able to maintain our sugar cane, macadamia, cattle, fishing and oyster industries which are the mainstay of our regional economy. A healthy environment means a healthy economy. Biodiversity and the web of life is worth protecting and conserving in its own right. The social and environmental impacts of goods and services are paid for separately, such as the charges for garbage services to carry away the packaging our food and other goods come in. Many environnsental values cannot be priced in monetary terms. If social and environmental costs were included in the prices of goods and services, the balance of supply and demand would beconie much more realistic. We should identify and acknowledge the real costs of what we do. including the costs of production, use, management and disposal. Our decisions need to recognise the full range of values, even if these cannot always he quantified. The community needs to he made aware of the full costs of developments and activities.

This requires recognition and ecological footprint of our activities and developments. We must share the global effects may be quite the opposite. responsibility for action on greenhouse gases, ozone depleting substances, biodiversity and habitat protection and pollution reduction, We should look beyond our own backyard; think globally, act locally. Our region is not an economic island (or an environmental line). Qualitatis'e Development Qualitative development requires an increase in the qualitative dimension of human welfare and not the quantitative growth in resource throughput as a key objective. Conservation of resources needs to be an integral component of the planning and implementation of development and activities. however, investment is needed to replenish and expand the capital base, and the human, technological and natural productive base should not be depleted. Traditionally, we measure our progress in terms of economic growth. which is simply a measure of how many resources we use. Our wealth as a region also includes quality of life and our cultural diversit y. A measure of regional development which includes quality of life factors will provide a much clearer overall iicture of the prosperity and progress of our region. Sustainable economic devclopment is defined as an activity that improves the prosperity of our region, or at least maintains it, without prejudicing the capacity for future generations to enjoy the environment. Development means more than just economic growth. l)evelopment should enhance our quality of life. lrecognising that this means different things to different peoplel without compromising our environment. Conservation of resources needs to be an integral consideration in the planning and implementation of development and activities. Limits on Natural Resource Use Some resources, such as quarry resources and fossil fuels, are finite. Other \"renewable resources', including agricultural land and forestry products, start to degrade or become less productive if they are overused. If we overuse our resources The scale and throughput of material resources need to be limited by the capacity of the there will he iionc left for our children's children. environment to both supply renewable resources and to assimilate wastes. Harvesting rates of renewable resources should not exceed their rate of regeneration. We should care for our region's natural and human resources: We must use them efficiently - aim for the optimum sustainable yield, manage resources to their highest use and look for alternatives; We must recognise our region's limited resources and its limited ability to assimilate waste. ('onstant Natural ('apital and Sustainable In come Our stock of capital - natural environment, technology and knowledge - is required to sustain our lifestyles and activities. The natural capital (eg. biological diversity, healthy environments, fresh water supplies, productive soils) must he maintained or enhanced from one generation to the next. Only that income which can be sustained indefinitely, taking account of the biodiversity conservation principle .should be taken. Some elements of our natural capital, such as life support systems (eg, biogecichemical cycling) are essential to our survival and cannot be substituted for by man-made capital. Other aspccls include the ecos ystems of our region (biological wealth) and the amenity or \"non-use\" values of our natural environment, such as landscapes. nd climate.

Community Participation Informed community involvement is vital to ensure that what we do in our region benefits the whole community rather than individuals or particular sectors. We need to develop mechanisms to ensure that we have representative levels of Strong community participation will be a vital prc-rcquisite for effecting a smooth involvement and that participatory planning exercises are not dominated by minority interests. transition to an ecologically sustainable society. The community has a vital role to play in decision making. Education and access to information will ensure effective community involvement. COMMUNITY PRIORITIES This report indicates the end of Phase One - the phase of identifying of what is important for our future. As we move from Phase One to Phase Two we need to keep working together. We need to start to find ways of applying the sustainability principles. Our region needs to think about how the findings of the NRRS planning process can be used. Parts II and III of the Final Report have more detail on further work and community priorities. There are a number of important priorities that require it mention in this Part. Implementation needs to become a key component in Phase Two. The NRRS provides a framework to encourage greater integration and consistency among all agencies in our region. For example, it offers an opportunity to link Total Catchmcnt Management and local government planning processes with findings from State Government reforms (eg. the Water Reform). The wide scope of the NRRS will result in a range of implementation options, including: aspects of the Framework which relate to land use planning and have broad support from all interest groups and sectors throughout our region will he considered in future revisions of the Regional Environmental Plan: establishment of protocols or accords with different groups with respect to specific responsibilities or obligations: determination of a memorandum of understanding or negotiation of strategic partnerships among various government departments or industry associations: development of guidelines or best practice notes: production of an advisory guide to a business plan for economic development: a combination of regulatory and financial incentives (such as rate rebates and developer contributions).

Our quality of life may be impacted upon in an adverse way if our region cannot sustain the increasing demands placed upon our resources and environments. During Phase Two it will be necessary to explore techniques and mechanisms to identify carrying capacities within our region. Resource management. Effective resource management is critical to ensure sustainable economic development and employnient opportunities, to achieve sustainability in the management of our agricultural land, forestry and water resources, and to ensure the ongoing contribution of our natural environment to our quality of life for economic. environmental and social reasons.

A number of criteria require refinement and development and these include a sustainahility index, indicators for regional state of the environment reporting, an economic development index and mechanisms to review the effectiveness of the strategy and the development process. Funding for further work on the NRRS means that the many different interests in our region need to find ways to help resource this process and ensure that regional ownership is maintained in continuing development.
