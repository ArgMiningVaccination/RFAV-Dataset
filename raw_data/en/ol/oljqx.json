Story is deep within our biology, and we are literally wired to tell and understand the world in terms of story. Each of us is part of an unfolding narrative, each a hero in an epic tale. And yet, so many of us leave our stories untold, the real story, that is. Most of us tell the \"outside\" story, such as de- tails of our work or family. The real story lies within and expresses our deepest values and hopes. This story touches on the lasting, visionary quality of greatness we all carry. When we don't know and tell this story, we wind up feeling lonely and out of touch with our life's pur- pose, bothered with a chronic sense that something just isn't right. We may even wind up feeling worthless, unloved, or even sick. Join Instructor Sheila Carroll, professional story coach, for a day of discovery and healing. Sheila will teach you simple techniques for telling your story for health and well -being. A great course for helping yourself or others heal, unique and satisfying! Class Time: 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Class Fee: $89 April 13: Beginning Beekeeping 101 If you've heard the buzz about bees and are interested in managing your own colony, this course is definitely for you.

Instructor: Wayne Weiseman Class Time: 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. each day Class Fee: $989 May 18: Plant Stem Cell Plant stem cells (Gemmotherapy), also known as meristems, are embryo cells of plant buds or rootlets that are undifferentiated and have the potential to become any tissue in the body, very similar to animal (embryologic) stem cells. They hold the blueprint and genetics of the entire plant. They rapidly and gently restore the balance between mind and body, while hav- ing an impressive influence on all channels of elimination. A wealth of information and clinical research has been collected in Europe over the last 70 years. In this seminar, you will learn the emotional/mental signatures, impact on physiology/pathology, tissue affinities, and empiri- cal protocols to initiate healing and how to incorporate other modalities along with plant stem cells.

Instructor: Amy Jo Howard, ND Class Time: 9 a.m. \u20145 p.m. Class Fee: $89 November 9: How to Deliver a Baby Everyone is invited to this lively and insightful class on \"Birth for Everybody.\" Does it matter how we view birth, or how we talk to our neighbors and kids about birth? (Hint: YES, IT DOES!) How we get born affects our whole lives - our expectations, how we breathe, our immune system, and how we connect (or not) with the rest of the human race. This lively class will reframe birth as it's presented in the US today, teach what babies are really doing and expecting, and discuss how the amateur can safely and calmly deliver a baby if unexpected circumstances occur. NEW understanding of gentle birth has very specific and simple ele- ments which reduce infant and maternal mortality, and that can be used in any situation for great outcomes! We'll explore making -do in disasters and provide a beautiful, easy -to-use reference that reinforces all you've learned. This is a fun and inspirational day (no ick, prom- ise!) and is for everyone who cares about mothers and babies - come with a friend!
