I want to take a moment as we are all worried about this latest respiratory virus pandemic to review a few herbs that have been used for centuries in traditional medicine to boost immunity and treat respiratory based illnesses. If you're concerned about getting sick or just want to strengthen your immune system as a precaution, consider these herbs! As a mother of two small children, I have lots of experience with using nature's finest immune-boosting tonics to fend off viruses. Herbal teas and tinctures can stimulate and empower the body's immune system to fight against any viruses that may try to enter. Here is a list of some of the best herbs you can use to boost your immunity and to relieve symptoms of a viral respiratory infection should you come down with something as flu season continues. Bee Balm - Bee balm has antimicrobial properties, stimulates lung and sinus function, and aids in digestion by helping to fight pathogens in digestive tract. Healthy digestion is key to a strong immune system so that the body can eliminate toxins effectively. Bee balm is an herb featured in our [Smooth Sailing Tea](/tea-mixes). Get bee balm here Echinacea- Echinacea is said to boost the immune system in a wide variety of ways. Not only does it activate the immune system and get the lymph moving to help detoxify the body, but it can also inhibit viruses from entering cells and kill bacteria. It has a long history of being used to treat septicemia and bacterial infections. It is most effective when taken regularly at the first sign of a cold. Echinacea is prominently featured in our [Bug Zapper Tincture. ](/tinctures) Elecampane - Elecampane can help alleviate bronchial spasms, fight infections, and clear congestion. The aromatic properties of elecampane work to stimulate the respiratory tract for improved function. Upon consumption of elecampane, your body will work to eliminate the aromatic essential oil of the herb through the lungs, cleansing the respiratory tract in the process. You can take elecampane as a tincture. [Get elecampane here ](/tinctures) Garlic- Though most of us think of garlic as an herb to flavor meals with, it has a very rich medicinal history. Ever eat some raw? It is potent! The phytochemicals that give garlic its zing are responsible for its antimicrobial and antiseptic properties. Garlic fires up the immune system and can strengthen the immune response, meaning you can knock out that cold or flu faster and easier. Raw garlic is one of the main ingredients in our [Bug Zapper Tincture. ](/tinctures) Goldenrod - Goldenrod is an herb traditionally used for seasonal allergies and sinus congestion because of its ability to stimulate the respiratory system due to its astringent properties. Goldenrod is also a diaphoretic, helping to induce sweating, which can help the body to break a fever. We have a stock of goldenrod herbs in bulk that you can use for tea or to create your own tincture. Holy Basil- Holy Basil is considered by herbalists to be an immune modulator. Rather than revving up or toning down immune function, immune modulators are said to help balance and strengthen the immune system so when the time comes, it is prepared to put up a healthy fight. Many immune modulators present a harmless challenge to the immune system and can improve communication between cells. Find holy basil in many of our teas and in tincture form. Pine Needles - Pine needles are high in Vitamin C, which is important in supporting a healthy immune system to defend the body from on unwanted invaders like viruses. Vitamin C also activates enzymes in the body that help alert the cardiovascular system to fight severe infections. It has a mild pine and citrus flavor that is great as a tea. Spilanthes - Spilanthes is a potent an immunostimulant that revs up the immune system at the first sign of a virus. When tested in a lab, spilanthes displayed strong antimicrobial properties as well as antifungal properties, treating infections and fighting illness in the body. In traditional medicine, people used spilanthes extracts to treat tooth decay, mouth ulcers, throat infections, and gum diseases. It is most effective when taken as a tincture 2 - 3 times daily. "}
