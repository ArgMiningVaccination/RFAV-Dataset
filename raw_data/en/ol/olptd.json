Your bed should be a sanctuary of rest and relaxation, and choosing the right bedding is essential for achieving a healthy and rejuvenating sleep. For the best sleep, it's recommended to choose organic high quality bedding made from natural, breathable, and hypoallergenic materials like organic cotton, bamboo, linen, or silk. These materials have the ability to regulate temperature and wick moisture away from the body, promoting a comfortable and refreshing sleep experience. But.. How to recognize sustainable and high quality bedding? Searching for sustainable and high-quality bedding can feel overwhelming. It's like wandering in a maze of options, unsure of which path will lead to the ultimate comfort and durability. However, fear not, for we have compiled a list of expert tips to assist you in making an informed decision. Sustainable Materials - What is the best bedding material to buy? First and foremost, when searching for bedding, prioritize natural materials. Bedding made from natural fibers such as cotton (organic), silk, hemp, bamboo, or linen is a smart choice. These [sustainable materials](https://orbasics.com/blogs/stories/sustainable-materials) are excellent at absorbing moisture and regulating temperature, providing you with a comfortable and restful night's sleep. Of these materials, cotton is the most popular choice due to its durability, breathability, softness, and ease of care. It's also typically more affordable than linen, bamboo, or other natural fabrics. In contrast, synthetic materials like polyester can exacerbate nighttime sweating and are often less breathable. Not to mention, [synthetic materials (made from petroleum) pose significant environmental problems](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/plastic-in-textiles-towards-a/file) and contribute to climate change. So, choose bedding made from natural materials, not only for your own comfort and well-being, but also for the sake of our planet. By doing so, you'll be doing your part in promoting sustainable and eco-friendly living. - Organic certifications - Is organic bedding better? Be sure to choose bedding made from ecological and sustainable materials, such as [organic cotton](https://orbasics.com/pages/organic-cotton). When bedding is grown using controlled organic farming methods, you can be confident that no harmful chemicals or fertilizers were used. In contrast to conventional bedding, [which may contain harmful ingredients](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0612/4493/2266/files/MADE_SAFE_Bedding_Detox_Your_Sleep_Report.pdf?v=1650063312) like formaldehyde, azo dyes, aldicarb, and parathion, organic bed are natural plant-based dyes and safe sateen or percale finishes. Therefore, don't just look for bedding made from natural materials, but also ensure that they are sourced from controlled organic farming. Certifications such as GOTS, IVN, or Fairtrade can help you find responsibly produced organic bedding. By choosing bedding made from organic and sustainable materials, you are benefiting your health but also supporting environmentally friendly and socially responsible practices. - Quality - what bedding lasts the longest? Investing in high-quality bedding is not only beneficial for a comfortable and restful sleep, but it also ensures longevity and durability. When it comes to choosing bedding that will stand the test of time, there are a few factors to consider. - Firstly, look for bedding made from high-quality materials such as long-staple cotton or linen. These materials are more resistant to wear and tear and have a longer lifespan than lower quality fabrics. - Additionally, consider the weave of the bedding. Sateen weaves, for example, have a smoother and silkier texture, but may not be as durable as percale weaves, which have a crisper and more breathable feel. - Thread count is the number of threads woven into one square inch of fabric, and it's easy to get caught up in the belief that the higher the thread count, the better the bedding. However, it's important to note that a high thread count doesn't necessarily equate to quality or comfort. While a high thread count may provide a softer and more luxurious feel, it's not the be-all and end-all of bedding quality. Instead, focus on finding bedding made from organic materials with a thread count between 200-400. This range provides the perfect balance of durability, breathability, and softness, ensuring a comfortable and restful sleep. - Lastly, pay attention to the construction of the bedding. Look for bedding with reinforced seams and high-quality stitching to ensure that it can withstand frequent washing and everyday use. Investing in durable and long-lasting bedding not only saves you money in the long run, but it also ensures that you can enjoy the comfort and luxury of your bedding for years to come. The Cost of Organic Bedding: Is organic bedding worth it? While it may be tempting to opt for cheaper bedding options, the benefits of organic bedding are undeniable. Organic bedding is made from materials that are grown without the use of harmful pesticides and chemicals, making it better for both the environment and your health. Free from harmful toxins it is also softer and more comfortable and also more durable than traditional bedding options. Although the initial cost may be higher, investing in organic bedding can actually save you money and health issues in the long run. Its durability and longevity mean that you won't need to replace it as often, and its high-quality materials will ensure a good night's sleep for years to come. When it comes to your health and well-being, choosing organic bedding is a small but significant step you can take towards a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. So why not make the switch to organic bedding today? Your health and the environment will thank you. "}
