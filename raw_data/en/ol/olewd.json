As most of you know, de- spite the many charms of New Haven, Dr. Lock-wood has left us to as- sume the Dean's post at The Ohio State University College of Medicine (no, he didn't go to coach the football team). Dr. Peter Schwartz kindly assumed the role of acting chairman, so the Department has functioned normally. The search committee is quite active, and we have been told to expect our new chair by the beginning of the new academic year. As Dr. Ed Funai also was stolen away by the attraction of Columbus, Dr. Catalin Buhimschi has kindly stepped in as acting head of the Section of Maternal-Fetal Medicine. Our Department continues to run extremely well, and we are pleased to bring you some of the highlights of the past year in this journal. As part of the celebration of the Yale Medical School's 200th anniversary, Charly arranged a great series of Grand Rounds speakers; here we bring you some of the highlights. Dr. Gautam Chaudhuri was our Residents' Research Day speaker in June; as one of the outstanding basic scientists in gynecologic endocrinology, he gave a very thought-provoking talk on free radicals and breast cancer. Dr. Nathan Kase presented another superb talk on PCOS, explaining, as he always does, how basic science translates to clinical medicine. Dr. John Queenan, the pioneer in Rh management, gave us a definitive update on that field. We also thought we would share some news of our faculty members' global outreach efforts: Drs. Magriples, Erekson and Rutherford described some of their activities in Africa and Jamaica. Of course, we will update you on the research and clinical progress of our sections and the prog-ress of our trainees, who continue to go out into the world and promote our field. We hope that many of you will be joining us here in New Haven on May 12, when we celebrate the career of Yale's first female resident, Dr. Mary Lake Polan. Mary Lake, of course, exemplifies Yale's strong tradition of excellence in research and clinical medicine; she will be speaking not only of her career, which encompassed all her activities here at Yale as a trainee and young fac-ulty member, but also about the expansion of her interests into international health. We anticipate another day of terrific presentations from Drs. Jamie Grifo, Florence Haseltine, Roberto Romero and Stephanie Spangler. I hope to see you all soon, and enjoy your visit back to Yale while reading these pages!

There have been many changes, but one constant remains: The private physicians have always been integral to the Department and large contributors to its success. In 1973, after returning from a stint in the Air Force, I found that morning report was packed with private and university faculty six days a week, all heatedly debating patient care. The on- call room was a coed barracks that slept four. The fetal monitor filled an entire room. There were no fellows, and some of the private community voluntarily rotated on call as high-risk attendings. Over the ensuing years, the private doctors remained important to the Department's mission: interviewing resident candidates; taking morn- ing report; giving lectures to medical students, residents and others; and sleeping in-house to cover residents when attending presence was mandated 24/7. The Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology became the role model for suc- cessful integration of community and university faculty for the entire medical center.With all the changes in our field, I have watched with pride the continued contributions of private Obstetrician/Gynecologists to the teaching and administration of the Department. We remain central to the collegial atmosphere of learning and growth that our students, residents, fellows and faculty enjoy. yale oBstetrical and Gynecolo Gical society 4free r adicals and Their i nteractions: implications in Breast Cancer Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen. They also fall under the definition of free radicals. A radi- cal is an atom or a group of atoms that has one or more unpaired electrons. Radicals can have a positive, negative or neutral charge. They are intermediaries in a variety of normal biochemi- cal reactions. When generated in excess or not appropriately controlled, radicals can wreak havoc on a broad range of macromolecules. Radicals have extremely high chemical reactivity, which can explain their normal biological activities and also how they inflict damage to cells. Radicals that are very important in biological sys- tems are derived from oxygen and are collectively known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS that have been identified as playing an important role in the biological system are the superoxide anion (O 2-), peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical OH-. These oxygen-derived radi- cals are generated constantly as part of normal aerobic life. They are formed in the mitochondria as oxygen is reduced along the electron transport chain. The ROS can be beneficial as well as harmful. The beneficial effects include an impact on inter - cellular and intracellular cell signaling. Amongst those that are toxic is the effect of oxygen radicals on cellular membranes (plasma, mito- chondrial and endomembrane systems), which is initiated by a process known as lipid peroxidation, a common target being unsaturated fatty acids present as membrane phospholipids. Under normal circumstances, cells are able to defend themselves against ROS damage with enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, cata- lase, glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins. as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), tocopherol (vitamin E), uric acid and glutathione also play a role. More recently, it was demonstrated that redox dysregulation originating from metabolic altera- tions and dependence on mitogenic and survival signaling through ROS represents a specific vulnerability of malignant cells that can be selec-tively targeted by pro- and antioxidant redox che- motherapeutics. Mitochondria in cancer cells are known to produce the superoxide radical (O 2-), which can undergo spontaneous dismutation or by manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Catalase is present in the peroxisomes and also in the mitochondrial matrix. Catalase is the main enzyme that con- verts H2O2 to H2O and O2. Glutathione peroxidase plays a minor role as well. It is only in the pres- ence of free metals that H2O2 can lead to the formation of OH- radicals, which can be damag- ing to biological membranes and probably respon-sible for the autoxidation of membrane lipids. Superoxide (O 2-) is produced by many types of cancer cells in much higher amounts compared to non-malignant cells. The two major sources of O2- produced by malignant cells are from the NADPH oxidase and the mitochondria.

There is increased expression of MnSOD in various cancer tissues, including that of ovarian cancer, squamous cell cancer of the esophagus, adenocarcinomas of the stomach and carcinoma of the breast. It is therefore not surprising that there is an increased amount of H 2O2 produced in cancer tissues. Most studies that have tried to elucidate the role of H2O2 in cancer have either added it exogenously or enhanced its production indirectly by treatment with external agents. The effects have been either proliferative and anti-apoptotic or apoptotic, depending on the effective concen-tration. Sub-micromolar concentrations (0.5\u00b5M) of H 2O2 led to proliferation, whereas higher concentrations (>100\u00b5M) led to cytostasis. We have observed that H 2O2 is produced in signifi- cantly higher amounts in human breast cancer cells when compared with normal breast epithe- lial cells. We also observed that the bioactivity of catalase as well as glutathione peroxidase is decreased in breast cancer epithelial cells when compared with normal breast epithelial cells. ShRNA for catalase further decreased catalase bioactivity in breast cancer cells and increased in-tracellular H 2O2 levels, and that led to an increase in the proliferation of these cancer cells. Transfec- tion of the breast cancer cells with either cata- lase or glutathione peroxidase led to a decrease in intracellular H 2O2 levels, thereby leading to apoptosis. We have observed that H2O2 inhibits protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), thereby ensuring that ERK1/2 and Akt remain in a phosphorylated state and leading to cell proliferation. Further un-derstanding the mechanism of increased ROS in cancer and methods to reduce their endogenous levels may lead to slowing the growth of cancer.yale oBstetrical and Gynecolo Gical society 6solving the r h Problem? It is an honor to participate in the Yale School of Medicine Bicentennial Celebration, as Yale has played such a major role in the development of perinatal medicine. In the preface of Manage-ment of High-Risk Pregnancy, there is a decade-by-decade chronicle of the advances in perinatal medicine (1), listing the individuals associated with these discoveries. Remarkably, nearly 20% of those worldwide advances were pioneered here at Yale. There were many innovations over a short span, beginning in 1958 with Dr. Hon's development of electronic fetal heart rate evaluation. In 1971 Dr. Gluck developed the L/S ratio to determine fetal pulmonary maturity. In 1972 Dr. Quilligan introduced fetal heart rate monitoring and also initiated the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology certification process for Maternal Fetal Medicine. In that same year Drs. Hobbins and Rodeck (London) pioneered clinical fetos- copy. In 1991 Dr. Lockwood reported on fetal fibronectin and preterm delivery, and in 2000 Dr. Mari demonstrated the value of middle cerebral artery Doppler for monitoring Rh disease. These achievements are a large part of the rich legacy of Yale obstetrics. Rh-alloimmunization was once responsible for approximately 6,000 perinatal deaths annually in the United States, half fetal and half neonatal. Rh-negative mothers generally became immunized by transplacental hemorrhage of Rh-positive fetal blood during the last two trimesters and at the time of delivery. Little was known about the dis-ease process until Drs. Landsteriner and Weiner discovered the Rh-antigen in 1940 (2). This discovery opened the floodgates for investiga- tions into cause, diagnosis, treatment and, finally, prevention. Many of these major discoveries were made during a short period from the 1950s through the late 1970s. While the advances are presented in the categories of diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis, many investigators worked on all three areas simultaneously. It is my aim to pres- ent some of the critical breakthroughs as I ob-served them in this remarkable worldwide effort. DIaGnosIs In the 1950s clinicians were limited to history, examination and Rh antibody titers. Management required great clinical skills, but assessing fetal condition accurately was actually impossible. In 1954 Dr. Allen and colleagues reported that 96% (167/174) of mothers with anti-D titers of 1:32 or lower with no history of hydrops or stillbirth had live fetuses at 37 weeks' gestation (3). With high-er titers the risk of fetal death was much greater. Thus Dr. Allen and colleagues demonstrated that low antibody titers and a favorable history were reliable predictors of good outcomes (Figure 1). Antibody concentrations are increasingly being reported as international units per milliliter. In 1992 Drs. Nicolaides and Rodeck showed that with low antibody anti-D concentrations equal to or <15 IU/ml, fetuses were at most mildly ane- mic (4).otHEr sElEctEd GraNd roUNds PrEsEN t a tioN s John T.

Dr. Liley pro- vided the world with a clinical tool when he pub-lished his graph in 1961 (6). After amniocentesis, the AF was scanned with a spectrophotometer that measured the amount of bilirubin expressed as deviation in optical density at 450 (OD 450). Dr. Liley created a graph with three downward-sloping zones from 27 to 40 weeks' gestation based on fetal condition and AF bilirubin levels. For the first time, clinicians had an accurate pre-dictor of fetal condition. Generally, the low zone indicated that the fetus was safe in utero, was gaining valuable maturity, and might even be Rh-negative. The upper zone indicated that the fetus was at risk of severe disease and could die in utero. The middle zone indicated that the fetus could remain in utero, and a follow-up AF scan was often done. This was an important breakthrough for clinicians, as mildly affected or Rh-negative fetuses could safely stay in utero. Severely affected fetuses had to be de- livered to avoid fetal hydrops and death. For the first time, many babies were saved, but in the 1960s and 1970s early delivery was a risky option because the neonatal survival rates remained low for very premature babies. In the 1980s at Georgetown University Hospital, we treated many patients with severe Rh disease before 27 weeks' gestation, which prompted us to develop a new graph starting at 14 weeks and extending to term (7). Known as the Queenan graph, it was crafted with 789 AF OD450s, many of which were serial values from the same patient. The graph had four zones (Figures 2 and 3). All of the OD450s of Rh-negative fetuses were plotted, and the area was divided into two zones, the lower half termed Rh-negative, the upper termed indeterminate. Then AF OD450 values for hydropic and severely anemic fetuses were plotted, and this zone was termed intrauter - ine death risk. Finally, the last zone between the two lower and the intrauterine death risk zones was termed the Rh-positive (affected) zone. The Queenan graph became widely used because it was based on obtaining serial AF OD450s to determine trends and was accurate in predicting fetal condition. Figure 2 Figure 3 In 1998 Drs. Scott and Chan compared the Queenan chart versus the Liley chart (8). Of the 72 AF OD450s, half were performed before 27 weeks and included all four of the severely affect- yale oBstetrical and Gynecolo Gical society 8ed samples and 11 of the 13 moderately affected samples. The sensitivity of the Queenan chart in severely affected pregnancies was 100% with specificity of 79.4%, positive predictive value of 22.2% and negative predictive value of 100%. For prediction of moderate/severely affected pregnancies, it had a sensitivity of 83.3% with a specificity of 94.4%, positive predictive value of 83.3% and a negative predictive value of 96.3%. MIDDle CeRebRal aRTeRY PeaK sYsTolIC PRessURe For many years investigators tested Doppler studies' ability to evaluate fetal anemia. It was Yale's Dr. Mari who led the cooperative study of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic pressure (9). This technique is fast, noninvasive, and has a 74% positive predictive value and 10% false positive rate (9) when estimating fetal anemia in red cell alloimmunization. Dr. Oepkes, et al compared AF OD450 to MCA Dopplers using fetal hemoglobin levels (10). They found MCA Doppler as accurate as or better than AF OD450. Since the Doppler studies are nonin- vasive, obviously they have replaced amniocente- sis in most instances. In 2005 Dr. Gautier and associates showed that fetal RhD genotyping was an accurate test, which could be used clinically to identify the Rh-neg-ative fetus that would not need further testing (11). With this advance and the excellent work of Dr. Mari, it is now possible to reserve invasive procedures for fetal therapy. TRea TMenT In the early 1960s, clinicians using AF OD450s could tell when a fetus was severely affected. However, neonatologists, as skilled as they were, could not save very premature babies, particularly when they were sick Rh-affected babies. Some severely anemic and hydropic fetuses were deliv- ered only to die in the nursery. In 1963, Dr. Liley once again came to the rescue with a daring pro-cedure, the intrauterine transfusion (12). For the first decade there was no real-time ultrasound for needle guidance. That didn't appear until 1973.Dr. Liley's dilemma was encountering patients with severe fetal disease too early to deliver safely. A physician who practiced in Africa told him that intra-abdominal transfusions were used safely for anemic children in remote villages. Dr. Liley performed a transabdominal intraperitoneal fetal transfusion by placing paper clips on the mother's abdomen as a guide before obtaining a roentgenogram to show where to direct the needle. The transfused Rh-negative blood passes through the subdiaphragmatic lymphatics into the thoracic duct and enters the fetal venous system. Of four fetuses treated, one was saved, and the era of fetal therapy was born. Many modifications were made to intrauterine transfusions, using sonography to guide needle placement and using the umbilical vein as the route for intravascular fetal transfusions. Survival rates for fetal transfusions using seven different approaches were reported by Drs. Schumacher and Moise (13). Considering all 411 fetuses, good outcomes were achieved in 84%. In nonhydropic fetuses, good outcomes were achieved in 94%, compared to 74% in hydropic. The procedure loss rate was 1%-3%. In 2004 Dr. Van Kamps and associates reported results of 593 intrauterine transfusions in 210 pregnancies (14). The overall survival rate was 86% and 78% for hydropic fetuses. The proce-dure loss was 1.7%. The LOTUS study provided a long-term follow- up after intrauterine transfusion, focusing on neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) (15). NDI consisted of at least one of these: cerebral palsy, severe developmental delay or bilateral deafness and/or blindness. There were 389 survivors out of 426 transfused fetuses. Complete data was available for 87% (338). NDIs were detected in 9% (31/338): bilateral deafness in three, cerebral palsy in five and severe developmental delay in 23 of the babies. AF OD450s, middle cerebral artery peak systolic pressures and intrauterine transfusions were out- standing advances. While these breakthroughs were occurring in obstetrics, the field of neonatol-the journal for alumni and friends of yale o B/Gyn 9ogy was making enormous progress. Neonatolo- gists developed the neonatal intensive care unit concept and improved the care of prematurity, neonatal anemia and hyperbilirubinemia. Their ingenuity and dedication are responsible for many of the advances in the care of Rh-affected babies. Rh-IMMUne PRoPhYlaXIs For centuries it was believed that the maternal and fetal circulations were separate. The possibil- ity that fetal cells could enter the maternal circu- lation was not understood. In 1954 Dr. Chown reported three anemic newborns whose mothers had fetal hemoglobin detected in their circula- tions (16), proving the concept of transplacental hemorrhage. Dr. Levine soon demonstrated that the Rh-negative mothers became immunized by transplacental hemorrhage while carrying Rh- positive fetuses. As a third-year resident at the New York Hospital/ Cornell Medical Center, I was intrigued by the process of Rh-alloimmunization. Since the initial detections of antibodies most often occurred postpartum, I wanted to investigate how fetal blood entered the maternal circulation at delivery. Performed long before the existence of institu-tional review boards, this research was rigorously supervised (17). After the baby and placenta were delivered, 20ml of the mother's chromate- tagged blood was instilled in the uterine cavity with the mother in Trendelenburg position. Ma- ternal venous blood was drawn at 5-, 10-, 30- and 60-minute intervals, demonstrating a transfer of red cells and plasma into the maternal circulation (Figure 4). Trendelenburg position and anesthesia appeared to enhance transfer, whereas methyl-ergonovine appeared to be more effective in de-creasing transfer than oxytocin. With the advent of RhIG, this research seemed less important, but it could still be a piece of the puzzle in auto-immune disease or AF embolus.Figure 4 The Kleihauer-Betke (KB) stain was a technique enabling investigators to identify and quantify fetal erythrocytes in the maternal circulation (18). Many investigators used this tool to study transplacental bleeding as the pathogenesis of Rh erythroblastosis fetalis. I spent many years in my laboratory at Cornell in New York City study- ing mechanisms of maternal immunization. Of course, we knew transfusing incompatible blood to Rh-negative women or, even more tragically, the injection of paternal blood into an Rh-negative daughter for potential protection against infec-tious disease could cause Rh immunization. The main genesis of maternal immunization, however, was transplacental hemorrhage. This became fer - tile ground for investigators for almost a decade. Our group at Cornell used the K-B stain to track fetal erythrocytes and fluorescent antibody tech-niques to track Rh-positive fetal erythrocytes as they entered the maternal circulation. The work of numerous investigators showed an interest- ing phenomenon. Some mothers had fetal cells identified in their circulations in the first trimester, though infrequent and very low in volume. There was a slight increase in the second trimester, but in the third trimester the frequency of the trans-placental passage of cells increased to as high as 70% of mothers. Most mothers had fetal cells in their circulations postpartum (Figure 5). It became obvious that delivery was the main immunizing event. Another cohort of mothers had no fetal cells detected antepartum, but postpartum had a transient presence of fetal red cells (Figure 6). This cohort had fetuses that were incompatible yale oBstetrical and Gynecolo Gical society 10with the mother in the ABO system. It seemed obvious that the maternal incompatibility in the ABO blood group was removing the fetal cells with maternal antibodies, a concept that was compatible with the work of Dr. Levine (19). Figure 5 Figure 6 Simultaneously, at Columbia Presbyterian Medi- cal Center, Vincent Freda, John Gorman and Bill Pollock from Ortho Pharmaceutical had teamed up to test the hypothesis that the Rh-positive fe-tal red cells could be cleared with administration of Rh-antibody postpartum. To test this hypothe- sis, Freda injected Rh-negative prison volunteers with 10ml of Rh-positive red cells. Three days later Freda returned to the prison to inject half of the volunteers (study) with anti-Rh antibody. The other half (controls) received nothing. The study was repeated at monthly intervals for five months. At six months, 0 of the 4 treated were immunized, compared to 4 out of 5 of the con- trols. A second phase of the study brought the results to 0 of 9 (treated) immunized compared to 7 of 11 (controls). The experiment showed that anti-Rh antibody protected the volunteers from developing active immunization (20). To test this discovery in patients, the Columbia team enlisted Elmer Jennings of Long Beach Me- morial Hospital and me at Cornell Medical Center. Our protocol was to administer 5-6000 micro-grams of Rh-immune globulin to Rh-negative mothers delivering Rh-positive babies who were ABO compatible with their mothers. David Zimmerman, a medical writer, recognized the enormous import of these studies and began to chronicle our progress in order to write a book. The following is an excerpt from Zimmerman's book, Rh: The Intimate History of a Disease and Its Conquest (21). On Sept. 9, 1965 Dr. Singher of Ortho Pharma- ceutical called a secret meeting at the Waldorf-Astoria to discuss the six-month results of the trials, which were reported and posted on a blackboard. Following the meeting, Ortho participants would not comment. But the clini-cal investigators emerged elated and could see no reason to keep secrets: John Gorman, Vince Freda, John Queenan and Alvin Zipursky were seated in a bar discussing the six-month results: 0 immunized/92 treated versus 21 immunized/94 controls. Dr. Zimmerman asked, \"Do these figures have statistical significance?\" \"As the figures were posted on the black- board, we could see it was proven,\" added John Gorman. \"Then Dr. Zipursky dropped a bombshell,\" he explained. \"He had been injecting anti-Rh antibody, not at delivery as everyone else was doing, but as small divided doses during pregnancy, as everyone feared to do. Dr. Zipursky believed that immunization oc-curred before delivery. So he had been inject-ing small doses of 7S antibodies, small enough to prevent immunization but not large enough to harm the fetus.\" On his notepad John Gor - man had jotted: \"Dr. Zipursky broke through a barrier. Can give 7S in pregnancy.\" the journal for alumni and friends of yale o B/Gyn 11The postpartum prophylaxis concept proved successful in our small clinical trial. It was now time to add more centers to test a much lower 300 microgram dose on a large scale to gain FDA approval. Simultaneously and independently, the Cyril Clarke team in Liverpool was working on the same problem, and the race was on to see if a clinically proven program of postpartum adminis- tration of anti-Rh antibody (passive immunization) could prevent active immunization in the Rh-neg-ative mother. Their progress was well known to us as we each presented our findings at scientific meetings and in research reports in the literature. Both teams arrived at successful large-scale trials at the same time, proving that postpartum Rh- antibody could prevent Rh immunization. The acceptance by clinicians was slower than expected. The success of postpartum Rh-prophy- laxis was reported frequently at scientific meet- ings and in journal articles. It proved successful in preventing 90% of immunizations in moth- ers who heretofore became immunized during pregnancy. We observed an impressive drop in the number of new immunizations. But curiously, even though this was a lifesaving measure, full utilization took almost 10 years to achieve (Figure 7) (22). Figure 7 At a meeting in Boston in 1978, Dr. Bowman presented Canadian data with antepartum Rh-immune globulin at 28 and 34 weeks, aimed at preventing the 10% not protected by postpar - tum Rh-immune globulin (23). Most skepticism centered on the expense of giving prophylaxis unnecessarily to mothers carrying Rh-negative fetuses, estimated to be as high as 40%. But Dr. Bowman prevailed as his data showed that the targeted 10% of patients not protected by postpartum Rh-prophylaxis could be effectively protected. A two-dose regimen evolved, 300 micrograms at 28 weeks and again postpartum. Surprisingly, the utilization was almost immediate (Figure 7). At the time of postpartum RhIG intro- duction, perhaps the education and promulgation of a new procedure was not as efficient, but I suspect the rapid compliance with antepartum RhIG was a result of the current professional li- ability crisis, which fostered a climate of immedi-ate adherence to standards of care. The results of Rh-immune prophylaxis are evident today. The incidence of Rh disease is very low, and the loss of a baby is even rarer. But has the problem gone away? Unlike active immunization as used in rubella, poliomyelitis and tetanus, the prophylaxis for Rh-disease is passive. The clinical vigilance and the need for protection have not changed. All significant exposures to Rh-antigen must be covered with RhIG. Figure 8 is a presen-tation of the risk of Rh immunization in various clinical situations with degree of risk. Figure 8 fUTURe RhIG is easily attainable in the United States, but this is not true for all countries, and shortages have occurred. The current system of produc- tion relies on pooled human plasma from actively immunized men. Development of a monoclonal yale oBstetrical and Gynecolo Gical society 12antibody would have the advantages of purity, lower cost and greater availability. But even with a monoclonal antibody, we still would be relying on the less than perfect system of passive im-munization. In my judgment, we have a workable stopgap measure that miraculously has more than decimated the incidence of Rh-alloimmuni- zation, but I am convinced that someday there will be a better answer than passive immuniza-tion. This remarkable three-decade period of discovery, diagnosis, treatment and prophylaxis of Rh-disease was the result of multinational cooperation in conquering the disease. Today Rh- disease rarely causes fetal or newborn deaths.the journal for alumni and friends of yale o B/Gyn 13RefeRenCes 1.

These include the consequences of an assembly, over time, of hyperandrogenemia, central visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance (Ins Res), leading to a cluster of metabolic risk factors collec-tively known as the metabolic syndrome (medS) (see Box 1). As a result, given the risk of cardiac/ metabolic/endocrine dysfunction and disease evolving into adulthood, PCOS is now a challenge for all clinicians and biomedical scientists.Although no single defining genetic flaw has been identified, there is an apparent genomic/ epigenetic basis underlying the variable timing, initiation and intensity of PCOS. In most cases, PCOS gradually emerges as a distinct clinical en- tity in pre- and peri-pubertal and adolescent girls and evolves into its full form in late adolescence or early adulthood (see Box 2). An epigenetic reaction to an environmental challenge at any stage in the lifecycle, including in utero, leads to altered homeostatic set points that persist and propagate, even across generations. The morphology of the polycystic ovary depicts a variable rate of activation and recruitment but otherwise normal follicle development and progression, which is arrested at the early antral stage. Normal numbers of primordial \"reserve\" follicles, normal numbers of primary and second-ary follicles, and a rate of atresia emphasize the inherent \"normalcy\" of these follicles other than the pace of their development and their failure to proceed to dominant follicle maturation.

Regardless of what therapy is applied - weight loss, exercise, insulin sensitizers, gonadotropin enhancement with HMG or recombinant hu-man FSH, or modulation with estrogen agonists/antagonists - the PCO is capable of surprising re- siliency with swift recovery of apparently normal albeit therapeutically induced cyclic oscillations and ovulation. In summary, the PCO ovary, in most instances, is inherently physiologically normal. It is inhibited by imposed intra- and extra-gonadal factors. When this inhibition is eliminated or reversed, normal function is restored. But with restoration and induction of ovulation and fertility, PCOS women still face additional problems. PCos anD PReGnanCY CoMPlICa TIons 1. When pregnant, PCOS mothers are at increased risk of: Pregnancy-associated hypertension preeclampsia Gestational diabetes Pregnancy loss, premature delivery Cesarean section, birth canal trauma 2. Pregnancy in PCOS mothers adversely affects the fetus: Large for gestational age (LGA), macrosomia Small for gestational age (SGA) Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) 3. Affects the neonate: Birth trauma, shoulder dystocia Neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia Elevated C-peptide levels in cord blood Admission to NICU 4. Progeny (female) of PCOS mothers face lifelong (infancy through late adult life) risk of all or individual elements of the metabolic syndrome as well as recurrence of PCOS, CV disease, DM 2 and endometrial cancer. ACOG Practice Bulletin # 108, October 2009 (citations 30 - 45) RaTIonale foR PRoPoseD sTUDY When pregnant, PCOS women face triple the risk of developing gestational diabetes and 3.5 times the risk of developing hypertension/preeclampsia. hYPeRTensIon anD PReeClaMPsIa Although the prospects for early predictive first trimester identification of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the placental deficien- cies (size, depth of invasion, degree of remodel-ing of the spiral arteries) that were the precur - sors to the emergence of preeclampsia later in pregnancy may finally be a reality, opportunities for safe intervention/therapeutic modification, if not reversal, are not available for first trimester interventions (hazards of inducing teratogenicity in the fetus, maternal hypotension). What is avail-able are reactive responses to emerging classical signs of excess weight gain, edema, proteinuria or incipient rises in blood pressure followed by standard management, hopefully until safe induc-tion of labor. Delivery is the only \"cure.\" Emerg- ing but not widely tested and confirmed as useful are maternal markers of incipient, evolving, worsening severity of impending preeclampsia. These are sFlt-1, PLGF and s-Endoglin, among others. None of the current elements of care, although ameliorative - even expert meticulous prenatal care in large academic centers affiliated with research universities - totally avoid serious maternal and neonatal morbidities. GesT aTIonal DIabeTes In dealing with the risk of gestational diabetes occurring in PCOS mothers, the challenge is not identifying those with subclinical or occult, unrec- ognized overt DM2 in the non-pregnant state. the journal for alumni and friends of yale o B/Gyn 17The parameters evaluating glucose regulation established by the ADA and the IADP5G, utilizing criteria for FG, OGTT, HgAIc and a variety of fam- ily and personal history items, perform well on serial sequential measurements. Rather, the dif-ficulty in determining abnormal glycemic control during pregnancy, once thought to be well es- tablished, is no longer considered definitive. The thresholds for diagnostic definition of pathologic dysglycemia resulting from the compounding influences of feto-placenta induced insulin resis- tance, the degree of maternal insulin resistance and limited maternal beta cell reserve (which correlates with fetal neonatal and maternal morbidities) have been upset by the large HAPO study. In this report the risk of adverse outcomes continuously increased as a function of glycemia at 24-48 weeks, gestation, even within ranges previously thought to be well within the scope of normal. Indeed, for most complications, \"no threshold for increased risk could be defined.\" The problem therefore is not the effectiveness of diet, exercise and insulin (or metformin) man-agement in the reduction of these burdens, but when and in whom these strategies should be employed. Furthermore, in both conditions (preeclampsia and gestational diabetes), early adverse fetal epi- genetic programming in reaction to under-/over-nutrition condemns the fetus to lifelong adverse and accelerating cardio/metabolic dysfunction and disease. In addition, these circumstances lead to intra- and transgenerational transfer and retention of these risks in future generations. These issues crystallize the most serious limitation of reac- tive strategies for exclusively antenatal control of these disorders. Therapeutic interventions restricted to the latter half of pregnancy deny the possibility of first trimester correction of the initi-ating abnormalities of placental function and the adverse permanent epigenetic programming the fetus undertakes to cope with these conditions. hYPoTheses basIC PRInCIPles: A correlation of epigenetic biomarkers with disease needs to be identified in order to develop early-stage diagnoses. A correlation of epigenetic biomarkers with acquired, compounding \"environmental stresses\" needs to be developed for early-stage diagnoses. The paradigm that genetics is the primary molecular mechanism involved in biology and medicine needs to be modified to include epigenetics as a crucial regulatory factor as well. 1. The pre-pregnancy cardio/endocrine/meta-bolic status of the PC os woman is correlated with development of pregnancy complications. The PCOS phenotype emerges progressively from early infancy through childhood and ado-lescence and into adulthood. In the more se-vere forms, the defining attributes (i.e., obesity, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance) may be seen as early as childhood (obesity, premature pubarche, sleep apnea). As this developmental evolution accelerates, by late adolescence and post-adolescence the majority of PCOS young women in the U.S. demonstrate some evidence of the metabolic syndrome; i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance and increased visceral (abdominal) adiposity. The advent of pharmacologic induction of ovulation and pregnancy in these women does not mean that they are spared the cardio/metabolic bur - dens of the syndrome and increased prospect of complication arising in pregnancy. Pregnant PCOS mothers face increased risks of developing intragestational hypertension and preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus resulting from the initial presence and incremental deteriora- tion of cardio/endocrine/metabolic status that the pregnancy imposes. QUesTIon To TesT hYPoTheses: Will pre-pregnancy identification of particular risk factors and specific corrective therapy reduce the intra-pregnancy burdens of the PCOS mother and her fetus? 2. The intra- and intergenerational transmis- sion of PCos is caused by intrauterine fetal epigenetic reaction society 18The pathophysiologic burdens arising preg- nancy are not limited to the PCOS mother; they impose serious constraints on the well-being of the entirely dependent, developing fetus. In order to modify the impact of these adverse maternal circumstances (hypertension, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia) and maximize fetal well-being, reactive fetal epigenetic protective reprogram-ming strategies are initiated. Accordingly, homeo-static set points are modified to shift fuel and nutrient distribution, utilization and storage and prioritize the degree of fetal organ development, growth and function. However well these strate- gies compensate and accommodate - \"match\" - the constrained intrauterine environment, their effects are maintained and even propagate after birth. Accordingly, in the nutritionally deprived SGA or IUGR fetus, they may not match (\"mis- match\") the extra-uterine environment encoun-tered after birth. The reprogrammed homeostatic set points and their consequences are no longer protective. Rather, these increase the vulnerabil- ity of child, adolescent and adult to the burdens inherent in the behavioral and dietary character -istics of developed societies. Similarly, the LGA fetus, through over-nutrition (maternal hypergly- cemia and hyperlipidemia), enters by and hepatic steatosis. In both types of PCOS prog-eny, incremental cumulative burdens experienced from childhood through adulthood, consisting of lipotoxicity, glucotoxicity and a systemic inflam-matory state, inevitably increase the risk of even-tual cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and cancer in the adult progeny of PCOS women.

Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiologythe journal for alumni and friends of yale o B/Gyn 19rwanda - obstetric f istula Obstetric fistula is a devastating maternal mor - bidity commonly found in third-world countries where access to obstetric care is limited or non- existent. This preventable condition results from prolonged obstructed labor, sometimes lasting three to four days. It commonly occurs in primipa-rous adolescents, owing to cultures in which girls marry young and fertility enhances social status. Obstetric fistula involves urologic, gastrointestinal and gynecologic injuries, resulting in urinary and sometimes fecal incontinence. Socially, women with this condition are ostracized and abandoned by their husbands and family, and often live isolated in shame and poverty. A 2010 estimate shows approximately two to three million women in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa suffering from fistula, and the World Health Organization esti- mates between 50,000 and 100,000 new cases each year. The Republic of Rwanda is one of the many African countries in which women are affected by obstetric fistula. Roughly the size of Mary-land, Rwanda is located in east-central Africa and is home to 11.4 million people, more than half of whom are under 18 years old. This is largely due to the infamous 1994 genocide in which an estimated one million people were killed. Since the genocide, Rwanda has begun a rebirth under the leadership of President Paul Kagame. One of the many accomplishments thus far has been the institution of national health insurance, which covers 92% of the population. However, the qual- ity of healthcare is still very limited. This is in part due to the lack of qualified medical professionals, many of whom were killed or fled the country during the genocide. The recent ratio estimates one physician for every 18,000 residents. Maternal health in Rwanda is gradually improving, in part due to the training of healthcare profes- sionals and increased access to obstetric care. According to the United Nations Population Fund, approximately 63.5% of births were attended by a skilled health worker in 2010. Their fistula pro-gram also provided surgical repair to 245 women between January and September 2010. Visiting surgeons have further assisted fistula repair rates and native physician training. However, additional improvements are needed and recognized by the Rwanda Ministry of Health for both the preven- tion and management of obstetric fistula. These include enhancement of their fistula program, focus on emergency obstetric and neonatal care, improved access to contraception, and partnering with training institutions. The International Organization of Women and Development (www.iowd.org) is an organization dedicated to the prevention of obstetric fistula, treatment of fistula and education of these women. A team of urogynecologists, colorec- tal surgeons, urologists, anesthesiologists and nurses has traveled to Rwanda three times per year (October, January and April) since April 2010, completing five missions to date. In April 2011, the IOWD performed 25 fistula repairs and 10 other major gynecologic surgeries. Rwanda pro-vides a unique and exciting opportunity to train native physicians and nurses.

Rutherford re- turned to Jamaica as part of a medical mission in association with Sacred Heart University. A total of 37 healthcare professionals were involved, including 10 nursing students and four nurse practitioner students as well as YNHH commu- nity members Leroi Stephenson, technologist; and Dana Marie Roque, MD, Gynecologic Oncology fellow. The group brought with them multiple suitcases filled with medications and surgical supplies. Over the course of one week, the general sur - gery and gynecologic teams performed a total of 44 procedures, including abdominal hysterec-tomy, Bartholin's gland excision, abdominal and inguinal hernia repair, and cholecystectomy, at St. Joseph's Hospital in Kingston. Some patients traveled over three hours by bus to obtain care. Medical teams staffed outreach clinics that provided internal medicine, pediatric and gyneco- logic services to surrounding rural communities and villages such as Braes River, Glenn Hope, St. Elizabeth's Church, Tivoli Gardens and Santa Cruz. Collectively, as many as 100 patients were evaluated per day. Sister Grace Yap, founder of the Franciscan ministries in Jamaica, coordinates this effort annually. She also helps to educate visiting volunteers about Jamaican culture, socioeco- nomics and barriers to healthcare access. At the conclusion of the week, all undistributed health-care goods were donated to the community. Thomas J.

With near universal health insurance coverage and one of the fastest-falling infant mortality rates ever recorded, Rwanda is focused on developing a sustainable pipeline of skilled healthcare professionals to support contin-ued development. Yale joined the Rwanda Health Education Consortium last year with specific focuses in the areas of internal medicine, pediat- rics, obstetrics and gynecology, and health man-agement. Yale will be collaborating with several other United States universities to strengthen medical student and resident education as well as healthcare delivery. There are estimated to be 480 trained physicians in Rwanda (one doctor for every 18,000 people) and only 11 Obstetrician/Gynecologists. The Con-sortium plans to hire United States physicians for a minimum year-long commitment to work in Rwanda as well as rotating subspecialists to train medical students and residents in obstetrics and gynecology. This will also provide an opportunity for Yale residents to rotate on elective in Rwanda. The proposal has been funded for five years and will begin July 2012.Urania Magriples, MD Associate Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences Co-Director, Maternal-Fetal Medicine Clinical Practice Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences Y ale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut the journal for alumni and friends of yale o B/Gyn 23baCKGRoUnD Chronic inflammatory environment and enhanced cell survival (i.e, balance between proliferation and apoptosis) play prominent roles in the establish-ment and progression of endometriosis. The p38 MAPK pathway transduces signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus in response to a wide range of cellular stimuli and environmental stress-es. p38 MAPK regulates a variety of cellular func- tions including cytokine production, proliferation and apoptosis. The aims of this study were to de-termine the expression and activity of p38 MAPK in normal and endometriotic human endometrium, and to evaluate its regulatory effect on cytokine production and cell survival in endometriosis. MeThoDs Comparison of p38 MAPK expression and phos- phorylation throughout the menstrual cycle in normal and endometriotic human endometrium was performed with immunohistochemistry. IL-8 expression and apoptosis were evaluated in endometriotic implants with immunohistochemis- try and TUNEL assay, respectively, and correlated with p38 MAPK activity in vivo. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the effects of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF- and IL-1b) on p38 MAPK cells. The in the regula-tion proinflammatory cytokine-induced IL-8 and MCP-1 expression in cultured investigated with ELISA. TUNEL, BrdU and MTT assays were performed to evaluate the effect of the p38 MAPK pathway on cell survival in endometriotic cells in vitro. The data were analyzed with Student's t-test, one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Holm-Sidak test or Pear - son correlation test. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.ResUl Ts p38 MAPK activity (phosphorylation) and ectopic, epithelial and stromal cells of endometriosis patients compared to those cells in normal endometrium during late proliferative and early secretory phases (p<0.05). Moreover, p38 in epithelial cells of ectopic endometrium of endo-metriosis patients were significantly higher than same patients' eutopic endometrium (p<0.05). Phosphorylated p38 MAPK expression was significantly higher in both epithelial and stromal cells of the superficial ectopic endometri- al implants compared to those of deeper implants of the same sample. Increased MAPK activity in endometriotic cells was correlated with IL-8 expression (Pearson cor - relation coefficient r=0.83, but proinflammatory cytokine-induced MCP-1 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, in endometriotic blockage of the p38 MAPK pathway did not change the survival of the cultured endo- metriotic cells. ConClUsIon Enhanced p38 MAPK activity may contribute to the inflammatory environment in endometriosis. Although the p38 MAPK pathway is not directly involved in the survival of ectopic endometriosis implants, the inflammatory environment created by p38 MAPK may result in establishment and progression of endometriosis.2011 rEsid ENts' rEsEarc H daY - aBstracts oF Ns P38 m itogen- activated Protein Kinase (ma PK) i s involved in the Pathogenesis of e ndometriosis by m odulating i nflammation, But PhD Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences, Y ale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticutyale oBstetrical and Gynecolo Gical society 24obJeCTIVe We sought chemotherapy regimens against uterine serous papillary adeno-carcinoma (USPC). sTUDY half of which overexpress HER-2/neu at 3+ level, were evaluated for growth rate and in vitro sensitivity to 14 single-agent chemothera- pies and five combinations by ChemoFx (Preci-sion Pittsburgh, PA). ResUl Ts Cell lines overexpressing HER-2/neu showed higher proliferation when compared to low HER-2/neu-expressing cell lines and a lower half maximum inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] when exposed to the majority of single-agent chemo- therapies. High HER-2/neu expressors were more sensitive to platinum compounds, manifesting a 5.22-fold decrease in carboplatin-IC(50) (P = .005) and a 5.37-fold decrease in cisplatin-IC(50) (P = .02).

MeThoD We followed 1,428 pregnant women and their children prospectively, using structured inter - views and medical record review until the child's sixth year of life. Infections during pregnancy were identified for hospital admissions, emer - gency department visits and problems identified as outpatients. Asthma in children was defined as physician diagnosis with current symptoms at age six. Adjusted odds ratios (ORa) were calculat- ed from multivariable logistic regression models. ResUl Ts There were 635 women (44.5%) who experi- enced infection during any antepartum infec-tion in pregnancy was associated with childhood asthma (ORa 1.49, 95% CI 1.07-2.07); however, among the specific infections, only antepartum urinary tract infection was significantly associ-ated (ORa 1.48, 95% CI 1.03-2.12). Rectovaginal colonization with group B streptococcus was re- ported for 20.9% of women but was not found to be associated with childhood asthma (ORa 1.29, 95% CI 0.90-1.84). ConClUsIon This study found an increased risk of asthma in children of women diagnosed with urinary tract infections during pregnancy, while other maternal infections did not appear to be associ-ated with asthma in offspring. Maternal and fetal immune and inflammatory responses to urinary pathogens, as well as alterations in microflora associated with infection and antibiotic exposure, may present a unique set of circumstances that predispose to an atopic state in offspring.maternal i nfection in Pregnancy and r isk of a sthma in offspring Charlene Hooper, MD, MPH; Kari Risnes, MD; Errol R.

The keratin cytoskeleton forms a complex, highly dynamic intracellular network that can change in response to cell cycle changes and cellular movement and differentiation. Here we investigate the expres-sion of CK15 in the human endometrium and its regulation by HOXA10 in the human endometrial cell lines. MeThoDs Endometrial biopsy specimens from throughout the menstrual cycle (N=32) were evaluated for CK15 protein expression by immunohistochem- istry, using a mouse monoclonal antibody. The human endometrial stromal cell line (HESC) and human endometrial epithelial cell (Ishikawa) were transfected at 60%-70% confluence with pcDNA/HOXA10; transfection with empty pcDNA vector served as a control. Transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated twice. Seventy-two hours after the transfection, total RNA was isolated. Quantitative RT-PCR was per - formed to determine expression levels of CK15. Results were compared using a non-paired t-test. ResUl Ts In the peri-implantation window (days 16 through 23), CK15 protein expression in the glandular epithelium of the human endometrium decreased to 50% of the proliferative phase expression level. CK15 mRNA expression decreased after pCDNA/HOXA10 cells. CK15 was not regulated by HOXA10 in HESC cells, and no significant varia- tion was observed in CK15 expression in stromal endometrial cells throughout the menstrual cycle. CK15 expression corresponded to the time of maximal secretory epithelial remodeling. ConClUsIon CK15 gene expression is decreased in a HOXA10-dependent fashion in human endome-trial epithelial cells. Expression decreases in the peri-implantation period concurrent with maximal HOXA10 expression. Dramatic changes in cellular architecture are necessary to achieve the secre-tory changes in the endometrial epithelium that bring about the implantation window. Alterations in CK15 likely facilitate these cytoskeletal chang-es, ultimately promoting endometrial receptivity.ho r Haines, MS; Hugh S.

The purpose of this retrospective study is to report the efficacy and tolerability of C and I chemotherapy with VCBT in the treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma at Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH). MeThoDs Patients (pts) diagnosed with uterine carcino- sarcoma in years 1996 - 2008 were identified through the Tumor Board Registry of YNHH. De-mographic and clinical data including stage, his-tology, grade, dose, need for dose reduc- tion, toxicities, co-morbidities, progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were obtained. Pts received C 40 mg/m 2 on day 1 and I 1.2 mg/m2 daily on days 1 to 4 with Mesna every 4 weeks for 6 cycles. High dose rate intracavitary VCBT was delivered with a vaginal cylinder. A total of 14 Gy was delivered in 2 fractions of 7 Gy each prescribed to a depth of 0.5 cm. The two frac- tions were administered 2 weeks apart in cycles 1 and 2. ResUl Ts A total of 29 pts treated with C and I were identi- fied, and 23 of 29 pts received VCBT. Median age of pts is 65 (range 40-82). There were sixteen pts (54.8%) with stage I/II, 8 (27.6%) with stage III, and 5 (17.2%) with stage IV disease. Eighteen (62%) pts completed C and I without a dose reduction, and 6 required a dose reduction, while 5 required early termination (3 of 5 pts completed <5 cycles). At median follow-up of 19 months (range 6-73), disease progression occurred in 9 pts (31%) and death occurred in 7 pts. With VCBT, no isolated vaginal failures were identified.

Quantitative RT-PCR was used to identify potential mechanisms underlying the differential sensitivity/resistance to patupilone versus paclitaxel in primary USPC cell lines. ResUl Ts Cell lines overexpressing HER-2/neu showed higher proliferation when compared to low HER-2/neu-expressing cell lines. Compared to low-expressing cell lines, high HER-2/neu expres- sors were significantly more sensitive to patu- pilone than to paclitaxel (p<0.0002). In contrast, there was no appreciable difference in sensitivity to patupilone versus paclitaxel in primary USPC cell lines with low HER-2/neu expression.

H daY yale oBstetrical Gical society 50NEWs itEMs honoRInG MaRY laKe Polan, MD Healthcare for women changed dramatically in the early 1970s. Revolutionary changes to our profession, including fetal monitoring, ultrasound, radioimmuno assays and che- motherapy, were pioneered here at Yale. Equally profound changes affected the practitioners of our profession. This year at YOGS we are celebrat ing the most profound of these changes: the choice of the first woman resident at Yale. We are delighted to celebrate the career of Dr. Mary Lake Polan. Mary Lake was no stranger to Yale when she started her residency here in 1975. She already had earned her PhD in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale in 1970, and had already done an NIH-sponsored postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Joseph Gall when she started medical school here in 1972. Upon finishing her residency, she stayed on to com-plete her fellow ship in Gynecologic Endocrinology and Infer - tility. What most of you don't know is that Mary Lake also served for six months as the Gynecologic Oncology fellow. (Peter Schwartz wanted to remind you all of how much Mary Lake likes to cut!) She remained on faculty here until 1990, when the lovely weather in Palo Alto (and perhaps the school there) encouraged her to move to Stanford, where she became Chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Mary Lake's interests continued to expand. She earned an MPH degree in the Maternal and Child Health Program at the University of California, Berkeley. Those interests then led her to organize a team to travel to East Africa to treat fistulas and other obstetrical complications. She continues these activities to this day; her request to all of our speakers at our YOGS event was to comment on the interna tional consequences of their work. While at Stanford, Mary Lake was elected to the Institute of Medicine. She has advised the NIH on Opportunities for Research on Women's Health. She has also served as an advisor to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Of course, as a renowned bench researcher, she has hundreds of publica-tions on many exciting topics, including ovarian function, steroidogenesis and endometriosis. Research interests currently include the interaction of the immune and endocrine systems. Being an East Coast person at heart, Mary Lake finally left sunny California for New York, where she is now Visiting Professor at Columbia. When asked to comment on her biggest obstacle, she replied to one interviewer, \"Trying to raise a family and having a career are difficult to blend.\" But she has accomplished both admirably, although her very talented daughter who attended our medical school could not be persuaded to become an Ob/Gyn! Among Mary Lake's other talents, which many of you do not know, is that she published an adventure novel in 1987, revolving around in vitro fertilization! the journal for alumni and friends of yale o B/Gyn 51In fonD MeMoRY hilton Kort, MD Dr. Hilton Kort died Friday, May 6, 2011 at the age of 64. A native of South Africa, Dr. Kort immigrated with his family to the United States in 1978 as a Ford Foundation Fellow at Yale University's School of Medicine. Dr. Kort co-founded Reproductive Biology Associates, which pioneered the birth of the first baby in Georgia utilizing in vitro fertilization. Today, Dr. Kort's practice is one of the preeminent IVF clinics in the world with close to 10,000 births. As a competitive endurance athlete, Dr. Kort was a two-time Ironman finisher and a three-time member of Team USA, competing in the Triathlon Age Group World Championships. A pillar in the community, Dr. Kort served as the Chairman of the Board of Trust- ees for Pace Academy. Hilton Kort is survived, revered and loved by his two sons, Anton and Jonathan, daughter-in-law Jackie and his wife of nearly 35 years, Philippa. elizabeth M. sabga, MD Dr. Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Sabga died on May 11, 2011 at the age of 50 at Bloomington Hospital. Dr. Sabga was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on January 22, 1961 and was educated at Harvard and Radcliffe colleges, the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and the University of California at San Diego. She was board certified in obstetrics and gynecology and a fellow of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She had practiced with Greater New Haven Ob/Gyn in Connecticut and with Aegis Women's Healthcare as well as practicing gynecology with her partners, Brandt Ludlow and Betsy Birch, in Bloomington. Dr. Sabga was a volunteer for the Red Cross, the Community Foundation of Bloomington and Monroe County, and Volunteers in Medicine. She was a member of Congregation Beth Shalom, drummer in the band Don't Call Me Betty and singer in the chorus Voces Novae. She was an avid cyclist, half and full marathoner, and triathlete; a talented maker of chocolates; a gardener; and a dedicated fan of the New York Yankees. She is survived by her husband Dan Melamed; her mother Patricia Sabga of Westlake, Ohio; her sisters Mardy of Kalamazoo, Michigan, and Patty of Malvern, Eng- land; her brothers Tom of Cincinnati and Mike of Westlake, Ohio; her nieces Sarah, Lesley and Robbie; and her nephews Art and Gabe.
