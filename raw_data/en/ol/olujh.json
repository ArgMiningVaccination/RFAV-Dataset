As Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, as a researcher and pediatrician, Dr. Hotez knows first-hand the importance and value of vaccines. He also knows how harmful movements against them have been, in particular the anti-vaccine movement that has sought to link vaccines to autism. And, while he joins the echo of voices in the scientific community that have repeatedly refuted that false claim, he does so not just as a doctor, but as a father of a daughter- 25-year-old Rachel- who is on the Autism Spectrum. He takes on that myth in his book, [Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism](https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/content/vaccines-did-not-cause-rachels-autism). In it, Hotez aims to not only highlight the benefits of vaccines and disprove their connection to Autism, but he also shares insight into our current understanding of Autism. And he allows his daughter to share her experiences as a person with [Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd/index.shtml). Back in June of 2018, Houston Matters host [Craig Cohen](https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/staff/craig-cohen/) spoke with Hotez about the book and the preponderance of scientific evidence against the anti-vaccine movement. He holds a [book signing](https://www.brazosbookstore.com/event/peter-hotez-vaccines-did-not-cause-rachels-autism) Monday, Jan. 7, at 7 p.m. at Brazos Bookstore. "}
