So naturally, when many Hollywood celebrities started praising HGH as a miracle worker for anti-aging and calling it their fountain of youth, many people started wondering if it's based on scientific facts or just another commercial fiction. Many people and celebrities are talking about how HGH helps them feel stronger, think sharper, and improve their overall quality of life. In fact, some celebrities, including Sylvester Stallone are talking about the benefits of exogenous recombinant or synthetic rHGH injections, which can be quite expensive and come with their long list of side effects. But, experts and anti-aging specialists are also turning towards HGH secretagogues or natural HGH supplements that can be added to daily routine and manifest themselves as a boost in energy & fitness levels.

Unfortunately, not every product on the market has these and some of those who do, are hiding behind proprietary blends and might not have sufficient dosages for the body to react. 2. Even though the FTC is considering mandating that all homeopathic medicines marketed in the US come with a statement on their label stating there is NOT enough clinical evidence that they work, one noteworthy element of the HGH supplement sector is the continued popularity of homeopathic HGH. 3. Unfortunately, the HGH supplement industry is very much about the hype. That's why it's essential to find out if the product is indeed effective or if it just has a good marketing team. Products like Somaderm had attracted a cult-like following and were aggressively promoted by people who signed up for their MLM program.

The Top 10 Best HGH Pills & Supplements: Rated & Reviewed 1. Genf20 Plus HGH-releasing supplement and the best HGH supplement available to men & women. This HGH supplement, which has undergone clinical testing and is advised by Dr. Steven Lamm, stimulates the pituitary gland to increase the body's normal production of the hormone. In contrast to other HGH supplements and products on the market, which are only available as capsules, GenF20 Plus is available as an enteric-coated tablet (for better absorption) and an oral spray. This natural supplement is only sold on the official website and comes in a supply of one month that contains 120 tablets. What are Genf20 ingredients? It contains anti-somatostatin ingredients and deer antler velvet, making it one of most effective, herbal, non-prescription HGH booster available today. This supplement might raise HGH levels without causing any negative side effects because it has seven different mechanisms to naturally promote growth hormone. Currently, it is the HGH supplement brand we most highly suggest for anti-aging. 1.L-Arginine : According to research, [this ingredient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6049717/) can triple the levels of IGF-1 levels and Growth Hormone in your body, even in older individuals. You can also expect a boost in exercise performance, especially for high-intensity ones. 2. L-Glutamine : This ingredient is the buffer tool during exercise, the one that works on avoiding muscle catabolism and decreasing post-workout pain. According to research, HGH preserves glutamine stores that aren't in muscles, increasing the body's capacity to function longer and harder. The endurance it offers and the way it controls \"cortisol\" (the stress hormone) without causing negative effects are two other reasons why athletes and bodybuilders adore this substance. Inverse correlation exists between [cortisol and human growth hormone](https://www.powerandbulk.com/tips/hgh-mechanisms/cortisol-pathway-how-cortisol-is-related-to-hgh/). It's a top-notch anti-aging dietary ingredient for any HGH supplement. 3. L-Glycine : While this ingredient helps boost HGH production from the pituitary gland, it also has the extra benefit of calming the brain and boosting prostatic health for men. 4. L-Lysine: An amino acid that tenfolds the efficacy of arginine and improves athletic performance. 5. L-Tyrosine: A controlling amino acid for metabolism. Tyrosine is essential for managing depression and reducing fatigue. 6. L-Ornithine: This is an amino acid that enhances athletic performance by working in perfect harmony with arginine. 7. Deer antler velvet: [This ingredient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_antler) is an all-natural source of glucosamine, chondroitin, and collagen. The body uses it to create the glycosaminoglycans that make up cartilage tissue. In addition to male and female hormones, deer antler velvet also contains insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1), a hormone generated in the liver in response to stimulation by growth hormone. IGF-1 and HGH are so closely related that HGH production levels are measured using IGF-1, and many experts think that IGF-1 is responsible for the anti-aging effects of HGH. 8. Colostrum: Consuming colostrum has a lot of advantages, including accelerated healing, improved immunity, anti-aging, and enhanced lean muscle and bone mass. 9. GABA: Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a gamma neurotransmitter that is essential for the proper functioning of the hypothalamus and pituitary in the human brain. High levels of GABA are linked to [increased HGH secretion ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23075553/)which might be because of its activity within the hypothalamus, or by sending signals to the pituitary gland to keep it secreting hGH. 10. L-Valine: L-Valine is necessary for the metabolism of muscles as well as the growth and repair of tissue. 11. Chromium: By delivering glucose to cells and boosting insulin function, chromium aids in the maintenance of blood sugar levels. Additionally, higher HGH release might be caused by lower blood sugar levels! By burning fat and increasing energy, it aids in maintaining a healthy weight and metabolism. 12. Alpha GPC and Phosphatidyl Choline: You can change the pituitary response to release more HGH by [suppressing Somatostatin](https://www.powerandbulk.com/tips/hgh-mechanisms/cholinergic-pathway-suppressing-somatostatin/) (the enzyme that lowers HGH release from pituitary) by taking a choline supplement such as \"Alpha GPC\" or \"Phosphatidyl Choline\" (when other secretagogue ingredients are the pituitary to produce HGH). 13. Astragalus Root Extract: This boosts the immune system, digestion, and metabolism while boosting sweat production and reducing weariness. 14. Pituitary (Anterior) Powder: This aids in muscular tone and has a positive impact on the pituitary gland, and is an essential health supplement for a healthy pituitary gland. Genf20 Pros: - Increases the production of growth hormone through 7 mechanisms. - There has been a standalone clinical study (on the product itself, not individual ingredients!) - Has received high praise and endorsements from the medical community, such as Dr. Steven Lamm, who frequently appears on ABC's \"The View\" - Numerous favorable user reviews as well as a strong foundation of devoted long-term customers who consistently place orders. - Uses anti-somatostatin compounds as well as deer antler velvet, both of which are usually missing in most other HGH products in the market Genf20 Cons: - Relatively expensive - Might be ineffective for some people - Although uncommon, side symptoms like anxiety and nausea are possible. - There is still a need for a healthy diet & lifestyle; this is NOT a miracle anti-aging pill, that can just slow down aging. 2. HyperGH 14x Category-wise 4/5 Review: Considered by many specialists to be the best over-the-counter legal HGH-based steroid or bodybuilding supplement, [HyperGH 14x](https://www.powerandbulk.com/out/hyper.php) has a wide audience ready to testify that it might just be the most effective substitute for real HGH injections for bodybuilding.

To create the glycosaminoglycans that make up cartilage tissue, the body utilizes glucosamine. - Growth hormones such as Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1, also known as somatomedin C), which is produced in the liver in response to growth hormone stimulation, are also present in deer antler velvet. Ingredients - L-Arginine - L-Tyrosine - L-Glutamine - Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) - Colostrum - L-Ornithine Extract One of the most powerful HGH supplements for bodybuilding & legal performance enhancer for athletes available on the market, closest to real HGH - Profile of high-quality and varied ingredients - Contains Alpha GPC spray and Deer Antler Velvet - Alternative to HGH and steroids for bodybuilding that is legal and safe - Positive user reviews & loyal repeat customers - Pills with enteric coating for maximum absorption HyperGH 14x Cons: - Relatively expensive - Since it's considered a bodybuilding supplement, it could've been beneficial if they also added more testosterone-boosting ingredients 3.

The product offers a wide range of health & anti-aging advantages and may enhance physical performance and well-being.

What are Ageless Foundation UltraMAX GOLD Ingredients? It is one of the best 10 HGH supplements on the market thanks to adequate quantities of amino acids, GABA, and the anti-somatostatin components: Alpha GPC Glycerylphosphorylcholine), Acetyl L-Carnitine (HCI), Broad Bean Seed (Vicia faba) - Stevia Leaf Extract 150 mg Even so, some natural ingredients like the velvet from deer antlers seem to be absent from the pills, which raises a few question marks.

Men should take Nugenix\u00ae GH-Boost, which comes in the form of powder sticks, right before bedtime. That way, while you're sleeping, it's working to support endocrine balance, promote improved sleep quality, and promote HGH production during deep sleep. Another company which makes similar product is SculptNation, which offers HGH Boost and [Test Boost Max](https://www.outlookindia.com/outlook-spotlight/test-boost-max-review-a-look-at-ingredients-customer-reviews-side-effects-and-does-this-sculptnation-t-booster-work-news-235996). What are Nugenix GH Boost Ingredients? The Nugenix GH Boost HGH supplement makes it to the top 10 on the list of HGH products based on its contents, which are amino acids, one dopamine booster, and one anti-somatostatin molecule, Alpha-GPC. The product provides GABA, Glutamine, Lysine, Arginine, and Ornithine in large dosages, all with the single goal of stimulating the pituitary gland to unleash your inner beast. Ingredients - GABA - 3000mg ( One of the most powerful amino acids to enhance growth hormone levels naturally alongside L-arginine is Gamma aminobutyric acid ,also known as GABA) - L-Glutamine - 2000mg L-Lysine cowhage or the cow-itch plant, is a bean-like plant and its extracts have been known to increase cognitive functions. Used to treat Parkinson's disease, extracts contain l-dopa amino acid. Typically used to increase dopamine levels, cowhage is provided in conjunction with special chemicals to prevent loss before it reaches the brain. Higher dopamine levels are linked to HGH. ) - A-GPC - 25mg ( Alpha GPC works via two mechanisms - Blocking somatostatin hormone, just like Phosphatidyl Choline and by enhancing Dopamine levels.) Nugenix GH Boost Pros - Comes from a reputed company - Decent blend of ingredients Nugenix GH Boost Cons - Expansive - Mixed user reviews - Doesn't contain ingredients like deer antler, colostrum etc. - Doesn't contain ingredients to regulate insulin levels like chromium. Chromium functions by assisting the hormone insulin in its functions of controlling blood glucose levels. This decreases the body's need for \"insulin\" and lower insulin levels implies more HGH levels. 9. Natures Plus Ultra GHT Male Category-wise rating - Quality: GHT Male](https://www.powerandbulk.com/out/ghtmale.php) is a decent, robust HGH bodybuilding supplement made with high-quality ingredients that work as a natural testosterone booster letting HGH and testosterone both function through various physiological routes. However, their combined effects are far more significant than one might expect! Nevertheless, since the product excludes anti-somatostatin substances like cholinergic pills and others, we think it falls short of HyperGH 14x as an HGH booster. Ingredients - FuranoMax Fenugreek Extract (proprietary source of fenugreek furans, stanols and furanostanols from whole Trigonella foenum-graecum seed 400 mg - GHT Proprietary Nutrient Blend - Red Palm Oil (octadecanoic acid), Korean Root Ginseng (Panax Amino 50% [150 mg] polyphenols) 300 - Sea Vegetables Extract (Ascophyllum Fucus vesiculosus) 150 mg - Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia) (standardized extract) 125 mg - Velvet Bean (Mucuna pruriens) (standardized 15% [18.75%] seed [vinifera]) 125 mg - Tribulus terrestris Extract 125 mg - GlucodOXAMP Activated Protein Kinase Hormone Booster - Guggul (Commiphora mukul) extract 100 mg - Cassia 75 mg - Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) Root and Leaf Extract 25 mg - Phosphatidyl Choline (from soy lecithin) 15 mg - Boron (as citrate) 5.5 mg Natures Plus Ultra GHT Male Pros - Decent blend of amino acids, dopaminergic eg. Mucuna pruriens and cholinergic exotic ingredients like Tongkat ali, resveratrol, sea vegetables - Works as a Testosterone boosting & anti-oxidant supplement as well - Mostly positive user reviews Natures Plus Ultra GHT Male Cons - Too many ingredients, so might be an overall decent general wellbeing product, but a sub-par HGH supplement - Expansive - Some ingredients like amino acids seem underdosed for optimal HGH production HGH has a good mix of amino acids, dopamine enhancers and one anti-somatostatin compound Alpha GPC, making it through to the top 10 HGH supplements in the market. Symbiotropin was initially created for healthcare professionals to boost the hormone system. However, once people found out about its potency in promoting protein synthesis, it became a popular performance supplement. Consuming amino acids after physical activity helps build muscle by increasing protein synthesis and decreasing protein breakdown. This leads to better muscle balance and can be enhanced by proper nutrition for improved muscle recovery and growth. Athletes worldwide use Symbiotropin to maintain their strength and power. It is an effervescent drink that should be taken in cycles for optimal results. Ingredients - Symbiotropin\u00ae Blend - L-Glutamine Symbiotropin - Decent ingredient profile - Positive user reviews Symbiotropin Cons - Expensive - Uses a proprietary blend and some ingredients are under-dosed FAQs Where to buy HGH products? Consumers seeking to buy HGH supplements need to do so with considerable care; you can buy quality products and learn more about HGH offerings on the manufacturer's website! Some products are available only on company's official websites, while others might be available at Amazon, CSV, Walmart, iherb, vitaminshoppe, Bodybuilding.com etc. When searching for HGH products, the consumer needs to check out the different brands available, to examine the ingredients in the product, user reviews, examine any risks of potential side effects, and the ease of use of the product as well. Do HGH supplements work? Based on our research and analysis, user reviews etc., we believe that supplements like GenF20 Plus, HyperGH 14x, MHP Secretagogue Gold etc. have the potential to increase your HGH levels. The clinical study on Genf20 Plus did not measure for a direct increase in HGH. There was a 28% increase in IGF-1, not in HGH. (IGF-1 rises when HGH rises, and the test looked for IGF-1, not directly for HGH). However, as the studies included subjects ranging in age and weight, you have to keep in mind that your results may vary from what the supplement claims on its site and what the research shows. Is it safe to take HGH supplements? Before incorporating HGH supplements into your daily routine, caution is advised as they may contain ingredients like mucuna pruriens or somatotrophic-myonucleic growth factors. Combining these supplements with other drugs or supplements can lead to side effects that resemble those of long-term HGH users. HGH supplements raise Dopa-L levels, which can result in adverse effects. It is important to consult with a doctor before using any type of HGH supplement. Some users may initially experience an increase in energy, but some may also suffer from sleep problems. Some individuals with prior mental health issues have reported a worsening of their conditions after taking HGH supplements, especially if any ingredient in the product alters brain chemistry or neurotransmitters eg. Huperzine A. What's in the popular HGH supplements like Genf20 Plus, GH boost, Altomas etc.? Most natural HGH boosters in the market are generally made up of amino acids. However, any hGH product containing amino acids like L-arginine, L-glutamine etc. is good for anti-aging and enhancing hGH but it will NEVER have a dramatic effect. Studies done on the usage of amino acids to increase hGH were done on intravenous \"injections\" that were several times the doses you receive in pills. So, the supplement manufacturers create a HYPE around their hGH supplement that it contains such and such amount of amino acids proven to increase hGH. However, they leave out the fact that amino acids were used via injections to increase hGH and that too in ridiculously huge doses. Such huge doses when taken in oral pill form will produce some nasty sides like nausea, upset stomach, dizziness etc. So, some supplement manufacturers hit 2 stones with 1 bird by having lesser doses of amino acids in their product. They make their product safe to consume and raise their profit margins in the process. However, the consumer does not really feel the HGH effect and if there is any effect, it's mostly placebo effect. Finding good HGH products requires knowledge of individual ingredients and secretagogues (hgh releasers) in the product and how they work to enhance HGH production. For example, amino acids need to be combined with anti-somatostatin ingredients like choline/Alpha-GPC. There are 7 ingredients (HGH releasers or secretagogues) that are really good, top of the cream stuff, that have been proven to be most essential in enhancing HGH naturally. Are HGH supplements legal? In general, natural HGH supplements or releasers for the purpose of anti-aging & wellbeing are legal. HGH supplements are not considered a controlled substance by the FDA, however their sale and use are regulated. In some cases, the sale of HGH for bodybuilding or performance-enhancing purposes may be illegal. It is advisable to check the laws in your specific jurisdiction and consult with a doctor before taking any HGH supplement. What form can you get HGH supplements in? HGH products primarily come in 6 different categories - pills, sprays, sublingual liquid drops, powders, patch & gel. HGH supplements in pills form have got the most press & publicity and most popular among bodybuilders too. HGH booster pills are the most popular & hassle-free way of consuming a supplement. After pills, on second position, HGH Sprays seem quite popular. They are especially very appealing to those who believe in Homeopathy.
