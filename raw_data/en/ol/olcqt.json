Back to Contents Page 7 of 143 Country information Section 1 updated: 29 June 2020 1. Overview of the healthcare system 1.1.1 All Sri Lankans benefit from free health care1 financed through government funding, generated through taxation2. The healthcare system also receives contributions from both donors and the private sector3. 1.1.2 The Ministry of Health , Nutrition and Indigenous Medi cine (MoHNIM), Sri Lanka Essential Health Services Package 2019, stated: 'Sri Lanka has a well -established public health system dating back to the establishment of the first health unit in the 1920s. The well -planned network of Medical Officer of Health units provide a comprehensive, quality, and evidence- based package of services covering reproductive, maternal, new born and child care, disease surveillance, prevention and control, as well as other promotive and preventive services. Grass- root level public health workers (Public Health Midwives and Public Health Inspectors) cover the entire country at household level and provide strategic interventions as per the national guidelines. Supervising officers at the field, regional and national level provide supportive supervision and feedback to the field officers. The high standards of the integrated public healthcare delivery system has enabled Sri Lanka to achieve good health gains at a low cost.' 4 1.1.3 Roar media, a services news pl atform covering South Asia, reported in April 2018, 'Technically speaking, the system is entirely state funded, and services are provided free of charge at the point of delivery. In reality, however, a sizable chunk of the country's households - 60% in fac t - are driven to spending their own finances out of pocket for surgery, drugs, laboratory tests, specialized treatment and medical investigations.'5 1.1.4 The same source reported: 'Despite the efforts of the Sri Lankan government to provide a well - networked sy stem of healthcare for the whole island, the Ministry of Health acknowledges the existence of rural -urban and regional disparities in healthcare resources across the country. The most hard hit appear to be the population from the estate sector [plantations ], conflict areas and less prosperous districts. 'The estate sector, for instance, has always had a high MMR (Maternal Morbidity Rate) and IMR (Infant Mortality Rate) in countrywide statistics. It also fares badly in nutrition, with one third of the women of reproductive age suffering malnourishment. While community ignorance and low education levels also exacerbates the issue, plantation workers often have difficulty in accessing healthcare services due to logistical reasons - such as transport 1 MoHNIM, 'Sri Lanka Essential Health Services Package 2019', (pvii), url 2 Women and Media Collective, ( Government Expenditure on Health, p2), 2015, url 3 Women and Media Collect ive, (Government Expenditure on Health, p2), 2015, url 4 MoHNIM, 'Sri Lanka Essential Health Services P ackage 2019', (p1), url 5 Roar Media, 'Sri Lanka's Healthcare System: Everyone, Everywhere?

For instance, estimates suggest that the current doctor: population ratio in Colombo is much higher than that in Nuwara Eliya.'6 1.1.5 Reporting in September 2018 on the ch allenges faced by the healthcare system, the World Bank stated: 'Widespread access to healthcare and increasing prosperity has accelerated the demographic and epidemiological transitions as Sri Lanka's population ages. This is increasing prevalence and burden of non- communicable diseases - both chronic (diabetes, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, mental health issues etc.) and acute ailments such as injuries. 'At the same time, the country continues to face communicable diseases such as tu berculosis, dengue, and influenza. Furthermore, malnutrition among mothers and children has not adequately improved, with 16.8% of babies delivered each year born with a low birth- weight, and 17% of children under -five being too short for their age - or stunted.'7 1.1.6 The World Health Organization (WHO) Sri Lanka Annual Report 2017, Making a Difference, stated: 'Seventy -five per cent of total deaths in Sri Lanka are attributable to NCDs [ non-communicable disease ]. Cardiovascular diseases are now the leading ca use of death, with cancer coming in second. NCDs are estimated to account for nearly 20% of premature deaths in the country (i.e. deaths that occur between the ages of 30 and 70 years).'8 1.1.7 The World Health Organi zation (WHO), in its Country Cooperation Strategy 2018- 2023, noted: 'Noncommunicable disease rates are rising and the proportion of the elderly is increasing. Despite free health care, out -of-pocket spending is increasing. Mental health and road traffic accidents persist as significant health issues. Health systems that have delivered results until now need to be reviewed and reorganized to address the epidemiological and demographic challenges.' 9 1.1.8 The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), 'Country Information Report, Sri Lanka', 4 November 2019, stated: 'The public health system offers universal free health care; however, regional disparities exist in the quality of care and facilities, particularly between urban and rural areas. Health outcomes are worse in the north and east, partly because of the delay in rebuilding destroyed infrastructure and diminution of human capital during the war. Some medicines and treatments are available only from private providers. Some specialist services are available in Colombo and district -level h ospitals, including in the north and east. There are few hospitals in the war -affected interior areas of the east, and those in need of treatment must travel to district hospitals in Ampara and Trincomalee.' 10 6 Roar Media, 'Sri Lanka's Healthcare System: Everyone, Everywhere?

Med), MDS (Col), MD (Comm. Med), DFPH (UK), FRSPH (UK), Consultant Community Physician, undertook research, commissione d by the UK Home Office Country Policy and Information Team , to establish what medical treatment and healthcare is available in Sri Lanka. Their research findings, compiled using a range of open sources , dated February 2020, noted: 'The Sri Lankan health system comprises of Western allopathic and other traditional systems. Of these, the Western system is the main sector catering to the needs of the majority and furthermore information on the other systems is incomplete and oft en not available. Allopathic system provides services through both the public and the private sector. The public sector has a wide network of health care institutions countrywide and is provided free at the point of delivery. 'The health services of the Government function under a Cabinet Minister. When the 13th amendment to the constitution was incorporated in 1989 and provincial councils were established, health became a devolved subject resulting in separate Provincial Ministries of Health in each of the nine provinces of the country, in addition to the Ministry of Health at National level. 'The share of care between the public and the private sector are different for inpatient and outpatient care. The public sector providing around 95% of the inward care and around 50% of the outpatient care services free at point of delivery providing a safety net to citizens (Ministry of Health, 2016). In addition to the services provided by the Department of Health Services, Provincial Councils and the Local Auth orities, there is separate service provision for the armed forces and the police.' 11 Back to Contents Section 2 updated: 29 June 2020 2. Primary (Public) healthcare 2.1.1 Sri Lanka's Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine (MoHNIM), December 2017 report on 'Reorganising Primary Health Care in Sri Lanka', stated: 'Sri Lanka's model of primary health care (PHC), available free through a government health system with island- wide availability, forms a sound b asis for providing universal health coverage. The public sector continues to provide the bulk of inpatient care but has ceded most outpatient provision to the private sector. Even then, it continues to be the predominant source of such care for the very poor, who cannot afford private care. 'However, this system is increasingly under pressure from the change in demography and disease patterns, and the growing out -of-pocket expenditure for chronic diseases. The increasing consumer expectations for 11 Dr Jayamal De Silva and Dr Nadeeka Chandraratne , Research findings, February 2020, Annex A Page 10 of 143 better quality and improved responsiveness in health care facilities is leading more Sri Lankans to opt for the private sector.'12 (See also Private sector ) 2.1.2 The MoH NIM report described the two main sectors within the primary healthcare sys tem: 'Primary community health services - The country is divided into Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas which is managed by a MOH and public health field staff consisting of public health midwives (PHM), public health nursing sisters, and public healt h inspectors is responsible for prevention and promotion of health. They have mainly focused on maternal and child health and communicable disease prevention but are increasingly being delegated new responsibilities. 'Primary medical/curative health servic es - Through a network of Primary Medical Care Units (PMCU) formerly central dispensary/ maternity home and Divisional Hospitals (DH) [formerly peripheral units and rural and district hospitals] the former offering outpatient services and the latter both outpatient and inpatient services for diagnosis and treatment. These are manned by non- specialist medical doctors and other staff including Registered Medical Officers, nurses, dispensers, few dental surgeons and Medical Laboratory Technicians.' 13 2.1.3 The MoHNIM , Sri Lanka Essential Health Services Package 2019, stated: 'Public health care providers are classified in three sub- systems: preventive primary healthcare (PHC) providers, curative PHC providers and referral hospitals... '1. Primary Medical Care Units (PMCU), previously known as Central Dispensaries, are relatively basic facilities, devoted to outpatient care. Services provided include OPD [Outpatient Department] consultations, dressings and injections, and drug dispensing. Some PMCUs have dental services and most do not have laboratory services. PMCUs are staffed by Medical Officers (usually one or two) or Assistant Medical Officers (AMO), as well as drug dispensers. Until recently Nursing Officers were not appointed to PMCUs; however Public Health Nursing Officers (PHNO) are now being recruited to HLCs [Healthy Lifestyle Centers] at this level. Most PMCU host MOH field clinic centres, where family planning, maternal care and immunization are provided by the MOH [Medical Officer of Health] team with the support of the facility team. '2. Divisional Hospitals (DH) are, in essence, PMCUs with inpatient capacity. The number of MO [Medical Officers] is higher because they provide round- the-clock service, and usually have some nursing staff. Some may have laboratory, and even a Public Health Laboratory Technician able to perform microscopy examinations. Some special clinics are usually conducted at this level, such as NCD [Non- Communicable Diseases] or mental health clinics. The premises be utilised as field cl inics for MCH [Maternal and Child Health] and Primary Health Care in Sri Lanka', (p34), December 2017, url 13 MoHNIM, 'Reorganising Primary Health Care in Sri Lanka', (p34), December 2017, url Page 11 of 143 immunisation activities, but the conduct of the clinic comes under the purview of the MOH. '3. Outpatient departments of secondary and tertiary care institutions (other than specialised hospitals).'14 Back to Contents 2.2 Referral facilities 2.2.1 The MoHNIM, Sri Lanka Essential Health Services Package 2019, noted: 'There is a variety of referral facilities, from first -level referral hospitals to specialized units. Some facilities, such as STD [sexually transmitted disease] clinics, do not include inpatient care, but the provision of specialized services linked to specific conditions or programmes.' 15 a. Secondary care hospitals 'Base hospitals (BH) of different levels (A,B) are secondary level institutions that provide at least the four main specialties of Internal Medicine, Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, an d Surgery, including theatre and blood bank, delivered by medical consultants with the assistance of medical officers. These hospitals may provide additional services, depending on resource availability. They also have support services, such as laboratory, radiology and pharmacy, among other services. 'BH are the first level of referral for PHC institutions - both preventive and curative. However, referred patients can still chose which hospital they will attend. Majority of BH are funded and managed by provincial and district health authorities.' 16 b. Tertiary care hospitals 'Teaching Hospitals, Provincial General Hospitals and District General Hospitals provide secondary and tertiary care services, with ranges according to their location and availability of staff and equipment. All these hospitals are funded and managed centrally by the MOHNIM. These facilities are staffed by medical consultants, grade medical officers, nursing officers, professions supplementary to medicine and paramedics. 'A few, highly s pecialized tertiary hospitals - e.g., Maharagama Cancer (Apeksha) Hospital, Lady Ridgeway or Sirimavo Bandaranaike paediatric hospitals, De Soysa Hospital for women, Castle Street Hospital for women, Eye hospital, mental hospital - play a role as centres of excellence. 'In addition to the medical clinics for the attention of referred cases and managed by appointment, all secondary and tertiary hospitals run a PHC - level, walk -in OPD service. As mentioned previously, patients can choose their provider in ev ery occasion they seek care.' 17 c. Special clinics 14 MoHNIM, 'Sri Lanka Essential Health Services Package 2019', (p5-6), url 15 MoHNIM, 'Sri Lanka Essential Health Services 2019', (p7), url 16 MoHNIM, 'Sri Lanka Ess Package 2019', (p7), url 17 MoHNIM, 'Sri Lanka Essential Health Services Package 2019', (p7), url Page 12 of 143 'Some public health programmes (e.g. Tuberculosis, STD/HIV/AIDS) run their own clinics, usually at district level. Staffed by trained or specialized MO, these clinics are involved in the final diagnosis of the relevant conditions (e.g., diagnostics of tuberculosis or sexually transmitted diseases are only final when assessed at a Chest or STD clinic) and the management and follow up of the patients. Some of these programmes provide services intermittently at district or BH level, by deploying their consultants - and drugs and supplies - to these \"branch clinics\". This is the case for chest, STD and mental health clinics, for example.' 18 d. Emergency care 'The emergency care services cover both the management of emergency cases at the health facilities, and the coordination and management of massive emergencies - either man- made or natural. Sri Lanka suffers from frequent natural hazards including floods, landslides, cyclones, droughts, wind storms, coastal erosion, and others. The MoHNIM has set up an Emergency Operations Centre, in charge of coordinating information sharing as well as the transfer of resources to emergency sites. 'All hospitals, from Divisional Hospital upwards, are to provide emergency servic es of increasing level of complexity. Most secondary and tertiary hospitals, and some DH, operate Emergency Treatment Units (ETU), in many cases complemented with Preliminary Care Units (PCU) or triage units. Road injuries are the first cause of hospitaliz ation in Sri Lanka, and their management requires well -structured teams and services. There are public and private ambulance services. The \"1990\" publicly -managed ambulance (pre hospital) service is expected to cover the whole country in the future.' 19 2.2.2 See also Annex C . Back to Contents 2.3 Private sector healthcare 2.3.1 The December 2017 MoH NIM report noted: 'Sri Lanka has a large private health services sector, and the growth of the private sector has been encouraged by state policy, as it is a necessity to fill the gap created by the low level of government spending. In the context of health, the issue is not substantial private sector utilisation or the spending on health per se; these are unavoidable as long as Sri Lanka is not able to increase government spending on health to at least 5% of GDP.' 20 2.3.2 The MoHNIM, Sri Lanka Essential Health Serv ices Package 2019, stated: 'There are three main groups of providers in the private sector: '1. Hospitals, with profile and standards of quality of care comparable to those of the public system, although with large differences in terms of waiting time and other facilities. 18 MoHNIM, 'Sri Lanka Essential Health Services Package 2019', (p7), url 19 MoHNIM, 'Sri Lanka Essential 2019', (p7), url 20 MoHNIM, 'Reorgan ising Primary Health Care in Sri Lanka', (p64), December 2017, url Page 13 of 143 '2. Clinics, either solo or group practices, providing general or special ized care. Both clinics and hospitals rely heavily on MO and consultants working in the public sector and who are allowed dual practice. According to the Census of Private, Cooperative and Estate Hospitals 2013, there were at least 1,900 public sector doct ors working part -time at private facilities. Although the main regular users of the private sector are the better off population, even poor people use these services because of convenient hours, shorter waiting times, availability of diagnostic tests, and perceived quality. '3. Private institutions providing diagnostic services (e.g. lab, radiology), as well as private pharmacies.' 21 2.3.3 Dr Jayamal De Silva and Dr Nadeeka Chandraratne's, Research findings, February 2020, noted: 'The private sector provides ambulatory care, inpatient care and rehabilitative care of varying degrees of sophistication. According to the Private Health Sector review (2015) there are 424 full time and 4845 part - time medical officers. These are supplemented by government medical officer s doing private practice in their off -duty hours who provide the bulk of private primary outpatient care. Most of these private clinics are operated on a solo practitioner basis and most also dispense medicines. The private hospitals provide outpatient and inpatient services and specialist consultation services, the latter being mostly specialists in government service practicing in their off -duty hours. The bulk of the in- patient care in the private sector is under government sector specialists practicing in the private sector. In addition, there is a thriving business of private pharmacies and investigative services that cater for the wealthy and poor alike. The private sector provides access to all types of care at a cost. Most patients pay out of pocket on a fee- for-service basis. 'The private sector is claimed to have certain advantages; the main being convenience, services being available at times when patients are free to attend. In addition, the ability to select the specialist of his or her choic e, and continuity with the same doctor is also considered important reasons for seeking private sector services. Greater confidentiality in private settings as compared to public facilities was also identified to be an important factor in patient's choosing services from private sector option .' 22 Back to Contents Section 3 updated: 29 June 2020 3. Discrimination in accessing health care 3.1.1 In August 2017 the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights stated in its Concluding O bservations on the fifth periodic report of Sri Lanka that 'The Committee, while welcoming the National Plan of Action for the Social Development of the Plantation Community (2016- 2020), is concerned that the Up -country community (or so- called \"plantation Tamils\") suffer from 21 MoHNIM, 'Sri Lanka Essential Health Services Package 2019', (p8), url 22 Dr Jayamal De Silva and Dr. Nadeeka Chandraratne , Research findings, February 2020, Annex A Page 14 of 143 direct and indirect discrimination (including caste- based) with regard to most Covenant rights, including [...] lack of access to health care.'23 3.1.2 The same report stated further 'The Committee is concerned that [...] discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons is widespread, including in [...] health care...' 'that persons with disabilities face challenges in accessing health services and information ( art. 12) ...'.24 3.1.3 An article published by Roar Media in April 2018, reported: 'Everyone has the right to unrestricted access to quality healthcare, regardless of gender, sexual orientation or lifestyle. Policy -wise, Sri Lanka offers healthcare to all, but it is not uncommon to come across stories where certain people have been overlooked, shunned or had unpleasant experiences within the healthcare sphere. 'For instance, in the year 2015, a country -wide report on sexual and reproductive healthcare revealed that the sector has a tendency to side -line people who are not a part of the \" traditional \" heterosexual famil y. Single women, for example, might find it difficult to be included in national health schemes due to conservative mindsets regarding sexual activity outside marriage. At -risk populations like sex workers, and sexual minorities, also suffer from adverse experiences in the healthcare sector, mostly due to a lack of information on the problems faced by the LGBTQ community, the criminalization of homosexuality and cultural prejudice. Statistics to support this claim are far and few in between, but research co nducted by Equal Ground revealed that 29% of the individuals who identified as LGBTQ in the survey had been refused medical treatment at some point in their lives.' 25 3.1.4 The article further noted: 'When Roar Media spoke to Sriyal Nilanka, Communications Offic er of Equal Grounds Sri Lanka, he was emphatic about the existing disparity in healthcare when it came to HIV/AIDS patients and members of the LGBTQ community. '\"Take transgender persons for instance,\" he explains. \"There are a lot of unpleasant situations that arise when transgender persons are admitted to a hospital or have to go into healthcare for some reason.\" This, according to him, ranges from cases of blatant discrimination and refusal of treatment, to unwanted sexual advances and fear -mongering. Th ere was even one case he had come across where a doctor from a well- known public hospital had taken to passing around the contact numbers of gay persons and making sexual advances towards them. Traumatic and negative experiences like this only serve to make these individuals more reluctant to approach healthcare institutes, even when they are in dire need of treatment. Medical personnel are more often than not openly hostile, insensitive or ignor ant of the specific healthcare needs of sexual minorities.

In practice, however, disc rimination occurred in employment, education, and provision of state services, including public transportation. Children with disabilities attended school at a lower rate than other persons. There were regulations on accessibility, but accommodation for ac cess to buildings and public transportation for persons with disabilities was rare. Observers of the November [2019] presidential election noted process improvements were needed to ensure participation of persons with disabilities in future elections.' 27 3.1.7 See also People living with disabilities Back to Contents Section 4 updated: 29 June 2020 4. Communicable diseases 4.1.1 The World Health Organization (WHO) , 2017 Annual Report on Sri Lanka, noted: 'Proof of Sri Lanka's successes in addressing communicable diseases can be seen in the rapidly falling morbidity and mortality attributable to these diseases. The island made public health history in 2016 by receiving WHO certification for the elimi nation of malaria, lymphatic filariasis (LF), and maternal and neonatal tetanus as public health problems... 'Diseases with outbreak potential such as dengue and leptospirosis continue to pose a challenge to the country. New cases are reported every year .... While leprosy was eliminated as a public health issue in the 1990s, a small but worrying increase in the number of cases has been noted in the recent past. The presence of paediatric leprosy cases indicates active transmission, while deformities and relapses highlight late case detection and poor compliance with leprosy treatment. Around 2000 leprosy cases are reported in Sri Lanka each year, of which 10% are found in children. The biggest problem is access to treatment. To address this problem, WHO supported the creation of outreach satellite clinics that would bring key diagnostic and treatment services closer to communities, especially in rural areas. An increasing number of relapses from 2013 indicate the possibility of drug resistance .'28 4.1.2 Dr Jayamal De Si lva and Dr Nadeeka Chandraratne's, Research findings, February 2020, noted: 27 USSD, Country Report 2019 - Sri Lanka, (Section 6.) 11 March 2020, url 28 WHO, 'Who Sri Lanka Annual Report 2017, Making a Difference', (p16), url Page 16 of 143 'The Medical Officer of Health (MOH) system which forms the cornerstone of the public health infrastructure in Sri Lanka dates back to (1926) British times. The prevention of communicable diseases at the community level is identified as a main responsibility of the MOH. The Epidemiology Unit of Sri Lanka functions as the apex organization in controlling of communicable diseases in the country. It implements activities related to dis ease surveillance and immunization in the country. 'The control of communicable diseases is mainly done through the notification process. Notifiable Diseases were first gazetted, and notification of communicable diseases became a legal requirement in Sri Lanka as early as 1897. Legislation drafted in relation to major communicable diseases include measures such as restricting movements of people during epidemics, Immunization, and compulsory notification. Every registered medical practitioner professing t o treat diseases, who attends on any person having symptoms of any disease in the notifiable disease list is required to notify to the proper authorities. Any person who contravenes this regulation shall be guilty of an offence and is liable to be prosecut ed in the Magistrate Court ... 'The Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) in Sri Lanka is considered a success story of controlling communicable diseases worldwide. Sri Lanka maintains an immunization coverage of 90 - 100% to all EPI vaccines in the countr y. 'With the existing strong system of preventing and controlling communicable diseases, Sri Lanka had been successful in eliminating Lymphatic Filariasis, Leprosy, Malaria, Polio, and mother to child transmission of HIV.

TB continues to be a public health problem with nearly 8000- 10 000 new cases reported every year. The country now needs to \"bend the curve\" by reducing the number of TB cases. Priority interventions for achieving this goal will be to improve case -finding, ens ure treatment completion among TB patients and contain drug resistance. In addition, disparities in the prevalence of TB across geographical sectors and socioeconomic classes need to be addressed. 'WHO's support for the prevention and control of TB in 2017 included epidemiological analysis and programme reviews, and development of national strategic plans. WHO is also helping the country with capacity development of human resources as well as boosting diagnostic capacity. 'A national TB manual with protocols for early diagnosis, management and follow up of patients with TB was developed in 2017. 'With funding support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), WHO provided technical assistance for a TB drug resistance survey. 'WHO also supported the mid- term review of Sri Lanka's National Programme for TB Control and Chest Diseases (NPTCCD) in July 2017 to evaluate the current status of TB control in the country. At the end of the review, specific interventions to improve case detection, strengthen monitoring and evaluation systems, and enhance coordination between stakeholders were proposed to the MoH [ Ministry of Health].

Mental health 8.1 Overview of mental health care 8.1.1 The DFAT report, 4 November 2019, stated: 'The government is devoting progressively greater attention and resources to mental illness. A National Mental Health Policy, adopted in 2005 and subsequently renewed in 2015, sits alongside a National Mental Health Action Plan. The Ministry of Health operates the National Institute of Mental Health in Colombo. The only state- run hospital dedicated to treating mental illness, it has 1,200 full -time staff and 1,500 beds. The National Institute of Mental Health admits over 8,000 patients annually. It operates a National Mental Health Helpline, launched in October 2018, and offered psychosocial support to those affected by the 2019 Easter Sunday terrorist attacks.' 88 8.1.2 The same report f urther added : 'Improving access to mental health services, including at the community level, is a government priority. As part of this effort, the government has deployed cadres of mental health workers to the district level and rolled- out a Training of Trainers in Mental Health and Psycho- Social Wellbeing Programme in the Northern Province. District -level hospitals have mental health facilities and some non- governmental organisations (NGOs) (e.g. Women In Need and Women's Action Network) provide psychosocial support services, including in Tamil -populated areas. The Internatio nal Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provides psychosocial support to the families of missing persons, including peer -to-peer counselling in the north, east and south. The families of missing government soldiers receive some psychosocial support from the Ministry of Defence. The Office on Missing Persons (OMP ...), established in September 2017, will provide mental health and psychosocial care for the families of missing persons as part of its functions. 'According to local sources, there is significant, ongoing need for psychosocial support in the north and east, particularly for former combatants, the families of missing persons and those affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami (which also affected people in the south and west). Despite some improvements, mental health services, overall, are considered inadequate, particularly in former conflict areas, and there remain ongoing challenges in accessing mental health care. Mental illness is not widely discussed in Sri Lankan society and carries stigma at the c ommunity level. This, in turn, deters victims from revealing and seeking treatment for mental illness. Some families seek traditional methods to \"cure\" mental illness, including through use of local healers.' 89 8.1.3 A UK Home Office Fact -Finding Mission ( FFM) to Sri Lanka was conducted between 28 September and 5 October 2019.

Teaching hospital Jaffna at present has two consultants working there.' 101 8.1.10 The report further added: 'In most settings, the consultant psychiatrist is supported by a range of other professionals as team members. There are several categories of medical officers who are employed under the supervision of consultant psychiatrist. The diploma doctors are the doctors who have a postgraduate diploma in psychiatry and are employed in clinics and community settings. They work under the supervision of a consultant psychiatrist but are capable of delivering a skilled service as they are given a postgraduate training for one year. There are designators medical officers identified as Medical officer of mental health (MOMHs) who get a three months additional training in psychiatry following their internship. Most of these doctors work only in psychiatric settings in larger hospitals where there is a consultant for supervision. At the same time, all other medical officers in Sri Lanka can cater to psychiatric emergencies and follow up psychiatric patients who are initially diagnosed by consultants. It is enabled as they are given at least two-and-a-half months of psychiatric training during the medical undergraduate training.

People living with disabilities 9.1.1 The WHO 2017 report stated 'Sri Lanka is one of the fastest ageing countries in the world, and this demographic transition is expected to affect the disability rate. According to the Department of Census and Statistics, about 1.6 million people in Sri Lanka, i.e. almost 10% of the population, live with disabilities. [...].The Government of Sri Lanka ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in February 2016. This requires the country to \"recognize that persons with disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination of disability\". ' 119 9.1.2 In 2017 Disability organizations Joint Front wrote a submission to the UN Universal Periodic Review of Sri Lanka stating that ' Identification and early detection of disability could minimize the severity of disabilities that may occur prior to, during and after the birth. Though the Government has made interventions the medical sector lacks timely interventions, systematic referrals and follow ups. Public health education programs as well as the general health education curriculum do not incl ude basic disability identification and prevention programs are insufficient. Access to health services is a challenging task for PwD s due to lack of physical accessibility and non- availability of information non- availability of audio visual communication boards and sign language interpreters even in leading state hospitals. The persons with severe disabilities and other difficulties are expected to wait in long queues for many hours and do not get the required attention. The required facilities are not av ailable in the hospitals to get a reasonable health service for PwDs.

COVID -19 10.1.1 The Coronavirus pandemic has forced countries across the globe to take drastic measures in order to contain the spread of the virus. Sri Lanka is no exception and the government has taken measures to minimise the number of coronavirus cases. The below information is current at the time of publication but decision makers should be aware that owing to the nature of COVID -19 this information may change. Where more up to date information is required decision makers should refer to CPIT for the latest available COI. 10.1.2 According to an April 2020 online news report on The Hindu ' Some 10,000 frontline health workers in Sri Lanka are working tirelessly to arrest the spread of COVID -19 that has affected 235 people and claimed seven lives until Wednesday [15 April] . Partnering them in their response to the public health crisis is the Sri Lankan military, playing many roles from contact - tracing to running quarantine centres to distributing relief. ' 121 10.1.3 Deutsche Welle, Germany's international broadcaster, report ed in May 2020: 'Sri Lanka closely monitored the pandemic's movement right after the first case appeared in the nation, tracking any potential COVID -19 suspects. \"The first case came out in Sri Lanka in the last week of January [2020] , after which there were no cases till about mid- March. During that gap, the government ensured that the public health surveillance was activated to find any cases with respiratory illnesses. Once the cases were identified, we conducted the needed diagnostics so that we were able to rule out any suspected COVID -19 cases,\" explained Pendse from the WHO [World Health Organisation] . 'Sri Lanka had already developed a surveillance system based on the Open Source DHIS2 platform in early 2020. The system has since become the basis for t he worldwide deployment of the DHIS2 COVID -19 response package via the Health Information Systems Program (HISP) to respond to the outbreak. 'The country also released the mobile- app COVID Shield to help people keep track of their health and provide suppor t during self -isolation and quarantine. The app is now being deployed in several other countries, including the Maldives. 'In addition, the Sri Lankan government also closed down public health clinics and instead started delivering routine health checks and medication directly to the homes of patients. A hotline was created to allow non- COVID patients seek advice from healthcare workers.

Med), MDS (Col), MD (Comm. Med), DFPH (UK), FRSPH (UK) Consultant Community Physician Overview of Health Care System The Sri Lankan health system comprises of Western allopathic and other traditional systems. Of these, the Western system is the main sector catering to the needs of the majority and furthermore information on the other systems is incomplete and often not available. Allopathic system provides services through both the public and the private sector. The public sector has a wide network of health care institutions countrywide and is provided free a t the point of delivery. The health services of the Government function under a Cabinet Minister. When the 13th amendment to the constitution was incorporated in 1989 and provincial councils were established, health became a devolved subject resulting i n separate Provincial Ministries of Health in each of the nine provinces of the country, in addition to the Ministry of Health at National level. The share of care between the public and the private sector are different for inpatient and outpatient care. The public sector providing around 95% of the inward care and This project is part funded by the EU Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund. Making management of migration flows more efficient across the European Union. Page 44 of 143 around 50% of the outpatient care services free at point of delivery providing a safety net to citizens (Ministry of Health, 2016). In addition to the services provided by the Department of Health Services, Provincial Councils and the Local Authorities, there is separate service provision for the armed forces and the police. The decentralization entrusted a significant role for the nine provincial ministries of Health. The Central Ministry of Health was responsible for stewardship functions such as policy making, development of guidelines, program monitoring and technical oversight, the purchase and distribution of drugs and consumables, human resources training and deployment and the operati on of the tertiary and a few other selected hospitals. The Nine Provincial Ministries of Health, were deemed responsible for primary and secondary levels of curative care and all preventive services. Primary healthcare The Sri Lankan health system is recog nized internationally as a high impact low -cost model. This achievement was built on the foundations of a health- care system that has been free at the point of delivery since 1951; a sound primary health- care approach since the mid- 1920s (significantly in advance to the Declaration of Alma- Ata in 1978); establishment of a wide network of close- to-client primary health- care services. The demand for services was greatly influenced by universal adult franchise as early as 1931; and increasing literacy including that of women. Sri Lanka is therefore well positioned to achieve UHC, however, current demographic, epidemiological, social and economic transitions are challenges that need to be overcome to ensure universal and equitable health financing and care provi sion (de Silva, Ranasinghe, & Abeykoon, 2016). Private sector healthcare The private sector provides access to all types of care at a cost and is a growing force, due both to greater investment from private players \u2014 who recognize the prevailing gaps in the delivery of public services and the evolving demographic and epidemiological profile of Sri Lanka \u2014 as well as greater demand from the population, including the poor \u2014 for \"quicker, cleaner, and more flexible\" health care services (Govindaraj, Navaratne, Cavagnero, & Sheshadri, 2014; Salgado, 2012). The private sector provides ambulatory care inpatient care and rehabilitative care of varying degrees of sophistication. According to the Private Health Sector review (2015) there are 424 full time and 4845 part -time medical officers (Amarasinghe, 2015). These are supplemented by government medical officers doing private practice in their off -duty hours who provide the bulk of private primary outpatient care. Most of these private clinics are operated on a solo practitioner basis and most also dispense medicines. The private hospitals provide outpatient and inpatient services and specialist consultation services, the latter being mostly specialists in government service practicing in their off -duty hours. The bulk of the in- patient care in the private sector is under government sector specialists practicing in the private sector. In addition, there is a thriving business of private pharmacies and investigative services that cater for the wealthy and poor alike. The private sector provides access to all types of care at a cost. Most patients pay out of pocket on a fee-for-service basis. Page 45 of 143 The private sector is claimed to have certain advantages; the main being convenience, services being available at times when patients are free to attend. In addition, the ability to select the specialist of his or her choice, and continuity with the same doctor is also considered important reasons for seeking private sector services. Greater confidentiality in private settings as compared to public facilities was also identified to be an important factor in patient's choosing services from private sector option (Govindaraj et al., 2014). Communicable diseases In Sri Lanka written laws relating to public health date back to the early British period, and the initial legislation was mostly concerned with prevention and control of major communicable diseases. Strict implementation of these laws was responsible for a reduction in the incidence of diseases such as smallpox, plague, an d cholera. The Medical Officer of Health (MOH) system which forms the cornerstone of the public health infrastructure in Sri Lanka dates back to (1926) British times. The prevention of communicable diseases at the community level is identified as a main responsibilit y of the MOH. The Epidemiology Unit of Sri Lanka functions as the apex organization in controlling of communicable diseases in the country. It implements activities related to disease surveillance and immunization in the country. The control of communica ble diseases is mainly done through the notification process. Notifiable Diseases were first gazetted, and notification of communicable diseases became a legal requirement in Sri Lanka as early as 1897. Legislation drafted in relation to major communicabl e diseases include measures such as restricting movements of people during epidemics, Immunization, and compulsory notification. Every registered medical practitioner professing to treat diseases, who attends on any person having symptoms of any disease in the notifiable disease list is required to notify to the proper authorities. Any person who contravenes this regulation shall be guilty of an offence and is liable to be prosecuted in the Magistrate Court. The list of notifiable conditions as approved by the Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases on 5th September 2008) (Ministry of Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, 2008) in Sri Lanka is presented in table below: The Group A Notifiable disease are Internationally Notifiable diseases and should be informed to the Director General of Health Services, Deputy Director General (Public Health Services), Epidemiologist, Regional Epidemiologist, Divisional Director of Health. The Group B diseases should be notified to the Divisional Director of Health Services/Medical Officer of Health. Group A* Group B** Cholera Plague Yellow Fever Acute Poliomyelitis / Acute Flaccid Paralysis Chicken pox Dengue Fever / Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever Diphtheria Dysentery Page 46 of 143 Encephalitis Enteric Fever Food poisoning Human Rabies Meningitis Mumps Rubella / Congenital Rubella Syndrome Simple Continued Fever of over 7 days or more Tetanus Neonatal Tetanus Typhus Fever Viral Hepatitis Whooping Cough Leishmaniasis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or suspected of SARS Tuberculosis The Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) in Sri Lanka is considered a success story of controlling communicable diseases worldwide. Sri Lanka maintains an immunization coverage of 90 - 100% to all EPI vaccines in the country. With the existing strong system of preventing and controlling communicable diseases, Sri Lanka had been successful in eliminating Lymphatic Filariasis, Leprosy, Malaria, Polio, and mother to child transmission of HIV. Page 47 of 143 However, there are a few communicable diseases such as Dengue, Leptospirosis, and acute lower respiratory tract infections that are observed in the country with seasonal variations. The epidemiology unit produces a Weekly Epidemiology Record which summarises the trends and situation in respect of the week under consid eration. Pharmaceutical sector In 1987, the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) was founded. It is now the largest drug manufacturer in Sri Lanka, providing 72 drugs to the Department of Health Services (MoH) at low profit margins. Until year 2015, legal basis for and regulation of medicinal drugs were provided through the Cosmetic Devices Drugs act (CDD) (1980 act no 27). The government approved the National Medicinal Drug Policy (NMDP), in year 2007. The implementing body which is the National Medicinal Regulatory Authority was established by the National Medicinal Regulatory Act an act of parliament in 2015 (Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, 2015). The NMRA act enabled the Sri Lankan government to issue a pr icing formula for 72 essential medicines that are required to treat diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and other common diseases. The national List of Essential Medicines for Sri Lanka can be accessed from https://nmra.gov.lk/images/PDF/publication/publication_003.pdf (Ministry of Health, 2013- 2014). According to the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment for Sri Lanka 2017 readiness score for essential medicines was 83 out of 100 for the hospitals in Sri Lanka. There had been no major difference in the readiness score between public and private sector hospitals (83 and 81 out of 100 respectively). The most commonly available drugs were paracetamol (99%) and prednisolone (99%), while the least commonly available drug was allopurinol (20%). The following drugs were also available in more than 95% of health facilities: metronidazole; amoxicillin; metformin; ACE inhibitors (e.g., ramipril, such as pantoprazole or rabeprazole), salbutamol and chlorpheniramine. These drugs were available universally across different types of health facilities. The following drugs were available in less than 50% of health facilities at the national level: fluconazole, co- sucrose supplements, and erythropoietin injections. In general availability of the above- mentioned essential medicines was lower in Divisional Hospitals, compared to the secondary and tertiary health care facilities. Availability of essential medicines prescribed for chronic non- communicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease were higher than other types of medicines. (Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and Department of Census and Statistics, 2018). Medical conditions: Cancer (oncology) The most prevalent caner in females is breast cancer. And the most prevalent cancers among males are lip, oral cavity and pharynx cancers. Screening for cervical Page 48 of 143 cancer by Cervical cytology (PAP) and direction of high- risk patients for Acetic acid visualization (VIA) are conducted by the Well Woman Clinics offered by the Ministry of Health. The Breast palpation / clinical breast exam ( CBE) and referral of patients for tertiary acre breast centres for mammography are also conducted by the Well Woman Clinics. Screening for other cancers are not routinely conducted by the preventive health sector. However, opportunistic screening is conduc ted for all patients presenting to primary healthcare institutions and health promotion interventions are carried out island wide to reduce risk factors for cancer (Annual Health Bulletin, 2016). The following government hospitals are armed with specialised cancer treatment facilities which include an oncologist, an oncosurgeon, and chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment (National Cancer Control Programme). 1. Apeksha Hospital, Maharagama (National Cancer Institute) 2. Teaching Hospital - Kandy 3. Teaching Hospital - Karapitiya 4. Teaching Hospital - Jaffna 5. Teaching Hospital - Anuradhapura 6. Provincial General Hospital - Badulla 7. Teaching Hospital - Kurunegala 8. Teaching Hospital - Batticaloa 9. Provincial General Hospital - Ratnapura In addition, few leading private hospital in Colombo too offer treatment facilities for cancer. Diabetes The prevalence of diabetes among the adult population in Sri Lanka is estimated to be 7.9% with females having a higher prevalence (8.4%) than the males (7.3%) (WHO fact sheet). According to the STEPS 2015 report, only 69% of adults with self - reported high blood sugar (65.7% for males and 73.1% for females) were estimated to be taking medicines. Among those previously diagnosed as having high blood sugar, 12.3% were on insulin (13.5% for males and 11.3 % for females). Sri Lankan doctors are well equipped to deal with diabetes and its complications as they receive a good training on identifying and treating them. The government hospitals in Sri Lanka generally provide investigations such as Fasting blood sugar, urine sugar and even HBAiC (in larger hospitals only). Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests (OGTT) are carried out for all the pregnant mothers and other patients where necessary. Most larger hosptials i ncluding some base hospitals have ophthalmology clinics and consultant ophthalmologists. They screen for diabetes retinopathy and eye disease. Treatment is provided for retinopathy, which includes retinal laser therapy at the Eye Hospital Colombo. Accessib ility of treatment Recent initiation of Healthy Life Style Centres by the Non- communicable unit of the Sri Lanka ministry of health increased the accessibility of services for the patients with diabetes. These centres are staffed by a medical officer and a trained nursing Page 49 of 143 officer and supportive staff. They carry out screening and treatment for diabetes and related disease at the primary care level. (World Health Organization, 2017) Medications available for diabetes The government hospitals of Sri Lanka dispense most of the essential medications free of charge to the patients who attend the clinics. Occasionally, the medicines run out and the poor patients are affected by it. (Sunday Times, no date) Metformin and sulphonylureas are readily available at primary healt h care institutions while insulin is available only at selected primary carer institutions. HbAIC levels for diabetes control, examination of fundus and foot for complications of diabetes are carried out at secondary and tertiary care institutions. Howeve r, insulin is reported to be somewhat cheaper in the Private market in Sri Lanka compared to countries such as the Germany. However, it could still be very costly compared to the wages a the general public receive. (Health Action International, 2017) Most of the commonly used drugs are available in Sri Lanka. Most of the base hospitals would have this set of medicines available from their pharmacies. T he Sri Lanka essential Medicines List states that the many of those medications following have to be available in the country. Soluble insulin, biphasic isophane insulin, metformin, glibenclamide, tolbutamide, and gliclazide are generally available from government hospitals. (Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka, 2014) The Sri Lanka diabetes Federation web site informs that there are newer medications available for the treatment of diabetes in Sri Lanka. Most of these medicines are available from the private sector hospital s and pharmacies. The following Lanka Diabetes Foundation, 2019) There is a variety of insulins available in the private sector. These include soluble insulin, isophane insulin, Mixed insulin (mustard), and long acting insulins. (Sri Lanka Diabetes Foundation, 2019) Kidney diseases and renal failure Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major burden on the healthcare system of Sri Lanka. Diabetes, hypertension, and the various forms of glomerulonephritis are well - recog nized etiologies. With increasing prevalence of non- communicable diseases, in particular diabetes and hypertension, the burden of CKD is expected to rise. Since the 1990s, a new CKD, where no obvious cause is identifiable, has been described in Sri Lanka. This new condition has resulted in a rise in the incidence of CKD in rural Sri Lanka, and has been aptly named chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu). Alternate suggested names for this condition include chronic agricultural nephropathy (CAN) and CKD of multifactorial origin (CKD -mfo) (Rajapaksha et al, 2016) CKDu appears to disproportionally affect poor, rural, male farmers in hot climates. Despite more than 20 years of study in Sri Lanka and globally, the problem of CKDu is not well understood. The Government of Sri Lanka accords a very high priority to addressing CKDu. A Presidential Task Force on CKDu was set up in 2014 to provide oversight and coordinate the efforts of various sectors, agencies and ministries towards the prevention and treat ment of CKDu. Page 50 of 143 The World Health Organization (WHO) report on \"Kidney Disease of Uncertain Aetiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka\" says that the age standardized prevalence of CKDu among females in the age group of 15 to 70 years of age is 16.9% and that of males in the same age category is 12.9% (WHO, 2016). The Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka has established surveillance on chronic kidney disease since October 2013. The following 49 hospitals are declared as sentinel sites for surveillance ( Epidemiology Unit,2017). 1. TH 51 of 143 25. DH Hettipola, Wilgamuwa According to the Service availability and Readiness Assessment Survey (2017) of Sri Lanka, 52% of health institutions offered services for CKD diagnosis. This service is offered by 97% of tertiary care hospitals, 92% of secondary care hospitals, 41% of Divisional Hospitals, and 57% of Private Hospitals. Management and/or long -term follow up of CKD patients were available in 49% of health institutions and monitoring of renal functions in 49% of health institutions at the national level. The service availability for CKD management and/or long -term patient follow up by facility type was almost similar to the CKD diagnostic services. Haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis services were available predominantly in tertiary care hospitals (59% and 66% respectively). Ha emodialysis and peritoneal dialysis were available in few Private Hospitals too (18% and 12% respectively). The NHSL, some of the Teaching Hospitals (56%) and few Private Hospitals (7%) performed renal transplantations. Hepatitis Due to high prevalence of alcohol use, liver diseases are common in Sri Lanka. Alcoholic liver diseases and liver diseases due to fatty liver are the two commonest forms seen in Sri Lanka. Hepatitis B and C prevalence rates are low. Hepatitis A, which is spread by feco- oral route i s moderately prevalent. (Wijewantha, 2017) When it comes to hepatitis B, Sri Lanka belongs to low endemic countries. Sri Lanka practices universal precautions and excellent injection practices. Hepatitis C is more prevalent compared to Hep B. (Epidemiology Unit, 2017) Even among prison inmates, the prevalence rat es for Hepatitis were found to be low. (Niriella et al., 2014) Hepatitis B vaccine is available in Sri Lanka since 2003. (Ministry of Health, 2019) Liver transplants The first successful liver transplant in Sri Lanka was carried out on 27 th June 2010, at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (Wijeratne et al, 2011). Currently , two government hospitals, the National Hospital of Sri Lanka and the North Colombo Teaching Hospital performs liver transplants free of charge. The North Colombo Teaching Hospital is armed with a Hepato- Pancreatico- Biliary and Liver unit which was formal ly established in February 2012. The liver transplants carried out in Sri Lanka is predominantly cadaveric transplants, but the units had been successful in few live donor transplants as well (University of Kelaniya, 2019). HIV/AIDs Sri Lanka continues to be a low prevalence country for HIV although the numbers of HIV positive cases have been slowly rising over the years. The estimated numbers of adults living with HIV as of 2018 is 3500 and new infections were less than 1000. Total number of People Living with HIV diagnosed and alive was 2709 as at the end of 2018 (cumulative reported number minus cumulative reported deaths) (National STD/AIDS Control Programme, 2019). Overall prevalence among key populations (KPs) which include female sex workers (FSW), males having sex with males (MSM), beach boys (BBs), people who use drugs (PWUD) and people who inject drugs (PWID) is <1%. But among the MSM, the prevalence is at 1.5%. Moreover, among the reported cases, the numbers of Page 52 of 143 MSM have al so slowly been rising with close to half of those positive reporting male to male sex. The other population group where HIV has been consistently documented are returnee migrant workers and where the number of cases detected has been rising over the years. In all other population groups, only a few cases have been detected. The National STD/AIDS Control Programme (NSACP) of the Ministry of Health is the main government organization which coordinate the national response to sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka. It collaborates with many national and international organizations such as the Global Fund to Fight Against AIDS, TB and Malaria (GFATM) and UN organizations while providing leadership and technical support to 33 island wide STD clinics and 21 ART centers. It provides STI and HIV laboratory services through a comprehensive laboratory network. HIV diagnosis is not a notifiable condition in Sri Lanka. However, because of the centralised HIV confirmatory system with Western Blot , all confirmed HIV seropositive persons are reported, and basic epidemiological information is collected by NSACP. The \"treat all\" policy of WHO was adopted in 2016 and the government provides free antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all people living with H IV along with diagnosis and management of opportunistic infections (OIs). According to WHO guidelines, the preferred first -line ART regimen is TDF+FTC+EFV fixed dose combination. In 2018, four drugs were included in the National formulary: dolutegravir, at azanavir/ritonavir, lamivudine/abacavir combination which are adult ARV formulations and dispersible zidovudine/ lamivudine for paediatric use. The WHO has declared that Sri Lanka has eliminated Mother to Child Transmission of HIV in 2018 and the country has declared a goal of Ending AIDS by 2025 and has developed a road map to achieve this goal. Mental Health System in Sri Lanka History Since ancient times, psychiatric treatments were carried out by the indigenous physicians who followed a system of medi cine similar to Ayurveda. (Minas et al., no date) There were other traditional healing systems based on exorcism and folk religion. These systems exist t oday as well even though the popularity has declined. Since the British Colonial era, there were three asylums which catered to the whole of the population of Sri Lanka. (Mendis, 2018) Following Tsunami in 2004, there was a rapid expansion of psychiatric services with opening of in- patient units in most district hospitals and a shifting of emphasis to community care. (Minas, Mendis and Hall, 2017) Currently Sri Lanka has close to 100 psychiatrists working all over the country. There are 67 consultant psychiatrists working in the Ministry of health (Annual Health Bulletin of Sri Lanka, 2016) and the rest work for the University psychiatry units attached to the teaching hospitals in different provinces. Mental Diseases Ordinance Sri Lanka has an archaic yet functional mental health law identified as the Mental Diseases Ordinance 1873. This was amended in 1956. (Government of Sri Lanka, 2019) The ordinance allows involuntary admissions. This covers admissions to the forensic psychiatric services as well. However, the ordinance has provisions to have Page 53 of 143 a patient admitted against his/ her will only to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH - Angoda), which is the former mental hospital/ asylum at Angoda. (Psychiatry and 2011, no date) Theo retically, patients cannot have involuntary admissions to any other hospital. In practice however, some patients are kept in General hospitals using the common law. Most of the time, the treating psychiatrist discusses with the family in order to help them in such situations and a collaborative decision is taken to keep the patient in such a setting. Consent by proxy is not considered valid in Sri Lanka. All involuntary admissions to NIMH need to be notified to the Director of the institute. NIMH has sever al acute and intermediate care facilities apart from the specialised services it houses. The specialised services include the high secure forensic unit, mother -baby unit, geriatric unit and a special ward for the mentally retarded. NIMH runs an out -patient clinic at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Colombo. Infra-structure: Mental Health There is a well distributes network of mental health services in the country which are mostly based on larger government hospitals. Many large hospitals have in- ward facilities for treatment. (Minas et al., 2017 ) The following hospitals have in ward facilities: 1. Teaching hospital s 2. Provincial general hospitals 3. District general hospitals 4. District hospitals type A (previously known as Base Hospitals) There are a total of 2960 beds for the psychiatric patients in hospitals distributed in the country. Most beds are found in the NIMH i n Colombo. (Annual Health Bullet in of Sri Lanka 2016) Yet, there are in- patient units found in less resourceful places such as Jaffna. However, there are no in- patient settings (wards) in Kilinochchi, Mulaithiu, Puttalam and Moneragala districts at the time of writing. (Annual Health Bulletin 2016) These four District General Hospitals are staffed by a consultant psychiatrist and out -patient and liaison services are available. The mental health directorate and the Sri Lanka college of psychiatrists collaborate in developing services in these less resourceful places. What are the services available in a typical psychiatry in- ward facility in Sri Lanka? All in -patient services are supervised by a visiting consultant psychiatrist. In some settings such as teaching hospitals where there ar e university units, the units are staffed by several consultant psychiatrists. For example, Colombo south teaching hospital and National hospital of Sri Lanka has eight consultants each in the university psychiatry unit. But the distribution varies. Teachi ng hospital Jaffna at present has two consultants working there. Variety of services in Mental Health In patients As mentioned earlier, most larger hospitals have in- ward treatment facilities. Almost all teaching and provincial general hospitals have wards for both male and female Page 54 of 143 patients. Elelctro -convulsive therapy (ECT) is also available in these types of larger hospitals. out patients All teaching hospitals, provincial and district general hospitals have out -patient treatment facilities. There are several types of clinics available including general adults, child and adolescent, geriatric, and substance abuse tr eatment clinics. Some university psychiatry units have separate psychotherapy and clozapine clinics. All psychiatry clinics are open for all the citizens in the country. Likewise, any patient could get admitted to any unit depending on the requirement. The waiting time for a first visit clinic might have a range of one day to two weeks. All emergencies are attended usually within 24 hours. Patients can access any specialized clinic depending on the availability of such in the nearest hospital. Community c linics All the consultants in smaller hospitals run and supervise community psychiatry clinics. The purpose of a community clinic is to improve accessibility of services and enhance compliance as a result. Domiciliary visits are carried out hand in hand wi th community clinics and patients are given depot anti -psychotic medications at their own places. The home visits are usually done by a medical officer and a community psychiatric nurse. Human Resources in psychiatry: In most settings, the consultant psy chiatrist is supported by a range of other professionals as team members. There are several categories of medical officers who are employed under the supervision of consultant psychiatrist. The diploma doctors are the doctors who have a postgraduate diplom a in psychiatry and are employed in clinics and community settings. They work under the supervision of a consultant psychiatrist but are capable of delivering a skilled service as they are given a postgraduate training for one year. There are designators m edical officers identified as Medical officer of mental health (MOMHs) who get a three months additional training in psychiatry following their internship. Most of these doctors work only in psychiatric settings in larger hospitals where there is a consult ant for supervision. At the same time, all other medical officers in Sri Lanka can cater to psychiatric emergencies and follow up psychiatric patients who are initially diagnosed by consultants. It is enabled as they are given at least two- and-a-half month s of psychiatric training during the medical undergraduate training. Apart from the medical staff, all the psychiatric clinics are staffed by a Community Psychiatric Nurse or a general nurse. Some are identified as community mental health teams which comprise of a doctor, community psychiatric nurse and a social worker. (Gambheera H, 2011) Psychiatric social workers and occupational therapists are available in all major hospital settings. Some provinces such as the Northern province have a community support worker in the team. There are volunteers at times in some of the psychiatric units. At present psychologists are available only in few university psychiatry units. The government hospital units which are under the Ministry of Health do not staff psychologists yet. Psychologists with postgraduate clinical psyc hology training and health promotion officers are planned to be recruited to the system in the near future. Page 55 of 143 Mental Health Conditions that are commonly seen and treated in Sri Lanka The annual report of the National Institute of M ental Health 2014 records successfully treated patients during the previous year as follows. (Health, 2014) FIGURE 1 DESCRIPTION OF DISCHARGED PATIENTS FROM THE NIMH: 2014 Almost all categoires mentioned in the IDC -10 or DSM -V are found in Sri Lanka. As an illustration, the following table is presented which is derived from the Annual Report of the NIMH in 2014. The NIMH being a tertiary care referral centre and a place where most severe patients are referred would bias the picture. This is the only place where patients are admitted against their will under the Mental Diseases Ordinance. The neurotic and stress related disorders are mostly managed as out patients and present to either community clinics, outpatient departments or to general hospitals. a. Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders Schizophrenia is a commonly diagnosed disorder in most psychiatry clinics and hospitals. All the hospitals where there is a consultant psychiatrist will treat all forms of psychotic illness which include schizophrenia, persistent delusional disorder, and acute psychotic episodes. Medical treatment is available all over the country. Most first generation and second- generation antipsychotic medications including clozapine are available in most government hospitals and are provide free of charge. In the NIMH r eport these conditions are mentioned as delusional disorders. Page 56 of 143 b. Mood disorders: depressive disorders and bipolar disorder Mood disorders are commonly seen in Sri Lanka mental health settings. T he patients either present with depressive or manic episodes. Most patients are managed as out-patients at the government hospital clinics. Most commonly used antipsychotic medications such as olanzapine, quetiapine and haloperidol are readily available. Quetiapine might not be available in smaller government hospitals . As mood stabilizers, quetiapine, sodium valproate, carbamazepine, lamotrigiene and lithium carbonate are prescribed. Monitoring facilities for lithium levels and kidney and thyroid function tests are available in most private settings. They are available in larger government hospitals such as teaching hospitals and provincial general hospitals free of charge. Availabiltiy of lamotrigiene and quetiapine varies in the government hospital clinics. For the treatment of depression, cognitive behavioural therapy is available from teaching hospitals and some private sector hospitals as well as private clinics run by the psychologists. Specialized psychotherapies are generally not available from smaller government hospitals such as base hospitals or community cli nics. Commonly used medications for depression are available all over the country. c. Substance abuse: Treatment for substance use disorders are provided by the consultant psychiatrists as both in- patients as well as out -patients. Detoxification of alcohol i s usually carried out either in a medical setting or psychiatric setting. Heroin detoxification is carried out using symptomatic treatment. There are four rehabilitation centres run by the National D angerous Drugs Control Board and provide short term rehabilitation based on evidence- based approaches free of charge. There are numerous private sector rehabilitation programmes available for a fee. Medications such as disulfiram, acamprosate and naltrexone for relapse prevention are only available from the pri vate sector. d. Stress related disorders Post-traumatic stress disorder and other stress related conditions are found to a lesser extent compared to other settings. This has been attributed to various factors including the variability of presentation due to culture specific factors. Most psychiatry clinics and consultant psychiatrists manage these conditions as out - patients. Medications used for treatment of PTSD such as fluoxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine and other medications which include commonly used ant ipsychotics for augmentation (risperidone) and mood stabilizers are available from most larger government hospitals (see below the list of essential medications) Newer medications such as duloxetine and bupropione are registered and available in Sri Lanka from private sector pharmacies. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is available from teaching hospitals clinics and private sector psychologists. EMDR is not routinely available from any of the government sector hospitals. However, there is an EMDR society in Sri Lanka which trains therapists and accreditate them. Their service is available through trained therapist networks in the private sector. ( EMDR Sri Lanka Associaton, 2019) e. Anxiety spectrum disorders Treatment for anxiety spectrum disorders are available in the form of medications and psychotherapy. Most antidepressants are available as mentioned below. New medications such as buspirone are available only from the private sector. Likewise, Page 57 of 143 CBT is available from teaching hospitals in the government sector hospitals and many private sector hospitals. Psychiatric Drugs and their availability Common medications which are used in psychiatry are dispensed from all the hospitals which run clinics. Some of the newer or restricted medications may not be available in smaller hospital clinics which are staffed by only a diploma doctor or an MOMH. For example, sertraline, venlafaxine, quetiapine and donepezil as well as methylphenidate would be available in larger hospitals up from District hospital type A. There are three types of depot medications and clozapine are available. Methylphenidate is also availabl e for the treatment of ADHD. Commonly available medications under the essential medicines list methylphenidate hydrochloride. ( Ministry of Health Sri Lanka , 2014) The private sector pharmacies have a wider range of medications which these medications are available from the government hospitals from time to time depending on the medical supplies department dispensing process. Drug registration information could be found in the National Medicinal Regulation Authority (NMRA) website. The current price of a generic drug can be obtained by contacting \"Rajay Osu Sala\", the state pharmaceutical company retail outlets. (STATE PHARMACEUTICALS CORPORATION PRICE LIST, 2019) Generic medicines are available for an affordable price for most patients. (Senarathna, Mannapperuma and Fernandopulle, 2011) Can a patient get down a drug which is not registered in Sri Lanka? Any person can request a special personal licence to get down a medication which is prescribed by a qualified doctor in Sri Lanka for personal use. This has to be done by making a special application to the National Medicinal Regulatory Auth ority (NMRA) (National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act, No. 5 of 2015) . Human resources and their distribution, university psychiatry units In addition to what was mentioned earlier, most university psychiatry units in the country provide a range of services to the general public free of charge. These include in- patient services and out -patient clinics . There are psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists and community psychiatry nurses who are attached to these units and provide a multidisciplinary care. The Universities of Colombo, Peradeniya, Jayewardenepura, Ragama, and Ruhuna have well equipped well - staffed units. They have 5 to 8 psychiatrists working for them at a given time. At present, university of Jaffna and the Eastern university do not have permanent psychiatrist, even though the two teaching hospitals attached have consultants working for them. Rajarata university has one consultant psychiatrist and a senior registrar in psychiatry. Services for the minority - Page 58 of 143 Most of the Mental Health services in Sri Lanka are staffed by persons who speak minority languages (Tamil and English). In special circumstances, where there are language issues, the staff nurses or other staff members act as translators. When a deaf person is seen for assessment, a sign language interpreter could be arranged as a translator. They are arranged through th e social services department of Sri lank. In areas where the majority speak either Tamil or Sinhala, almost all the staff are well versant with the respective language. All doctors in Sri Lanka can speak in English. Other professionals: GPs, DMOs, physicians, The number of persons per a medical doctor in Sri Lanka is 1,118. (Annual Health Bulletin of Sri Lanka 2016) The current medical workforce has a reasonable knowledge in psychiatry and mental health and most are capable of prescribing commo nly used psychiatric medications. All MBBS qualified doctors can prescribe antidepressants, antipsychotics and other psychoactive medications. Most GPs will manage depression and anxiety themselves. This was made possible because of the introduction of psy chiatry in the medical curricula in Sri Lanka. (Sciences, 2018) Private sector professionals: including psychologists and counsellors The private sector in large cities have psychologists working for almost all the large private hospitals in Sri Lanka. The \"echanneling\" website, which is the portal for reservation of a consultation by a specialist in Sri Lanka listed 28 clinical psychologists who are available in numerous private sector hospitals and clinics in the country. (channelling.com, 2019 b) These services are especiall y available in main cities such as Colombo, Kandy and Galle. (channelling.com, 2019) Counselors are available in many settings. As there is no single authorit y in Sri Lanka for accreditation of counsellors, they come from different backgrounds and levels of expertise. The state sector has social workers doing counselling in the government hospitals. There are other counsellors available in almost all the divisional secretariat offices which are the smallest administrative structures in the country. These divisional secretariat offices have child protection, probation and other officers who act as agents for respective government agencies and carry out counselling as well. Mithuru Piyasa Centres The state health system in Sri Lanka initiated the Mithrur Piyasa program to cater for the domestic violence survivors. These centres host trained medical officers and nursing officers to help DV survivors with counselling, treatment and advise. Patients are referred to the nearest psychiatry service for further management when needed. We have cited one such example operating at the largest hospital for women in Sri Lanka (Castle Street Hospital for Women, 2019) Other services: School counsellors Sri Lanka has a network of school counsellors working in most larger schools. They are teachers specially trained for carrying out counselling. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) - Page 59 of 143 A range of Non- governmental organizations (NGOs) are working for delivery of mental health services in Sri Lanka. Some provides counselling an d helplines. There are several helplines for people who feel suicidal, with the assumption that the attempts could be prevented. (Sumithrayo - Sumithrayo Org, 2019) (Sri Lanka Suicide Hotlines - Suicide.org , 2019) Some NGOs provide residential care for the chronic patients who require long term rehabilitation. Sahanaya is such an organization which runs a day care centre in Colombo and a residential care facility at Gorakana. (National Council for Mental Health - Gorakana Residential Facility, 2019) Help lines: Sri Lanka has several counselling helplines. The NIMH runs a 24- hour general mental health helpline which is operated by trained nurses. They direct patients to the respective local centres as appropriate after the initial counselling. Their telephone number is 1926. (NIMH introduces mental health helpline '1926, 2019) Sumithrayo is an organization which has been having a suicide prevention helpline for years. Apart fro m the telephone counselling, they operate as a drop in centre for counselling. (Sumith rayo - Sumithrayo Org, no date) The National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) has a helpline for quitting tobacco and alcohol use. Its telephone number is 1948 (National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol, no date) There are several non- governmental sector organizations which work in the field of mental health promotion and prevention of alcohol and drugs. (ADIC Sri Lanka - Alcohol and Drug Informa tion Centre, 2019) Neurological conditions Neurological conditions are common in the medical practice in Sri Lanka. The neurologists are trained in the management of following conditions: Headaches, Infections, Cerebrovascular disease Disorders of consc iousness Epilepsy, Movement disorders, Demyelination and vasculitis, Dementia, Disorders of cranial nerves, Disorders of the peripheral nervous system Disorders of the spine and spinal cord Autonomic nervous system Neuro- ophthalmology, Neuroimmunology, Sleep disorders, Pain, Head injury. (Postgraduate Institute of Medicine, 2014). Currently there are more than 30 neurologists and 15 neurosurgeons in the government free health care system all over the country. Most neurosurgeons are available only at the major hospitals such as teaching and provincial general hospitals. (Annual Health Bulletin of Sri Lanka 2016). The Sri Association of Neurlogists lists more than 50 members in their list and the numbers are rising. (Association of Sri Lankan Neurologists, 20 17) CT and MRI brain scanning are available in Sri Lanka. All provincial general hospitals host CT scanners. MRIs are available at the NHSL. Contrast media for the use of patients undergoing neuroimaging are available free of charge for these patients. (S ri Lanka National List of Essential Medicines, 2014) The following medications are available from the neurology clinics which are operative at the government hospital diazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, phenytoin, lamotrigiene. For the treatment of migraine, sumatriptan and propranolol are available in addition to non- steroidal antiinflamatory drugs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac sodium as well as aspirin. Morphine and tramadol are avail able for the treatment of pain in neurology and cancer care. (Sri Lanka National List of Essential Medicines, 2014). Most newer drugs are available for purchasing from the private sector. They include levetiracetam, gabapentine and pregabaline. Cardio Vas cular Disease (CVD) The broad disease category CVD comprises atherosclerosis related ischemic heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Cardiovascular disease accounts for 34% of the total deaths on Sri Lanka and Ischemic heart disease and st roke are the two main causes of death respectively (WHO, 2018). According to STEPS survey 2015, which quantifies the risk factors for CVD, 45.7% men and 5.3% women currently used some form of tobacco product (either smoked or smokeless) while 35.3% of males and 4.1% of females were daily tobacco users. One third (34.8%) of the males were current alcohol users (drank in the past 30 days), while 40.2% were lifetime abstainers. A great majority (96.5%) of females were lifetime abstainers. 22.5% of the males and 38.4% of the females did not meet the WHO recommendation of physical activity (Ministry of Health, 2015). Healthy Life Style Centres had been established by the Ministry of Health with the objective to screen and identify behavioural and intermediate ris k factors for CVD and other non- communicable diseases among adults between the age of 40 to 65 years (Annual Health Bulletin of Sri Lanka 2016). Cardiologists are available in most of the large. Hospitals in Sri Lanka. There are 59 cardiologists working in the government health system. (Annual Health Bulletin of Sri Lanka 2016) Where there are no cardiologists, the consultant physicians would look after these patients. Most large hospitals would have echocardiogram facilities. Major provincial hospitals have intervention cardiological services such as stenting. Emergency units in base hospitals are equipped in managing acute cardiac conditions including acute myocardial infarctions. The following medications are available and considered essential cardiac medications in Sri Lanka. Heparin, warfarin, and enoxaparin are available from base hospitals where there are consultant physicians avaible for managing patients with acute and chronic cardiac conditions. diltiazem, adenosine. (Sri Lanka, 2014) Specialized cardiac units are established in the two national hospitals and the main teaching hospitals. These units offer a range of cardiac care facilities which include Intensive Coronary care unit facility with Coronary Care Units and Intermediate coronary care units and inward facilities with specialised paediatric wards. The units also offers invasive and non- invasive cardiac investigation facilities such as cardiac catheterization and angiography laboratory with biplane digital subtraction angioplasty, - ess echocardiography, Treadmill stress testing, Holter monitoring, Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, Tilt table testing, Pacemaker facility with a screening unit and facilities for temporary, single and dual chamber pacemakers (Institute of Cardiology, 2018). Page 61 of 143 The following medicines which are used in heart failure are considered essential and are available in Sri Lanka: carvelidilol, digoxine, enalapril, furosemide, HCT, spironolactone, dopamine and noradrenaline. (Sri Lanka, 2014) Hypertension is a major health problem in Sri Lanka. Most General Practitioners and primary heatlh care clinics manage thousands of hypertensive patients. HLCs screen them for raised blood pressure and complications resulting from that. Most commonly used medications are available in Sri Lanka. Notably the following drugs are available: atenolol, enalapril, hydralazine, HCT, labetalol, methyldopa and nifedipine. There are newer medications available in the private sector for a reasonably higher price. Cardiac bypass grafts and stenting are provided in the public health system in Sri Lanka. C urrenty there are close to 20 thoracic surgeons working in major hospitals in Sri Lanka. (Annual Health Bulletin of Sri Lanka 2016) There are few who work for the private sector completely and occasionally visiting surgens from India carry out cardiac surgeries in major private hospit als in Sri Lanka. There are approximately 500 cardiac surgeries carried out in the government sector each month. The stents are given free of charge for these surgeries. (Daily News, 2019) Paediatrics Sri Lanka proudly host s the largest children's hospital in the world in its capital city. (Lady Ridgeway Hospital, 2019). According to the Annual Health Bulletin 2016, there are 172 paediatricians working in the government hospitals around the country. This number has to be supplemented with the paediatricians who are working for the university paediatric units and the ones who does full time private practice. (Annual Health Bulletin of Sri Lanka, 2016) Paediatricians in Sri Lanka are well trained to handle all the paediatric conditions that are common in our setting. The extensive training, they receive include mandatory overseas training in a country such as the UK. They receive a training in managing many conditions which include the following: behavioural problems, cardiology , dermatology, diabetes and hepatology, genetics and dysmorphology, haematology and oncology. neurology and neurodisability nutrition, ophthalmology, pharmacology, poisoning and accidents, respiratory medicine and ENT, safe guarding, transfusion medicine, sexually transmitted diseases. (Postgraduate Institute of Medicine, 2014) The Lady Ridgeway hospi tal provides the full spectrum of paediatric services including cardiology, oncology, plastic surgery and many more. (Lady Ridgeway Hospital, 2019). Peradeniya hosts a similar specialized hospital which was opened recently and increases the accessibility o f the general public to the paediatric care. (Sirimavo Bandaranayake specialized children hospital - Peradeniya, 2019) Child ENT, audiology and speech therapy The Lady Ridgeway Hospital has facilities and consultants for all the ENT and speech therapy needs. Audiology facilities are sometimes tapped through Rathmalana Audiology Centre which provides facilities on a not for profit basis. (LRH, 2019), (Home | Ratmalana Audiology Centre, 2019) Page 62 of 143 Speech therapy is available from the LRH and other major hospitals such as the Colombo South Teaching Hospital and North Colombo Teaching Hospital free of charge. Altogether there are 70 speech therapists available in the government sector hospitals providing treatment for both children and adults.

They are specially trained in dealing with deafness which include management of a deaf child and .forensic audiology. Advanced ENT investigations are part of the training of the ENT surgeon. The investigations include radiological tests. Facial nerve function tests, endoscopic techniques, audiological investigations, tests of vestibular functions. (PGIM, 2016) Most investigations such as CT scans, endoscopies and other related tests are available from both government and private sector hospitals. f. Medicines available for treatment of ENT conditions The following are used in disease conditions in the ear: Betamethazone+ neomycine the nose: Xylometazoine, betamethasone, silver nitrate, beclomethasone.

(Ministry of Health Sri Lanka, 2014) Paediatric care for the children with TB All children are immunized for TB on the first day of their life. Unless there is a serious contra- indication, this injection is given universally. Then the children who develop features suggestive of TB are evaluated by the paediatricians. There were 248 cases of TB among children who are less than 14 years detected as new cases in the year of 2017. (N ational Programme for Tuberculosis Control and Chest Diseases, Ministry of Health, 2017). All TB patients get full diagnostic services and treatment with multi -drug regimes in order to prevent resistance. All TB cases are registered in the National Program me and followed up accordingly till they finish the course of treatment. (National Programme for Tuberculosis Control and Chest Diseases, Ministry of Health, 2017). Tuberculin skin test, chest X -rays and bacteriological confirmation are available for all patients who are suspected of having TB through the chest clinics at major hospitals throughout the country. The guideline specifies the procedure to follow when suspected case of drug resistant tuberculosis is managed. And the risk of TB in HIV positive i ndividuals is also evaluated separately. All HIV exposed infants are given preventive treatments. The following medications are available for the treatment of TB in both adults and children from the chest clinics throughout the country: ethambutol, isoniazid, ethionamide and levofloxacin. (Sri Lanka, 2014) In fact, there is a national guideline issued by the national TB control programme in Sri Lanka which gives extensive details and guidance on investigations and Page 63 of 143 management of TB and related conditions among children. (National Programme for Tuberculosis Control and Chest Diseases, Ministry of Health, 2018) Support and care for the children with disabilities Maternal and child health services in Sri Lanka is at a relative high level. The maternal mortality rate is lowest in the region and was approximately 33/ 100,000 in 2016. The obstetric and neonatal care is of high standard. (Annual Health Bul letin of Sri Lanka 2016) The Lady Ridgeway Hospital in Colombo has facilities, staff and equipment for providing occupational therapy, speech therapy and physiotherapy for disabled children. Similar services are available from the Sirimao Bandaranaike Chil dren's Hospital Peradeniya. (LRH, 2019), (Sirimavo hospital - Peradeniya, 2019) University of Kelaniya conducts postgraduate programs in disability studies and prepare professionals for working in this field. (Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, 2019) There are various non- governmental organizations providing services for children with disabilities. They range from day care services to full treatment programs with speech therapy, occupational therapy and rehabilitation. Many are charities operating in v arious parts of the country. (MJF Charitable Foundation, 2019), (CPLF, 2019),(CRC | Home, 2019). However, the opportunities for special education in Sri Lanka is limited. (Muttiah, Drager and O'Connor, 2016) And Most of these are provided by non -governmen tal organizations. Recently, the Health Minister has spoken at the World Health Organization summit and stated that Sri Lanka is geared to provide rehabilitation in multiple aspects. This includes physical as well as psychological rehabilitation of the needy persons in the society. (Daily News, 2017) Table below shows the number of available health professionals who are involved in providing rehabilitation services. This excludes the persons who work fulltime in the private sector.

Speciali zed Rehabilitation Facilities The Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Hospital at Ragama caters specifically to the needs of disabled persons. It has a special unit addressing the needs of the children. This is a fully equipped rehabilitation hospital which is run by consultants in the relevant fields. The hospital provides services for a broad range of conditions. They are arthritis, connective tissue disorders, stroke, spinal injury, childhood muscular skeletal disorders, rehabilitation of amputees, health education and counselling, and vocational rehabilitation. It provides wheel chair and special seating services and laboratory services as well. (Rheumatology and Rehabilitation Hospital - Ragama, 2019) Some private sector specialized clinics have come up during the recent past. They provide physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy services. The services could be costly and are on par with or above the consultation fees of consultant medical specialists in the country. (Oral Aural Centre, 2019), (Ratmalana Audiology Centre, 2019), (Lanka Doctor, 2019), (Physiotherapy Sri Lanka | Revival Physical Medicine Centre Colombo Sri Lanka , 2019). Information on rehabilitation services provided by the government hospitals could be obtained by calling the government information center (GIC) . For example, when we accessed the GIC website in order to find such information, it listed the rheumatology and rehabilitation service available at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children in Colombo. (GIC, 2019) Eye c onditions and diseases There are four major eye conditions which are common in Sri Lanka. They are cataract, glaucoma, refractive errors and conjunctivitis. (Ministry of Health, 2019a) Early childhood nutrition programmes in Sri Lanka provide high dose vi tamin A for all the children free of charge for prevention of blindness related to vitamin deficiencies. 12 Mannar 2 - - 13 Vavuniya 6 1 - 14 Mallaitiv 3 - - 15 Batticaloa 11 - 3 16 Ampara 8 1 2 17 Trincomalee 8 1 1 18 Kalmunai 8 2 - 19 Kurunegala 22 3 3 20 Puttalam 7 1 1 21 Anuradhapura 19 2 3 22 Polonnaruwa 11 1 2 23 Badulla 19 3 3 24 Moneragala 0 1 - 25 Ratnapura 13 2 3 26 Kegalle 11 1 1 27 Sri Lanka (total) 500 70 111 Page 65 of 143 The National Eye Hospital provides the full spectrum of modern eye care free of charge for any citizen in Sri Lanka.

(Ministry of Health, 2019a) The vision 2020 action plan for combatting blindness in Sri Lanka aims at dealing with eye problems as a public health priority. There are 65 eye surgeons working in the public health system at present and more around 25 in the private sector. (Ministry of Health, 2013), (Annual Health Bulletin of Sri Lanka 2016) The following medications are available free from the government hospitals under the essential the gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus, stomach and colon) accounts for nearly 20% of the cancer mortality in Sri Lanka (WHO, 2014) Common gastroenterological conditions observed in Sri Lanka are gastroesophageal reflux disease, acute and chronic gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, Gastroenteritis, and diseases of the colorectum which include anal fissures, haemorrhoids and sphincter anomalies. Management of gastrointestinal tumours are mainly done at specialised oncology units whereas the care faci lities for other gastroenterological conditions are offered at almost all tertiary care institutions in the country. The offered facilities include anorectal function testing (evaluation of constipation and faecal endoscopic ultrasound, testing for chronic constipation, including radionuclide gastric and intestinal transit studies, 24- hour pH monitoring, gastro- duodenal motility, ambulatory motility recordings and provocative testing for non- cardiac chest pain. Gynaecological conditions Common gynaecological conditions in Sri Lanka includes the cancers of the female reproductive tract and menstrual cycle related abnormalities. Cervical cancer is the second commonest malignancy among females with an age- standardized incidence rate of 8.2 per 100,000 population in 2014. It accounts for 8.6% of newly diagnosed cancers among females. Ovarian cancer is the fourth commonest malignancy with an age- standardized rate of 7.2 per 100,000 population accounting for 7.3% of female cancer incidence. Uterine cancer stands as the eighth commonest with an age-standardized rate of 5.2 per 100 000 population consisting 4.7% fall newly diagnosed female malignancies (National Cancer Control Programme, 2019). Hemachandra (2007) reports a prevalence of 62.4% self -reported gynaecological symptoms among ever married women. The most c ommon gynaecological problem was premenstrual syndrome (62.4 %), followed by problems related to menstrual bleeding (43.1%). The prevalence of dysmenorrhoea had been 33.4%. Page 66 of 143 Gynaecological malignancies are managed at specialised cancer units while the speci alised obstetricians and gynaecologists working in the tertiary care institutions and private sector offer treatment to other common gynaecological conditions . Tuberculosis and other lung diseases Tuberculosis Sri Lanka has a special TB treatment and prevention program. (National Programme for Tuberculosis Control and Chest Diseases, Ministry of Health, 2017), This national programme oversees the control and treatment of all the TB cases diagnosed in Sri Lanka. Proper surveillance and treatment as well as f ollow up is assured as TB is taken up as a public health priority. There are approximately 10,000 patients diagnosed every year in Sri Lanka. Majority of cases are detected in urban areas and nearly half of them are sputum positive. All the chest clinics around the country delivers Directly Observed Treatments (DOTs) to prevent spread of the disease. Contact screening is also carried out as part of management of TB patients. GeneXpert tests are available from 30 locations over the country representing all the districts. Digital X -rays as well as microscopy evaluations are also available throughout the country from government hospitals. There are close to 200 microscopy centres. (Health, 2017) The recent TB regional Green Light Committee hosted by the WHO regional office has discussed the following for the TB control in Sri Lanka: Universal Drug Susceptibility testing must be achieved at the soonest possible by end of 2018. Workload analysis at Gene X pert sites. Improve coordination for use of Gene X pert machines. Establishment of sputum collection centres at all hospitals and strengthening transportation networks. Active adverse events monitoring is a must and needs to be emphasized to all attending the patients Infection Prevention Control (IPC) and taking measures for Triaging of patients, such as free availability of masks for patients and taking administrative measures to build waiting areas with open spaces to provide proper ventilation, providing coughing booths at OPDs etc. Switching from longer regim en to shorter regimen Encouraging private hospitals to include TB screening in corporate agreements Continuous sensitization of General Practitioners Urgent workload assessment of Public Health Laboratory Technicians (PHLTs) , radiologist and other staff and redistribution, as necessary Operationalization of digital X -ray for screening Innovative means to approach migrants Innovative insurance plans that cover TB treatment (Health, 2017) Page 67 of 143 According to the WHO report on TB in Sri Lanka, there have been 56 patients infected with TB and 26 with multi -drug resistant (MDR) in the year 2018. TB treatment coverage is thought to be around 64% and the national budget for TB treatment and control is 5.1millions USDs. HIV positive TB incidence has remained low from t he year 2000 upto date. (WHO, 2018). Treatment success rate is mentioned as 84% in the Annual Health Bullletin 2016. The following medications are available for the treatment of TB in both adulsts and children from the chest the country: and levofloxacin. (Sri Lanka, 2014) Asthma Prevalence of asthma among adults as estimated comes around 31%. T hough a 23% reported experiencing wheezing, only 11% were on regular treatment for asthma. It assumed that a substantial proportion of people deny of having asthma whilst having symptoms and are not on regular treatment. (Amarasiri et al., 2016) The follo wing medications are available through the Sri Lank And theophylline. There are other newer medications available through the government as well as the private sector. Palliative care Palliative care has been given a prominence in Sri Lanka recently. The National Cancer Control Program has drafted a new National Strategic Framework for Palliative Care Development. (Health, 2018) The Postgraduate institute of Medicine has introduced a postgraduate diploma in palliative care medicine since 2015. The doctors who are trained in this sub- specialty would be able to deliver effective palliative care services within the government hospital system. ( PGIM, 2015). The Sri Lanka Medical Association has set up a palliative care task force for the advancement of the field in the country. (The Sunday Times, 2017). The Ministry of Health has planned to set up a dedicated palliative care hospital which was pl anned to be operative by 2019 in Anuradhapura. (The Sunday Times, 2018).

Then they are considered as medications which occasionally go \"out of s tocks\". However, they are available from the private sector as there are several brands of a single medication registered in the country. Medicines other than specified in the essential drugs are available in the government as well as the private sector in the country. For example, medications such duloxetine and bupropione are available from the private sector pharmacies. A procedure called \"Local purchasing\" helps the clinicians to use even some of the expensive medications when needed in the governmen t sector. Likewise, help from the president's fund and other welfare funds make it possible for the patients to make use of medications and devices which are normally not available from the government hospitals. Mentioning of names of private sector organizations and hospitals as well as other organizations such as NGOs are illustrative and the authors declare that we have not received any remuneration, financial or otherwise from any of these institutions, for mentioning their names in this document.
