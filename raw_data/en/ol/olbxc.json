ALLERGY VACCINES: CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS NEEDED By: Varsha Meghnani, PhD of LightHouse Lab Services INTRODUCTION: Allergies are among the most common chronic conditions in the western world. Figure 1. depicts the results from a research conducted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showing that food allergies in children have increased approximately 50 percent in the last two decades in the USA [1]. The cases of allergies are more prevalent in cities than in the rural areas. Many hypotheses have been proposed by different scientific groups to explain the recent rise in allergy cases. Growing pollution, consumption of genetically modified foods (GMO), obesity, vitamin D deficiency are some of the contributing factors proposed in the recent past. Another theory proposed is the \"hygiene hypothesis\" which suggests that living conditions in the cities are too clean which suppresses natural development of our immune system and diminishes its ability to distinguish between the harmful and harmless [2]. The process is not as simple as it sounds and there is no single hypothesis that can be applicable in all the cases. Allergy is a complex hyper-immune response against some harmless substances, called allergens. Allergens can be foods, drugs, plant pollens, insects' stings, animals' products, metals, molds, cosmetics, insecticide etc. Upon contacting with allergens, the body generates specific molecules called antibodies i.e. IgE which bind with mast cells. Upon subsequent exposure of the same allergens, the IgE antibodies signal the mast cells to release histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which produce allergy symptoms like itching, inflammation, rashes, running nose, swelling etc. The immune system is an integral part of human protection against disease, but in allergies, protective immune mechanisms cause detrimental reactions in the host, which makes it difficult to treat allergies. Hence there is no permanent cure for allergies and they are very difficult to manage. One option is to avoid using/contacting the known allergens. This strategy works but is a tedious process and is often not possible, especially if the allergens are environmental and are wide spread. Food allergens can be avoided to some extent but again it is not a very convenient option and can lead to nutritional deficiencies in the patient. There are several types of medications available both over-the-counter and prescription. These medications can produce symptomatic relief but do not address the underlying allergy and do not prevent disease progression. Long-term use of these drugs is not recommended since these medications can produce some very serious and annoying side effects. Therefore, people with allergies are bound to live with the residual symptoms which is not only a financial burden on them but also negatively impact their quality of lives. Allergy Vaccines/Shots/Immunotherapy: Allergy immunotherapy offers an alternative treatment option that gives persistent therapeutic benefits and has a potential to prevent the progression of the allergic diseases. Although the concept of allergy vaccines/shots/immunotherapy is almost 100 years old [3], it has been recently adopted to treat allergies. In 2014, the FDA approved three new immunotherapy products that are intended for the treatment of hay fever caused by certain pollens. In 2017, the FDA approved vaccines for the treatment of house dust mite-induced allergic rhinitis (nasal inflammation) with or without conjunctivitis (eye inflammation). Some of the details regarding current FDA approved allergy vaccines have been summarized in Table 1. Allergy vaccine contains a small amount of allergens, that are responsible for triggering allergies. The allergens in the allergy shots are adequate to stimulate immunogenicity but are not enough to cause a full-blown allergenicity. Immunogenicity is the capacity of a vaccine to induce a benecial immune response, whereas allergenicity is the potential to cause an allergic reaction. Over time, the dose of allergens is increased which helps the body build tolerance against that allergen, causing allergy symptoms to diminish over time. Immunotherapy changes the response to allergen exposure by inducing immunological tolerance. The allergy vaccines work by deviating the immune response from humoral immunity to cellular immunity [5]. Unlike humoral immune response, cell-mediated immune response does not involve production of IgE antibodies, but rather involves the activation of T-lymphocytes. This way the body is encouraged to produce more Th1 regulatory T cells, which secrete interferon gamma, stimulating B cells to produce IgG instead of IgE, and IgG is not capable of triggering an allergic reaction [6]. As compared to the symptomatic treatment, allergy immunotherapy offers many advantages. Immunotherapy produces long-lasting effects even after discontinuation of the treatment, which improves the quality of the patients' life. Immunotherapy also has capacity to prevent further progression of the allergic disorders. Immunotherapy is a cost-effective treatment option as compared to the symptomatic treatment. Since it produces long term effects and hence results in decreased consumption of medications, fewer visits to the hospitals and incurred productivity gains. Despite of all the advantages allergy vaccines offer, there are still a lot of developments needed to improve the safety and efficacy of the therapy. One of the major concerns with allergy vaccines is its safety. Introduction of allergens can induce adverse effects which can be very serious in some cases. Allergy immunotherapy has traditionally been based on the administration of the allergens obtained from natural sources which are mostly contaminated with other toxins and hence can produce severe side effects. Efforts have been made to reduce the allergenicity (IgE activation abilities) of the vaccines by chemically modifying the allergens used in the vaccines. Such modified allergens are also called \"allergoid\". Chemical modification of allergens has shown to significantly reduce their IgE binding capability, but the side effects cannot be completely eliminated by simply modifying the allergens' chemical properties [7]. Recently, hypoallergens created by genetic recombinant technology have been tested for producing allergy vaccines [8]. Hypoallergenic allergens are naturally occurring isoforms of a particular allergen that have reduced IgE reactivity while maintaining immunogenicity. It is hypothesized that the use of recombinant hypoallergenic isoforms can further reduce adverse events generated by immunotherapy but more research is required to reach the full potential of recombinant allergens in the clinical setting. Moreover, currently used allergens vary greatly in terms of potencies and immunogenicity. This variation is very difficult to control and hence leads to inconsistencies in the efficacy of the therapy. Apart from the allergen type the proportion of the allergen used in the vaccine is also very crucial for the successful treatment. Allergen extract cross-reactivities and incompatibilities must be taken into consideration before mixing different allergens for the preparation of immunotherapy prescriptions. Such cross reactivities and incompatibilities of the allergen extracts might result in lowered therapeutic potential of the immunotherapy [9]. Another concern with immunotherapy is its limited efficacy in certain types of allergies. Immunotherapy is not considered appropriate for food and drug allergies. Right now, the only way to address such allergies is to avoid the culprit allergens or suppress allergic reactions once they have already started. Immunotherapy is mostly started with very low dose which is increased gradually over time. But due to multiple dosing requirement, it is not convenient for the patients and has poor patient compliance. Due to the time commitment needed, patients sometimes miss the shot appointments which leads to failure of the therapy. Due to the associated side effects, some of the patients cannot reach and maintain the therapeutic blood levels and hence cannot achieve the optimal efficacy of the therapy. To improve the efficacy and the minimize the dose requirements different route of administration have been tested. Currently sublingual dosing route is considered a gold standard for allergy immunotherapy, since it helps in maintaining a constant blood concentration for long period and hence minimize multiple dosing. Sublingual dosing is relatively simple route of dosing especially in pediatric patient population who are the major candidates for allergy therapy [5]. Due to the associated drawbacks immunotherapy has not been widely accepted for treating and preventing allergies. As depicted in the Figure 2, to reduce the unwanted side effects and to improve the quality of the vaccines the manufacturing process must be standardized. The standardization process allows for production of well-characterized, non-contaminated extracts of known biologic potency and composition. Manufacturing of the allergy vaccine must be reproducible with minimal batch to batch variation. At the same time vaccine production should be possible at low costs. Lastly but most importantly allergy vaccines should be safe to use with no anaphylactic reactions and efficacious in reducing symptoms for a long term in few doses of application to increase patient compliance and to reduce the overall treatment cost.
