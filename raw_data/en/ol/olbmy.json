Homeopathy is a safe, effective system of natural medicine, used by millions of people worldwide for more than 200 years. The principles of homeopathy were developed into a system of medicine by the German physician, Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843). Homeopathic medicines are prepared from natural sources, are used in extremely small amounts, and are recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. They are non-toxic and, when used properly, can be safely given to infants, children, adults and animals. How does homeopathy differ from conventional medicine? Homeopathy is based on the principle that \"like cures like.\" That is, if a substance can cause symptoms of disease in a healthy person, then it can cure a sick person suffering from similar symptoms. Suppose a person has hay fever, with watery eyes and a burning nasal discharge. Instead of giving an antihistamine to dry up the discharge, a homeopath might prescribe Allium Cepa, a tiny dose of onion, specially prepared by a homeopathic pharmacy, in accordance with FDA approved guidelines, because onion is known to cause watery eyes and a burning nasal discharge. Homeopathy regards symptoms as the body's healthy attempt to restore itself to balance. A homeopath will choose a remedy that supports the symptoms, rather than opposing them or suppressing them as is done in conventional medicine. Homeopathy recognizes that each person manifests illness in a unique and slightly different way. That is why two people with the same illness will not necessarily receive the same homeopathic remedy. A cold sufferer with a stopped-up nose and dry eyes would receive a different remedy than a cold sufferer with a runny nose and watering eyes. Unlike the \"one size fits all\" approach often used in conventional medicine, a homeopath chooses a remedy that matches a person's unique symptom profile, including physical, mental, and emotional symptoms. Because homeopathy is supportive and not suppressive to the body's vital force, it may work more slowly than conventional medicine. That may mean possibly weeks, months or years of deep healing to restore the body to its original health.
