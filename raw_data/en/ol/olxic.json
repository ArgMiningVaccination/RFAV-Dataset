In acupuncture or acupressure treatments, small, fine needles or other forms of manipulation target and stimulate specific points on the body. We're still learning more and more each year about the potential of [acupuncture](https://www.synergyrehabaz.com/services/acupuncture). This form of treatment can help with a wide variety of conditions, including chronic pain problems ranging from headaches to arthritis and even debilitating menstrual symptoms. Many of our patients find that [acupuncture](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/acupuncture-over-opioids-for-pain-relief) does enough to relieve their pain so they don't need to turn to addictive opioid pain medications or invasive surgical treatments. At [Synergy Rehabilitation & Wellness Center](https://www.synergyrehabaz.com/about) of Scottsdale, Arizona, [our team](https://www.synergyrehabaz.com/provider) is always working on better ways to resolve your pain. We offer acupuncture as part of a commitment to minimally invasive, holistic complementary medicine. How does acupuncture work? In traditional Asian medicine, acupuncture is thought to release your body's internal flow of energy, also called qi. Acupuncture may be able help patients with pain complaints due to the treatment's ability to trigger an [all-natural release of endorphins](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/relieving-pain-with-acupuncture). Your endorphins affect your pain levels and also work to improve your overall mood and sense of well-being. [Studies](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151882) show that stimulating your vagus nerve with acupuncture techniques can lower inflammation levels around your body. When you come in for a treatment, we carefully insert a number of needles into specific \"acupoints,\" targeting the root cause of your pain. You should experience only slight discomfort, because we use extremely small, fine-gauge needles. Once we place the needles, you rest for 30-50 minutes in peace and quiet. We may use techniques like warming, rotating, or spinning the needles to further enhance your treatment experience. Relief when you need it With acupuncture, you can get the relief you need without medications or long recovery periods. Your results could appear during your treatment session or immediately afterward. A simple procedure might be all you need. If you have persistent problems with pain or discomfort, or are recovering from a traumatic event or injury, acupuncture may have beneficial effects. Results with acupuncture can vary from person to person, but the relatively few risks involved and the total lack of recovery time mean that a session is often worth a try, especially if you're dealing with stubborn or persistent pain.
