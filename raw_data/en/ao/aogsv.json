Gereige, MD, MPH,* Pablo Marcelo to this contain discussionof unapproved/investigative use ofa commercial product/device.Practice Gap The epidemiology of pneumonia is changing; chest radiographs and routine laboratory testing are unnecessary for routine diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in chil-dren who are candidates for outpatient treatment. Objectives The readers of this article are expected to: 1. Know the cause, clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and general approach to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies of the different types ofpneumonia in children of various age groups. 2. Be aware of the challenges that face the clinician in making an accurate diagnosis of pneumonia due to the inaccuracies and shortcomings of the various laboratory andimaging studies. 3. Know the complications of pneumonia in children and their appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Introduction Pneumonia is commonly encountered by emergency department and primary care clini- cians. Childhood pneumonia remains a signi cant cause of morbidity and mortality in de- veloping countries, whereas mortality rates in the developed world have decreasedsecondary to new vaccines, antimicrobials, and advances in diagnostic and monitoring tech-niques. (1) This review focuses on pneumonia in children: its causes in various age groups,clinical manifestations, indications for hospitalization, and the challenges that clinicians facein making an accurate diagnosis despite the new and emerging diagnostic tests. Epidemiology The incidence of pneumonia var ies by age groups and between developing and developed countr ies. Worldwide, the overall annual incidence of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years is 150 million to 156 million cases, (2)(3) leading to an estimated 2 million deaths p er year, most of which occur in developing countries. (4) Forty percent of cases require hos-pitalization. (5) In developed countries, the annual incidence ofpneumonia is estimated at 33 per 10,000 in children youngert h a n5y e a r sa n d1 4 . 5p e r1 0 , 0 0 0 in children ages 0 to 16 years. In the United States, pneumoni a is estimated to occur in 2.6% of children younger than 17 years. Fortunately, the mortality rate in developed countries is less than 1 per 1000 per year. (3) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), pneumonia is the single largest cause of death in children worldwide, leading to an annual death of an estimated 1.2 mil-lion children younger than 5 years. This accounts for 18% of alldeaths of children younger than 5 years worldwide. (6) Cases of pneumonia occur throughout the year; however, the incidence is increased during the colder tract MRSA: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MSSA: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus VATS: video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery WHO: World Health Organization *Editorial Board.

It is presumed that person-to-person transmission of respiratory drop- lets enhanced by indoor crowding, impaired mucociliaryclearance, and the peak of viral infections that led to viralpneumonias with secondary bacterial pneumonias are thecause of this peak. In tropical climates, peaks of respira-tory infections are seen sporadically throughout the year.(4) Table 1 highlights the risk factors of pneumonia inneonates and older children and teens. Denitions Before further discussion of this topic, it is important to dis-cuss the de nitions of the various terms related to pneumonia. Pneumonia Pneumonia still remains a condition that is challenging to accurately diagnose. Therefore, no single de nition that accurately describes childhood pneumonia currently ex-ists. Pneumonia is de ned as a lower respiratory tract in- fection (LRTI) typically associated with fever, respiratorysymptoms, and evidence of parenchymal involvement by either physical examination or the presence of in ltrates on chest radiography. Pathologically, it represents aninflammatory process of the lungs, including airways, al- veoli, connective tissue, visceral pleura, and vascular structures. Radiologically, pneumonia is de ned as an in- ltrate on chest radiograph in a child with symptoms of an acute respiratory illness. (1)(7) Walking Pneumonia Walking pneumonia is a term typically used in school-aged children and young adults with c linical and radiographic ev- idence of pneumonia but with mild symptoms in which therespiratory symptoms do not interfere with normal activity.Typically, Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been implicated as the organism presumably responsible for walking pneumonia. Community-Acquired Pneumonia Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to an acute pulmonary infection in a previously healthy individual ac-quired in the community (as opposed to hospital-acquiredor nosocomial pneumonia)(8) Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia A pneumonia that develops in a hospitalized child within48 hours after admission is considered hospital-associated Table 1.

(9) Pneumonia that affects those individuals living in chronic care facilities and those who were re- cently hospitalized fall in this category as well. Etiology A large number of microorganisms cause pneumonia,ranging from viruses to bacteria and fungi (Table 2).The etiologic agents of pneumonia depend on the pa- tient's age. In neonates (0-3 months of age), maternal flora, such as group B streptococcus and gram-negative bac- teria, are common causes that are vertically transmitted. Overall, Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most com- mon bacterial cause of pneumonia in children older than 1week, whereas viruses account for 14% to 35% of cases. (7)(10) In children ages 3 months to 5 years, 50% to 60% ofcases are associated with viral respiratory infections. (11) In school-aged children ( >5 years), atypical organisms, such asMp n e u m o n i a e andChlamydophila (previously known asChlamydia )pneumoniae, are more common. (12) Mycoplasma pneumoniae remains the leading cause of pneumonia in school-age children and young adults. New vaccines and emerging antibiotic resistance led to a change in the pathogens implicated in pneumonia. The rst vaccine that affected the epidemiology of pneumonia in the United States was the conjugated Haemophilus in- fluenzae type b vaccine (1990). It drastically reduced in- vasive disease by this organism. In 2000, thepneumococcal conjugated 7-valent vaccine not only de-creased the rates of invasive disease signi cantly (98.7 cases per 10,000 in 1998 -1999 vs 23.4 cases per 10,000 in 2005) but also decreased the incidence ofpneumonia that required hospitalization and ambulatory visits in children younger than 2 years. (10)(12)(13) The rates for children ages 1 to 18 years, however, remainedstable. Conjugated vaccines reduce nasopharyngeal colo-nization. This effect bene ted nonimmunized adults older than 65 years through herd immunity. As expected,the pneumococcal conjugated 7-valent vaccine led toa shift of the most common serotypes that cause diseasein children, and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduced in 2010 provides additional coverage against common pneumococcal serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F,and 19A, further incidence of pneumoniathat requires hospitalization. (10)(12)(13) Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) should be considered in cases of complicated pneumonia with empyema and necrosis.The latter can be severe when associated with in fluenza infection. In the last few years, clinicians have encoun-tered severe secondary bacterial infections after in fluenzainfection. This mechanism is still not clear, but animal models suggest that in fluenza A enhances transmission of bacteria such as S aureus . (13) New viruses emerged in the past few years. The hu- man metapneumovirus (hMPV) was described in 2001. Often considered to be a pathogen associated with bron-chiolitis, it is described in association with pneumonia.Children younger than 5 years are susceptible to hMPVinfection, and infants younger than 2 years with primary infection are particularly at risk of severe infection. Seroepidemiologic studies indicate that virtually all chil-dren are infected with hMPV by 5 to 10 years of age.In one series, hMPV was isolated in 8.3% (second onlyto respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]) of cases of radio-logically diagnosed CAP. Children with hMPV wereolder than those with RSV (mean age of 19 vs 9 months)and had a higher incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms and wheeze. Indicators of severity (such as saturations on admission, respiratory rate, and duration of stay) wereno different in hMPV compared with other viruses. (13)(14) The human bocavirus is in the parvovirus family. Al- though it has not been cultured yet, it can be identi ed by electron microscopy. Initially, its role in pneumoniawas unclear. Preliminary evidence suggests that nearly all children have produced antibodies to human bocavirus by school age, and most newborns receive antibodies fromtheir mothers. (13)(14) Clinical Manifestations Pneumonia in children is a challenging diagnosis becausethe presenting signs and symptoms are nonspeci c, might be subtle (particularly in infants and young children), and vary, depending on the patient 's age, responsible patho- gen, and severity of the infection. (1)(4)(7)(13) In all age groups, fever and cough are the hallmark of pneumonia. (4) Other ndings, such as tachypnea, in- creased work of breathing (eg, nasal flaring in infants), and hypoxia, may precede the cough. The WHO uses ta- chypnea and retractions to effectively diagnose pneumo-nia in children younger than 5 years but tachypnea becomes less sensitive and speci c as age increases (in children >5 years). (4) Most of the clinical signs and symptoms have a low sensitivity and speci city except for cough, crackles (rales), retractions, rhonchi, and nasal flaring (in young infants), which are highly speci c but not sensitive, meaning that their absence might help ruleout the disease. (1) The rate of diagnosed pneumonia inpatients with fever but no cough or tachypnea is 0.28%. Upper lobe pneumonias may present with a clinical pic- ture suggestive of meningitis due to radiating neck pain.infectious diseases pneumonia 440 Pediatrics in Review Vol.34 No.10 October 2013 by Rachel Boykan on December 1, 2014 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from Table 2.

In neonates, pneumonia can occur as early or late on- set. (1) Early-onset pneumonia typically presents in the rst 3 days of life. The infection is acquired from the mother either hematogenously through the placenta orthrough aspiration of infected amniotic fluid in utero or during or after birth. It commonly presents with respi-ratory distress beginning at or soon after birth. Newborns may also present with nonspeci c symptoms, such as leth- argy, apnea, tachycardia, and poor perfusion, occasionally progressing to septic shock or pulmonary hypertension.Other signs include temperatur e instability, metabolic aci- dosis, and abdominal distension. (2) Late-onset pneumoniaoccurs after birth during hospitalization or after dischargeand is either nosocomial acquired or due to colonizationor contaminated equipment. Late-onset pneumonia typi- cally presents with nonspeci distress, and circulatory collapse. Ventilator-dependent infants may have increased oxygen and ventilator require-ments and/or purulent tracheal secretions. It is virtually impossible to clinically differentiate bac- terial from viral pneumonia except that bacterial pneu-monia might have a more abrupt and severe onset after days of symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. The patient may be ill appearing and sometimes experi-ence toxic effects, with moderate to severe respiratory dis-tress and localized chest pain. Finally, complications aremore likely to occur in bacterial pneumonia. (13) Pneumococcal pneumonia is typically a lobar pneu- monia that presents with fever, nonproductive cough, ta-chypnea, and decreased breath sounds over the affected lobe. (10)(12) Atypical bacterial pneumonia caused by Mp n e u m o n i a e orC pneumoniae usually presents with abrupt onset of fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, photophobia, sore throat, and gradually worsening prolonged nonproductivecough. Atypical bacterial pneumonia may be dif cult to differentiate from viral pneumonia. Hoarseness is more fre-quently seen with Cp n e u m o n i a e infection compared with a viral origin. Wheezing in a child older than 5 years mightbe associated with atypical bacterial ( Mycoplasma orChla- mydia ) and viral pneumonias and is unlikely to be due to other bacterial causes. (13) Mycoplasma pneumoniae may be asymptomatic or may present with minimal physical ex-amination ndings. In one review, 75% to 100% of patients with Mp n e u m o n i a e infection have an intractable, nonpro- ductive cough, whereas only 3% to 10% developed pneu- monia. M pneumoniae is self-limited.

(15) Mycoplasma pneumoniae may be also associated with a variety of extrapulmonary manifestations (Table 3). Chlamydia pneumoniae is indistinguishable from pneu- monia caused by other factors. Extrapulmonary manifes-tations of Cp n e u m o n i a e infections may include the following: \u0081Meningoencephalitis \u0081Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome \u0081Reactive arthritis \u0081Myocarditis Viral pneumonia has a gradual insidious onset. The pa- tient usually experiences nontoxic effects, with upper re- spiratory tract symptoms, and auscultatory ndings are more likely to be diffuse. Wheezing is more frequent inviral than bacterial pneumonia. General Approach History and Physical Examination The approach to the child with suspected pneumonia be-gins with a detailed history and careful physical examination.History is more likely to reveal fever, with associated respi-ratory symptoms, including cough and tachypnea. On phys-ical examination, the clinician must pay special attention tothe general appearance of the patient and assess for hypoxiaand cyanosis. Young infants may present with lethargy, poor feeding, or irritability. Alt hough the presence of fever is not specic for pneumonia, it may be the only sign in occult pneumonia. In a systematic review, tachypnea was twice as frequent in children with vs without radiographic pneu-monia, and its absence was the most valuable sign for rulingout the diagnosis, making it the most sensitive sign. Othersigns of respiratory distress include increased work use of accessory muscles), apnea, and altered mental status. Signs of respira-tory distress are more speci c than fever or cough for LRTI but not as sensitive. Lung examination is a key part of the assessment. Aus- cultation of all lung elds should be performed, listening for crackles (rales) or crepitations, the presence of whichcorrelates with pneumonia. The absence of these ndings does not rule out pneumonia. Other ndings consistent with consolidated lung parenchyma might include de-creased breath sounds, egophony, bronchophony, tactilefremitus, or dullness to percussion. Again, wheezing ismore likely in viral or atypical pneumonia, but whenwheezing is only heard unilaterally and is associated withfever, bronchial obstruction (intrinsic or extrinsic) andassociated bacterial infection should be suspected. Splinting, dullness to percu ssion, distant breath sounds, and friction rub are suggestive of pleural effusion and must be con rmed by imaging. It is important to men- tion that many patients clinically suspected of havingpneumonia are treated empirically with no need for im-aging or laboratory workup except for severely ill chil-dren with hypoxia, respiratory distress, and inability toeat or drink. Diagnostic Testing and Evaluation RADIOGRAPHIC IMAGING. In a child with mild lower respiratory symptoms consistent with CAP who is a can- didate for outpatient treatment, chest radiographs are notroutinely needed to make the diagnosis. (7)(8)(16) Thepresence of in ltrates on chest radiograph in a child with fever and respiratory distress con rms the diagnosis of pneumonia; however, the absence of chest x-ray ndings does not rule out pneumonia if there is high clinical sus-picion. This is due to several factors: the radiographicndings may lag behind the clinical picture, dehydrated children may not have an in ltrate initially, and it is im- possible to differentiate atelectasis from pneumonia ona single chest radiograph (an in ltrate that resolves in less than 48-72 hours is more likely atelectasis than pneumonia). An initial chest radiograph may be indicated in the fol- lowing situations (16):Table 3. Clinical Manifestations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae Infections (7) Respiratory tract disease Intractable nonproductive to mild cough (75%-100%) Pneumonia (3%-10%) Chills With or without wheezing and (6%-59%) Joint involvement (polyarthritis) hepatitis) Central nervous system Cardiac disease (pericarditis, myocarditis)infectious diseases pneumonia Pediatrics in Review Vol.34 No.10 October 2013 443 by Rachel Boykan on December 1, 2014 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from 1.

As part of the workup of a young infant with fever without a source and leukocytosis. Follow-up chest radiographs are not routinely indi- cated in who are adequately treated and recov- ered. Follow-up radiographs are indicated in complicatedpneumonias that are clinically unstable, in patients receiv-ing adequate antibiotic coverage for 48 to 72 hours withpoor clinical improvement or worsening, and in recurrentpneumonias that involve the same lobe to rule out a sus-pected anomaly, chest mass, or foreign body. Childrenwith complicated pneumonia treated with chest tubeplacement or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) do not require routine daily chest radiography if they are clinically stable and improving. When indicated, chest radiographs should be obtained in the posteroanterior upright position in children youngerthan 4 years and in the supine anteroposterior position inyounger children. A lateral view is preferred, and a lateraldecubitus view (with affected side down) should be ob-tained when a pleural effusion is suspected. Bedside ultrasonography of the chest was studied and compared with chest radiographs. In one prospective cohortstudy of 200 patients, ultrasonog raphy an overall of CI, 83%-93%). Speci city increased to 97% in children with consolidation greater than 1 cm by chest radiographs.The authors concluded that bedside ultrasonography wasfound to be a highly speci c, noninvasive, radiation-free test that can be used by clinicians to diagnose pneumonia. (17) Laboratory Testing Routine laboratory testing is not indicated to diagnose pneu-monia, particularly in children who are stable, are nonhy-poxic, and have suspected CAP and are candidates foroutpatient treatment. Patients w ith hypoxemia, severe respi- ratory distress, possible complicated pneumonia, or associ-ated comorbid conditions may need further workup. Blood Tests A complete blood cell count with differential does notallow differentiation among bacterial, atypical, or viralorigins or dictate management, particularly in the out- patient setting. (7)(8) A complete blood cell count with differential is typically performed in children who arecandidates for hospitalizatio n (Table 4). Peripheral eo- sinophilia suggests Chlamydia trachomatis in infants with afebrile pneumonia of infancy. Acute phase reac-tants, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactiveprotein, and serum procalcitonin, should not be routinelymeasured in fully immunized children with mild disease but may be useful in monitoring response to treatment in children hospitalized with severe or complicated pneu-monia. (11)(16) Other blood tests might include serumelectrolytes to assess for degree of dehydration and to ruleout hyponatremia secondary to syndrome of inappropriateantidiuretic hormone secretion. Microbiologic Tests BLOOD CULTURES \u0081Not routinely indicated in the outpatient setting in children who have nontoxic effects and fully immu-nized due to low yield (only positive in 10%-12% ofchildren). (8) \u0081In patients with parapneumonic increases to 30% to 40%. \u0081Should be obtained in children hospitalized with se-vere disease, who fail to demonstrate response despiteadequate antibiotic coverage, or in children with com- plicated pneumonia. (16) \u0081Follow-up blood cultures are not necessary in patients with clear improvement. NASOPHARYNGEAL SAMPLES. Nasopharyngeal cul- tures do not provide useful information because the bac- teria recovered are usually normal upper respiratory tractflora and do not necessarily correlate with the cause of pneumonia. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is nowavailable for the detection of several pathogens in naso- pharyngeal samples as discussed below. The identi cation of bacteria by PCR in nasopharyngeal samples is not as useful for the same reason expressed above. SPUTUM CULTURES \u0081Difcult to obtain and induce in young children ( <5 years) and in outpatient setting. \u0081Should be obtained in older hospitalized children,children who are in intensive care, those who havecomplicated pneumonia, or those who do not respondto sputum samples specimen for examination is onewith:infectious diseases pneumonia 444 Pediatrics in Review Vol.34 No.10 October 2013 by Rachel Boykan on December 1, 2014 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from B10 or fewer epithelial cells BAnd 25 or more polymorphonuclear leukocytes under low power ( /C2100). BA predominant microorganism intracellu-lar organisms suggest the etiologic agent.PLEURAL FLUID \u0081When pleural fluid is more than minimal in amount, it should be obtained through a diagnostic (and possi-bly therapeutic) thoracentesis and sent for Gramstain and culture ideally before administration ofantibiotics. \u0081Because most children have already received antibioticsby the time the pleural fluid is sampled, thereby signif- icantly reducing the yield of conventional cultures, an- tigen testing and PCR may be helpful in identifying the causative agent. \u0081Studies such as pH, glucose, protein, and lactatedehydrogenase rarely change management and arenot recommended, except for white blood cellcount with differential to differentiate bacterial from mycobacterial causes and from malignancy.(16) Table 5 highlights the laboratory ndings in empyema. Rapid Tests Nasopharyngeal swab specimen for rapid testing by PCRor immuno fluorescence may be useful. (8) A positive rapid test result for viruses in inpatient and outpatient set-tings might decrease the need for further testing or forstarting antibiotic therapy; it may also give the opportu-nity for starting antiviral therapy early. (16) Rapid testsexist for the following PCR) The PCR tests for pneumococcus in sputum and blood are not recommended because their sensitivity and speci city in children have not been conclusively established. Antigen Detection and Serologic Testing Urinary antigen detection tests have low sensitivity andhigh false-positive rates. (8)(16) Hence, they are not rec-ommended for the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumo-nia in children.

Routine serologic testing for speci S ,C pneumoniae ) is not in- dicated because results do not usually in fluence manage- ment. Viral serologic testing is not practical because acuteand convalescent specimens are needed. Serologic testingforChlamydophila species is not readily available. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, when suspected in an older child, is often treated empirically. However, serologic andPCR testing can be helpful in evaluating the youngerchild or in establishing the diagnosis in patients with ex-trapulmonary (particularly central nervous system) man- ifestations. The most (ELISA); however,the complement xation test has better city. It measures early IgM (predominantly) and IgG antibodies(to a lesser extent) to M pneumoniae . A positive result is dened as follows: \u0081A 4-fold or greater increase in titer in paired sera OR \u0081A single titer of greater than or equal to 1:32 Antibody titers rise 7 to 9 days after infection and peak at 3 to 4 weeks. A 4-fold decline in titer also is diagnosticif late samples are obtained. The presence of antibodieseither by enzyme immunoassay or complement xation is highly sensitive for the detection of M pneumoniae infection. A major disadvantage of these tests is theirfalse-positive results, particularly during in flammatory re- actions, such as neurologic syndromes, bacterial meningitis,and acute pancreatitis. Less commonly used diagnostic tests are as follows: 1. Tuberculin skin testing or Quantiferon gold (children >5 years old): If pulmonary tuberculosis is suspected, either tuberculin skin testing (puri ed protein deriva- tive) or interferon gamma release assays canbe used. There are 2 available IGRAs:a. Quantiferon Gold: Measures interferon gamma produced by lymphocytes b. ELISA spot: Measures the number of lymphocytes producing interferon gamma both in response tospeci cM tuberculosis antigens. IGRAs measure response to antigens not present inBCG or Mycobacterium avium ; therefore, it has better speci city than tuberculin skin testing, especially in children who had received BCG vaccine in whom fre-quent puri ed protein derivatives can cause a boosting effect. 2. Urine antigen testing for legionellosis due to serogroup 1.3. Serum and urine antigen testing for histoplasmosis. 4. Histoplasmosis serologic testing (immunodiffusion and complement xation). 5.Cryptococcus antigen detection in serum. 6. The following tests can be used as part of the workup of the immunocompromised patient with suspected pneumonia: a.b- D-Glucan levels: b-D-Glucan is part of the cell wall of yeast and fungi and even Pneumocystis jirovecci and can be elevated in fungal pneumonias. (18) b. Galactomannan levels: Galactomannan is part of the cell wall of molds, such as aspergillus. Antigen levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or serum are pos- itive in suspected pneumonia due to aspergillus.(19) The clinician must be aware that certain antibiotics, such as piperacillin-tazobactam or transfusion with blood or blood-derived products such as intravenous immuno-globulin, may induce false-positive test results. (20) Invasive Studies Invasive studies to establish the cause of pneumonia inchildren are reserved for the critically ill child or the child with signi cant comorbidity whose initial diagnostic workup is inconclusive and in whom the risk of establish- ing the diagnosis outweighs the risk of the invasive pro-cedure. (16) Invasive studies are rarely needed. Invasivestudies include the following: \u0081Bronchoscopy with BAL - Quantitative culture techni- ques differentiate true infection from upper airwaycontamination. \u0081Morning gastric lavage through a nasogastric tube foracid fast bacilli stain and culture is used in the diagnosisof tuberculosis. \u0081The BAL technique for obtaining cultures in intubatedpatients uses a catheter inside a catheter, avoidingTable 5.

In one study, open lung biopsy con rmed the infectious cause in 10 of 33 patients, 8 of whom had a prior non-diagnostic BAL. Lung biopsy is commonly used in im-munocompromised patients. Differential Diagnosis When the clinician is faced with a child presenting with fe-ver, tachypnea, cough, respiratory distress, and in ltrates on chest radiograph, the diagnosis of pneumonia is highlylikely. (7) Other diagnoses, however, must be considered. In a neonate with respiratory distress, congenital anatom- ical cardiopulmonary anomalies must be ruled out, such astracheoesophageal stula, congenital heart disease, and sepsis. In infants and young children, foreign body aspira-tion (even if no history of any witnessed aspiration), bron-chiolitis, heart failure, sepsis, and metabolic acidosis may allcause tachypnea. In these cases, a careful history and phys-ical examination and a supportive imaging study can dis- tinguish pneumonia from other conditions. In adolescents and young adults, Lemierre syndrome (jugular vein suppurative thrombophlebitis) must be considered. Lemierre syndrome is typically caused byFusobacterium species that infect the carotid sheath and spread to lungs and mediastinum. Children who present with respiratory distress and wheezing may have CAP; however, rst-time wheezing of asthma with or without bronchiolitis can be the truediagnosis. A patient with asthma or bronchiolitis mayhave a radiographic picture that is normal or has in ltrates that could potentially be due to atelectasis. Other entities that may mimic pneumonia on clinical examination or on radiographs in children are listed inTable 6 Treatment Treatment of pneumonia varies between inpatient andoutpatient settings. In either setting, supportive care in- cludes the use of antipyretics, suctioning, and hydration when needed. Mucolytics and cough suppressants haveno role in the treatment of pneumonia. (21)(22) Zinc sup- plementation has been studied and found to be an effective adjunct to decreasing the incidence and prevalence ofpneumonia in children 2 to 59 months. (23)(24) In mostcases of CAP, the chances of having a speci ce t i o l o g i cd i - agnosis are low, leading the clinician to treat empirically.TheFigure gives highlights of the decision tree of the ap- proach to the child with suspected pneumonia. Outpatient Management EMPIRIC THERAPY. Antimicrobial therapy is not rou- tinely recommended in presc hool children with pneumonia (viruses are more common). (21) Because S pneumoniae remains the most commonly implicated pathogen, amoxi-cillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate remains the most appropri-aterst-line antimicrobial agent used empirically for CAP in fully immunized, healthy, young preschool children withmild to moderate symptoms. (25) Clavulanate adds thebenet of action moniae resistance to penicillin is due to a penicillin- binding protein (PBP2x) that has decreased af nity tob-lactams. Increasing the dose of amoxicillin (90- 100 mg/kg daily) may overcome this mechanism of re-sistance and should be prescribed if the clinician suspectsresistance (eg, children in day care or siblings in daycare, history of frequent infections). Amoxicillin-clavu- lanate is dispensed in 2 different amoxicillin-clavulanate ratios: 7:1 14:1. The 14:1 ratio should be whenhigh-dose amoxicillin is required to reduce the possibilityof antibiotic-associated diarrhea. In school-aged children and teens with a clinical pic- ture compatible with atypical CAP, coverage using a mac-rolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) should beconsidered. A systematic review of studies in developing countries found no signi cant difference in the treatment failures or relapse rates between 3- and 5-day courses of antibiotics in children ages 2 to 59 months with outpa-tient management of CAP. (26) In children with moderate to severe CAP suspected of having in fluenza infection and because early antiviral therapy provides the maximum bene t, treatment with antiviral therapy should not be delayed until con rmation of a positive in fluenza test result. It is also worth noting that treatment after 48 hours of symptoms might stillprovide clinical bene ts in severe cases of in fluenza. (16) Inpatient Management Table 4 highlights the indications for hospitalizations andintensive care admission.infectious diseases pneumonia Pediatrics in Review Vol.34 No.10 October 2013 447 by Rachel Boykan on December 1, 2014 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from EMPIRIC THERAPY. It is helpful for the clinician to be familiar with the antibiograms of the local community hospitals when deciding on empiric therapy. Fully immu- nized infants or school-aged children hospitalized withCAP must be empirically prescribed an antibiotic regi-men that provides coverage for S pneumoniae using am- picillin or penicillin G (if no signi cant local resistant strains in community data). Ampicillin- sulbactam provides additional coverage against Hi n fluenzae, M catarrhalis, or methicillin-sensitive Sa u r e u s (MSSA). The currently available intravenous formulations ofampicillin-sulbactam do not permit ampicillin(300-400 mg/kg pneumococci with highampicillin mean inhibitory concentration is suspected.If this dose is desired, a com bination of at 300 and regular ampicillin at 100 to 200 mg/kg daily is a recommended regimen. The alternative is third-generation cephalos porin (ceftriaxone at 100 mg/kg daily or cefotaxime at 200 mg/kg daily) used in infantsand children who are not fully immunized, in regions withhigh rates of invasive penicillin-resistant pneumococcalstrains, and in infants and children with severe life-threateninginfections and/or pneumonia complications, such as em-pyema. In patients with suspected M pneumoniae orC pneumoniae , the addition of an macro- lide to empiric cephalosporin or b-lactam antibiotic should be considered. In hospitalized patients with othercomorbidities or clinical or radiographic ndings sugges- tive of S aureus , vancomycin, linezolid, or clindamycin should be added to the regimen (Table 7). (16) Ceftaro-line, a fth-generation cephalosporin, may provide an at- tractive alternative in those patients with complicated pneumonia. Ceftaroline does not yet have an indication in pediatrics hence, data on dosing is limited. Ceftarolineis the rst cephalosporin with proven ef cacy against Sa u - reusexpressing the penicillin-binding protein PBP2a and pneumococci expressing PBP2x. Even though ceftarolineis indicated for use, it has not been approved for treatinglung infections due to MRSA, but it is indicated for MSSA.There is no evidence that chest physiotherapy plays a ben- ecial role in the management of pneumonia or leads to a decrease in the length of stay or a change in the outcome. (27) Complicated pneumonia (eg, parapneumonic effusion, lung abscess) is an indication for hospitalization. The an-tibiotic choice in these patients must provide a broadercoverage for b-lactam resistant bacteria and CA-MRSA. In addition, coverage for anaerobes must be provided in children with lung abscess or aspiration pneumonia until as p e c i c etiologic agent is identi ed.Table 6.

When a bac- terial pathogen is identi ed on blood or pleural fluid cultures, sus- ceptibility testing should guide the antibiotic choice (Table 8). The treatment regimen for un- complicated cases must be contin-ued for a total of 7 to 10 days(parenteral and oral therapy). In hospitalized cases whose baseline inflammatory markers are checked, some centers recommend continu-ing antibiotics until the erythrocytesedimentation rate falls below 20mm/h. Longer antibiotic regimenis recommended in complicatedcases, starting parenterally and con- tinuing orally. Suggested antibiotic courses are 4 weeks total or 2 weeksafter defervescence and clinicalimprovement. Children receiving adequate an- tibiotic coverage for 48 to 72 hourswithout clinical improvement orwith deterioration of clinical picture should undergo further investigation to rule out alternative diagnosis (for- eign body), antibiotic resistance, or complicated pneu-monia. (16) Children with allergy to b-lactams become a therapeu- tic challenge. History is essential in this situation becausemany children whose parents report penicillin allergy arenot necessarily truly allergic. If real allergy is suspected,options are carbapenems (meropenem, 20-40 mg/kg per dose every 8 hours), which rarely cross react with penicillins or cephalosporins, or clindamycin (even inhospitals with reported clindamycin resistance >30% on antibiograms), or combination of antibiotics, or linezolid plus aztreonam. Quinolonessuch as levo cover most respiratory patho- gens that cause pyogenic and walking pneumonia. Complications and Sequelae Children with pneumonia might experience several com-plications. (7)(13)The complications are more likelydue to bacterial pneumonias than atypical or viral pneu-monias. The rate of complications in hospitalized chil-dren with pneumococcal pneumonia is estimated at40% to 50%. Patients with chronic illness or comorbid conditions are more subject to complications that result in increasedlength of stay. Prolonged or persistent fever or worseningof symptoms despite adequate antibiotic coverage ina child is suspect for complications. Table 9 lists the com-plications of pneumonias Necrotizing pneumonia is suspected when a translu- cent lesion is seen on chest radiography in a child withprolonged fever or septic appearance. Diagnosis is con-rmed with contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Most necrotizing pneumoniae in pediatrics are caused by Table 7.

Pneumatoceles are frequently encountered, and radiologic c ure lags behind clinical cure. Lung abscess presents with nonspeci c clinical signs and symptoms similar to those of pneumonia. It has an indolent course and is often associated with a parapneu-monic effusion. Lung abscesses may occur in healthy chil-dren or may be secondary to a congenital (cysticmalformation) or acquired (cystic brosis, immunode - (25) Up to 90% of cases mightbe adequately treated with a prolonged course of intrave-nous antibiotics. Parapneumonic effusion can be in the form of pleural effusion or empyema. The pleural fluid analysis allows dif- ferentiating one from the other (Table 5). Empyemais a pleural effusion that has become purulent orsemipurulent.Treatment The effectiveness of treating pleural effusion and empyema in children and teens is unknown because there is a lack of well-designedcontrolled studies. Traditionally, pleural fluid is obtained by needle aspiration for culture, and antibiotic therapy isstarted. Further chest tube drainage is resorted to if there is no improvement or the patient 's condition worsens. In severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary.

(Both have been found to be equally effective and associated with decreased morbidity.) The choice of drain-age procedure depends on lo-cal expertise. Either VATS oropen chest debridement withdecortication is indicated in a pa-tient who continues to havemoderate to large effusions and respiratory compromise despite 2 to 3 days of chest tube and - brinolysis. Decortication is asso-ciated with higher morbidityrates. A chest tube that demon-strates lack of intrathoracic airleak and less than 1 ml/kg dailyduring the past 12 hour drainage can be clamped or removed. Fibrinolytics are used along with chest tube placement for moderate to large effusions. The initial dose ofbrinolytics is administered at the time of chest tube placement with a \"dwell\" time, during which the chest tube is clamped, beforeapplying suction to the tube. In var-ious studies, the dwell time variedbetween 1 and 4 hours with a repeatadministration of brinolytics any- where from every 8, 12, or 24 hourslater. On the basis of the currentlyavailable data, both chest tubewith brinolysis and VATS are con- sidered equally acceptable initialTable 9.

(16) Additional imaging and further investigation to assess effusion progression are indicated for the child not re- sponding to broad-spectrum therapy after 48 to 72 hoursto assess progression of the effusion. For children receiv-ing mechanical ventilatory support with no improvement,BAL or a percutaneous lung aspirate should be performedfor culture to determine antibiotic resistance. An open lung biopsy for a Gram stain and culture should be obtained in the persistently and critically ill child receiving mechanical ventilatory support in whom p revious investigations have not yielded a microbiologic diagnosis. (16) Lung Abscess Up to 90% of patients with a lung abscess may be ade-quately treated with intravenous antibiotics alone or withcombination of intravenous antibiotics transitioning to oralantibiotics without requiring drainage of the abscess. (2) Discharge Criteria Children hospitalized with pneumonia are eligible for dis-charge when they demonstrate any of the following (Ta-ble 10) (15): \u0081Clinical improvement in level of activity and appetite, with a decreased fever for at least 12 to 24 hours. \u0081Sustained pulse oximetry measurements greater than 90% in room air for at least 12 to 24 hours.\u0081Stable and/or baseline mental and cardiorespiratory status. \u0081Ability to tolerate their home antiinfective regimen, and thecaretaker at home has the abilityto administer therapy. \u0081Ability to maintain adequatefluid and nutrition orally. In addition, children hospitalized with pneumonia eligible for discharge: \u0081Who have had a chest tube and meet the requirements listedabove, the chest tube must havebeen discontinued 12 to 24hours before discharge with noclinical evidence of deterioration since chest tube removal \u0081Must have a follow-up plan prior to discharge. Follow-up Children hospitalized with pneumonia must follow upwith their primary care physician soon after dischargeto ensure continued improvement and adherence withthe antibiotic regimen prescribed. It is important to dis-cuss with caretakers that cough may persist for severalweeks to 4 months after a CAP and 3 to 4 months afterviral pneumonia or pertussis. Recovering children may continue to have moderate dyspnea on exertion for 2 to 3 months. Special Considerations Immunodeciency Children and young adults who are immunocompro-mised secondary to congenital or acquired immunode - ciency require special considerations in their treatment regimen in addition to coverage for the typical pathogens discussed in the normal host (2): \u0081Gram-negative bacilli (including Pseudomonas aerugi- nosa) and S aureus are common causes in neutropenic patients or in patients with white blood cell defects. \u0081History of exposure to an aquatic reservoir of Legionella pneumophila, such as a river, lake, air-conditioning tower, or water distribution system, places the patient at risk for legionellosis. \u0081Opportunistic fungi, such as Aspergillus andCandida, are the most common fungal pathogens in immuno- compromised patients. Aspergillus affects the lungs spore inhalation.Table 9.

(21) The treatment of HIV-infected children depends on their CD4 cell count. Most children in the UnitedStates bene t now from antiretrovirals and have nor- mal immune status so their treatment parallels thosewithout HIV infection. Those children whose CD4cell count is low are at risk of unusual pathogens, suchasPneumocystis jirovecii or cryptococcus; consulting with an infectious disease specialist is recommended.(28) Cystic Fibrosis Pneumonia in patients with cystic brosis is caused by in- fection by S aureus ,P aeruginosa, and Hi n fluenzae (mostly nontypable strains) early in their disease. Olderchildren with cystic brosis bacteria also may also cause disease in this population.These patients rarely get rid of their bacteria, so reviewingprevious cultures is very important.Sickle Cell In patients with sickle cell anemia who present with fever,hypoxia, and respiratory distress due to acute chest syn-drome, atypical bacterial pathogens are primarily the cul-prits. Other causes include S pneumoniae ,S aureus , and Hi nfluenzae . Other special considerations for therapy include the following: \u0081Residence or travel to certain geographic areas that are endemic for speci c pathogens, such as tuberculosis (Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe),or exposure to individuals at high risk for tuberculosis, including homeless, incarcerated individuals, and HIV-infected patients. \u0081Exposure to certain animals such as the deer mouse(hantavirus), bird droppings (Histoplasmosis), birds(Chlamydophila ( Coxiella burnetii -Q fever) Prevention and/or Control The most effective prevention method based on strongevidence is active immunization of children againstHi nfluenzae type b, S pneumoniae ,i nfluenza, and per- tussis. In fluenza virus vaccine should be administered an- nually to all infants 6 months or older and to adultcaretakers of infants younger than 6 months. The latter should also receive the pertussis vaccine. High-risk infants should receive the RSV-speci c monoclonal antibody - based on the American Academy of Pediatrics recom-mendation. (4)(16) Several measures can be adoptedto prevent or decrease transmission. Because transmissionoccurs by droplet or contact, good hand washing andgood personal hygiene are the most important measures.Standard isolation precaution is required in hospitalized patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and negative iso- lation in patients with TB. Other measures include limit-ing exposure to infected individuals and to cigarettesmoke. Additional infection control measures based oncause include the following: \u0081Respiratory syncytial and parain fluenza viruses -gown and gloves (ie, contact precautions). \u0081Influenza virus, group A Streptococcus (for the rst 24 hours of treatment), MSSA, Bordetella pertussis (until pa- tient has received 5 days of effective therapy), and M pneumoniae -mask within 3 ft (ie, droplet precautions). \u0081Adenovirus -contact droplet precautions. \u0081Methicillin-resistant S aureus contact and droplet precautions and dedi- cated patient equipment.Table 10.

(16) On the basis of strong evidence, infants younger than 3 months with suspected bacterial pneumonia will likely benet from hospitalization. Moderate evidence indicates that blood cultures should not be routinely performed in a child older than 3 to 6 months with suspected CAP who is fully immunized, who has nontoxic effects, and who is a candidate for outpatient management. On the basis of moderate evidence, blood cultures may recover the causative organism in children hospitalized with severe pneumonia, in those who do not demonstrate clinical response despite adequateantibiotic coverage, or in children with complicated pneumonia. On the basis of moderate evidence, fever and tachypnea are the most sensitive clinical signs of pneumonia, particularly after the rst 3 days of illness On the basis of strong evidence, oral antibiotics are as effective as intravenous antibiotics in the treatmentof mild-moderate CAP.
