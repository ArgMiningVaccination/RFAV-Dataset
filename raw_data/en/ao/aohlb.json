Unlike plants, which they were originally t hought to be, they lack chlorophyll and therefore must derive their energy (nutrition) from other organisms, either liv e (parasitic) or dead (saprophytic). However, Fungi are more advanced than Bacteria, as they have nuclei and organelles within their cells (eukaryotic vs. proka ryotic). Bacteria and fungi were here before us, and evolut ion determined that it would be best for us to carry a farm of bacteria and fungi within us, to harness their abil ities. They defend us against other more harmful critters, and produce compounds such as vitamin K2, B12, B3 and others. In fact, we carry as much as three pounds of these critters of up to 400 different species within our lower intestines. Of the trillions of cells that make up our body, only 10% are us, while they are 90%! So, rather than us using them, they are using us as a home , transport and feeding device! While the first reaction to this fact might be \"ee ewww\", upon further examination, some of the greatest accomplishments of civilization are based on utiliz ing these critters. Bread, beer, wine and coffee could not b e made without the fermentation caused by their biochemica l machinery. Antibiotic-producing molds, formally discovered by Alexander Fleming 1928 (actually by E rnest Duchenne in 1897, and over 2500 years ago by the Chinese and Egyptians) have enabled us to live long er lives. Death by overwhelming infection, of childre n, mothers, surgical patients, and trauma victims prio r to the 1900's was quite common. Prior to penicillin, the only anti- bacterial agents used were toxic chemicals such as arsenic and others (see below) which caused huge damage whi le doing their job. Penicillin was truly miraculous b y doing its magic without causing damage. In fact, this effect was so amazing, that it insta ntly hoisted allopathic medicine over other professions such as homeopathy and herbalism. To this day, we carry ar ound a hope that no matter what we do, there will be a \" magic bullet\" that will solve our problems. In fact, the term \"magic bullet\" was coined by Nobel-prize winning German sc ientist Paul Erlich to refer to chemical agents that specif ically target bacteria without causing damage to the host 1. Yeast and Bacteria in the Twenty-First Century However, the quest for the magic bullet has its do wn- sides, as we are learning today. Bacteria in hospi tals develop antibiotic resistance, and are now getting into the community (such as drug-resistant tuberculosis and MRSA). Also, by taking antibiotics, we kill off th e good bacteria within our gut, which changes the balance of organisms (ecology), to from 90% good-10% bad to 10 -90, a condition called dysbiosis . These \"bad\" bacteria, cannot keep naturally occurring yeasts such as Candida albicans under control. These bad bacteria and yeast then p roduce toxins which damage the lining of the gut, and make it permeable to compounds that it is normally designed to keep out of the body, a condition called leaky gut syndrome . The toxicity of leaky gut can then lead to a hos t of dysfunctions--of the immune, hormonal and mind-b ody systems, the gastro-intestinal system itself, the l iver, as well as other conditions. Symptoms of Yeast Dysbiosis Immune dysfunction usually manifests as progressively increasing allergies, autoimmune disease (Hashimoto 's thyroiditis, colitis and rheumatoid arthritis as ex amples), and poor resistance to common infections such as sinusitis, upper respiratory infections, yeast infe ctions of the skin, nails and genitals, and perhaps cancer. Hormonal dysfunction can manifest as PMS, endometriosis, infertility, accelerated peri-menopause, adrenal fatigue, hypoglycemia and pre-diabetes, to name a few. Mind -body dysfunction can manifest as mental fog, irritability, anxiety, depression, ADD, autism, seizures and other neuro- developmental problems in children. These often fa il to respond to conventional drugs and talk therapy, as the root cause is not addressed. Gastro-intestinal dysfunct ion can look like chronic constipation or diarrhea, IBS (ir ritable bowel syndrome), GERD (gastro-intestinal reflux dis ease), and various malabsorption conditions. Other associ ated conditions include pelvic floor dysfunction, interstitial cystitis (ICS), fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue sy ndromes, elevated cholesterol and C-reactive protein, painfu l muscles, arthritis-like symptoms, acne, and feeling sick when the liver cannot keep up with the load of toxi ns. Sometimes there are no obvious signs of yeast infection, such as involvement of the feet, toenails, genitals , or skin, but the persistence of symptoms raises the question . Evaluation of Yeast Presence There are no reliable conventional tests to prove the yeast syndrome, as all of us carry some in our bowe ls and have antibodies to yeast in our blood. However, there is one best test for \"invasive\" candidiasis. When yeast is under control, it is co ntained in the bowel and produces minimal evidence of its pres ence. However, in the case of leaky gut, a specific produ ct of yeast metabolism called d-arabinitol passes through the lining of the gut, into the bloodstream, through th e kidneys, and into the urine. If there is a significant amou nt of this marker in the urine, it is a reliable measure of in vasiveness. If the presence of invasive yeast is clear, such a s a case of a nursing mother with vaginal yeast which s preads to her breast and her baby's mouth (\"thrush\"), then such a test is not necessary. However, if a patient has p ersistent symptoms despite treatment of other causes, looking for the yeast marker can be very important. At the sam e time, the urine can be examined for markers of good and b ad bacteria, assessing the overall ecology of the gut. Strategies for the Treatment of Yeast Holistic medicine, which approaches illness multi- dimensionally, lends well to healing the yeast synd rome. Unfortunately, too many patients are placed on exce ssively restrictive \"yeast free\" diets for long periods of time, or are given multiple courses of drugs and unnecessary supplements in their quest for healing. Many patie nts, from the very young to the very old, are treated for oth er chronic conditions, with limited success, when the presence of yeast is totally overlooked. Of the many strategies that can be used to heal fr om yeast overgrowth, no specific \"protocol\" can apply to all people. For example, someone with a stressful job, poor 1/24/09-15 yeast_al.wpf \"Yeast & Candida\" M Cheikin MD Page 2 sleep, taking the birth control pill, chronic const ipation, heavy metal toxicity and nutritional deficiency may need these issues addressed before healing of yeast can begin. 1. Anti-yeast diets . In general, these are diets that restrict the carbohydrates that feed the yeast and bad bacteria. Often, this is not a sufficient strategy because the minute the diet is stopped, the yeast tends to retu rn. However, if combined with other strategies, it can be helpful. In addition, specific toxins in our diet, such as the antibiotics in conventional animal products, includ ing farm- raised fish, and even the chlorine in our drinking water can kill off the good bacteria that we are trying to gr ow. So, the healing diet requires more than carbohydrate restri ction. 2. Beneficial yeast. One of the simplest and often effective strategies is to take \"pro-biotic\" yeast, similar to the bacterial pro-biotics in yogurt. This good yea st, a cousin of the yeast used to make beer, helps push o ut bad yeast and bacteria. Due to its safety, it has been effectively used for young children. It has been effective in dozens of cases of intractable diarrhea, constipation, coliti s and IBS. 3. Stomach acid and enzymes. One of the causes of yeast (and bacterial) dysbiosis is a lack of stomac h acid. As discussed in a prior article, the stomach is sup posed to be extremely acidic. This helps defend against inv asion by yeast and bacteria entering through the mouth. If this acid is blocked by drugs, stress or other conditions, th ese critters can enter our GI tract and populate our st omach (H Pylori, the ulcer-causing bacteria), small intestin es (the upper small intestines is not supposed to host bact eria), and other places such as the gallbladder. Also, without acid, the enzymes of the stomach and pancreas do not work properly. Without enzymes, ou r foods are improperly digested, which may cause food intolerance, allergy, and the malabsorption of spec ific nutrients. Furthermore, these improperly digested foods, especially the carbohydrates, feed the bacteria and yeast in the colon and cause overgrowth, leading to dysbi osis as discussed above. 4. Specific anti-yeast supplements. There are several supplements that can kill or weaken yeast. These i nclude oregano oil, berberine, undecylenic acid, garlic, s pecific enzymes, and others. For persistent vaginal yeast and sinus infections, these agents can be applied topic ally. Killing yeast too fast can cause a \"die-off reactio n\", where the products from the dying yeast cause a toxic rea ction. Therefore, it is best to add these products in the right sequence. 5. Anti-yeast drugs. The big gun of treatment is to use anti-yeast drugs. The general experience, however, is that yeast will return if other strategies aren't used t o prevent re- growth once the drugs are finished. Also, most of these drugs are toxic to the liver. So again, if used, t hey should be used as part of a strategic sequence. 6. Treating co-existing conditions. The yeast syndrome often co-exists with adrenal fatigue, thyr oid dysfunction, nutritional deficiency, chronic stress , and other conditions. In a holistic fashion, all should be w orked on together utilizing a balanced program. 7. Energy medicine techniques . While the most subtle, energy techniques such as acupuncture, yoga, and Ne uro- Modulation Technique can facilitate healing in a ge ntle manner. These techniques can enhance immune functi on, gastro-intestinal function, hormonal balance, sleep , emotional balance and other processes that are nece ssary to achieve a root-cause, long-lasting healing. The Garden of the Gut The importance of gut function and its pervasive effects on virtually every function of the body was well known by Hippocrates, as well as the ancients who developed Chinese and Ayurvedic Medicine. Thinking of the gut as a garden and yeast as weeds reminds us t hat we have to constantly do \"spot weeding\" (occasional ly using special supplements), add mulch and other age nts (such as probiotics), and to do seasonal clean-ups (such as periodic elimination/ detox diets). Using such a holistic approach is effective and long-lasting for people o f all ages.
