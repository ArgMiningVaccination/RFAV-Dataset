Smith, MD, MPH, is an attending physician at Seattle Children's and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine. Dr. Smith is a graduate of McGill University Medical School and Pediatric Residency. She graduated from our fellowship program with a MPH degree in 2002 and is Medical Co-Director of the Kidney Transplantation Program. This year she will also be going to outreach clinics in Alaska. Her research focuses on viral complications in solid organ transplantation - both those with clinical manifestations and more occult infections associated with allograft dysfunction. Results of a major prospective study report her findings that subclinical CMV and EBV infections are associated with decreased long-term renal allograft function in pediatric renal transplant recipients. Her ongoing research focuses on mechanisms of virus-induced allograft dysfunction. Dr. Smith's research has a translational link, as it takes advantage of novel clinical diagnostics to survey for viruses (her primary K23 mentor was Dr. Corey, Head of the Virology Division in the UW Department of Laboratory Medicine) and donor-specific antibodies using solid-phase assays (with Dr. Karen Nelson of the Puget Sound Blood Center). Her research has also been funded by grants from the National Kidney Foundation, the American Society of Transplantation and Roche. Dr. Smith is also an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Washington School of Public Health and has been actively involved in mentoring all of the pediatric nephrology trainees in the clinical research pathway. - - Throughout the years of my daughter Samantha's life, we dealt with many pediatric specialists on a daily basis. Beings that we had this vast experience with so many pediatric specialists, I can tell you that Dr. Jodi Smith is a one of a kind treasure that is needed in the medical profession. She is kind, sweet, knowledgeable in her expertise, and has an amazing bedside manner. Dr. Smith listens to the patient and the patient's family, something that can be a rare commodity in the hospital world. She truly is someone you want in your amazing child's corner... Thank you Dr. Jodi Smith for all you do. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2022 Seattle Magazine 2022 Seattle Top Doctor - 2019 Seattle Magazine 2019 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR -
