Gorski, MD, FACOG]In Town Hall meetings across the country during the past two years, people voiced a number of concerns about access of the public to Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) practitioners and products. Issues raised include access to qualified CAM practitioners, state regulation of CAM practitioners, integration of CAM and conventional health care, collaboration between CAM and conventional practitioners, and the cost of CAM services. Many people who testified, including those who have only limited access to \"basic health care,\" expressed a desire for increased access to safe and effective CAM, along with conventional services. As is true for conventional health care, many factors influence access to CAM services and their delivery. The distribution and availability of local providers, regulation and credentialing of providers, policies concerning coverage and reimbursement, and characteristics of the health care delivery system all affect the quality and availability of care and consumer satisfaction. Equally important, access is limited by income, since most CAM practices and products are not covered under public or private health insurance programs. As with conventional care, access to CAM is more problematic for rural, uninsured, underinsured, and other special populations. The issue of access is further compounded by lack of scientific evidence regarding safety and effectiveness of many CAM practices and products. [Thereb is no reason to be concerned about access limitations unless practices and products have been proven to be safe and effective.] A better understanding of how the public uses CAM is needed in order to determine what can be done to improve access to safe and effective CAM within the context of other public health and medical needs. In addition, more information is needed on what constitutes \"appropriate access\" to CAM services. [This falsely implies that there are many safe and effective \"CAM methods\" and that more access to them is needed and that access to them should be increased.] Most CAM practices have developed independently of the conventional health care system and are not uniformly regulated by the states or the Federal government. A variety of market mechanisms and other arrangements have developed to pay for these services, including out-of-pocket payments, discounted fees, insurance reimbursement, and donated services. Where the public has had access to CAM services it has often been with little assurance of safety, quality, or efficacy. [That is correct. It is not possible to \"assure efficacy\" without scientific data that something works.] Moreover, because most consumers have had to pay for CAM services directly, access often has been limited to those with higher discretionary income [1] An overview of insurance coverage and reimbursement for CAM is presented in Chapter 7. As interest in CAM grows and as CAM increasingly enters the mainstream of American health care, mechanisms that worked in the past to help ensure safety and quality may no longer be adequate. For example, if CAM practices become eligible for reimbursement through the health insurance system, issues that now confront the conventional health care system \u2014 including safety, fraud, and practitioner malpractice or incompetence \u2014 will need to be addressed for CAM. In addition, if private health insurance reimbursement for CAM services increases, questions of equity arise for beneficiaries of Federal \u2014 and state- sponsored health care programs, the underinsured, and uninsured. [This passage has things backward. Issued of \"safety, fraud, and practitioner malpractice or incompetence\" should be resolved before methods are covered, not afterward.] Some people believe that existing practice structures have worked well for those who use CAM and that no further action is required. But market demand for CAM is already reshaping the dynamics of health care delivery, requiring that some issues be addressed. For example, insurers and managed care plans are offering CAM options more frequently, and integrated medical clinics and private practices are spreading. [It is unclear whether the \"shaping\" is the result of market demand or by the wishful thinking of executives who think that offering \"CAM\" services will make them more marketable.] As more evidence is published on the safety and effectiveness of CAM practices, they are more likely to be incorporated into health care treatment protocols. [How can the Commission possibly know whether research will cause them to be more accepted or less accepted?] Now is the time to look at policy options for the future and to design strategies for addressing potential issues of access and safety. Beyond these basic concerns, protecting the public, maintaining free competition in the provision of CAM services, and maintaining the consumer's freedom to choose appropriate health professionals are issues to be considered when developing strategies and policies. [Consumers are free to choose whatever they want as long as they pay for it themselves.] Moreover, the need to maintain CAM styles of practice, rather than allowing them to be subsumed into the conventional medical model, also must be considered when addressing these issues. [The Commission does not define \"CAM styles of practice\" but implies that they are superior to conventional styles.] If approached with both imagination and caution, the policy planning process could not only address these issues more effectively, but also a broader set of health issues affecting the nation, such as whether access to safe and effective CAM services can: - Benefit vulnerable populations including those with chronic diseases, the terminally ill, and other populations with special needs; - Lower health care costs and possibly increase access to conventional health care services for some segments of the population, such as the chronically and terminally ill; and, - Help solve issues of equity and quality that do not set up a zero-sum struggle over limited resources. The present state of evidence concerning the safety and effectiveness of various CAM practices precludes any final assessment of their contributions to and limitations in addressing these broader health issues. The process of gathering evidence is on-going, however, and as evidence increases concerning ways that various CAM approaches do or do not affect health, processes of living and dying, and costs for other care, access to and delivery of some CAM practices and services are likely to become more pressing public policy issues. [This falsely assumes that research will eventually demonstrate that many \"CAM\" practices are beneficial. As usual, the Commission does not consider the fact that research could also demonstrate that they don't work.] Meanwhile, public interest in CAM, and the market dynamics that have evolved in response to it, have brought issues of access to the forefront. Policy-makers should begin to address these issues and examine the implications of different kinds of policy for consumers and practitioners, for clinics, hospitals and other organizational settings where health care is now delivered, and for the system as a whole. [This puts the cart before the horse. Before considering whether additional access is needed, there must be evidence that something works.] CAM Practitioners and Public Safety The public has expressed interest in maintaining easy access to CAM practitioners and in having sufficient information about them to make informed choices. [The public also favors motherhood and apple pie.] Perceptions of the relative importance of being able to take responsibility for one's own health and health decisions, yet be protected from incompetent practitioners, underlie differences in consumers' response to possible state or Federal regulation of CAM. Public sentiment on the need for and degree of regulation ranges, with some calling for more regulation of CAM, to others who are opposed to any regulation. The Commission recognizes that Americans want to be able to choose from both conventional and CAM practices and that they want assurances that practitioners are qualified. [There is an inherent conflict between freedom to choose and the need ro be protected.] CAM practitioners have raised additional issues that are important to the public because they affect freedom of access to CAM providers. Some health care practitioners, both CAM and conventional, are concerned about liability and prosecution if the services they provide are not commonly accepted within conventional medical practice. Another concern of some CAM professionals is that they are licensed to practice in some states but not others, and that even where licensed, their scope of practice may vary across the country. [The extent to which unqualified pracitioners can practice depends on their ability to persaude state legislators to legalize what they do.] While some CAM professions endorse licensure requirements in order to participate fully in the health care delivery system, several people testified that licensure is not feasible for some categories of CAM practitioners, such as Native American and other traditional healers. Some CAM practitioners consider their disciplines to be educational (Alexander Technique) or spiritual (Reiki) and have expressed concerns about being licensed as health professionals. Some conventional health care practitioners who incorporate CAM modalities into their practices want to broaden the scope of practice laws to allow these modalities to be used. Establishing legal authority to practice requires states to establish standards of practice, including training, education and continuing education requirements, as well as scope of practice. Some CAM professionals believe that to reorganize CAM on the conventional professional model, with the kind of licensure, registration, or exemption procedures that this implies, will damage the fundamental character of much of CAM. Some believe that in the past, legislation to \"protect the public\" was often used to restrict competition in the provision of services. Five important issues of access and delivery concern both the public and practitioners: - Protecting the public from the inappropriate practice of health care, - Providing opportunities for appropriately trained and qualified health practitioners to offer the full range of services in which they are trained and competent, - Maintaining competition in the provision of CAM and other health services, - Preserving CAM styles and traditions that have been valued by both practitioners and consumers, and - Determining the extent of the public's choice among health care modalities. If addressed separately, these concerns can lead to very different public policies, and state legislation that affects access to CAM practices varies in its emphasis on these concerns. Therefore, when developing strategies to address problems of access to CAM practitioners, all of these criteria should be considered. Evaluating State Approaches Legislative and regulatory policies that affect conventional and CAM practitioners fall largely under the aegis of state governments, primarily through regulation of practice. In recent years, a few states have passed legislation and enacted regulations that affect access to CAM practitioners. These regulations provide a natural experiment for solutions to access and delivery of CAM. If properly documented and evaluated, these ventures could provide information that may guide other states and the Federal government in future policy development. [True, but the history of such boards suggests that they do almost nothing to protect the public.] Minnesota provides almost unlimited freedom to practice. Unlicensed practitioners must inform clients of their education, experience, and intended treatments, as well as possible side effects or known risks of the treatments. Clients must sign an informed consent statement acknowledging the practitioner is unlicensed, that complaints may be filed with the Minnesota Department of Health if treatment is unsatisfactory, and that they have the right to seek licensed care at any time. Requirements for practice are minimal, but practitioners are not exempted from liability for untoward outcomes. Licensed health professionals also may provide CAM services, as long as their provision of the services is consistent with regulations governing their licensure. In short, the Minnesota law preserves maximum freedom for CAM practitioners and consumers and relies primarily upon informed consent for protection of health care consumers. In contrast, Washington provides licensure, registration, or exemption for various categories of CAM professionals, based on their education and the extent to which their profession prepares practitioners to assume responsibility for the total health care of clients. Regulations delineate standards of practice, the scope of practice allowable, education and training requirements for licensure, registration, or exemption, and required professional oversight. Four CAM professional groups (naturopathic physicians, acupuncturists, massage therapists, and chiropractors) are licensed and regulated. The emphasis in Minnesota is placed on granting all CAM professionals the freedom to practice with minimal restrictions, while holding them accountable for outcomes. The Washington law emphasizes licensure as the route to protecting consumers and the practice rights of some CAM professionals. The Minnesota law preserves the range of CAM practices without distinguishing among them, whereas the Washington law requires CAM practitioners to fit into a professional model in order to receive the rights and responsibilities granted conventional health care professions. [Neither approach offers much public protection because irrational practices are so deeply ingrained in these practices that the boards are rarely inclined to attempt to stop them.] Other states vary considerably in their regulatory approaches to licensure and scope of practice. For example, chiropractors are licensed in all states, while acupuncturists, massage therapists, and naturopathic physicians are licensed in 40, 30, and 11 states, respectively. (Table 1 shows the distribution of CAM specialties by state.) These variations affect access to and delivery of CAM by limiting practitioners' ability to practice lawfully and to obtain malpractice insurance. On the Federal level, several bills have been introduced into recent sessions of Congress that could affect access to CAM, including some that allow greater latitude for unconventional treatments. Any Federal legislation drafted in the future should consider the experience states are acquiring through their various legislative initiatives. A number of factors should be studied when evaluating state models of creating access and delivery and protecting the public. Health services research should document how different legal frameworks affect access to CAM and how this different access affects health outcomes. Other issues to be considered include how state regulations affect the supply and distribution of various CAM practices and practitioners over time, as well as competition and costs of services. Also important are the effects of different regulatory models on the safety of the population, problems that may arise from use of different models, and the impact on conventional health care practitioners. Changes in the amount of time and quality of interaction with consumers of CAM services might also be assessed through periodic surveys. [It is unclear how a survey could be used to evaluate quality of care. Consumer satisfaction can be surveyed, but that is not a reliable indicator of quality of care.] As evidence becomes available about the impact each regulatory model is having, the lessons learned can help inform choices that other states and the Federal government will be making. Authority to practice has real impact on access to and delivery of services. The Department of Health and Human Services should gather and assess information about effects of these laws on the public's health as well as on access to CAM and CAM practitioners. Recommendation 18: The Department of Health and Human Services should evaluate current barriers to consumer access to safe and effective CAM practices and to qualified practitioners and should develop strategies for removing those barriers in order to increase access and to ensure accountability. Actions |18.1||The Department of Health and Human Services should assist the States in evaluating the impact of legislation enacted by various States on access to CAM practices and on public safety. [How useful this would be would depends on whether it is done properly.]| |18.2||The Department of Health and Human Services and other appropriate Federal agencies should use health care workforce data, data from national surveys on use of CAM, regional public health reports on CAM activities and other studies to identify current and future health care needs and the relevance of safe and effective CAM services for helping address these needs. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe and effective \"CAM\" activities. No data can identify a \"need\" for \"CAM\" products or services that have not been proven safe and effective.]| Regulatory Frameworks States, in exercising their authority over health care practitioners, should consider where a regulatory infrastructure for CAM practitioners might be necessary in order to promote quality of care and patient safety. The primary mechanisms used by states to regulate health care practitioners are: - Mandatory Licensure, which prohibits the practice of a profession without a license. Licensure denotes a high degree of professional development, including consensus within the profession concerning standards of education, training, and practice, and the ability to self-regulate. - Title Licensure, which permits anyone to practice the modality, but allows only those granted a license to use the title. A demonstrable level of skill or training normally is required for title licensure. - Registration, which is granted in some states to professionals such as dieticians and pharmacists upon completion of required training and exams, is in other states simply a requirement that a provider register his or her name, address, and training with a designated state agency. This type of registration prohibits non-registered individuals from practicing and gives the agency authority to receive consumer complaints and revoke registrations. - Exemption, which accords special status to religious healers. Medical licensing statutes do not apply to these healers, provided they practice within the tenets of a recognized church. State and Federal policy-makers and others with an interest in these issues should recognize three unique challenges that face regulation of CAM practitioners. First, views vary among CAM practitioners regarding how much training should be required for licensure in any given field, the extent to which such training should be required for licensure, and whether and how such education and training can incorporate intuitive skills and individualized approaches to providing health care services. [This falsely assumes that \"CAM\" services are individualized. Many \"CAM\" practitioners treat everyone the same way.] For many CAM providers, licensure presents a tension between the desire to increase standardization of CAM education, training, and practices across states and the desire to keep CAM practice flexible, non-standardized, and linked to subjective, interpersonal and intuitive aspects of care. [What should count is whether they offer valuable services, which most do not.] While increased licensure of CAM may help facilitate research, ease referrals, enhance patient access, and increase consumer protection, it may decrease individualization of services, time spent per patient, and range of patient options, qualities of CAM practice valued by practitioners and patients alike. [This paragraph is absolute baloney. Our laws should be designed to protect people from practitioners who are not qualified to diagnose or treat disease. Most people who offer \"CAM\" services are not qualified to do either.] Second, variation in what constitutes \"CAM\" makes any assessment of CAM as value-added services difficult. Disagreement also surrounds the nature and scope of various CAM professions. [Defining one's scope requires scientific evidence of effectivess.] In 2001, the University of California, San Francisco Center for Health Professions published a report that addresses this issue [2]. Questions it raised include: How does the profession describe itself in terms of the types of care it provides, and the types of care that are beyond its professional scope? Are there differences of opinion within the profession about the range of care that is appropriate for the profession to provide? What interventions and modalities does the profession use? Answers to these questions will help define the various CAM professions. A third, related concern involves the confusion and potential legal consequences that arise from the overlap of approaches and techniques used by CAM practitioners. For example, some states include homeopathy and acupuncture within the definition of the practice scopes for naturopathy or chiropractic, whereas others do not. Practitioners from states with a broad scope of practice who move to states with a more limited one may be unsure whether they risk state censure by providing these services. Confusion and legal risk can occur within a state if the legal authority to practice is not well defined or lacks clarity as to boundaries for practice. The potential for liability creates fear and uncertainty for some CAM practitioners. All providers, CAM and conventional, can be prosecuted if they are considered to have exceeded their scope of practice. [Generally speaking, licensing laws are far too liberal and insufficiently enforced to protect the public against irrational practices.] To address some of these issues the Pew Health Professions Commission, established in 1989, conducted an in-depth study of reform in the regulation of health care practitioners. They recognized that health care workforce reform would necessitate regulatory reform and created a task force to propose new approaches that would better serve the public's interest. In 1995, they published 10 recommendations for regulatory reform and offered policy options, hoping to stimulate debate and discussion by states [3]. The recommendations focus primarily on regulation of conventional health care practitioners but they are applicable to CAM practitioners as well. Recommendations from the Pew Commission Taskforce are in [Appendix B](https://www.quackwatch.org/07PoliticalActivities/WHC/b.html). [Strengthening state regulation of practitioners is a good idea, but if competency standards were uniformly raised, the professions of acupuncture, chiropractic, and naturopathy would be decimated, and no other \"CAM\" practitioners would be permitted to practice independently.] Recommendation 19: The Federal Government should offer assistance to states and professional organizations in 1) developing and evaluating guidelines for practitioner accountability and competence in CAM delivery, including regulation of practice, and 2) periodic review and assessment of the effects of regulations on consumer protection. Actions |19.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should create a policy advisory committee, including CAM and conventional practitioners and representatives of the public, to address issues related to providing access to qualified CAM practitioners, provide guidance to the states concerning regulation possibilities, and provide a forum for dialogue on other issues related to maximizing access. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason in order to develop effective methods of training and qualification, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence or method. Rational methods need no special protection. Irrational methods cannot be made safe by writing guidelines.]| |19.2||The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with states, should assist CAM organizations that wish to develop consensus within their field of practice regarding standards of practice, including education and training. The conclusions reached by CAM professional groups concerning these matters should be considered by states and regulatory bodies in determining the appropriate status of these practitioners for such regulatory options as registration, licensure or exemption. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason to develop practice standards, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence. There can be no objective standards for determining who is a \"qualified CAM practitioner.\" The basic requirement for professional practice should be knowledge of scientifically sound practices. Self-identification or recognition as a \"CAM\" or \"conventional\" professional is irrelevant.]| Recommendation 20: States should evaluate and review their regulation of CAM practitioners and ensure their accountability to the public. States should, as appropriate, implement provisions for licensure, registration, and exemption consistent with the practitioners' education, training, and scope of practice. Actions |20.1||The Department of Health and Human Services' policy advisory committee, in partnership with state legislatures, regulatory boards, and CAM practitioners, should develop model guidelines or other guidance for the regulation and oversight of licensed and registered practitioners who use CAM services and products. This guidance should balance concerns regarding protection of the public from the inappropriate practice of health care, provide opportunities for appropriately trained and qualified health practitioners to offer the full range of services in which they are trained and competent, maintain competition in the provision of CAM and other health services, preserve CAM styles and traditions that have been valued by both practitioners and consumers, and determine the extent of the public's choice among health care modalities. [This falsely assumes that there are many \"appropriately trained and qualified \"CAM\" practitioners and that consumer use is a measure of effectiuveness. Moreover, there is no logical reason why guidelines and standards should depend on whether or not somthing is marketed as \"CAM.\" This recommendation calls for weakening consumer protection against quackery.]| Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Hospice, Community Health Centers, and other Health Care Delivery Organizations Hospitals and Other Conventional Health Care Settings Because of the increased use of CAM, access and safety issues involving delivery of CAM in hospitals, hospices, nursing homes, community health centers, and other health delivery organizations are increasing. Patients sometimes bring CAM products and even CAM practitioners into inpatient settings. Health delivery organizations vary in their policies and procedures regarding such situations, and there is little monitoring of interactions between CAM and conventional health care in these settings. Health care facilities credential practitioners who provide services at their facilities. The question of who may practice and under what conditions within health delivery facilities is not addressed consistently for CAM practitioners. In some facilities, CAM practitioners who are not credentialed are permitted to provide services to patients; in others, only practitioners already credentialed by the facility may provide services. Issues of safety and quality of care also arise when conventional practitioners who are credentialed by a facility use CAM in their practice. An increasing number of physicians use CAM practices for their patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings. One way to address the growing number of issues related to the use of CAM interventions in hospitals, nursing homes, hospices, other clinical settings, and home health care is through the initiatives and leadership of nationally recognized accrediting organizations, including those that accredit health care networks and managed care organizations. For example, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), an independent nonprofit organization, surveys and accredits nearly 18,000 facilities, other health delivery settings, and health plans using professionally based standards to measure compliance. Other nationally recognized accrediting organizations include the National Committee for Quality Assurance and the American Accreditation HealthCare Commission. The efforts of these organizations to address CAM in all health care settings will contribute greatly to the public's safety. In addition, these efforts will assist state and Federal regulators of health delivery organizations and health plans, who often use accreditation as a proxy for government oversight. One important initiative that national accrediting organizations may take is to review their standards, guidelines, and interpretations for areas that affect or are affected by trends in CAM. For instance, one JCAHO standard addresses \"the relationship of the hospital staff and its staff members to other health care providers, educational institutions, and payers.\" In this case, more specific guidance is needed as to how a facility can meet the standard when incorporating CAM interventions into hospital services, serving as a component of an integrated delivery system that includes CAM, or participating in collaborative treatment plans with CAM providers. [Credentialing standards should be the same for everyone. They should not be lowered because they label their practices as \"CAM.\"] The work of national accrediting organizations includes not only a wide range of standards and guidance, but also measurement tools, quality and performance improvement initiatives, and surveys. The work usually is conducted by staff along with representatives of the health care industry, other industry experts, and consumers who serve on various committees and special working groups. It is important for national accrediting organizations to include CAM experts and representatives of CAM organizations on any group that addresses issues related to CAM. [This improperly suggests that only people who consider themselves as \"CAM\" experts are qualified to judge other \"CAM\" practitioners. It also bypasses the issue of whether it is possible to be an expert in a field whose methods have not been proven effective.] Recommendation 21: Nationally recognized accrediting bodies should evaluate how health care organizations under their oversight are using CAM practices and should develop strategies for the safe and appropriate use of qualified CAM practitioners and safe and effective products in these organizations. Actions |21.1||National accrediting bodies, in partnership with other public and private organizations, should evaluate present uses of CAM practitioners in health care delivery settings and develop strategies for their appropriate use in ways that will benefit the public. [This falsely assumes that there are many such uses. It deliberately avoids mention of inappropriate uses and what to do about them.]| |21.2||Nationally recognized accrediting bodies of health care organizations and facilities should consider increasing on-going access to CAM expertise to ensure that processes to develop accreditation standards and interpretations reflect emerging developments in the health care field. [Credentialing standards should be the same for everyone. They should not be lowered because they label their practices as \"CAM.\" This recommendation falsely assumes that \"CAM\" advocates are producing significant new developments.]| |N.||Nationally recognized accrediting bodies, using CAM experts, should review and evaluate current standards and guidelines to ensure the safe use of CAM practices and products in health care delivery organizations. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe \"CAM\" practices and products. As usual, it also fails to call for review intended to exclude unsafe and ineffective modalities.]| Community Health Centers, Hospices, Independent Centers and Other Programs A growing number of Americans use community health centers and other public health programs to meet their health care needs, including help with mental health and substance abuse treatment. These centers and programs often emphasize patient-centered care. A few community health centers have begun to use the services of CAM practitioners such as chiropractors, naturopathic physicians and acupuncturists. These centers might serve as models for the use of CAM practitioners by other community health centers and other public health service programs; however, they need to be evaluated to determine their impact on health care access and cost-benefits. [This appears to assume that close evaluation will be favorable.] Hospice care for the terminally ill is another important model that should be evaluated further. Some hospice programs are beginning to include CAM practitioners on the treatment team. Some of the CAM practices they use are chiropractic, acupuncture, music therapy, meditation, and visualization. In some instances, these services are believed to help reduce anxiety and pain. Some independent CAM centers, which may not have any direct hospital affiliation and may not have a physician on staff, also offer a variety of CAM services. These centers tend to be client-oriented with flexible hours and a broad spectrum of practitioners available. Many of the centers encourage patients to actively improve their health and concentrate on health maintenance rather than disease care and encourage coordination and collaboration among CAM practitioners who are seeing the same patient or client. More information is needed on who uses these centers, their impact on access and delivery, whether appropriate referral procedures are in place, and the quality of care provided. Only when more systematic data are available can the advantages and disadvantages of independent CAM centers be assessed. [This falsely assumes that most of the \"independent CAM centers\" offer appropriate treatment.] Special and Vulnerable Populations Special populations, such as racial and ethnic minorities, and vulnerable populations, such as the chronically and terminally ill, have unique challenges and needs regarding access to CAM. Efforts to address access to CAM need to be balanced with the need for access to conventional health care. Scarce resources need to be carefully allocated so that these populations are not denied opportunities available to others to access safe and effective conventional and CAM services. [This falsely assumes that minority groups and chronically and termianlly ill people are suffering from a lack of access to \"CAM.\" The biggest barrier to \"CAM\" use is not access but lack of scientific evidence of effectiveness.] Increased information on CAM use and barriers to access for these populations is needed. Although some studies have described CAM use among African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans, reliable access and utilization data are largely lacking. In the case of Native Americans, information gathering is limited by their status as sovereign nations. Nonetheless, the Indian Health Service has a program to encourage communication with practitioners of traditional Indian medicine, which will help ensure safety when both Native American and conventional medical systems are used. Surveys of CAM use in the general population indicate that it is being used disproportionately by highly educated, and upper-income Americans [4]. [That's because upper-income Americans have more money that they can afford to waste.] However, early studies used telephone interviews with English speakers, thus providing little information about CAM use among those who do not speak or have limited ability in English, who have lower income, or who lack telephones [5.]. Later studies corrected for these biases, but they did not use adequate statistical sampling to estimate the use of CAM in minority populations [6-11]. Other surveys have focused on low-income and ethnic groups, but these studies frequently had small, unrepresentative samples 12-15]. The National Center for Health Statistics is conducting a nationwide survey on access to and use of CAM among racial and ethnic minorities that is expected to provide statistically reliable estimates of CAM use in these groups. In an October 2000 letter to community health centers and other public health programs, the Health Resources and Services Administration's Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) endorsed the use of CAM in these centers where appropriate [16]. In 2001 they began surveying the use of CAM by persons receiving health services from BPHC-funded community health centers. Information being gathered includes participants' use of six modalities (acupuncture, manual healing, botanicals and herbs, homeopathy, traditional healing, and mind-body techniques); whether the CAM service was provided onsite or by referral, either with or without payment by the community health center; and demographic data. Results should be available in 2002 and will provide a significant, statistically reliable portrait of the use of a variety of CAM services and products by community health center clients, whose come disproportionately from rural, low-income, and minority populations. It is important to continue collecting this kind of information in the future. [Knowing the extent of use will provide no indication of what might be needed, because no data exist to determine whether adding \"CAM\" practices is beneficial and more important than increasing standard practices.] Discussions are currently underway between BPHC and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine to include clients of community health centers in CAM clinical trials, in order to increase the relevance of findings for application to the health needs of minority populations. Use of CAM is especially high among populations with potentially life-threatening diseases. Surveys show that people with cancer use CAM practices and products more frequently than the population as a whole, with CAM most often being used in conjunction with conventional therapies [17-19]. Similarly, there is high use of CAM by people who are terminally ill and their caretakers. Many people in these vulnerable populations are using CAM services regardless of whether they have insurance coverage and sometimes without the knowledge or cooperation of their conventional physician. The chronically and terminally ill consume more health care resources than the rest of the population. Approximately 75 percent of all health care spending in the U.S. currently is for the treatment of chronic disease [20], and 25 percent of Medicare spending is for costs incurred during the last year of life [21]. The great interest in CAM practices among the chronically ill, those with life-threatening conditions, and those at the end of their lives suggests that increased access to some CAM services among these groups could have significant implications for the health care system [This implies that many chronically and terminally ill people would bebefit from availability of unspecified \"CAM\" practices. Health services research, demonstrations, and evaluations are needed to assess whether CAM services can improve care and quality of life for people in these groups, and possibly lessen the use of expensive technological interventions. [Research of this type should not be done unless it appears likely to have a significant practical effect.] With the number of older Americans expected to increase dramatically over the next 20 years, alternative strategies for dealing with end-of-life processes will be increasingly important in public policy. This demographic shift should influence priorities for the kinds of research and demonstration projects that would be carried out in the near future. A more careful assessment of the potential and limitations of CAM approaches in the health care system as a whole might lead to more effective use of resources. For example, Congress could direct the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to develop a demonstration project to study evidence-based CAM interventions as part of comprehensive care of persons with chronic disease in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. [This falsely assumes that such research would find substantia benefit.] The demonstrations would assess health outcomes and total costs of care for beneficiaries in settings where physician leaders are committed to evidence-based medicine, high quality, client-centered care, and openness to CAM approaches. If evaluations show that some uses of CAM can lessen the need for more expensive conventional care in these populations, the economic implications for these Medicare and Medicaid could be significant. [This falsely assumes that this is the likely outome.] If safe and effective CAM practices become more available to the general population, special and vulnerable populations should also have access to these services, along with conventional healthcare. CAM would not be a replacement for conventional health care, but would be part of the options available for treatment. In some cases, CAM practices may be an equal or superior option. [This falsely assumes that safe and effect \"CAM\" practices are abundant.] Evidence for assessing the potential of CAM interventions in treating vulnerable and special populations is still being gathered. While it is too early to judge the effectiveness of CAM in addressing their health care needs, CAM nonetheless offers the possibility of a new paradigm of integrated health care that could affect the affordability, accessibility, and delivery of health care services for millions of Americans. [This paragraph is wishful thinking.] Recommendation 22: The Federal government should facilitate and support the evaluation and implementation of safe and effective CAM practices to help meet the health care needs of special and vulnerable populations. Actions |22.1||The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal Departments should identify models of health care delivery that include safe and effective CAM practices, evaluate them, and then support those models which are successful for use with special and vulnerable populations, including the chronically and terminally ill. [This repeats the false assumtpion that many such \"CAM\" methods exist.]| |22.2||The Department of Health and Human Services should sponsor the development and evaluation of demonstration projects that integrate the use of safe and effective CAM services as part of the health care programs in hospices and community health centers. [This repeats the false assumtpion that many such \"CAM\" methods exist.]| |22.3||The Department of Health and Human Services should identify ways to support the practice of indigenous healing in the United States and to improve communication among indigenous healers, conventional health care professionals, and CAM practitioners. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe and effective indigenous healing practices.]| Table 1.

Gorski, MD, FACOG] COORDINATION OF RESEARCH Recommendation 1: Federal agencies should receive increased for clinical, basic, and health services research on CAM. Actions |1.1||Federal agencies should increase their activities with respect to CAM in accordance with their biomedical research, health services research, or other health care-related responsibilities and make these activities, including available technical assistance, known to CAM and conventional researchers and practitioners. Activities might include funding initiatives such as requests for applications and proposals; CAM-focused offices or centers; CAM-focused staff positions; CAM advisory committees or the representation of qualified CAM professionals on such committees. [Research priorities should depend on the likelihood that projects will yield significant results and not on whether or not they are marketed as \"CAM.\"]| |1.2||Federal agencies should assess the scope of scientific, practice, and public interest and needs regarding CAM that are relative to their missions, examine their portfolios, and develop funding distribution strategies to address these interests and needs. [Since \"public interest\" is not necessarily related to effectiveness, it should not be a major factor in determining research priorities.]| |1.3||The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality together with The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine should develop ways to expand health services research in CAM and explore methodologies for health services research in this area. [NCCAM and its predecessors have produced no significant findings during its ten years of existence. It makes more sense to abolish it than to increase its funding.]| |1.4||The Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support more research on (1) complex compounds/mixtures frequently found in CAM products, (2) clinical interventions consisting of multiple treatments, (3) how patient-practitioner interactions affect treatment outcomes, and (4) individualizing treatments. [Identifying the active ingredients of promising herbs is a worthwhile endeavor that has been taking place for decades. But this recommendation also supports clinical research on crude extracts (chemical mixtures) that is likely to be unproductive. It might also be useful to study patient-practitioner interactions. However, research expenditures and other incentives should be proportional to probable value, not whether something is labeled \"CAM.\"]| |1.5||n order to protect public health and maximize benefits, Congress should provide adequate public funding for research on frequently used or promising CAM products that would be unlikely to receive private research support. [This falsely implies that their are many promising \"CAM\" products. Frequency use should be considered only if a product appears to be effective.]| |1.6||The Federal government should support research on CAM practices that appear to be effective but may not be profitable to private investors, such as biofeedback, meditation, guided imagery, art therapy, and music therapy. [Research priority should be related to the probability of obtaining useful results, not according to whether something is marketed as \"CAM.\"]| Recommendation 2: Congress and the Administration should consider enacting legislative and administrative incentives to stimulate private sector investment in CAM research on products that may not be patentable. Actions |2.1||Incentives to stimulate private sector investment in CAM research should focus on (1) research on dietary supplements and other natural products that may not be patentable; (2) research on other CAM products that may not be patentable, including therapeutic devices; and (3) the development of analytical methods for producing better quality CAM products. [Research priority should be related to the likelihood of useful results and not to whether products are classified as \"CAM.\"| |2.2||The Federal and private sectors should provide support for workshops to discuss the research needed by regulatory agencies for their review and approval processes for CAM products and devices. [This recommendation puts the cart before the horse. CAM advocates do not need special training in how to get things approved. Regulatory approval is based on proof of safety and effectiveness. Whether methods are standard or are labeled \"CAM\" is not relevant. What counts is whether or not they work.]| |2.3||Federal agencies should develop outreach programs to inform manufacturers of CAM products and devices about the Federal research support available to private industry and how the agency can assist them.| Recommendation 3: Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support research on CAM modalities and approaches that are designed to improve self-care and behaviors that promote wellness. [Research priorities should be determined by the likelihood of useful findings and not whether they are identified as \"CAM.\" Proven self-care and wellness strategies are part of mainstream public health and should not be identified as \"CAM.\"] Recommendation 4: Federal, private, and nonprofit sectors should support new and innovative CAM research on core questions posed by frontier areas of scientific study associated with CAM that might expand our understanding of health and disease. Actions |4.1||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, assisted by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, should develop guidelines for establishing research priorities in CAM . [NCCAM has supposedly been doing this for many years.]| |4.2||The National Science Foundation, in collaboration with The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, should examine frontier areas of science associated with CAM that are outside the current research paradigm and methodological approaches to study them. [This falsely assumes that that \"frontier areas of science associated with CAM\" are rational but cannot be tested by established research methods. This appears to include alleged supernatural forces such as\"electromagnetic energy flow\" that cannot be measured with scientific instruments.]| |4.3||Multidisciplinary workshops and expert panels should be convened by Federal, private and nonprofit organizations, collaboratively or independently, to explore the challenges in design and methodology presented by research questions in CAM areas that are outside the current research paradigm. [The fact that quack methods cannot be substantiated does not mean that science-based standards of evidence should be lowered.]| |4.4||The National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense are among the Federal organizations that should consider contributing collaboratively or independently to the support of research on core questions in areas described in many CAM systems. [This is a blatant pitch for more research funds for studying methods marketed as \"CAM.\" Research dollars should be allocated according to potial usefulness rather than how they are designated.]| |4.5||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, working with the World Health Organization, should examine investigative approaches for studying the traditional systems of medical practice from a variety of cultures. [The study of folk healing is probably not a cost-effective way to discover new methods.]| Recommendation 5: Investigators engaged in research on CAM should ensure that human subjects participating in clinical studies receive the same protections as are required in conventional medical research and to which they are entitled. Actions |5.1||Licensed practitioners using CAM systems and modalities who wish to conduct or collaborate in clinical research should follow the same requirements as in conventional medical research. They should develop, or partner with a research institution to develop, a scientifically valid research protocol and obtain Institutional Review Board approval to ensure that they meet accepted standards of ethical conduct and their responsibilities to protect human subjects. [These are standard operating procedures for scientific research.]| |5.2||Accredited CAM institutions and CAM professional organizations should establish Institutional Review Boards where possible, and guide their colleagues and members to utilize the Institutional Review Board process, which is required to conduct clinical research.| |5.3||Institutional Review Boards that review CAM research studies should include the expertise of qualified CAM professionals in the review.| |5.4||Research institutions, National Institutes of Health Institutes and Centers, and other Federal research and health care agencies should be more proactive in developing programs that (1) provide opportunities for expert review of promising CAM practice-based observational data by experienced researchers, (2) stimulate practitioner response to the opportunities offered by the programs and (3) facilitate communication and stimulate partnerships between CAM practitioners and conventionally-trained researchers in designing and implementing clinical studies.| Recommendation 6: The Commission recommends that state professional regulatory bodies include language in their guidelines stating that licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized practitioners who are engaged in research on CAM will not be sanctioned solely because they are engaged in such research if they: (1) are engaged in well-designed research that is approved by an appropriately constituted Institutional Review Boards, (2) are following the requirements for the protection of human subjects, and (3) are meeting their professional and ethical responsibilities. All CAM and conventional practitioners, whether or not they are engaged in research, must meet whatever State practice requirements or standards govern their authorization to practice. [This proposal, if implemented, would enable practitioners of quack methods to escape rstate egulatory action by setting up their own Institutional Review Boards.] Recommendation 7: Increased efforts should be made to strengthen the emerging dialogue among CAM and conventional medical practitioners, researchers and accredited research institutions; Federal and state research, health care, and regulatory agencies; the private and nonprofit sectors; and the general public. Actions |7.1||CAM and conventional medical researchers and practitioners should adhere to the same high standards of quality and ethics in all aspects of research and related activities. [This is self-evident but exaggerates the likelihood that \"CAM\" researchers and practitioners can achieve high standards of quality and ethics.]| |7.2||Federal agencies should develop programs to stimulate cooperation and partnerships between CAM and conventional medical professionals and accredited institutions. [This exaggerates the likelihood that \"CAM\" practitioners can enter into useful partnerships with science-based practitioners and their institutions.]| |7.3||Committees reviewing or advising on research, journal submissions, regulatory compliance, and health insurance coverage in both the public and private sectors should include as members or consultants trained, experienced, and properly qualified CAM health care professionals. [This falsely implies that many \"properly qualified CAM health professionals\" exist. TMoreover, the choice of experts should be based on the quality of their work rather than how they label and market themselves.]| |7.4||Multidisciplinary conferences, workshops, and expert panels on CAM research and related activities, including research methodology, should be supported independently or collaboratively by the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. [Such intermingling would have political value for \"CAM\" proponents but is unlikely to add to scientific knowledge.]| |7.5||The nonprofit sector and the private sector should create funding partnerships, whether independently or with Federal agencies, to augment support for CAM research, research infrastructure and training, research conferences, and information dissemination. [Nonprofit and private organizations can give money to whomever they please. Allocation of government funds should be based on scientific standards, not how methods are classified.]| |7.6||The Federal government should support research, including population-based research, to learn more about why people use CAM practices and products, how they determine the safety and effectiveness of the practices and products they use, and what they find satisfying or unsatisfying about them. [If done properly, research of this type could be used to educate people on how to avoid being quacked. But the statistics could also be used to promote irrational methods by trumpeting about how popular they are.]| |7.7||To benefit patients and future research protocol development and to add to our knowledge about the use of CAM, Institutional Review Boards should consider requiring that all research subjects be asked about their use of herbal or other dietary supplements. [This might be important if using dietary supplements or herbs could confound the data. But routine questioning might convey an underlying message that the products are so important that they deserve special consideration.]| |7.8||Federal agencies supporting biomedical and health services research should develop orientation and training programs for public representatives to enhance the effectiveness of their participation on advisory committees concerned with CAM. [It does not make sense to train people whose judgment is so poor that they advocate wildly implausible hypotheses.]| Recommendation 8: Public and private resources should be increased to strengthen the infrastructure for CAM research and research training at conventional medical and CAM institutions and to expand the cadre of basic, clinical, and health services researchers who are knowledgeable about CAM and have received rigorous research training. Actions |8.1||Funding should be made available to accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions develop programs that examine CAM research questions and that stimulate cross-institutional collaborations involving faculty and students in research and research training.| |8.2||Funding should be made available to accredited CAM and conventional medical institutions support joint research and professional education and training programs to enhance the quality and clinical relevance of CAM research and link the research with evidence-based education and training of practitioners. [This falsely assumes that training advocates of irrational practices will lead to valuable results. There is no logical reason to assume that it will. Moreover, CAM is a marketing term, not a genuine field of health care.]| |8.3||Federal health agencies with research training programs and responsibilities that encompass CAM-related questions should be given adequate support to increase research training in CAM. [This falsely assumes that training advocates of irrational practices will lead to valuable results. There is no logical reason to assume that it will. Moreover, CAM is a marketing term, not a genuine field of health care.]| |8.4||Existing resources, such as The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine-supported centers and the National Center for Research Resources' General Clinical Research Centers should be utilized to increase opportunities to conduct clinical research and training on CAM and examine the inclusion of CAM into the clinical setting. [Despite nearly ten years of distributing grant money, NCCAM and its predecessors have produced no useful clinical research findings. It makes no sense to increase their funding.]| |8.5||Federal support should be increased for career development awards, including those that enable investigators focusing on CAM to develop into independent investigators and faculty members, and mid-career awards that provide the time required to mentor new CAM investigators. [The basis for training career investigators should be the quality of their work, not whether they label or market themselves as \"CAM\" investigators.]| Recommendation 9: Public and private resources should be used to support, conduct, and update systematic reviews of the peer-reviewed research literature on the safety, efficacy, and cost-benefit of CAM practices and products. Actions |9.1||The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality should expand its Evidence-based Practice Center systematic reviews on CAM systems and treatments for use by private and public entities in developing tools, such as practice guidelines, performance measures, and review criteria, and for identifying future research needs. [This falsely implies that current methods of scientific review are defective and that \"CAM\" methods should be reviewed differently.]| |9.2||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine should issue a comprehensive, understandable, and regularly updated summary of current clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of CAM systems and treatments for health care practitioners and the public. [Many such summaries have been published. Whether more would serve any useful purpose would depend on who compiles them and whether their conclusions are supported by scientific evidence. To date, neither NCCAM nor WHCCAMP has ever publicly concluded that any \"CAM\" method is worthless and should be abandoned. The call for dissemination of \"evidence\" attempts to conceal how little there is that is worth disseminating.]| EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS Recommendation 10: The education and training of CAM and conventional practitioners should be designed to ensure public safety, improve health, and increase the availability of qualified and knowledgeable CAM and conventional practitioners and enhance the collaboration among them. Actions |10.1||Conventional health professional schools, postgraduate training programs, and continuing education programs should develop core curricula of knowledge about CAM to prepare conventional health professionals to discuss CAM with their patients and clients and help them make informed choices about the use of CAM. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |10.2||CAM education and training programs should develop curricula that reflect the fundamental elements of biomedical science and conventional health care relevant to and consistent with the practitioners' scope of practice. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" deserve advocacy in training programs.]| |10.3||CAM and conventional education and training programs should develop curricula and other methods to facilitate communication and foster collaboration between CAM and conventional students, practitioners, researchers, educators, institutions and organizations. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" deserve advocacy in training programs and that the offerings \"CAM\" advocates are likely to be trustworthy.]| |10.4||Increased Federal, state, and private sector support should be made available to expand and evaluate CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions. [This is a blatant call for promotion of unsubstantiated methods and their advocates throughout our medical educational system. Just the opposite is needed. Science-based accrediting bodies should attack the quackery that that has infiltrated medical education within the past few years.]| |10.5||Expansion of eligibility of CAM students at accredited institutions for existing of loan programs should be explored. [This would help subsidize students at schools of acupuncture and naturopathy whose teachings advocate irrational practices such as homeopathy.]| |10.6||The Department of Health and Human Services should conduct a feasibility study to determine whether appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners enhance and/or expand health care provided by primary care teams.* This feasibility study could lead to demonstration projects to identify: 1) the type of practitioners, 2) their necessary education and training, 3) the appropriate practice settings, and 4) the health outcomes attributable to the addition of these practitioners and services to comprehensive care. [This falsely implies that \"CAM\" advocates have a lot to offer. However, adding ineffective methods to effective ones will increases the cost of health-care delivery but not its quality.]| |10.7||The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal Departments and Agencies should convene conferences of the leaders of CAM, conventional health, public health, evolving health professions, and the public; of educational institutions; and of appropriate organizations to facilitate establishment of CAM education and training guidelines. Subsequently, the guidelines should be made available to the states and professions for their consideration. [This falsely assumes that rational guidelines can be written for teaching irrational methods.]| |10.8||Feasibility studies of postgraduate training for appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners should be conducted to determine the type of practitioners, practice setting, and their impact on clinical competency, quality of health care, and collaboration with conventional providers. [Here WHCCAMP demands that residency training be corrupted by giving CAM advocates free reign to promote their anti-scientific nonsense.]| |10.9||Practitioners who provide CAM services and products should complete appropriate CAM continuing education programs that include critical evaluation of CAM to enhance and protect the public's health and safety. [There is no reason to expect that science-based CAM continuing education programs can be created or that \"CAM\" practitioners would attend such programs or be influenced by them. To be \"appropriate,\" such programs would have to advocate abandonment of \"CAM\" methods that are irrational.| CAM INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT AND DISSEMINATION Recommendation 11: The Federal government should make available accurate, useful, and easily accessible information on CAM practices and products, including information on safety and effectiveness. Actions |11.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should establish a task force to facilitate the development and dissemination of CAM information within the Federal government and to eliminate existing gaps in CAM information. The task force should include consumers, CAM providers, scientists, and conventional health care practitioners. Resources should subsequently be provided to close identified gaps and improve the availability, coordination, and dissemination of information. [The only real gaps in government CAM information are (a) the failure to identify which CAM methods are worthless and (b) the failure of NCCAM and other government agencies to refer people to information sources that are justifiably critical of CAM methods. Setting up more agencies with similar policies would worsen the situation rather than improve it.]| |11.2||Federal Departments and agencies with missions or activities relevant to CAM should 1) develop informational materials about CAM that are easy to understand and use, and 2) support and collaborate with national and local community leaders and CAM leaders and organizations to identify strategies for enhancing the development, availability, and accessibility of information on the safety and effectiveness of CAM practices and products. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |11.3||Increased funding should be provided to the National Library of Medicine and the American Library Association to expand training of librarians to include helping consumers find information on CAM. [This is another way to promote dubious methods. Why should a particular subset of medical literature get special status or attention in libraries merely because it deals with unproven, disproved or irrational therapies? Moreover, it is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| |11.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should direct resources to streamline the process of identifying and making available relevant, high-quality CAM information from other countries and in other languages. [This falsely assumes that other countries have high-quality \"CAM\" information available.| Recommendation 12: The quality and accuracy of CAM information on the Internet should be improved by establishing a voluntary standards board, a public education campaign, and actions to protect consumers' privacy. Actions |12.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should form a public-private partnership to review new and existing websites and to develop voluntary standards promoting accuracy, fairness, comprehensiveness, and timeliness of information on CAM web sites, as well as the disclosure of sources of support and possible conflicts of interest. Sites reviewed and found in compliance with the standards could publicize the fact and display a logo denoting their merit. [DHHS's healthfinder.gov already does a poor job of sorting out reliable and unreliable sources of CAM information. There is no reason to believe that another government-sponsored system would work better.]| |12.2||Funding should be provided to the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education to conduct a joint public education campaign that teaches consumers how to evaluate health care information, including CAM information, on the Internet and elsewhere. [Whether or not such information is useful would depend upon who compiles and controls it. So far \u2014 for political reasons \u2014 the government-generated teachings about CAM methods have been woefully inadequate. There is no reason to believe that additional funding will modify this situation.]| |12.3||Congress should protect consumers' privacy by requiring all health information sites, including CAM sites, to disclose whether they track users and if so, how that information is used and stored, including whether it is sold to third parties. [Individual privacy should be protected regardless of what information is sought.]| Recommendation 13: Information on the training and education of providers of CAM services should be made easily available to the public. Actions |13.1||The Commission recommends that states require all persons providing CAM services to disclose information regarding their level and scope of training and to make it easily available to consumers. [Consumers who want this information are already free to ask for it. Requiring qualified practitioners to provide it without being asked will merely increase their overhead. Requiring unqualified practitioners to disclose their background would only be useful if consumers could judge the validity of nonstandard credentials \u2014 something very few people can do. The real way to protect consumers is to prevent unqualified individuals from practicing.]| |13.2||The Commission recommends that states disclose information on State guidelines, requirements, licensure, certification, and disciplinary actions of health providers, including CAM providers, and make it easily accessible to the public. [Some state licensing boards already provide such information.Whether doing this is cost-effective and actually protects people has not been demonstrated. Curiously, far less public information is available about chiropractors than about medical doctors and other mainstream practitioners.]| Recommendation 14: CAM products that are available to U.S. consumers should be safe and meet appropriate standards of quality and consistency. Actions |14.1||The efforts of both the public and private sectors to ensure the development, validation, and dissemination of analytical methods and reference materials for dietary supplements should be accelerated.| |14.2||The proposed Good Manufacturing Practices for Dietary Supplements should be published expeditiously, followed by a timely review of comments and completion of a final rule. The Food and Drug Administration should be provided with adequate resources to complete this task. [GMPs deal mainly with the technicalities of manufacturing and the cleanliness of manufacturing and storage facilities. They are not a substitute for ensuring that the health claims for such products are legitimate. Worthless or dangerous products prepared according to GMPs are still worthless or dangerous.]| |14.3||Adequate funding should be provided to appropriate Federal agencies, including U.S. Customs and Food and Drug Administration inspection authorities, to enforce current laws monitoring the quality of imported raw materials and finished products intended for use as dietary supplements. [The FDA already has the legislative tools to do this, but many other tasks compete for attention from its limited resources.]| |14.4||Manufacturers should have on file and make available to the FDA upon request scientific information to substantiate their determinations of safety, and current statutory provisions should be periodically reexamined to determine whether safety requirements for dietary supplements are adequate. [Manufacturers are already required to have information available to the FDA, but it is obvious that current laws do not protect the public. The only way to protect the public is to require proof of safety and effectiveness before marketing.]| |14.5||An objective process for evaluating the safety of dietary supplement products should be developed by an independent expert panel. [It is not possible to evaluate safety without considering effectiveness.]| Recommendation 15: Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as modified by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, should be fully implemented, funded, enforced, and evaluated. Actions |15.1||The Food and Drug Administration and other agencies with regulatory responsibilities should be provided with additional resources to 1) enforce the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act's regulations regarding labeling of dietary supplements, 2) enforce current provisions requiring that dietary supplements be labeled in English, even if the same information is also included in another language, and 3) employ additional professionals with expertise in dietary supplements. [It is difficult to understand, in practical terms, what such \"additional resources\" would accomplish. It would be far more effective to demand that products be proven safe and effective before they are marketed.]| |15.2||Current provisions requiring disclosure of material facts by manufacturers of CAM products should be enforced, and manufacturers should meet their responsibility to disclose material facts on the label, package, and/or package insert, so that the public will have information about known risks and well-documented significant interactions. Information on potential benefits of dietary supplements should also be made easily available at the time of purchase. [Current drug laws require that products marketed for the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of disease be labeled with adequate directions for their intended uses. If dietary supplements (and herbs) had to meet this standard, the industry would collapse.]| |15.3||Congress should periodically evaluate the effectiveness, limitations, and enforcement of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, including its impact on public health, and take appropriate action to ensure the public's safety. [The impact is obvious: since its passage, the marketplace has been flooded with unsubstantiated claims for dietary supplements and herbs. The only appropriate action would be to repeal the law.]| Recommendation 16: Activities to ensure that advertising of dietary supplements and other CAM practices and products is truthful and not misleading should be increased. Actions |16.1||Congress should provide additional support to the Federal Trade Commission to 1) expand efforts to identify false and deceptive advertising of CAM-related health services and products and take appropriate enforcement action when necessary, 2) use appropriate CAM experts in the process of examination of CAM-related advertising, 3) increase activities to help consumers distinguish useful and reliable information from deceptive and unsubstantiated advertising in all forms of marketing and advertising, including at the point of purchase; and 4) seek additional public comment on the benefits and potential problems in the advertising of CAM-related services and products. [This is an excellent recommendation. However, although stronger federal action could drive many CAM entrepreneurs out of business, the U.S. Congress is dominated by CAM advocates who have seriously weakened consumer protection during the past decade. If WHCCAMP really wants more protection for consumers, it should advocate repealing the 1994 Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act which severely weakened FDA enforcement powers. And it should also oppose CAM advocates' efforts to weaken FTC enforcement in the same way.]| Recommendation 17: The collection and dissemination of information about adverse events stemming from the use of dietary supplements should be improved. Actions |17.1||Congress should require dietary supplement manufacturers and suppliers to register with the Food and Drug Administration, and the agency should encourage voluntary registration until such a requirement is in effect, so that manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers can be promptly notified if a serious adverse event is identified. [This is one of the few valid ideas in the WHCCAMP report.]| |17.2||Recent congressional support for improving the Food and Drug Administration's adverse events reporting system should be enhanced by requiring dietary supplement manufacturers and suppliers to maintain records and report serious adverse events to the agency. [This is one of the few valid ideas in the WHCCAMP report.]| |17.3||Additional resources and support should be provided to 1) the Food and Drug Administration to simplify the adverse events reporting system for dietary supplements, and to streamline the database for timely review and follow-up on received reports; and 2) the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other appropriate Federal agencies to increase outreach activities to consumers, health professionals (including poison control centers, emergency room physicians, CAM practitioners, and mid-level marketers) in order to improve both manufacturers' and the public's awareness of and participation in voluntary event reporting. [This might be useful, but it would be more efficient to require that products be proven safe and effective before marketing.]| ACCESS AND DELIVERY Recommendation 18: The Department of Health and Human Services should evaluate current barriers to consumer access to safe and effective CAM practices and to qualified practitioners and should develop strategies for removing those barriers in order to increase access and to ensure accountability. Actions |18.1||The Department of Health and Human Services should assist the States in evaluating the impact of legislation enacted by various States on access to CAM practices and on public safety. [How useful this would be would depends on whether it is done properly.]| |18.2||The Department of Health and Human Services and other appropriate Federal agencies should use health care workforce data, data from national surveys on use of CAM, regional public health reports on CAM activities and other studies to identify current and future health care needs and the relevance of safe and effective CAM services for helping address these needs. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe and effective \"CAM\" activities. No data can identify a \"need\" for \"CAM\" products or services that have not been proven safe and effective.]| Recommendation 19: The Federal Government should offer assistance to states and professional organizations in 1) developing and evaluating guidelines for practitioner accountability and competence in CAM delivery, including regulation of practice, and 2) periodic review and assessment of the effects of regulations on consumer protection. Actions |19.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should create a policy advisory committee, including CAM and conventional practitioners and representatives of the public, to address issues related to providing access to qualified CAM practitioners, provide guidance to the states concerning regulation possibilities, and provide a forum for dialogue on other issues related to maximizing access. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason in order to develop effective methods of training and qualification, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence or method. Rational methods need no special protection. Irrational methods cannot be made safe by writing guidelines.]| |19.2||The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with states, should assist CAM organizations that wish to develop consensus within their field of practice regarding standards of practice, including education and training. The conclusions reached by CAM professional groups concerning these matters should be considered by states and regulatory bodies in determining the appropriate status of these practitioners for such regulatory options as registration, licensure or exemption. [Although standard biomedicine can apply criteria of facts and reason to develop practice standards, \"CAM\" possesses no such body of evidence. There can be no objective standards for determining who is a \"qualified CAM practitioner.\" The basic requirement for professional practice should be knowledge of scientifically sound practices. Self-identification or recognition as a \"CAM\" or \"conventional\" professional is irrelevant.]| Recommendation 20: States should evaluate and review their regulation of CAM practitioners and ensure their accountability to the public. States should, as appropriate, implement provisions for licensure, registration, and exemption consistent with the practitioners' education, training, and scope of practice. Action |20.1||The Department of Health and Human Services' policy advisory committee, in partnership with state legislatures, regulatory boards, and CAM practitioners, should develop model guidelines or other guidance for the regulation and oversight of licensed and registered practitioners who use CAM services and products. This guidance should balance concerns regarding protection of the public from the inappropriate practice of health care, provide opportunities for appropriately trained and qualified health practitioners to offer the full range of services in which they are trained and competent, maintain competition in the provision of CAM and other health services, preserve CAM styles and traditions that have been valued by both practitioners and consumers, and determine the extent of the public's choice among health care modalities. [This falsely assumes that there are many \"appropriately trained and qualified \"CAM\" practitioners and that consumer use is a measure of effectiuveness. Moreover, there is no logical reason why guidelines and standards should depend on whether or not somthing is marketed as \"CAM.\" This recommendation calls for weakening consumer protection against quackery.]| Recommendation 21: Nationally recognized accrediting bodies should evaluate how health care organizations under their oversight are using CAM practices and should develop strategies for the safe and appropriate use of qualified CAM practitioners and safe and effective products in these organizations. Actions |21.1||National accrediting bodies, in partnership with other public and private organizations, should evaluate present uses of CAM practitioners in health care delivery settings and develop strategies for their appropriate use in ways that will benefit the public. [This falsely assumes that there are many such uses. It deliberately avoids mention of inappropriate uses and what to do about them.]| |21.2||Nationally recognized accrediting bodies of health care organizations and facilities should consider increasing on-going access to CAM expertise to ensure that processes to develop accreditation standards and interpretations reflect emerging developments in the health care field. [Current continuing medical education standards| |21.3||Nationally recognized accrediting bodies, using CAM experts, should review and evaluate current standards and guidelines to ensure the safe use of CAM practices and products in health care delivery organizations. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe \"CAM\" practices and products. As usual, it also fails to call for review intended to exclude unsafe and ineffective modalities.]| Recommendation 22: The Federal government should facilitate and support the evaluation and implementation of safe and effective CAM practices to help meet the health care needs of special and vulnerable populations. Actions |22.1||The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal Departments should identify models of health care delivery that include safe and effective CAM practices, evaluate them, and then support those models which are successful for use with special and vulnerable populations, including the chronically and terminally ill. [This repeats the false assumtpion that many such \"CAM\" methods exist.]| |22.2||The Department of Health and Human Services should sponsor the development and evaluation of demonstration projects that integrate the use of safe and effective CAM services as part of the health care programs in hospices and community health centers. [This repeats the false assumtpion that many such \"CAM\" methods exist.]| |22.3||The Department of Health and Human Services should identify ways to support the practice of indigenous healing in the United States and to improve communication among indigenous healers, conventional health care professionals, and CAM practitioners. [This falsely assumes that there are many safe and effective indigenous healing practices.]| COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT Recommendation 23: Evidence should be developed and disseminated regarding the safety, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of CAM interventions, as well as the optimum models for complementary and integrated care. Actions |23.1||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should convene a joint public and private task force to identify and set priorities for studying health services issues related to CAM and to help purchasers and health plans make prudent decisions regarding coverage of and access to CAM. [The only prudent decisions should be to cover methods that have been proven safe, effective, and cost-effective. Whether methods are marketed as \"CAM\" is not relevant.]| |23.2||Federal agencies, States, and private organizations should increase funding for health services research, demonstrations, and evaluations related to CAM, including outcomes of CAM interventions, coverage and access, effective sequencing and integration with conventional therapies, effective models for service delivery, and the use of CAM in underserved, vulnerable, and special populations. [It is pointless to invest limited health-care dollars investigating or deploying methods that have no proven value.]| |23.3||Federal, State, and private entities should fund health services research on the costs, cost-benefits, and cost-effectiveness of CAM interventions and wellness programs. [This falsely assumes that such research will provide substantial benefits.]| |23.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the National Committee for Vital and Health Statistics should authorize a national coding system that supports standardized data for CAM. This system should make possible the collection of data for clinical and health services research on CAM, and support compliance with the electronic claims requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. [Few interventions promoted as CAM have been proven safe and effective for their intended purposes. There is no logical reason to assign insurance codes to methods that are unproven and/or irrational.]| |23.5||The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, through its clearinghouse, should provide information on health services research, demonstrations, and evaluations of CAM services and products. [The NCCAM and its predecessors were created for this purpose but have not identified a single \"safe and effective service or product.\" Nor have they set up an honest clearinghouse. People who ask for information about specific practices are usually referred to proponents and almost never referred to science-based critics.]| |23.6||Public agencies and private organizations should support the development of informational programs on CAM targeted to health plan purchasers and sponsors, health insurers, managed care organizations, consumer groups, and others involved in the provision of health care services. [The amount of useful information that fits this description is trivial. This appears to be a brazen proposal for goverment agencies to help market \"CAM\" methods. If anything, the public needs more information about what CAM methods are known to be ineffective.]| |23.7||Congress should request periodic reports from appropriate Federal departments on coverage of and reimbursement for CAM practices and products for Federal beneficiaries, Medicaid beneficiaries, Federal employees, military personnel, veterans, and eligible family members and retirees, as well as any legislative, regulatory, or programmatic impediments to covering safe and effective CAM interventions. [The big \"impediment\" is lack of evidence that they work. Unless \"CAM services and products\" are proven useful, there is no reason for policymakers to concern themselves about third-party reimbursements unless they want to know how much money is being wasted.]| Recommendation 24: Insurers and managed care organizations should offer purchasers the option of health benefit plans that incorporate coverage of safe and effective CAM interventions provided by qualified practitioners. Actions |24.1||Health insurance and managed care companies should modify their benefit design and coverage processes in order to offer purchasers, for their consideration, health benefit plans that include safe and effective CAM interventions. [Most insurance companies need no prodding to cover methods that have been proven effective. The vast majority of \"CAM\" methods have not even been scientifically tested.]| |24.2||Health insurance and managed care companies should make use of CAM expertise in the development of benefit plans that include safe and effective CAM interventions. [This falsely assumes that such methods are useful and that \"CAM\" advocates can be trusted to sort out what should be covered.]| |24.3||Health insurers, managed care organizations, CAM professional associations, CAM experts, private organizations that develop medical criteria, and Federal agencies are encouraged to develop appropriate clinical criteria and guidelines for the use of CAM services and products. [This falsely assumes that many such modalities exist and that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice.]| Recommendation 25: Purchasers, including Federal agencies and employers, should evaluate the possibility of covering benefits or adding health benefit plans that incorporate safe and effective CAM interventions. Actions |25.1||Employers, Federal agencies, other purchasers and sponsors should enhance the processes they use to develop health benefits and give consideration to safe and effective CAM interventions.| |25.2||Public purchasers such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Defense, employers, other health benefit sponsors, and health industry organizations should include CAM practitioners and experts on advisory bodies and workgroups considering CAM benefits and other health benefit issues. [This falsely assumes that many such modalities exist and that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice.]| |25.3||The Secretary of Health and Human Services, preferably through the Federal CAM coordinating office when established, should maintain a list of opportunities for CAM experts to participate on advisory committees and other workgroups. [This assumes that \"CAM\" advocates can offer reliable advice. The WHCCAMP report shows the absurdity of this assumption.]| |25.4||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should direct agencies under his authority to convene workgroups and conferences to assess the state-of-the-science of CAM services and products and to develop consensus and other guidance on their use. [Government agencies normally promote methods that have been proven effective. There is no reason to give special consideration to methods that are marketed as \"CAM.\"]| |25.5||State governments should consider, as part of evaluating and reviewing their regulations, how regulation of CAM practitioners could affect third-party coverage of safe and effective CAM interventions. [Third party coverage is normally based on scientific merit. \"CAM\" advocates hope to promote through political means what they cannot accomplish through science.]| CAM IN WELLNESS AND HEALTH PROMOTION Recommendation 26: The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal agencies and public and private organizations should evaluate CAM practices and products that have been shown to be safe and effective to determine their potential to promote wellness and help achieve the nation's health promotion and disease prevention goals. Demonstration programs should be funded for those determined to have benefit. Actions |26.1.||The Healthy People Consortium should evaluate the role of safe and effective CAM practices and products in addressing the10 leading health indicators and develop strategies, including demonstration programs, to encourage the use of CAM practices and products found to be beneficial in addressing these indicators. [This recommendation incorrectly assumes that there are valid CAM principles and practices that the scientific community is neglecting. CAM advocates attempt to boost their credibility by including diet, nutrition, and exercise within their scope. However, the scientific mainstream has addressed these areas for decades.]| |26.2||Questions on the extent and use of CAM products and practices should be included in national surveys and other assessment tools including the National Health Interview Survey, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Where appropriate, information from these sources should be incorporated into the Healthy People 2020 goals and objectives. [It would be worthwhile to investigate the harmful impact of irrational and unsubstantiated methods. However, surveys that merely assess the \"popularity\" of such methods might make them appear more legitimate.]| |26.3||The Department of Health and Human Services, as part of the Healthy People 2010 initiative, should support the development of a national campaign to teach and encourage behaviors that focus on improving nutrition, promoting exercise, and teaching stress management for all Americans, especially children. This campaign should include safe and effective CAM practices and products where appropriate. [This is a crass attempt to equate \"CAM\" with \"healthy behaviors\" without any evidence to support such an association. There is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children. In fact, many chiropractors, naturopaths and other practitioners denigrate and oppose the proven public health measures of vaccination and fluoridation.]| |26.4||The Federal government, in partnership with public and private organizations, should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to improving nutrition, promoting exercise, and teaching stress management to children. Demonstration programs should be funded for those found to be applicable to children. [As noted in #26.3, there is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children.]| |26.5||The Health Resources and Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Education, and other Federal agencies that develop school health guidelines should evaluate the potential applicability of safe and effective CAM practices and products to these school health guidelines. Those found to have benefits should be included in the guidelines. [As noted in #26.3, there is no evidence that methods unique to \"CAM\" improve the health of children.]| |26.6||Federal agencies, in partnership with the business community, should develop incentives for schools to make lunches and snacks healthful, and to limit the sale \u2014 and eliminate the advertisin \u2014 -of high-fat snacks, soft drinks, and other products that do not contribute to healthy lifestyles. [There are valid reasons to promote good health habits to children, but this activity has nothing to do with \"CAM.\"]| |26.7||The Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products to determine their potential role in workplace wellness and prevention activities, and include them in Federal workplace wellness and health promotion programs and Federal health coverage plans when appropriate. [There is no reason to believe that this would be better than simply encouraging good health habits that have little or nothing to do with \"CAM.\" \"CAM\" programs that disparage standard care or advocate irrational methods would have a negative impact on the health of federal workers.]| |26.8||Federal agencies, in conjunction with the business community, should develop incentives for employers to include CAM practices and products found to be beneficial in wellness and prevention activities in their workplace wellness programs and health coverage. [There is no reason to believe that this would be better than simply encouraging good health habits that have little or nothing to do with \"CAM.\" \"CAM\" programs that disparage standard care or advocate irrational methods would have a negative impact on the health of federal workers.]| Recommendation 27: Federal, State, public, and private health care delivery systems and programs should evaluate CAM practices and products to determine their applicability to programs and services that help promote wellness and health. Demonstration programs should be funded for those determined to be beneficial. Actions |27.1||The Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Veterans Affairs, and Defense and the Commissioner of the Administration for Children and Families, should evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products that contribute to wellness and health and determine their applicability to Federal health systems and programs. [This falsely assumes that many safe and effective \"CAM\" practices and products exist and need special federal promotion to gain recognition.]| |27.2||The Secretary of Health and Human Services should facilitate the bringing together of public and private health care organizations to evaluate safe and effective CAM practices and products that contribute to wellness and health and determine their applicability to health systems and programs, especially in the nation's hospitals and long-term care facilities and in programs serving the aging, those with chronic illness, and those at the end of life. [There is no logical reason to believe that adding \"CAM\" services to health systems or programs would make such programs more effective or cost-effective. Before investing in any such research, there should be data showing that such an investment would be worthwhile.]| |27.3||CAM and conventional health professional training programs should consider offering training and educational opportunities for students in self-care and lifestyle decision-making to improve practitioners' health and to enable practitioners to impart this knowledge to their patients or clients. [Conventional training and public health programs already offer this. There is no reason to believe that \"CAM\" practitioners have something additional to offer.]| Recommendation 28: Research on the role of CAM in wellness and health promotion, the application of CAM principles and practices, and the role of CAM practitioners in the management of chronic disease should be expanded. Actions |28.1||The Department of Health and Human Services should fund demonstration projects to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of comprehensive health promotion programs that include CAM. These studies should include underserved and special populations. [There is no logical reason to believe that offering \"CAM\" services to underserved and special populations will enhance their health.]| |28.1||The Federal government and private health organizations should evaluate CAM practices and products that are currently being used for wellness and health promotion to determine their effectiveness and applicability to the management of chronic disease. Funding should be provided for demonstration projects in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and other Federal agencies for those CAM practices and products found to have benefit in the management of chronic disease, end of life such as hospice. [This falsely assumes that many \"CAM\" practices and products can be proven useful to chronically and terminallly ill patients and deserve special funding priority.]| COORDINATING FEDERAL EFFORTS Recommendation 29: The President, Secretary of Health and Human Services, or Congress should create an office to coordinate Federal CAM activities and to facilitate the integration into the nation's health care system of those complementary and alternative health care practices and products determined to be safe and effective. Actions |29.1||The office should be established at the highest possible and most appropriate level in the Department of Health and Human Services and should be given sufficient staff and budget to meet its responsibilities. [It would be absurd to create an \"office at the highest possible level\" to promote so-called CAM. Doing that would constitute a government endorsement of homeopathy, therapeutic touch, cranial osteopathy, rebirthing and many other preposterous practices that have been embraced by one or more members of Commission.]| |29.2||The office should charter an advisory council. Members should include CAM and conventional practitioners with expertise, diverse backgrounds, and necessary training, as well as representatives of both the private and public sectors, to guide and advise the office about its activities. [Previous advisory councils have been composed almost entirely of \"CAM\" advocates and have included few if any knowledgeable critics.]| |29.3||The office's responsibilities should include, but not be limited to, coordinating Federal CAM activities; serving as a Federal CAM policy liaison with conventional health care and CAM professionals, organizations, institutions, and commercial ventures; planning, facilitating, and convening conferences, workshops, and advisory groups; acting as a centralized Federal point of contact regarding CAM for the public, CAM practitioners, conventional health care providers, and the media; facilitating implementation of the Commission's recommendations and actions; and exploring additional and emerging topics not considered by the Commission.|[WHCCAMP Analysis Index](https://www.quackwatch.org/07PoliticalActivities/WHC/00.html) ||| [Quackwatch Home Page](https://www.quackwatch.org/index.html)This article was posted on March 25, 2002.

CAM includes the worldviews, theories, modalities, products, and practices associated with these systems and their use to treat illness and promote health and well-being. Although heterogeneous, the major CAM systems have many common characteristics, including a focus on individualizing treatments, treating the whole person, promoting self-care and self-healing, and recognizing the spiritual nature of each individual.

[Comments in red by Stephen Barrett, MD and Timothy N. Gorski, MD, FACOG]Complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM, can be defined as a group of medical, health care, and healing systems other than those included in mainstream health care in the United States. CAM includes the worldviews, theories, modalities, products, and practices associated with these systems and their use to treat illness and promote health and well-being. Although heterogeneous, the major CAM systems have many common characteristics, including a focus on individualizing treatments, treating the whole person, promoting self-care and self-healing, and recognizing the spiritual nature of each individual. [These are buzzwords used for marketing purposes. No studies have demonstrated that \"CAM\" practitioners actually do more than conventional practitioners to \"individualize treatments,\" \"treat the whole person,\" \"promote self-healing,\" or do more than conventional practitioners to \"recognize individual spirituality.\" In addition, many CAM systems have characteristics commonly found in mainstream health care, such as a focus on good nutrition and preventive practices. [\"CAM\" versions of nutrition and preventive care often include bogus diagnostic tests, inappropriate ecommendations for dietary supplements, and fad dietary strategies. In addition, large percentages of chiropractors, naturopaths, and various other \"CAM\" advocates do not recommend vaccination. \"CAM\" advocates have added almost nothing useful to mainstream nutrition or public health practices.] Unlike mainstream medicine, CAM often lacks or has only limited experimental and clinical study; however, scientific investigation of CAM is beginning to address this knowledge gap. Thus, boundaries between CAM and mainstream medicine, as well as among different CAM systems, are often blurred and are constantly changing. [This is a gross exaggeration. \"CAM\" research has produced almost nothing of value.] Examples of the health care systems, practices, and products typically classified as CAM in the United States are listed in Table 1. |Major Domains of CAM Examples Under Each Domain||Examples Under Each Domain| |Alternative health care systems||Ayurvedic medicine | Chiropractic Homeopathic medicine Native American medicine (e.g., sweat lodge, medicine wheel) Naturopathic medicine Traditional Chinese Medicine (e.g., acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine) |Mind-Body interventions||Meditation | Hypnosis Guided imagery Dance therapy Music therapy Art therapy Prayer and mental healing |Biological based therapies||Herbal therapies | Special diets (e.g. macrobiotics, extremely low-fat or high carbohydrate diets) Orthomolecular medicine (e.g., megavitamin therapy) Individual biological therapies (e.g., shark cartilage, bee pollen) |Therapeutic Massage, | Body Work, and Somatic Movement Therapies |Massage | Feldenkrais Alexander Method |Energy Therapies||Qigong | Reiki Therapeutic Touch |Bioelectromagnetics||Magnet therapy| Many of the CAM systems of health care listed in Table 1 have evolved from the collective clinical experiences of many practitioners over generations of practice, such as in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Others have evolved from the clinical experiences of a single practitioner or small groups of practitioners who have developed a particular intervention. [A few would be more properly described as part of conventional care. Some of are so irrational that further study is not needed to conclude that they should be abandoned.] Despite their diversity, there are some common threads that run among many traditional systems of health care as well as systems that have emerged more recently. These similarities include an emphasis on whole systems, the promotion of self-care and the stimulation of self-healing processes, the integration of mind and body, the spiritual nature of illness and healing, and the prevention of illness by enhancing the vital energy, or subtle forces, in the body [1]. [\"Promotion of self healing\" and \"enhancing vital energy\" are quack concepts that cannot be demonstrated.] Convergence of CAM and Mainstream Healthcare Some of the common threads that run through CAM health care systems also are part of mainstream, or conventional, health care. For example, conventional medicine has a long tradition of being concerned with preventing disease as evidenced by the development of programs for immunizations, healthier mothers and babies, family planning, safer and healthier foods, fluoridation of drinking water, control of infectious diseases, reducing deaths from heart disease and stroke, decreasing the use of tobacco products, and promoting motor vehicle safety and safer workplaces [2]. [The idea that \"CAM\" health care generally advocates a broad specturm of preventive and public health measures is a flat lie. Only about a third of chiropractors advocate immunization and two national chiropractic organizations strongly oppose it. Naturopaths do not generally support immunization and fluoridation. None \"CAM\" organizations has aggressively attacked the problem of tobacco use. Some \"CAM\" advocates promote concepts of \"safer foods\" that encourage consumers to waste money buying \"orgnically grown\" products.] Mainstream or conventional health care also has long-recognized that good nutrition and exercise are important components of a healthy lifestyle [3,4]. There also is a growing recognition within conventional health care that biopsychosocial and spiritual factors may play an important role in promoting health and preventing illness [5,6]. The difference between conventional and CAM health care systems in many of these areas, however, is one of emphasis. [No surveys have demonstrated that this assertion is true or that the lnutrition strategies advocated by \"CAM\" practitioners are valid. With respect to chiropractors, for example, many of their publications and continung education courses make false of improbable claims for a wide variety of dietary supplement products; but their publications and programs almost never contain information about dietary guidelines or cholesterol management.] In part, because of the many technological advances that have occurred in conventional health care over the years (see Recent History of CAM section, below), pharmacological, surgical, and other technological approaches have come to dominate conventional health care. While acknowledged, prevention and wellness promotion have been underemphasized. For example, according to a recent report by the Nutrition Education Consortium, the teaching of nutrition in medical schools and residency programs remains \"woefully inadequate,\" [7] and a survey by Cooksey et al. [8] found that most medical schools do not have faculty trained specifically in nutrition. As a result of this lack of training in nutrition in medical education, many practicing physicians are not adequately prepared to provide nutrition counseling to their patients. However, registered dieticians and clinical nutritionists are employed by hospitals and clinics. These are the specialists who are trained in this area and are well established in the conventional health care system. Because many CAM approaches often focus on prevention rather than cure [9], they have come to be identified with wellness and self-care. [Note that the citation for this highly questionable statement is a book written by WCCAMP's chairman, James S. Gordon.] This may be a reflection of history, as effective treatments for many of the infections and severe injuries that occurred were lacking. Traditional systems were better able to strengthen the individual and attempt to prevent disease than to treat many of the illnesses that killed millions even one hundred years ago. This is not to imply that CAM systems of health care are more effective than conventional health care in promoting health and preventing illness, as many have not been scientifically shown to prevent disease or promote health. [It is clearly intended to imply that \"CAM\" practitioners are doing more than maintstream practitioners.] The perception that conventional health care emphasizes high technology approaches to treating patients, while CAM health care emphasizes low technology approaches to promoting health and preventing disease, has led some to suggest that conventional and CAM health care may eventually converge to form a new health care system that integrates the best of each [10]. However, there are not only scientific, but also educational, regulatory, and political obstacles to integration of the two systems. [This falsely implies that \"CAM health care\" is a system. \"Integrated is merely another term for \"complementary.\"] Evolution of CAM Terminology As interest in and use of non-mainstream health care practices has evolved in this country over the past several decades, the terminology used to describe CAM systems, practices, and products has had to evolve accordingly. Rather than focus on what these \"other\" health care systems are not (i.e., \"unorthodox, \"unconventional,\" or \"unscientific\"), more recent terminology has begun to focus on what these systems are and how they might be used. [The new terminology, of course, is more deceptive.] For example, because many consumers appeared to be using unconventional health care practices as alternatives to conventional health care, the term \"alternative medicine\" was widely adopted in the United States and Europe in the later 1980s [11,12]. This perception, however, was largely dispelled by surveys in the early 1990's, which found that people were using the two systems of health care \u2014 mainstream and alternative \u2014 simultaneously [13,14]. [\"Alternative\" is not a system. It is a marketing term intended to make people believe that unproven methods are genuine alternatives. These surveys found that health care consumers were accessing a range of therapeutic and preventive options, both alternative and conventional, to essentially \"complement\" one another. [That phraseology is used to dignify the word \"complementary.\"] As a result, the term \"complementary medicine\" was widely adopted not long afterwards to describe systems of health care and individual therapies that people used as adjuncts to their conventional health care [15,16]. [As far as we can tell, the original suggested meaning was the use of both \"alternative\" and established methods, using the best of both. This did not actually describe what \"CAM\" practitioners did but enabled them to pretend that they offered something extra rather than something useless.] A more recent and detailed survey conducted by Astin [17] has found that, although many unconventional therapies were being used to complement mainstream medical care, some were being used instead of conventional medical care. These data suggested that the term \"complementary\" was only partially descriptive of what was occurring in the marketplace. To acknowledge this dichotomy, Congress adopted the phrase \"complementary and alternative medicine\" and applied it to the National Institutes of Health's National Center on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), when the Office of Alternative Medicine was elevated to the status of a coordinating research \"Center\" in 1999. Even this terminology is unsatisfactory to many because it does not reflect emerging models of health care that have arisen in the overlapping areas between these various systems. [This statement is meaningless because \"CAM\" is a hodgepodge, not a \"system.\"] Nor does it account for the fact that health care systems, practices, and products that are not widely accepted or readily available in one part of the United States may be fully accepted and easily available in another. Members of the Commission considered other terms, such as \"integrative health care,\" \" collaborative health care,\" \"comprehensive health care,\" and \"\"holistic health care,\" but chose to use the term \"complementary and alternative medicine\" because it is used in the President's Executive Order and is widely recognized by the media and in the scientific literature. To fully understand the complexities of CAM as well as its current relationship with conventional health care in this country, it is necessary to understand its recent history, its current status, and future prospects, including emerging models of integrative and collaborative care. Recent History of CAM in the United States The history of CAM in the U.S. is a long, complex story that has been shaped by scientific, economic, and social factors. A detailed rendering of this history is beyond the scope of this report. This section instead provides a brief overview of the more recent developments that have helped shape the present status of CAM in this country and its prospects for contributing to the health and well being of our nation. Early American health care consisted of an eclectic mix of systems. In fact, until the middle of the 19th century, the vast majority of primary medical care in this country was provided by botanical healers, midwives, chiropractors, homeopaths, and an assortment of other lay healers offering a variety herbs and nostrums for a range of illnesses [18-20]. This began to change in the latter part of the 19th century, however, with the development and validation of the germ theory and significant scientific advances in antiseptic techniques, anesthesia, and surgery. Beginning in the late 1800s and lasting until the early 20th century there also was a major revolution in medical education that helped scientific medicine evolve into the dominant health care system in this country. This revolution in medical education began with the publication of William Osler's (1847-1919) textbook, The Principles and Practice of Medicine in 1892, which brought diagnostic clarity to medical practice. By 1905 Osler's textbook was the primary medical textbook in the vast majority of U.S. medical schools [21]. This revolution culminated with the release of a report by Abraham Flexner in 1910 [22] that served to crystallize the educational reform movement. After the release of the Flexner report, many medical institutions that did not meet its standards were driven out of business or forced to implement significantly more rigorous training programs [21]. Schools for many unorthodox healing systems either ceased to exist or became marginalized [20]. The isolation and elaboration of life-saving hormones, sulfa drugs, and other antibiotics in the early and middle of the 20th century, conventional medicine cemented its place as the nation's preeminent form of health care in this country. Although most of the other health care systems and their therapies did not disappear, they were considered by most of the public and the mainstream medical community to be unscientific relics of the past. As a result, many were practiced in relative obscurity. With the reduced threat of infectious diseases and other acute illnesses, conventional medicine began turned its focus to the more complex and costly problems of chronic, degenerative illnesses. As a result of public health interventions developed earlier in the 20th century, people began living significantly longer. This gradual aging of the population began to significantly increase the prevalence of chronic conditions, such as arthritis, back pain, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and cancer, putting further pressure on conventional medicine to address these conditions. As the health care system developed more sophisticated means of diagnosing and managing chronic illnesses, the cost of health care began to rise dramatically. Between 1965 and 1975, national health care expenditures more than tripled, rising from just over $41 billion to nearly $130 billion. Although employers and government programs covered some of these increases, out-of-pocket expenditures more than doubled during this same period [23]. Since then costs have continued to rise, with national health care expenditures reaching more than $1.2 trillion in 2000, the latest year for which such figures are available, and they are expected to reach more than $2.6 trillion by 2010. It was during this time of increasing rates of chronic illness and escalating health care costs that medical pluralism began to reemerge in this country. This reemergence was spurred on by a number of overlapping and sometimes interrelated movements. [A major factor was the deveopment of television, which enabled promoters of quackery to reach large audiences.] Beginning in the 1950s, the whole foods and dietary supplement movements began to change Americans' view of food as not only something they needed to stay alive but also as potential therapeutic agents. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Americans were increasingly exposed to a variety of traditional health care systems from foreign and indigenous cultures, many of which dated back to antiquity [24]. New York Times writer James Reston's account of his emergency appendectomy in a Chinese hospital during then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's visit to China in 1971 was particularly influential in this process [25]. Reston's article described how his postoperative pain and discomfort were relieved by acupuncture and herbs. For most Americans, this was their first glimpse of Traditional Chinese Medicine and its potential uses. During this same period, the growing \"counterculture\" movement in America sparked a fascination with the religious and philosophical traditions of Asian cultures. Transcendental Meditation, which is derived from Hinduism, became widely known and practiced [25]. Meanwhile, there was a growing interest in indigenous health care traditions, such as Native American and Mexican-American health care practices, particularly their reliance on herbs and natural substances. This movement, in turn, led to a renewed interest in \"natural\" health care movements that had developed in this country in the 19th century but had been relegated to the background of the American health care landscape. The late 1970s saw the emergence of the holistic health care movement in this country. Holistic practice (holism comes from the Greek word \"holos\" or \"whole\") emphasized an attention to the whole person, including the physical, spiritual, psychological, and ecological dimensions of healing. Holistic health care incorporates practices and concepts of Eastern philosophy and diverse cultural traditions, including acupuncture and the use of herbs, massage, and relaxation techniques as well as conventional medical practices [26]. It gained its greatest following among nurses [27]. However, many physicians, particularly those in the new specialty of family medicine, also became interested in this movement. [The percentage of physicians who claimed to practice \"holistic medicine\" is probably less than 1%.] The American Holistic Medical and Nurses Associations were formed, large professional and public conferences held, and a number of holistic medical clinics and holistic health centers opened. The late 1970s and early 1980s also was a time when a variety of self-care movements emerged; they offered programs or sponsored events to help individuals and families increase wellness or reduce their risk of onset of illness through diet or lifestyle changes [28,29]. The years since then have been a particularly active time for the personal fitness movement, which increasingly is making use of the techniques of other systems of healing, such as yoga, tai chi, and massage [30]. [These are relaxation tchniques and have little or nothing to do with fitness.] The Current Status of CAM in the United States Today, use of CAM approaches and therapies is more prevalent in a number of patient populations in the Unites States, no matter how narrowly or broadly it is defined. Physicians, hospitals, and other conventional health care organizations also are showing a growing interest in CAM. Although such prevalence of use and interest in CAM is not an indication that these practices are effective, it does suggest that those with chronic conditions and the physicians who treat them are looking for more therapeutic options than are widely available in conventional health care settings. Indeed, for some chronic conditions, state-of-the-art conventional therapies have provided only modest gains. For example, according to a number of assessments over the years, expensive mainstream health care approaches to managing chronic lower back pain often have not been very effective [31-36]. This is perhaps why individuals with back pain are some of the most frequent users of CAM practices. [It would be more appropriate to say that many people undergo spinal manipulation for back pain.] Consumer Use of CAM Practices Because of the dramatic increase in the prevalence of chronic conditions, the past decade has witnessed an acceleration both in consumer interest in and use of CAM practices and/or products. Surveys indicate that those with the most serious and debilitating medical conditions, such as cancer, chronic pain, and HIV, tend to be the most frequent users of CAM practices. CAM usage also appears to be high among certain ethnic populations that have access to their traditional forms of healing. CAM and Cancer A survey that assessed both the prevalence and predictors of CAM use in a comprehensive cancer center population where all were using conventional therapies found that 63 percent had used at least one CAM approach other than a spiritual practice. Women with cancer were more likely to use CAM than men with cancer, and those patients who had surgery, chemotherapy, or both were more likely to use CAM than cancer patients who had neither [37]. Another survey of almost 2,000 tumor registry patients selected at random found that 75 percent had used at least one CAM modality.38 The most frequently used therapies among this group of cancer patients were nutritional approaches (63 percent), massage (53 percent), and herbs (44 percent). The most common reason patients gave for using CAM was to \"stimulate an immune response\" (73 percent). Breast cancer patients were significantly more likely to be consistent users of CAM therapies compared to patients with tumors in other sites areas of the body (84 percent versus 66 percent, respectively). The majority of cancer patients (63 percent) enrolled in clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health used at least one CAM therapy, with an average use of two therapies per person [39]. This same study found that the most frequently utilized therapies were spiritual approaches, relaxation, imagery, exercise, lifestyle, diet (e.g., macrobiotic, vegetarian), and nutritional supplementation therapies. Patients unanimously believed that these CAM treatments helped to improve their quality of life by helping them cope more effectively with stress, decreasing their discomforts related to treatment and the illness itself, and giving them a better sense of control. A similar pattern of CAM usage has been found among men with prostate cancer, with 42 percent of those surveyed using vitamins, prayer or religious practices, and herbs to treat their condition [40]. Most of the men in this survey did not report their use of CAM to their physicians. Most of these surveys included prayer and spirituality under CAM. Many people that attend churches, synagogues, or mosques or other religious entities do not believe that this is essential information for their physician and would not feel compelled to share this information with their physician. On the other hand, the use of botanicals and other dietary supplements during cancer treatment would be a concern if the physician were unaware that their patient was using these products. CAM and Chronic Pain A recent national survey by Astin [17] found that back problems were the most common medical condition (24 percent) for which people reported using CAM treatments. In this survey, neck problems also were associated with frequent use of CAM. Other studies have found that one-third of all patients suffering from back pain choose chiropractors over physicians to treat them, and that chiropractors provided 40 percent of primary care for back pain [41,42]. Moreover, these studies found that chiropractors retained a greater proportion of their patients (92 percent) for subsequent episodes of back pain care than did other providers. Similarly, Krauss and colleagues [43 ] found that CAM practitioners and products were chosen more often than conventional physicians and therapies by those persons with chronic pain (52 versus 34 percent) and headaches (51 versus 19 percent ), as well as by persons suffering from other associated maladies, including depression (34 versus 25 percent), anxiety (42 versus 13 percent), and insomnia (32 versus 16 percent). Surveys of rheumatology patients have found similarly high CAM utilization rates, ranging between 19 and 63 percent, depending on the type and severity of their condition [44]. Other studies have documented that people with painful chronic conditions, including arthritis and headache, and psychological problems (insomnia, depression, and anxiety) are frequent users of CAM therapies, particularly massage, chiropractic, and acupuncture [13,45]. CAM and HIV Infection A recent study of 1,675 HIV-positive men and women using CAM (usually in addition to conventional medication) found that the most frequently reported CAM substances were high doses of vitamin C (63 percent), multiple vitamin and mineral supplements (54 percent), vitamin E (53 percent), and garlic (53 percent).46 The health practitioners most commonly consulted were massage therapists (49 percent), acupuncturists (45 percent), and nutritionists (37 percent). The CAM activities most commonly used were aerobic exercise (63 percent), prayer (58 percent), massage (53 percent), and meditation (46 percent). The majority of this group of HIV-infected individuals consulted with both conventional and CAM providers and used both conventional and CAM medications simultaneously, yet few reported that their conventional and CAM providers worked as a team. Similar observations were made in a survey of 180 HIV-infected people [47]. This study found that almost half (45 percent) of this group had visited a CAM practitioner an average of 12 times per year, compared to only 7 visits per year to their conventional physician or nurse practitioner. More than two-thirds (68 percent) of the HIV-infected individuals in the study used herbs, vitamins, or dietary supplements. Eighty-one percent of those who used supplements said the remedies were \"extremely\" or \"quite a bit\" helpful. Approximately 24 percent reported using marijuana to treat weight loss, nausea, and vomiting in the previous year, and most (87 percent) said it was extremely or quite helpful. Ethnic Differences in CAM Usage In addition to the type and severity of illness one has, people's cultural and ethnic backgrounds can influence their propensity for using CAM. For example, surveys of CAM usage among Mexican-American and Hispanic populations have demonstrated that almost half of respondents have used a CAM practitioner one or more times during the previous year [48,49]. Herbal medicine, spiritual healing techniques, and traditional healers are used quite frequently by these groups. Similarly, surveys of Native American populations have found that they tend to have higher rates of CAM usage than the general U.S. population [50] and are also frequent users of herbal remedies, spiritual healing techniques, and traditional healers.51 Income, not belief systems, prohibits interaction with traditional healers by Native Americans [51]. Reasons People Give for Using CAM The reasons people seek out and use CAM practices are not fully understood. However, strong associations have been found between CAM usage and: 1) an interest in spirituality and personal growth, 2) a commitment to environmentalism, and 3) feminism [16]. In addition, several other studies have found that belief in a holistic approach to health, a strong internal locus of control, and transformational life experiences also are associated with CAM usage [17,52,53]. [The most likely reason that people seek \"CAM\" treatment is misleading publicity.] Although Astin's survey [17] found that only a small percentage (4.4 percent) of people used CAM therapies as alternatives to conventional practitioners and treatments, there is some evidence that they used CAM because they believed it is more effective than conventional medicine. For example, in the survey of rheumatology clinic patients mentioned above [54], 50 percent of respondents reported turning to CAM because they perceived their conventional treatment (drugs) as ineffective. Similarly, when researchers interviewed 113 patients at a family practice, the top reason given for to seeking CAM therapies was that patients believed they would work [54]. A similar study of primary care patients found that: 1) recommendations from friends or coworkers, 2) a desire to avoid the side effects of conventional treatments, and 3) failure of conventional treatments to cure a problem were the most frequently cited reasons for using CAM therapies [55]. In this study, use of practitioner-based CAM therapies was significantly and independently associated with patients' perceived poor health status and emotional functioning and a musculoskeletal disorder, usually low back pain. Patients who used CAM most commonly visited chiropractic (35 percent), used herbal remedies and supplements (27 percent), and sought massage therapy (17 percent). Use of self-care-based therapies was associated with high education and poor perceived general health compared to the previous year. Use of traditional folk remedies was associated with Hispanic ethnicity. Conventional Health Care's Interest in and Use of CAM Evidence suggests that a growing number of physicians already use some CAM practices and consider them safe and effective in offering them to their patients. A comprehensive review of 25 surveys of physician practices and beliefs regarding five commonly used CAM practices \u2014 acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, herbal medicine, and massage \u2014 found that about half of the surveyed physicians believed in the efficacy of these five CAM practices [56]. This study found that a significant proportion of conventional physicians were both referring patients to CAM practitioners and/or offering some of these CAM treatments in their practice. [This paragraph greatly exaggerates the significance of \"comprehensive reviuew.\" Only two of the 25 studies were done within the United States. One of these found very low beliefs, ranging from 49% favoring chiropractic to only 1% believing in homeopathy. The other survey took place at \"family practice\" seminar where many participants expressed interest and belief in the five practices. However, 27.2% of them said that they practiced chiropractic, which means that a many of the responders were not medical doctors but were chiropractors. Thus the published data were meaningless.] In addition, Pelletier and colleagues [57] found that a small, but growing number of insurance companies are offering or are considering coverage for CAM services. [The raw numbers are misleading, because \"CAM\" coverage is typically limited andx offered at extra cost.] CAM also has made significant inroads into conventional medical education, with more than two-thirds of mainstream medical schools currently offering elective courses in CAM or including CAM topics in required courses [58]. However, the acceptance of some CAM practices by the conventional health care community did not come without economic and political power struggles. [The \"power struggles\" did not lead to acceptance.] CAM practitioners have filed suit and won court cases against conventional health care professional associations [59], and in many states CAM professions have faced strong opposition from conventional health care organizations in gaining licensing from state regulatory agencies [60]. Evidence Base for CAM Surveys documenting the rise of interest in and use of CAM by consumers were a significant factor in the biomedical research community's decision to take a serious look at both the safety and efficacy of many CAM approaches and therapies. [Third refers to the establishement of the NIH Office of Unconventional Medicine, which evolved into the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Its establishment had nothing to do with any rise in consumer interest in \"CAM.\" It reasulted from persuading Senator Tom Harkin that the scientific research community was unfairly neglecting research on alleged cancer cures. Harkin has sufficient politcal clout to control legislation related to NIH funding. Harkin was also a key figure in establishing the WHCCAMP.] Federal expenditures for CAM research have risen dramatically since the early 1990s. To date, NCCAM has funded the establishment of 14 research centers to explore the safety and efficacy of a wide range of CAM therapies for a host of conditions. As a result of these and other international efforts, the evidence base for the efficacy a number of CAM approaches and treatments has grown significantly over the past decade. [Regardless of the size of this so-called evidence base, the number of \"CAM\" methods that have been proven safe, effective, and cost-effective is close to zero.] More research on CAM currently exists than is commonly recognized. In fact, the Cochrane Collaboration, an international effort to develop an evidence base for a wide variety of medical therapies, both allopathic and CAM, lists more than 4,000 randomized trials for various CAM therapies in its electronic library. [The number depends on what is included in one's definition of \"CAM.\"] Furthermore, a number of Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews of this worldwide research literature have identified the potential benefits [What is a \"potential\" benefit?] of CAM and related approaches and products for a small number of chronic conditions, including: - Low-fat or modified fat diets for preventing cardiovascular disease [61] - Acupuncture in the management of low back pain and recurrent headaches [62,63] - St John's Wort for treating mild to moderate depression [64] - Herbal and glucosamine therapy for treating osteoarthritis [65,66] - Nutritional supplements for several neurological conditions [67,68] In addition to these Cochrane systematic reviews, an NIH scientific review panel concluded that acupuncture is a plausible option for treating several conditions, including nausea associated with chemotherapy and anesthesia, acute dental pain, headaches, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, fibromyalgia, and depression [69]. [That panel, like this Commission, was stacked with advocates who wrote a loosely worded and poorly reasoned report. Its exact words were that \"acupuncture may be useful. . . .\"] Another NIH review panel concluded that that mind-body techniques, such as meditation and guided imagery, are effective both in the management of painful conditions and the relief of stress and anxiety [70]. All of these literature reviews have concluded that larger, more rigorous studies are needed before definitive statements can be made about the benefits of these therapies. [This seems to be the standard conclusion whenever \"CAM\" research is done.] These data, nevertheless, point to the need for a comprehensive and aggressive research program in several areas of CAM, particularly those areas where CAM practices and products are frequently used adjunctively to mainstream medical care [71]. [Research priorities should be based on the likelhood of useful results, not where methods are popular.] The interaction of conventional and CAM health care systems over the years has made such a research program possible by producing significant improvements in CAM research methodology and data collection [72]. Conventional health care, in turn, has used these improved research methods to examine some CAM practices, found similarities between their practices and CAM practices, and has begun including them in comprehensive care programs [20]. [This statement is false and is not supported by reference #20, whicb says nothing whatsoever about conventional health care including CAM practices in comprehenive care programs.] Safety Issues with CAM Use Despite the promising evidence that some CAM practices may be effective in managing and treating certain chronic conditions, most CAM therapies that are currently being used by consumers have not been studied adequately in regard to either efficacy or safety [73,74]. Even when evidence indicates that a particular CAM approach or modality is safe and effective for a particular condition, new safety concerns may arise when it is used in conjunction with conventional medications, which is the way most consumers use CAM. Even when evidence indicates that a particular CAM approach is safe and effective for a certain condition, new safety concerns may arise when it is used in conjunction with conventional medications, which is the way most consumers use them. A recent review published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that some commonly used herbal products can cause serious complications for surgery patients [75]. The potential complications included bleeding, cardiovascular instability, hypoglycemia, and there was evidence that some herbs may increase the strength of anesthetics or the metabolism of many drugs used during and after surgery. The potential adverse interaction of CAM and conventional treatments is particularly troubling to public health officials because most people do not tell their conventional health care providers that they are using CAM services or products. [Even if they did, there is little reason to believe that they would be safer.] A survey of health food stores customers found that although these CAM consumers welcomed a partnership with their physicians, they generally believed that physicians in general were closed-minded and had little knowledge about dietary supplements [54]. [Distrust of the medical profession is probably higher among people who shop in health food store sthan among those who do not.] These consumers had decided to assess the effectiveness of dietary supplements through personal study and subjective experimentation and not discuss this experimentation with their doctors. A similar lack of communication regarding CAM has been found between cancer patients and their physicians. For example, in a survey of women with breast cancer, Adler and Fosket [76] found that the majority of respondents (55 to 85 percent) used CAM therapies but did not divulge this use to their physicians because they assumed the physicians would not be interested, would respond negatively, would not understand, or would dominate the conversation due to assumed disinterest. Another survey found that physicians were unaware of CAM usage by the majority (57 percent) of their patients [77]. These studies suggest that physicians and patients must become more knowledgeable about the potential benefits and harms of CAM approaches and treatments, and physicians and other conventional health professionals must make significant efforts to open the lines of communication with their patients about their use of CAM approaches and products. Recently, a major effort has been made to increase conventional physicians' awareness and understanding of CAM through educational programs. However, there is a great deal of variability in the content of these programs [58]. [Reference #58 refers to courses taught to medical students. The vast majority of these courses are of low-quality.] Although a few provide detailed information on potential CAM benefits and safety issues, most are too general in content to provide physicians with the knowledge base they need to feel more comfortable about the subject and to display a willingness to discuss CAM issues with their patients. [In other words, most of the \"CAM\" courses taught at medical schools are worthless.] Concerns about the safety of CAM products and their interaction take place in the context of the larger public attention to the side effects and problems accompanying all medical treatment [78]. Future Prospects of CAM Despite the increasing use and acceptance of CAM and emerging evidence supporting efficacy of some CAM approaches and therapies, it is difficult to predict whether many CAM systems and practices will ever be fully integrated into the conventional health care system. Although a significantly greater degree of cooperation between specific CAM and conventional health care approaches and practitioners in the future, how well they can integrate their practices depends to a great measure on the establishment of an evidence-base for safety and effectiveness of CAM approaches as well as the success of a variety of ongoing pilot programs to test the efficacy and feasibility of integrative and collaborative models of CAM and conventional health care delivery. Models of Integration Over the past few years, a growing number of hospitals, major academic medical centers, managed care companies, and insurance carriers have become interested in integrating some aspects of CAM into their operations. [The primaty driving force has been economic rather than scientific.] According to the American Hospital Association [79], nearly 16 percent of America's community hospitals offered CAM services in 2000, up from about 11 percent in 1999. Furthermore, many major medical centers, particularly comprehensive care cancer centers such as M. D. Anderson in Houston, Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center and Columbia -Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, have begun integrating CAM services into all of their patient care [80]. [We doubt that \"CAM\" services are part of \"all\" patient care.] However, the development of integrative health care is still in its early stages and faces a number of challenges. Many of these approaches are still without an adequate scientific basis. [No, most of these practices have no scientific basis.] Even where there is evidence of benefit, the delivery of CAM in a conventional health care setting often requires significant reconfigurations of the way both the conventional and CAM health care services are structured, conceptualized, and delivered [82.83]. Another significant challenge facing integration is many CAM practitioners' belief that they would have to dramatically alter or water down their approach to practice in order to adapt to a physician-dominated system. Some CAM professions would prefer not to integrate if it means giving up their identity and independence [20]. Models of Collaboration Another model that is being tested in a number of conventional academic and CAM health care centers is collaborative model rather than an integrative one. This model does not require full integration of services but instead is based on conventional and CAM practitioners referring patients to one another within a clinic or network. The models that are currently being pilot tested range from having conventional and CAM practitioners working side-by-side as equals, collaborating both in the diagnosis and treatment of patient conditions [10], to having to physician-centered models, where CAM practitioners provide services independently but under the supervision of a primary or a specialty care physician [83]. These models, however, reveal additional challenges, which are listed below. Meeting Challenges As noted, many of these integrative and collaborative programs are in their infancy. As they grow and develop, they face a number of challenges, including addressing: - Difficulties in communicating and significant differences in worldviews and methods of diagnosing and treating illness and promoting health; - Certification and training standards for some CAM professions; - Insurance reimbursement for safe and effective CAM practices; - Appropriate research models; - Comprehensive information on CAM for both the lay public and health care practitioners; and, - Appropriate education of both conventional and CAM professionals about each other's disciplines at all stages of their training. [This falsely assumes that closer association would lead to greater acceptence of \"CAM practices.\" In the following chapters, the Commission discusses these and other challenges in depth and recommends strategies for addressing them at the national and state level. The ways in which individual practitioners and programs meet these challenges will help to shape the future of CAM practice and determine the access people have to CAM services.

Gorski, MD, FACOG]Since the public utilizes both conventional health care and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), the Commission believes that this reality should be reflected in the education and training of all health practitioners. [Appropriate education would inform students that homeopathy is worthless, chiropractic \"subluxations\" are delusions, the flow of \"chi\" through \"acupuncture meridians\" is a nonsensical concept, and chelation therapy doesn't work. It is safe to assume that the Commission does not have this type of reality in mind.] Thus, the education and training of conventional health professions should include CAM, and the education and training of CAM practitioners should include conventional health care. The result will be conventional providers who can discuss CAM with their patients and clients, provide guidance on CAM use, collaborate with CAM practitioners, and make referrals to them, as well as CAM practitioners who can communicate and collaborate with conventional providers and make referrals to them. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities.] Reaching this goal will require development of CAM faculty, curricula, and programs at both CAM and conventional institutions. Because of increased consumer demand for CAM services and products, national curricular elements should be established for CAM education and training. However, the Commission recognizes the barriers to and voluntary nature of such national curricular elements. An evaluation should be undertaken of whether postgraduate training should be established for appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners. Continuing education programs should be developed for and required of all practitioners who provide CAM services and products. Finally, students of CAM want to participate in loan and scholarship programs, and it is important that this participation be evaluated. [This falsely assumes that there are enough useful \"CAM\" methods to warrant special emphasis.] Recommendation 10: The education and training of CAM and conventional practitioners should be designed to ensure public safety, improve health, and increase the availability of qualified and knowledgeable CAM and conventional practitioners and enhance the collaboration among them. Education in CAM for Conventional Health Care Professionals In 1995, a national conference on complementary and alternative therapy education recommended that CAM be included in nursing and medical education [1]. Although there has been notable progress in introducing CAM into medical, nursing, and other fields of conventional health care education in recent years, more needs to be done. [The main needs is to make sure that the information presented is accurate.] For example, in 1997, 64 percent of allopathic medical schools reported offering elective courses in CAM or including such topics in required courses [2]. Data from all 125 allopathic medical schools in response to the 2000-2001 Liaison Committee on Medical Education Annual Medical School Questionnaire indicate that although no medical school requires a separate CAM course, 91 schools include CAM in required conventional medical courses, 64 offer CAM as stand-alone elective, and 32 include CAM as part of an elective. Required and elective courses included acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, meditation, manual healing techniques, nutritional supplement therapy, and spirituality, according to the questionnaire. (Table 1). - Table 1. CAM Topics Included in Required or Elective Courses at Medical Schools Accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. Topics Required Course Only Elective Course Only Both Acupuncture 18 54 28 Herbal medicine 28 45 33 Homeopathy 17 48 18 Meditation 13 53 17 Manual healing techniques 15 50 11 Nutritional supplement therapy 30 42 36 Spirituality 25 43 35 - Source: 2000-2001 Liaison Committee on Medical Education Annual Medical School Questionnaire. More than one response could be chosen, so the total number of responses does not equal the number of respondents. In a study of an allopathic medical school with no formal or elective courses in CAM, third-year medical students were found to have insufficient knowledge about the safety of 10 common CAM modalities [3]. These modalities included massage therapy, herbal medicine, meditation, chiropractic, hypnosis, spiritual healing, acupuncture, homeopathy, reflexology, and naturopathy. The authors of this study recommended including CAM topics in the medical school curriculum to better prepare the practicing physician for soliciting information from patients about current CAM use, responding to patients' inquiries about CAM, and assessing the merit of introducing a CAM modality into, or removing it from patients' care plans. [An accurate picture of these practices could be provided in a 2-hour session that highlights the irrational practices that most of them involve.] Courses in CAM offered at conventional medical schools differ widely in content, format, and requirements [4]. In light of this variation, consensus needs to be reached on the essentials of a core curriculum [1]. In November 2000, the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation convened a conference to develop guidelines for teaching CAM in medical and other health professional schools. The participants concluded that efforts to expand knowledge about CAM should extend beyond the education of medical students to all conventional health professionals [5]. Addressing the myriad conventional health professions and programs will require a range of educational options. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities.] CAM Conventional Health Care Professions Curricula While CAM can be taught in stand-alone courses, it may be more effectively and efficiently integrated into allopathic medical school curricula by combining it with current initiatives such as evidenced-based medicine, cultural competence, and interdisciplinary collaboration. CAM in medical education has evolved to the point where two fundamental questions need to be answered: What should be taught, and how should it be taught? CAM taught in the context of conventional medical education should be evidence-based [6]. New educational programs for physicians need to be developed that include the conceptual basis of CAM practices, along with a critical review of the safety and efficacy of CAM practices and products. This information should be incorporated into required courses of medical school curricula and graduate training programs, not relegated to electives, whose content may not be critically evaluated [7]. While many CAM courses are taught from either an advocacy or neutral view, all CAM courses should be taught critically [8]. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities. Note carefully that the WHCCAMP report does not criticize any \"CAM\" method. ] Georgetown University School of Medicine plans to integrate CAM into the entire medical school curriculum as part of a recent grant from the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). [This is the home territory of WHCCAMP Chair James S. Gordon, MD. Students who are interested in getting scientific medical training would be well advised to go elsewhere.] Other innovative efforts to integrate CAM with existing medical school curricula are already underway; however, these efforts are geographically dispersed, not well known, and not systematically studied. They range from informal CAM seminars, such as brown bag lunches with CAM practitioners sponsored by student groups, to formal symposia or debates of controversial CAM issues by authorities with opposing views. While survey and other lecture courses are efficient ways of presenting a large volume of information, CAM is being integrated into a variety of courses. For example, information on acupuncture is being integrated into basic science courses, such as anatomy or physiology, as well as clinical courses, such as neurology, while herb-drug interactions are being included in pharmacology. All of these methods of teaching about CAM offer opportunities to present the history, culture, and philosophy of CAM and training of CAM practitioners as well as a critical analysis of published research on its safety and effectiveness. They also provide opportunities to communicate effectively with CAM practitioners and discuss CAM comfortably and accurately with patients. However, these didactic opportunities can be coupled with opportunities to experience CAM personally, particularly mind-body approaches and stress management, as part of self-care. This is being done at the George Washington University Center for Integrative Medicine through a Department of Education Fund for Improvement of Post-Secondary Education grant. A cogent argument for including self-care in medical education is that the health and well-being of medical students has been so neglected that by the end of their training, they often feel drained of the compassion and spirit that drew them to medicine [9]. In addition, students who learn the fundamentals of self-care will be better able to teach their patients to care for themselves. [There is no reason to believe that \"CAM\" education will provide any useful self-care measure that is not included in conventional medical training. Nor is there good reason to believe that relaxation exercises are an important part of self-care.] Medical education should include opportunities to experience CAM approaches, such as meditation and relaxation therapy, for students who personally may benefit from these approaches during their stressful journey through medical school. [This assumes that many students will benefit from these. No evidence to support this assumption is cited.] Postgraduate and Continuing Education Although the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine has published suggested curriculum guidelines on CAM and recommended that CAM knowledge, skills, and attitudes be incorporated into family practice residency training [10], very few postgraduate CAM training opportunities exist for physicians and other conventional health care providers. [That's because there is very little worth teaching.] One of the most extensive postgraduate CAM training programs is at the University of Arizona. This two-year fellowship in integrative medicine is limited to four allopathic or osteopathic physicians per year who have completed residency training. To expand the availability of training in integrative medicine, the University of Arizona recently created an associate fellowship program. Combining distributed-learning and on-site training, this two-year associate fellowship is available to 50 allopathic and osteopathic physicians and a small number of nurse practitioners per class at a cost of $27,500 for the class entering in 2003. Other postgraduate training opportunities are evolving. One is at The Continuum Center for Health and Healing at New York's Beth Israel Medical Center, which has developed not only a required rotation in integrative medicine for a family medicine residency, but also a two-year fellowship in integrative medicine. Even though the number of postgraduate training opportunities in CAM is very small indeed, there are more CAM postgraduate educational opportunities for physicians than for other conventional health care professionals. The number of continuing education programs in CAM for conventional health professionals appears to be growing. This is an important trend, since continuing education is one of the chief means by which the current generation of conventional health professionals learns about CAM. Despite these efforts and the creation of the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, more needs to be done to move from discourse to implementation of CAM in the education, postgraduate training, and continuing education of not only allopathic physicians, but also osteopathic physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists, and all other conventional and allied health professions. A catalyst could be a conference or series of workshops facilitated by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and other Federal Departments and Agencies. These gatherings would bring together individuals and representatives of institutions, professional and accrediting organizations, and the Federal government who have been involved with recent and on-going efforts to develop core curricula of knowledge about CAM for conventional health professionals. The elements of these core curricula should be developed in conjunction with CAM experts and institutions and implemented in conventional health professional schools, postgraduate training programs, and continuing education programs. The core curricula, educational models, evaluations, recommendations, and other relevant information could be compiled and posted on the Internet at a variety of Federal and non-Federal websites, with links to related websites. [This is a blatant call for federally funded promotion of unsubstantiated methods and their advocates throughout our medical educational system. Just the opposite is needed. Science-based accrediting bodies should attack the quackery that that has infiltrated medical education within the past few years.] However, this strategy does not address the education and training needs of conventional health care students and providers who desire an integrative approach and wish to go beyond learning about CAM to learning how to provide CAM. This type of practice-oriented education and training in CAM should be obtained in appropriate conventional health care postgraduate training and continuing education and at CAM institutions. The challenges to developing core curricula of knowledge about CAM for conventional health professional schools, postgraduate training programs, and continuing education programs include: - Professional, organizational, and institutional difficulty changing, - Lack of funding, - Provision of adequate incentives to adopt these curricula, - Logistical design, development, and implementation issues, - Consensus on curricula, - Availability of adequately trained faculty and faculty development, and - Limited ability to add to already very full curricula. [What nonsense! The main \"challenge\" is the fact that methods unique to \"CAM\" offer almost nothing of value to patients.] Action |10.1||Conventional health professional schools, postgraduate training programs, and continuing education programs should develop core curricula of knowledge about CAM to prepare conventional health professionals to discuss CAM with their patients and clients and help them make informed choices about the use of CAM. [It is safe to assume that WHCCAMP expects CAM advocates to control any such activities and to promote unsubstantiated methods.]| Education in Conventional Health Care for CAM Practitioners CAM education should be a symmetrical process. That is, the education and training of CAM practitioners should include exposure to conventional health care and its related sciences just as the education and training of conventional health professionals should include CAM [11]. CAM students should attain basic competency in the biomedical sciences and understand the components and functions of the conventional health care system, including public health. This foundation should be augmented by an evidence-based approach to education and training to achieve minimal competency in interpreting CAM and conventional literature and critiquing CAM research, particularly clinical trials. [WHCCAMP again demands that the entire medical education system be corrupted by giving CAM advocates free reign to promote their nonsense.] The core curriculum for CAM students should include clinical competencies such as medical record keeping, knowledge of medico-legal aspects of care, practice in a referral environment, collaboration with conventional providers, and communication within a health care team. Students should learn to recognize the limits of their clinical expertise as well as potential complications of CAM interventions, the circumstances under which patients or clients should be referred to conventional health care providers, and the means of doing so. Additional competencies should include a basic knowledge of other CAM systems, modalities, practices, and approaches as well as when and how to refer patients or clients to those CAM practitioners. [The Commission again fails to mention anything about irrational or ineffective methods.] The elements that should be contained in the core curriculum for CAM education and training and the best methods of incorporating them into existing curricula could be determined by conferences facilitated by DHHS and other Federal Departments and Agencies or by a series of demonstration projects conducted at representative CAM education and training programs. These demonstration projects could be supported, for example, by NCCAM, Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr), the Department of Education, foundations, and innovative partnerships. Since these two approaches are not mutually exclusive, both conferences and demonstration projects could be undertaken, if adequate funding were available. These models, evaluation results, and recommendations should be compiled and made available through several sources, including the Internet. [Standards, methods, and curricula should be based on scientific knowledge of what works and what does not. Whether or not something is called \"CAM\" is not relevant.] The challenges to developing a core curriculum about conventional health care for CAM education include: - Professional, organizational, and institutional difficulty changing, - Lack of funding, - Provision of adequate incentives to adopt curriculum, - Logistical design, development, and implementation issues, - Consensus on curriculum, - Availability of adequately trained faculty and faculty development, and - Limited ability to add to already very full CAM curricula. Action |10.2||CAM education and training programs should develop curricula that reflect the fundamental elements of biomedical science and conventional health care relevant to and consistent with the practitioners' scope of practice. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" deserve advocacy in training programs.]| Communication and Collaboration between CAM and Conventional Health Care Professionals The language of biomedicine is currently as foreign to many CAM professionals as much of CAM terminology is to conventional health care professionals. Therefore, commonality of language should be the initial focus of improving communication between CAM and conventional health care professionals, and it should begin in CAM education and training programs. Minimal fluency in biomedical language should be foremost in a core biomedical curriculum for CAM education and training programs. [This appears to be another endorsement of a two-tier system of medicine: one based on science and another based on non-science. The Commission's recommendation is just the opposite of what is needed to maintain the integrity of our science-based medical system.] CAM organizations could be the point of contact for conventional institutions seeking CAM practitioners to teach CAM courses and provide relevant examples of practice. These organizations also could help locate CAM practitioners to participate in CAM research projects conducted at conventional institutions. At the organizational level, joint conferences could be held between CAM and conventional organizations representing students, practitioners, researchers, educators, or institutions. [This falsely assumes that \"CAM\" advocates have a lot to offer.] The challenges to attaining and improving communication and collaboration between CAM and conventional students, practitioners, researchers, educators, institutions, and organizations include: - Achieving consensus on biomedical fluency and other educational strategies, - Professional, organizational, and institutional difficulty changing, - Securing sufficient funding, - Designing, developing, and implementing logistics involved with joint activities, and - Providing adequate incentives to improve communication and collaboration. Action |10.3||CAM and conventional education and training programs should develop curricula and other methods to facilitate communication and foster collaboration between CAM and conventional students, practitioners, researchers, educators, institutions and organizations. [This falsely assumes that many methods marketed as \"CAM\" deserve advocacy in training programs and that the offerings \"CAM\" advocates are likely to be trustworthy.]| Increased Support for CAM Faculty, Curricula, and Program Development Access to increased funding and other resources for CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at both CAM and conventional institutions could result in better CAM education and training. [Conventional institutions include not only allopathic medical schools, but also osteopathic medical schools and dental, nursing, pharmacy, and all other health professional and allied health schools.] This, in turn, could translate into more skilled practitioners, improved CAM services, and greater patient satisfaction and safety. Although CAM faculty, curricula, and program development can be regarded as a continuum, faculty development is the most important and pragmatic point at which to begin. Faculty development is not only absolutely essential for any educational improvement, but also the cornerstone of CAM education and improved training at CAM and conventional institutions. However, the current, limited funding for this purpose appears to be directed toward only a small number of curricula and program development projects at largely conventional institutions. The type of faculty development needed by CAM and conventional institutions may be different and may vary from institution to institution. For conventional institutions, it can include providing experience in CAM systems, modalities, and therapies; teaching faculty how to collaborate with CAM practitioners and educators; and instructing them how and what to teach about CAM. For CAM institutions, faculty development can include how to teach using evidence-based, problem-based, and competency-based approaches and other educational techniques appropriate for their students and how to collaborate with conventional providers and educators. [WHCCAMP again demands that the entire medical education system be corrupted by giving CAM advocates free reign to promote their nonsense.] CAM programs at conventional health care institutions could encompass a variety of activities, including the development of CAM, integrative health, or integrative medicine clinics or centers, integrative medicine residencies and fellowships, and CAM research programs. These clinics or centers can be sites for student clinical rotations, residency and fellowship training, and clinical research and research training, particularly health services research. Juxtaposing CAM education, training, and research with conventional approaches can focus CAM research on clinically relevant topics, improve the quality of research, especially that conducted by CAM practitioners, and link CAM research with evidence-based education and training. This juxtaposition is essential for acceptance of CAM by evidenced-based conventional health care. Because CAM institutions are more heterogeneous than conventional institutions, the program needs of CAM institutions are significantly more varied. Although CAM institutions ought to be able to pursue support of their unique program needs, some CAM institutions may be more successful by forming partnerships with conventional institutions to undertake joint activities and programs. Examples of successful partnerships between CAM and conventional institutions include the Bastyr University and University of Washington and the National College of Naturopathic Medicine and the Oregon Health Sciences University. According to the available data, most support from NCCAM for education and training has been given to conventional institutions. [NCCAM established the CAM Education Project Grant (PAR-00-027) in response to Public Law 105-277, which mandated that the director of NCCAM \"study the integration of alternative treatment, diagnostic and preventive systems, modalities, and disciplines with the practice of conventional medicine as a complement to such medicine and into health care delivery systems in the United States.\"] Between fiscal years 2000 and 2001, 10 CAM Education Project Grants (R25) were made by NCCAM to accelerate the development, refinement and expansion of innovative educational approaches to incorporate CAM into medical, dental, nursing, and allied health professional school curricula, into residency training programs, and into continuing education courses. Grant recipients in 2000 were the Boston's Children's Hospital, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, the University of Minnesota -Twin Cities, the Rush-Presbyterian - St. Luke Medical Center, and the University of Texas Medical Branch-Galveston. Recipients in 2001 were the Maine Medical Center, the Georgetown University School of Medicine, the Tufts University School of Medicine, the University of Michigan School of Medicine, and University of Washington School of Medicine/Bastyr University. It is important to note that NCCAM is considering a similar program for CAM institutions, but this program has not gone through the concept clearance process. Limited support of CAM training and education programs also has been provided by BHPr. The Bureau's Division of Nursing has funded three graduate programs that contain content on CAM, as well as the Chiropractic Demonstration Project Grants Program. The latter supports research projects in which chiropractors and physicians collaborate to identify and provide effective treatment for spinal and low-back conditions. All of the BHPr education and training programs are established legislatively through Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. These programs are directed toward specific health disciplines delineated in the legislation and allow very little, if any, latitude in allocation of funds. Currently, chiropractic research is the only BHPr CAM activity that is legislatively authorized. Both NCCAM and BHPr examples illustrate how legislation drives funding of CAM education and training. Therefore, it ultimately may be necessary to pass new legislation or amend current legislation to support CAM education and training. Before that can be done, however, it is necessary to identify effective CAM education and training strategies and programs. This can be accomplished through a series of demonstration projects for CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions and subsequent evaluation of the various models and publication of the findings in print and on-line. [This falsely implies that there are many effective \"CAM\" methods.] Since faculty, curricula, and program development at both CAM and conventional institutions can benefit from collaborations and the economies of scale they provide, collaboration should be an essential element of these demonstration projects. Wherever possible, joint demonstration projects should be undertaken to take full advantage of combining programs and sharing faculty, expertise, facilities, and resources. [This falsely implies that mainstream and \"CAM\" practitioners have some sort of equivalence.] Additional sources of funding sources for CAM education and training need to be found. It may be possible to obtain funding from other NIH institutes and Federal Agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Agency for Health Care Quality and Research, and Department of Education. Funding from states, foundations, and other public and private sources should be explored also. [Training subsidies should be based merit and not on whether or not someone is described as a \"CAM\" practitioner.] Bringing funding sources together with organizations such as the Association of American Medical Colleges, the American Association Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine, the American Dental Education Association, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, the Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions, the Association of Schools of Public Health and comparable CAM organizations can help in identifying programs, faculty, resources, and opportunities to improve CAM education and training. Identification of funding sources, collaboration between funding sources and organizations, and development of selection criteria for competitive awards for CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions could be achieved through Federally sponsored workshops and conferences. The challenges facing efforts to increase support for CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions include: - Limited availability of funding in an era of diminishing resources and increased competition, - Resistance from conventional health professions' organizations and institutions, - Equitable identification and prioritization of appropriate recipients for funding, and - The need for Federal legislation and appropriations to support such programs. [The big \"challenge,\" of course, is that \"CAM\" is mostly smoke and mirrors.] Action |10.4||Increased Federal, state, and private sector support should be made available to expand and evaluate CAM faculty, curricula, and program development at accredited CAM and conventional institutions. [This is a blatant call for promotion of unsubstantiated methods and their advocates throughout our medical educational system. Just the opposite is needed. Science-based accrediting bodies should attack the quackery that that has infiltrated medical education within the past few years.]| CAM Student Participation in Existing Loan and Scholarship Programs CAM students, institutions, and professional organizations have expressed considerable interest in participating in loan and scholarship programs. Chiropractic students were eligible for participation in the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program [as authorized by the Public Health Service Act, Title VII, Section 705], the program has been phased out, and no initial loans are available. Chiropractic students at participating institutions now may be eligible for Stafford loans. Currently, the only CAM students eligible for the Scholarship for Disadvantaged Students (SDS) program are chiropractic students [as authorized by the Public Health Service Act, Title VII, Section 705]. [It should be pointed out that chiropractors have by far the highest loan default rates.] No CAM students are eligible for the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) scholarship program at this time [as defined in the Public Health Service Act, Title III, Section 301], because it is limited to U.S. citizens enrolled in or accepted for enrollment in fully accredited U.S. allopathic or osteopathic medical schools, nurse practitioner programs, nurse-midwifery programs, physicians assistant programs, or dental schools. In other words, only students of a health profession that is named specifically in authorizing legislation can be awarded an NHSC scholarship. The purpose of the NHSC scholarship program is to provide primary health care to underserved and vulnerable populations in rural and urban areas designated by the Federal government as health professions shortage areas. As a result of program requirements and limitations as well as other factors, NHSC, which recently was transferred within HRSA from the Bureau of Primary Health Care to BHPr, meets approximately 12-15 percent of the identified need for health care in underserved areas. Because of the enormous unmet need, especially for primary care, and the limited number of NHSC positions and funds available, the government's and medically underserved communities' clear preference for conventional health care providers should not be unexpected. [Few \"CAM practitioners\" can function competently as primary care physicians. This recommendation, if followed, would result in irreparable injury to many people as well as the public health generally. It also calls for taxpayers' dollars to support irrational methods.] Any policy changes regarding CAM participation in Federal loan and scholarship programs would have to be mandated legislatively. Expansion of eligibility for loan programs administered by BHPr, such as Loans for Disadvantaged Students, Health Professions Student Loans, or Primary Care Loans, to CAM students would require, at a minimum, financial impact analyses by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), determination of which CAM professions should participate, determination of which loan programs should be expanded, and amendment of the Public Health Service Act, Title VII. Since participation in these programs is based in part on financial need, only CAM students meeting the financial eligibility criteria would be eligible. Expansion of eligibility for the Stafford loan program administered by the Department of Education would have to be preceded by similar CBO evaluations, determination of which CAM professions should participate, and legislative changes. In addition, CAM institutions would have to be accredited by an approved accreditation agency, apply and be approved for participation in Title IV of the Higher Education Act student assistance program, and sign a participation agreement. In general, expansion of Federal loan programs to CAM students appears easier than participation in the NHSC scholarship program. However, before considering any changes in NHSC policy or legislative, a number of critical aspects of CAM participation must be examined. Since the chief purpose of this program is not education, but the provision of health care to medically underserved and vulnerable populations, current participants must be able to provide the necessary health care services, which generally are described as or included as a component of primary care. [There is no logical reason to believe that a shortage of \"CAM\" practitioners exists.] Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act defines primary care by delineating required community health center primary care services and provides examples of representative clinical competencies. These include: - Health services related to family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, or gynecology that are furnished by physicians and where appropriate, physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurse midwives; - Diagnostic laboratory and radiologic services; - Preventive health services (including prenatal and perinatal services; screening for breast and cervical cancer; well-child services; immunizations against vaccine-preventable diseases; screenings for elevated blood lead levels communicable diseases, and cholesterol; pediatric eye, ear, and dental screenings to determine the need for vision and hearing correction and dental care; voluntary family planning services; and preventive dental services); - Emergency medical services; and - Pharmaceutical services. The Department of Health and Human Services should conduct a feasibility study to determine whether appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners enhance and/or expand health care provided by primary care teams. [No study is needed. The answer is no.] These primary care teams typically consists of family practitioners, internists, pediatricians, and obstetrician gynecologists as well as physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, dentists, and mental health professionals. The feasibility study could be followed with demonstration projects to determine the type of practitioners, their education and training requirements, appropriate practice sites, minimal clinical competencies, and health outcomes attributable to the addition of these practitioners and services to comprehensive care. Then, the CBO should estimate the financial impact of CAM practitioner participation in these programs. Guidelines have been set for determining the number of a given type of conventional health care provider for a defined population size or geographic area (for example, an area that has a population to full-time-equivalent primary care physician ratio of at least 3,500 to 1), but not for CAM practitioners. Such guidelines would need to be developed for each type of CAM practitioners. The challenges to expanding the eligibility of CAM students to participate in existing loan and scholarship programs include: - A preference for conventional health care providers to fill the largely unmet need, - Required changes in legislation and appropriations changes, - Identification of specific CAM disciplines and practitioners, and - Difficulty in administering CAMinclusive programs particularly in the absence of population and geographic guidelines for CAM practitioners and financial impact data. Action |10.5||Expansion of eligibility of CAM students at accredited institutions for existing of loan programs should be explored. [This would help subsidize students at schools of acupuncture and naturopathy whose teachings advocate irrational practices such as homeopathy.]| |10.6||The Department of Health and Human Services should conduct a feasibility study to determine whether appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners enhance and/or expand health care provided by primary care teams. [Typically, these primary care teams consists of family practitioners, internists, pediatricians, and obstetrician gynecologists as well as physicians assistants, nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, dentists, and mental health professionals.] This feasibility study could lead to demonstration projects to identify: 1) the type of practitioners, 2) their necessary education and training, 3) the appropriate practice settings, and 4) the health outcomes attributable to the addition of these practitioners and services to comprehensive care. [This falsely implies that \"CAM\" advocates have a lot to offer. However, adding ineffective methods to effective ones will increases the cost of health-care delivery but not its quality.]| National Guidelines for CAM Educational and Training Questions about national guidelines for CAM education and training are by no means unique to the United States. In Great Britain, the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology considered a number of issues related to CAM education and training [12]. Despite the exceedingly complex mosaic of CAM practices, therapies, modalities, disciplines, and professions, the committee recommended that CAM training courses, whether for conventional health professionals or CAM professionals, should be made more uniform and should be accredited by appropriate professional bodies. [This falsely assumes that \"CAM\" training courses have a lot to offer.] National standards for CAM education and training may not be attainable in the United States for a number of reasons. For example, each of the 50 States has varying educational requirements for licensure for a multiplicity of professions. In addition, a given CAM modality or therapy may involve numerous CAM and conventional disciplines; but there may be no agreement among or between disciplines on accreditation requirements, processes, or body for that particular modality or therapy. [The standards for \"CAM\" should be the same as for science-based practices. The Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education [ACCME] already has an adequate standard. It does not approve programs that advocate irrational methods.] In an attempt to provide some uniform guidance, the Federation of State Medical Boards' Special Committee for the Study of Unconventional Health Care Practices has begun to develop guidelines for the use of CAM. These guidelines address education, but they focus on the scientific basis of treatment methods without delineating any specific education or training requirements. Simultaneously, nascent efforts by physician organizations to standardize CAM education and training for allopathic and osteopathic physicians have emerged. The American Board of Holistic Medicine, for example, has administered a board certification examination covering 13 areas of holistic medicine, including exercise medicine, nutritional medicine, environmental medicine, biomolecular medicine, behavioral medicine, spiritual medicine, energy medicine, social medicine, manual medicine, homeopathic medicine, botanical medicine, ethnomedicine including acupuncture, and conventional medicine. For physicians practicing medical acupuncture, the American Board of Medical Acupuncture has developed and administered a board certification examination. [It is not possible to develop science-based guidelines for irrational practices. Homeopathy and \"energy medicine\" are delusional practices. Any organization that certifies people in these areas should be considered untrustworthy. The fact that WHCCAMP uses the American Holistic Medical Association as an example of what should be done shows that the WHCCAMP majority is similarly untrustworthy.] Chiropractic has the most extensively developed and implemented national education and training standards of any CAM profession. [Its standards are extremely low and poorly enforced.] Traditional Chinese acupuncture, therapeutic massage, and naturopathic medicine perhaps have moved closer than other CAM professions to establishing national education and training standards. [In 2001, the U.S. Secretary of Education revoked its approval of naturopathy's national accrediting body.] Because of their progress, these CAM professions are appropriate candidates for conferences convened by DHHS and other Federal Departments and Agencies, although CAM professions and disciplines that are still in the process of developing standards should be included as well. Such conferences would assemble the leadership of CAM, conventional health, public health, evolving health professions, and the public; educational institutions; and appropriate organizations to facilitate establishing CAM education and training guidelines. Subsequently, these guidelines would be made available to the states and professions for their consideration. The challenges of establishing national CAM educational and training guidelines include: - Their similarity to education and training requirements for licensure and therefore perceived encroachment on states' rights, - Complexity-that is, the numerous disciplines or professions that may be associated with a given modality, - Lack of educational standardization within professions, - Absence of a clearly delineated scope of practice for each profession; - Funding requirements, and - Resistance from CAM and conventional professions and organizations. [The big \"challenge\" is the extent of irrational practices that \"CAM\" professions involve.] Action |10.7||The Department of Health and Human Services and other Federal Departments and Agencies should convene conferences of the leaders of CAM, conventional health, public health, evolving health professions, and the public; of educational institutions; and of appropriate organizations to facilitate establishment of CAM education and training guidelines. Subsequently, the guidelines should be made available to the states and professions for their consideration. [This falsely assumes that rational guidelines can be written for teaching irrational methods.]| Demonstration Projects of Postgraduate Training for Appropriately Educated and Trained CAM Practitioners To improve education and training, the competency of practitioners, and the quality of services, CAM education and training should continue beyond the entry, professional school, or qualifying degree level. However, as previously noted, there are very few opportunities for postgraduate CAM education and training. Currently, the chiropractic profession appears to have the most extensive full-time postgraduate CAM education and training, offering residencies in radiology, orthopedics, family practice, and clinical sciences. A typical chiropractic residency program is two to three years in duration and includes outpatient care and inpatient clinical rotations at chiropractic and conventional medical facilities, along with classroom and research experiences. [This description grossly exaggerates the extent and quality of postgraduate chiropractic education.] Residencies in naturopathic medicine are less well developed. Postgraduate training has been in existence since 1979 and consists of a limited number of mainly one-year and some two-year residency programs with an emphasis on naturopathic family practice. Most of these residencies are based in outpatient clinics, some of which are affiliated with a hospital. Utah now requires at least a one-year residency for licensure of naturopathic physicians. Before establishing new or expanding current CAM postgraduate education and training programs, appropriate CAM candidates for postgraduate education and training should be identified and the feasibility, type, duration, and impact of postgraduate education and training for these CAM practitioners should be determined. For example, should one-year postgraduate training programs be available for traditional Chinese acupuncturists or doctors of oriental medicine? Should three-year primary care or family practice residencies be available for naturopathic, Ayurvedic, or Tibetan medicine physicians? [The more important question is whether graduates of these schools can provide rational health care.] The process of determining likely candidates could include demonstration projects of residencies and postgraduate training for appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners. Federal Agencies and Departments such as NCCAM, BHPr, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Veterans Affairs could sponsor the projects. Because community health centers represent a unique opportunity for combining education in ethnically, racially, and culturally diverse learning environments with service to medically underserved populations who otherwise might not have access to CAM, any current or proposed CAM postgraduate education and training program affiliated with such centers should be given special consideration. [This falsely implies that there is a shortage of \"CAM\" services among economically underprivileged populations and that this provides an adequate basis for more federal subsidies.] Demonstration projects should be awarded on a competitive basis and funded with monies that are distinct from the current graduate medical education funding streams. In addition, projects should include funds for financial analyses and longitudinal studies to assess the types of CAM practitioner, feasibility of residencies and postgraduate training, competency-based educational effectiveness, impact on health care quality, and collaboration between CAM and conventional providers. [This falsely implies that the public has a special unmet need for \"CAM\" services. In effect, the Commission would like the U.S. Government to fund demonstration projects for methods before they are proven effective.] The challenges to establishing demonstration projects of residencies and postgraduate training in CAM for appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners include: - Determining which practitioners should participate in postgraduate education and training demonstration projects, - Developing and applying selection criteria and processes, - Funding, and - Limited availability of a sufficient number of training sites, patients, and faculty. Action |10.8||Feasibility studies of postgraduate training for appropriately educated and trained CAM practitioners should be conducted to determine the type of practitioners, practice setting, and their impact on clinical competency, quality of health care, and collaboration with conventional providers. [Here WHCCAMP demands that residency training be corrupted by giving CAM advocates free reign to promote their anti-scientific nonsense.]| Continuing Education in CAM for All Practitioners Who Provide CAM Products and Services Continuing education represents a powerful means of affecting conventional and CAM practitioners' behavior, thereby enhancing public health and safety. Britain's House of Lords affirmed the importance of continuing education for CAM practitioners [12]. The Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation Conference on Education of Health Professionals in Complementary/Alternative Medicine recommended that professional and educational health care associations include high-quality, evidenced-based CAM information in continuing education programs [5]. There are more programs in CAM continuing education for conventional health professionals than for CAM practitioners. However, the number, type, and availability of programs with content appropriate for all practitioners who provide CAM services and products are not sufficient to enhance and protect the public's health and safety regarding CAM. Therefore, continuing education needs to be improved and made available to all conventional health professionals as well as all practitioners who provide CAM services and products. [Current continuing medical education standards state that organization and course is not eligible for accreditation by ACCME if, in the judgment of the ACCME, its program is devoted to the advocacy of unscientific modalities of diagnosis or therapy.] Action |10.9||Practitioners who provide CAM services and products should complete appropriate CAM continuing education programs that include critical evaluation of CAM to enhance and protect the public's health and safety. [There is no reason to expect that science-based CAM continuing education programs can be created or that \"CAM\" practitioners would attend such programs or be influenced by them. To be \"appropriate,\" such programs would have to advocate abandonment of \"CAM\" methods that are irrational.| References: - Berman B. Complementary medicine and medical education.

The article contributed significantly to the recent explosion of interest in \"alternative medicine\" in the United States. The paper reports a telephone poll of 1539 people on their use of \"unconventional\" methods on the previous year. Until that time quackery and medical pseudoscience practices existed in a fringe subculture. This began to change around the time of this article's appearance and the report has become one of the most frequently cited articles in the medical literature. The lead author was David M Eisenberg, MD, whose chief publication up until this time had been a popular book on the wonders of traditional Chinese medicine entitled Encounters With Qi. The article began by acknowledging the difficulty of defining \"unconventional, alternative, or unorthodox therapies,\" referring to \"medical practices that are not in conformity with the standards of the medical community.\" This is a fairly satisfactory definition of \"alternative medicine\" if \"the standards of the medical community\" are understood to include methods that are truly effective or which are under appropriate and well-designed scientific investigation. But the Eisenberg article settled on a definition of \"unconventional medicine\" being those \"medical interventions not taught widely at U.S. medical schools or generally available at U.S. hospitals.\" It addressed the question of how widespread these methods are and how much money is spent on them in relation to medical care that is more or less in conformity with medical and scientific standards. The 1539 people interviewed were a subset of 2295 respondents who agreed to participate and actually finished the interview. The 2295 people were, in turn, found by calling 5158 telephone numbers and excluding more than half of them because they were not working, were \"not assigned to households,\" did not speak English, or were cognitively or physically impaired. But for the sake of argument and brevity, my comments leave aside the implications of these facts - that the survey was not representative of the population. The telephone polling began by asking respondents about 24 medical conditions. Only 8% of respondents offered other \"important conditions.\" The ten most frequently reported medical conditions listed by the Eisenberg survey are shown in Table 1 with, for comparison, figures from the Centers for Disease Control's Vital and Health Statistics, Prevalence of Selected Chronic Conditions 1990-92. |Medical Condition||From Table 3 of | Eisenberg Article. |CDC Vital and Health Statistics, Prevalence of Selected Chronic Conditions |\"Back |Chronic bronchitis||5.2%| The Eisenberg survey also asked about dizziness, diabetes, and cancer, but the rates of these disorders and 11 others that the 1539 respondents were asked about were not given in the article. Presumably they were less than 8%, although, as is shown, hearing problems, skin conditions, and heart disease in the general population are in this range of prevalence according to the CDC. Deafness, of course, was the condition that D.D. Palmer \"cured\" when he \"discovered\" chiropractic more than a hundred years ago. Notably absent from Eisenberg's data were common ailments such as colds, cough, and flu. Neither was there mention of obstetric or gynecologic disorders, which are probably the most common medical problems of reproductive aged women. Among women aged 18-44, for example, roughly the range in which Eisenberg reported the highest rate of use of \"unconventional medicine,\" the CDC reported the prevalence of menstrual disorders as 2.8%, bladder infections 1.4%, kidney infections 1%, and other disorders of the female genital tract at 3%. Taken together as genitourinary problems, and including pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications, these would almost surely total 8% or more. Yet they appear to have been excluded. Also absent was obesity, which is notable because commercial weight loss centers were included in \"unconventional medicine\" methods and were used by more respondents than the majority of other methods. As one of a variety of chronic medical conditions that has proven extraordinarily resistant to successful management by any means, obesity has been and continues to be a prime target for \"alternative medicine\" promoters. Its absence here is inexplicable. When the survey respondents were asked about their use of \"unconventional medicine\" and whether or not they had seen a practitioner or \"provider\" of same, the answers broke down as shown in Table 2. |Type of Therapy||Used in Past 12 Months (%)||Saw a provider | (% of those exercise and prayer)||34||36| \"In the case of prayer, we thought [additional] questions would be inappropriate. As for exercise, we thought the term was too vague and the practice sufficiently ubiquitous to preclude the gathering of useful data.\" [from \"The Interview\" section of Eisenberg et al, 1993] The survey did not include some common aberrant methods, and included ones that did not fit the report's own definition. Among those not mentioned were chelation therapy (for atherosclerosis), antineoplastons, iridology, reflexology, aromatherapy, crystal therapy, kinesiology, magnets, acids and other non-herb \"nutritional supplements\" consisting of biochemical precursors, co-factors, and intermediates, Maharishi Medicine (previously known as Ayurveda), naturopathy, urine-drinking, bee pollen, royal jelly, snake venom, colloidal silver, colonics, light therapy, and ozone therapy. All of these methods and others continue to receive credulous media attention, are widely promoted, and have attracted outspoken and devoted advocates. Their absence from the list raises questions of completeness and of representation of the \"alternative\" field. Perhaps their use fell below the level of detection, but if so, that makes the \"34%\" use of \"alternative methods\" to be made up of other methods, perhaps not at all unconventional. Turning to the listed items, hypnosis, while only 1%, was included in \"unconventional medicine.\" Yet hypnosis is an accepted adjunct to medical science in appropriate circumstances. It is taught at many U.S. medical schools and psychiatry residencies. Biofeedback, despite lack of firm effectiveness, retains a similar position. Although chiropractic was listed as the second most commonly used method, the study did not distinguish it from manipulative therapy, used by some osteopathic physicians and physical therapists. Some respondents may have experienced \"chiropractic \" in those forms. The study did not look at these important distinctions in order to distinguish, say, hypnosis used for pain control from use in past-life regression or to recall alien abduction experiences, or medical manipulation for joint mobilization from chiropractic treatment of childhood ear infections and learning disabilities. The following statement explained about the methods reported in the survey: \"We did not ask whether the respondents' providers of unconventional therapy were medical doctors.\" So, conceivably, some \"chiropractic\" was administered by physical therapists and D.O.'s. Some, or possibly all \"biofeedback\" took place at medical clinics specializing in pain management. And \"megavitamin therapy\" might include niacin for hypercholesterolemia and other standard pharmacologic applications of vitamins. In the case of chiropractic there is another curious anomaly. Fully 30% of those who said they used chiropractic in the previous 12 months apparently did so without benefit of a chiropractor. The authors acknowledge that \"Some forms of unconventional therapy typically involve a provider (for example, a chiropractor or acupuncturist).\" But there is no attempt to explain or account either for the 30% of chiropractic use that people were practicing on themselves or the more curious finding that 9% of users of acupuncture had apparently been practicing on themselves. Or do these inconsistencies suggest another form of massage? Again, \"Some users of unconventional therapy may visit a provider less often than once a year but may continue to use the prescribed unconventional therapy.\" Was this the case only with imagery, \"spiritual healing,\" and commercial weight loss programs, or also with a third of those who said they had used chiropractic and nearly a tenth of those who said they had used acupuncture? The most-used \"unconventional medicine\" was \"relaxation techniques.\" It was among the most-used methods for all of the ten top medical conditions considered besides \"back problems\" and allergies, as shown in Table 3. |Of Those with||\"Unconventional Medicine\" use in the just what are \"relaxation techniques?\" Medical school graduates, as well as professionals in hospitals would agree that the idea of physical, mental, and emotional rest are components of good medical care. What is \"massage?\" It is a universal practice, when people injure themselves reflexively resort to \"massage\" the area. It would be difficult, given this, to find anyone who does not utilize \"unconventional medicine.\" The authors recognized this problem, saying: \"Some of the unconventional therapies studied warrant further clarification. For example, 'massage therapy' or 'relaxation therapy' may mean different things to different people.\" But, again, this was stated only in the small print, not to be found in interpretation and discussion of results. \"Spiritual healing\" certainly means different things to different people as well. To most it means a healing ceremony of some sort, usually with a group. But is it also \"spiritual healing\" when a Catholic priest comes to the hospital bed to administer a sacrament? Or when anyone says a religious prayer? These practices are not taught in medical schools, but it seems doubtful that this deserves to be considered as \"unconventional medicine.\" Likewise, the use of \"imagery,\" especially in the management of insomnia and anxiety, is so customary that it is a clich\u00e9 to speak of counting sheep to bring on drowsiness or imagining one's audience to be naked in order to allay stage fright. But most, if not all of these qualifications, and omissions of distinctions had the cumulative effect of maximizing the numbers of survey respondents who could be said to have used \"unconventional medicine.\" This, in turn, was used to support similarly magnified extrapolations of the use and economic impact of \"unconventional medicine.\" So, for example, the Eisenberg report stated: The estimated number of ambulatory visits to providers of unconventional therapy in 1990 was 425 million. This number exceeds the estimated 388 million visits in 1990 to all primary care physicians (general and family practitioners, pediatricians, and specialists in internal medicine) combined. But these \"providers\" included masseurs and masseuses who make no claims of curing any diseases, commercial weight loss methods, and self-help group meetings. And they might have included many physicians or people who working in conjunction with physicians, delivering appropriate care in conformity with medical scientific standards. Or perhaps they were not included. It is not possible to know from the data presented. The article compares \"alternative\" visits to those to general and family practitioners, pediatricians, and internists. As before, there is no mention of obstetrics and gynecology, even though it is well-known that many women depend on their Ob/Gyn physicians as their primary doctors, or to other medical specialists who might serve as primary physicians. Considering the prevalence of \"back problems,\" allergies, and anxiety and depression, why not include the annual number of visits to orthopedists, physiatrists, physical therapists, allergists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and clinical social workers? By including some practitioners and excluding others, the authors are able to pick their way to justifying their major conclusion that, \"unconventional medicine has an enormous presence in the U.S. health care system.\" The authors go on with their finding that \"fewer than 3 in 10 users of unconventional therapy mention its use to their medical doctors,\" ignoring the fact that some of this \"unconventional medicine\" may even have been supplied by or at the recommendation of medical doctors. Moreover, the importance of visits to \"unconventionals\" is variable. A physician may not attach much importance to whether a patient had a massage, attended a Weight Watchers' meeting, or even seen a chiropractor in the previous 12 months. No one study is expected to answer all questions about an investigated matter. But what would be useful to know is how many people, given a serious diagnosis by a physician, seek out acupuncture, homeopathy, or a brown rice diet in lieu of appropriate medical or surgical treatment, or use substances that interfere with prescribed drugs? How many unnecessarily use ineffective methods for disorders that are self-limited? \"Roughly half of those who use unconventional medicine for their principal medical conditions have no supervision of this treatment by either a medical doctor or a provider of unconventional therapy.\" But, again, what is the significance of someone's using \"relaxation techniques\" or imagery in an unsupervised setting? \"The use of unconventional therapy,\" they warned, \"especially if it is totally unsupervised, may be harmful.\" But what is this harm? Are the 30% of people who use chiropractic on their own more liable to injure themselves than are chiropractors to injure the other 70% of those who use this form of \"unconventional medicine?\" Would it be safer for people having a massage, or attending a self-help group? What may truly be harmful where these methods are concerned, is their substitution for proved measures in the setting of serious or potentially serious medical conditions. Two references were given by the authors in support of the idea that their data show a risk to the public of unsupervised \"unconventional medicine.\" One was the 1984 report of the U.S. Congress' Subcommittee on Long-Term Health and Aging, Quackery: a $10 Billion Scandal, known as the Pepper Report for the late chair of that committee, Claude Pepper. The other is the 1987 report of the Department of Health and Human Services' Health, Information and the use of Questionable Treatment: A Study of the American Public. The adverse effects noted in these sources are primarily from methods \u2014 herbs \u2014 that this article's data indicate were used by only a small minority of their respondents. They also found evidence of harm caused by delay or forgoing of appropriate medical treatment because of the substitution of unproved and ineffective therapies that are deceptively promoted. The present study did not mention those problems. The present report suggested that \"medical doctors should begin to ask patients about their use of unconventional therapy whenever they take a history.\" Yet delay seeking medical care may arise from \"spiritual healing\" and \"prayer\" as from other \"unconventional medicine.\" Yet the authors declined to ask patients details about about these two methods because it \"would be inappropriate.\" The major problem of the original survey was its exaggeration of the prevalence of questionable, unproven, disproven, and irrational health and nutrition use. The conclusions put forward in this article have been reported repeated since its publication. This has especially taken the form of a subtle term-switching device in which the curious and rather idiosyncratic \"unconventional medicine\" was converted to the authors' definition of \"alternative medicine\". The authors have not hesitated to use such language distortion. Dr. Eisenberg has argued strenuously that his data show the need for physicians to cooperate with their patients' use of whatever \"alternative medicine\" that they may find appealing. On September 9, 1997, for example, the University of Texas-Southwestern and the Alternative Medicine Research Foundation of Texas sponsored a CME conference in Dallas. Dr. Eisenberg was the keynote speaker, and he used his time to review his 1990 data. He admitted that much of the \"unconventional medicine\" considered in the survey was essentially \"extended self-care.\" He then, without further explanation, began referring to \"alternative medicine\" and focused on herbs, acupuncture, and homeopathy. There was no discussion of \"relaxation techniques,\" which accounted for the largest use of \"unconventional medicine\" in his 1993 article. There was no consideration of chiropractic, massage, imagery, or \"spiritual healing\" or of commercial weight-loss programs. Dr. Eisenberg, at this same conference in 1997, ridiculed critics of homeopathy as having taken the position that, \"it can't work, so it doesn't work?\" This paper was presented at the \"Science Meets Alternative Medicine\" conference sponsored by the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine in Philadelphia on February 27th of 1999. At that time, one commentator suggested that Dr. Eisenberg could hardly help how others might misinterpret his work. But in September of 1998 Dr. Eisenberg was a co-author of another article that appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association [JAMA 280:784-787]. The second sentence of that report stated: We have known for several years that approximately 1 in 3 adults in the United States uses chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy, or one of many other treatment modalities. The reference for this fact being \"known,\" of course, was the 1993 NEJM article. Fortunately, this deception did not appear in Dr. Eisenberg's follow up survey, a report of which appeared last November in JAMA. But in this updated report building on the 1990 data, there was no pretense about \"unconventional medicine.\" Non-rational methods were referred to as \"alternative medicine\" throughout. There was also, this time, an acknowledgement that there are \"more alternative\" and \"less alternative\" therapies among those considered in both the 1990 data and in the follow-up survey of 2055 respondents in 1997. But there was no attempt to sort out which therapies were \"more alternative\" or \"less alternative.\" There was no consideration given to what distinguishes \"more alternative\" from \"less alternative\" therapies. There was no attempt to identify whether a particular application of a therapy was consistent with facts and reason or not. The principal data presented in the follow-up survey are shown in Table 4. |Type of Therapy||Used in past 12 more therapy (excluding | exercise and prayer) |33.8||42.1 | * P .05; P .01; P .001 Many of the same problems of the 1993 article apply to this updated survey. For example, relaxation therapy and massage have still not been clarified, although this was said to be warranted five years previously in the 1993 paper. On the whole, the 1998 article is slightly less polemical that that of 1993. Given the promotional success of the earlier report, perhaps there was no need to be more emphatic. In 1998 it is merely stated that, \"the prevalence and expenditures associated with alternative medical therapies in the United States have increased substantially,\" and that, \"the magnitude of the demand for alternative therapy is noteworthy.\" Eisenberg and his co-authors do not speculate on why this is so, but express a sort of uncomprehending interest in their findings, \"in light of the relatively low rates of insurance coverage for these services.\" They do speculate that increased insurance coverage of \"alternative medicine\" would almost surely further increase its use. But they do not address the question of whether the increased use of \"alternative medicine\" since the 1990 survey has had any health benefits. On the contrary, they draw proper attention to the hazards of adverse effects, particularly in the elderly and infirm. But their data are of no help in assessing this very serious risk and no suggestions for addressing it are offered. Elsewhere, Dr. Eisenberg has suggested that physicians \"supervise\" their patients' use of \"alternative medicine\" and even co-manage their care with \"alternative medicine\" practitioners. But even in the updated 1998 survey report, Eisenberg and his collaborators do not suggest that physicians make an attempt to educate their patients or try to discourage or curtail their use of unproven and ineffective methods. Most concerning is absence of comment on major driving force behind alternative medicine - relaxed regulatory environment of the marketplace. The 1998 report mistakenly assumes \"alternative\" medicine use reflects demand for it and/or dissatisfaction with biomedical care. Two years after the collection of the Eisenberg's original survey data, Congress appropriated funds for what was to become the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM). The impetus was the will of one senator, Harkin of Iowa who used his committee chairmanship to appropriate funds because of his personal belief in bee pollen and other ineffective remedies. OAM has now been upgraded with increased funding to the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. A year after the 1993 NEJM report, the [Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA)](https://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/dshea.html) freed the health food industry from much of the regulatory oversight of the FDA. An avalanche of uncritical media coverage of unproved claims and practices followed. A swell of advertising dollars poured into the print and electronic media. This was a potent, and not coincidental combination. Ideologically motivated private foundations such as the $300 million Fetzer Foundation had poured millions of dollars into medical school courses and research, had sponsored the Bill Moyers' PBS series \"Healing and the Mind,\" sponsored the Eisenberg study plus his Harvard Medical School course and annual post-graduate courses for physicians and other health professionals. These and the first Eisenberg paper itself acted to create a perception that \"alternative medicine\" is safe, effective, and at least as good, if not better than, scientific biomedicine. The authors did not comment on the fact that use of acupuncturists, homeopaths, and chiropractors remained stable over the ten years, while the \"alternative medicine\" that drew the greatest increase in use, more than tripling between 1990 and 1997 were over-the-counter herbal medicine, folk remedies, and homeopathic products, all of which have been aggressively mass-marketed in the wake of DSHEA. Major manufacturers are rolling out herbal and homeopathic versions of their established trade-named products. Vitamin sales lagged by comparison, having been previously marketed maximally for years. On the other hand, many \"nutritional supplements\" combine herbs, vitamins, as well as additional ingredients and may claim to be homeopathic as well. Thus, someone's purchasing a single over-the-counter \"nutritional supplement\" of this kind would contribute to an increased prevalence of use of several different forms of \"alternative medicine.\" In 1996, under pressure from organized acupuncturists, the FDA reclassified acupuncture needles as Class II \"medical devices,\" which permitted their use and associated claims of various health benefits. In 1997 the OAM, in association with its former interim Director, carefully orchestrated a seemingly biased panel that issued a consensus statement in favor of acupuncture. The 1998 Eisenberg article mentioned none of these things, while marveling at the public's alleged demand for \"alternative medicine.\" The impression remains that acupuncture and \"natural\" products are safe, effective, and even constitute \"cutting edge\" medical science. Eisenberg is silent on how these factors may have affected his updated survey information of 1997. Yet they are crucial to any evaluation. Manufacturers are now selling products which are, for all intents and purposes, medications. But, legally, as \"nutritional supplements,\" they are \"foods.\" Even food products are now appearing which contain herbal ingredients, such as soup containing Saint John's Wort and corn chips laced with kava. Any serious discussion of the prevalence, let alone the medical and public health implications of \"alternative medicine\" will be non-productive until and unless their terminology is clarified. For if \"unconventional\" medicine cannot be distinguished from \"alternative medicine,\" \"complementary medicine,\" \"integrative medicine,\" and quackery, then there will be nothing left to call quackery or illegal promotion. Likewise, if medicine cannot be distinguished from exercise, prayer, relaxation, self-help practices, and other \"extended self-care,\" then there will be nothing left that will not be medicine. These issues are important not only scientifically, but also in the social, cultural, and economic context of continued medical scientific progress amid rising medical care costs. Unfortunately, Dr. Eisenberg, his collaborators, the lay and medical press and other commentators have been obscuring rather than clarifying, hindering instead of helping, honest efforts to confront them. ________________________ Dr. Gorski practices obstetrics and gynecology in Arlington, Texas, and is president of the Greater Dallas-Fort Worth Council Against Health Fraud.

At the time it was published, he was editor-in-chief emeritus of The New England Journal of Medicine and professor emeritus of medicine and social medicine at Harvard Medical School. I Andrew Weil, M.D., is variously described on the covers of his best-selling books as \"the guru of alternative medicine,\" \"one of the most skilled, articulate, and important leaders in the field of health and healing,\" \"a pioneer in the medicine of the future,\" and \"an extraordinary phenomenon.\" On his website, which records over two and a half million hits a month, he is called \"America's most trusted medical expert.\" A recent cover of Time, which featured the familiar picture of his bald head and bewhiskered cherubic countenance, announced that \"medicine man Dr. Andrew Weil has made New Age remedies popular.\" In the accompanying story, Time tells us that \"millions of Americans swear by\" his medical advice. Not all of this is hype. Weil is arguably the best known and most influential of the many physician-writers now in the vanguard of the alternative medicine movement. He is also one of the most prolific. Since 1972 he has written eight books. The first three were mostly about the effects of natural drugs on consciousness, but the remaining five, all published in the past fifteen years, are about health and healing. Read together with one remarkable chapter in his first book, these more recent works provide a comprehensive description of alternative medicine, as seen through the eyes of its most serious and systematic advocate. If Deepak Chopra is the mystical poet-laureate of the movement, then Weil is its heavy-duty theoretician and apologist. He directs a large and astonishingly successful medical marketing enterprise that might be called Dr. Andrew Weil, Inc. No longer the angry young rebel, he has become the urbane and supremely self-assured CEO of alternative medicine, who is seeking to reshape the medical establishment that he once scorned. The popularity of his teachings, and the spreading wave of interest in alternative remedies that he and others have inspired, are forcing mainstream medicine to deal with a counterculture that it would have preferred to ignore. \"Alternative medicine\" is the term generally used to designate a varied collection of methods for the prevention, the diagnosis, or the treatment of disease that are not generally accepted by regular (or \"allopathic\") physicians and have not been part of the standard medical school curriculum in the United States. Some of these methods are very old. Acupuncture and other kinds of traditional Chinese medicine, as well as the Ayurvedic medicine of ancient Hinduism, were practiced before the Christian era, and they still flourish. Native American shamans and medicine men used herbal and ritual healing before the European conquest of America, and such practices still exist. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many healing cults were contending with allopathic physicians for popular support. These included homeopathy, naturopathy, and herbal medicine, psychic and faith healing, magnetic therapy and chiropractic and osteopathy. More recent twentieth-century additions to the alternative medicine family include therapeutic touch, guided imagery, biofeedback, and various forms of diet therapy. In the past few years, two new terms have come into use: \"complementary medicine\" and \"integrative medicine.\" They identify a recent development in the alternative medicine movement championed by Weil and others: the idea that alternative medicine should be used in conjunction with, rather than instead of, mainstream allopathic methods. Until now, alternative medicine has generally been rejected by medical scientists and educators, and by most practicing physicians. The reasons are many, but the most important reason is the difference in mentality between the alternative practitioners and the medical establishment. The leaders of the establishment believe in the scientific method, and in the rule of evidence, and in the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology upon which the modern view of nature is based. Alternative practitioners either do not seem to care about science or explicitly reject its premises. Their methods are often based on notions totally at odds with science, common sense, and modern conceptions of the structure and the function of the human body. In advancing their claims, they do not appear to recognize the need for objective evidence, asserting that the intuitions and the personal beliefs of patients and healers are all that is needed to validate their methods. One might have expected such thinking to alienate most people in a technologically advanced society such as ours; but the alternative medicine movement, and the popularity of gurus such as Weil, are growing rapidly. Weil's writings are ambiguous about the conflict between science and alternative medicine, as they are about many other issues in alternative medicine. Yes, he thinks that all healing methods ought to be tested; and yes, modern science can make useful contributions to our understanding of health and disease. Yet the scientific method is not, for Weil, the only way, or even the best way, to learn about nature and the human body. Many important truths are intuitively evident and do not need scientific support, even when they seem to contradict logic. Conventional science-based medicine has its uses, but they are limited. Like so many of the other gurus of alternative medicine, Weil is not bothered by logical contradictions in his argument, or encumbered by a need to search for objective evidence. This habit of thought was evident early in Weil's career. He was educated at Harvard College and Harvard Medical School in the '60s, but he revolted against those academic bastions. Like many other students of his generation, he experimented with mind-altering drugs. He was a botany major and, not surprisingly for those days, he became interested in the psychedelic properties of certain plants. Later, in medical school, he participated in studies of the clinical and psychological effects of marijuana, which led to a few publications in scientific journals. He also developed a strong antipathy toward many of the basic concepts of conventional medicine, and the traditional pedagogical methods then employed to teach them. We learn a little about Weil's postgraduate years from the brief autobiographical comments in the preface to The Natural Mind, his first book. After a one-year internship at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco in 1968-69, he began what was supposed to have been a two-year tour of duty at the National Institute of Mental Health. He resigned after a year. He says it was because of official opposition to his work with marijuana. He then left the world of allopathic medicine entirely, to go off to an Indian reservation in South Dakota to study with a Sioux medicine man and learn about herbal medicine and ritual healing. \"On the reservation,\" he says, \"I participated in sweat lodge ceremonies, grew a beard, and `dropped out.'\" At home afterward, \"I started to practice yoga, experiment with vegetarianism, and learn to meditate.\" In 1971 he began to write The Natural Mind, which became a best-seller and launched his career as a writer. The Natural Mind (1972) is mainly a criticism of American drug policy and an exposition of Weil's views on the interaction of psychedelic drugs with the mind. It also expounds his general philosophy of mind-body relations upon which much of his later writings on health and healing is based. The seventh chapter, entitled \"A Trip to Stonesville,\" should be required reading for all who would understand the origins of Weil's belief in the healing power of the mind. It is a startling document\u2014a sharply drawn manifesto of New Age biology, a direct challenge to the scientific basis of conventional medicine, and a revealing window on Weil's style of thought. And, since a theory of mind-body relations is central to most current formulations of alternative medicine, this chapter must be considered one of the movement's most important philosophical statements. It merits a detailed examination. According to Weil, many of his basic insights about the causes of disease and the nature of healing come from what he calls \"stoned thinking,\" that is, thoughts experienced while under the influence of psychedelic agents or during other states of \"altered consciousness\" induced by trances, ritual magic, hypnosis, meditation, and the like. He cites some of the characteristics of \"stoned thinking\" that give it advantages over \"straight\" thinking; these include a greater reliance on \"intuition\" and an \"acceptance of the ambivalent nature of things,\" by which he means a tolerance for \"the coexistence of opposites that appear to be mutually antagonistic.\" In Weil's view, intellect, logic, and inductive reasoning from observed fact are the limited instruments of \"straight\" thinking, and should be subservient to guidance by the intuitive insights that are gained during states of altered consciousness and \"stoned\" thinking. Weil tells us that \"the history of science makes clear that the greatest advancements in man's understanding of the universe are made by intuitive leaps at the frontiers of knowledge, not by intellectual walks along well-traveled paths.\" He neglects to add, unfortunately, that to be successful these \"intuitive leaps\" had to explain all of the relevant observed facts. Intuition can be a valuable tool for interpreting the facts, and even for guessing what the facts will prove to be, but it cannot substitute for the facts. Yet Weil may not agree with this. He asserts that \"there exists within us a source of direct information about reality that can teach us all we need to know.\" Does he mean that this inner \"source\" need not conform to observed facts? Apparently so, because chapter seven's main thrust is to assert the primacy of intuition over observation. In Weil's mind, intuition, no matter how bizarre and unsubstantiated, rules the day. But if intuition rules, how would we find the truth when one person's intuition conflicts with another's? Weil does not appear to consider that a problem, either. For, as \"stoned thinking\" reveals, there is not one truth, but many truths. Reality itself is basically \"ambivalent.\" Weil notes that the wisdom of \"stoned thinking\" is reflected in the teachings of Oriental philosophies and religions, which have always understood the essentially \"ambivalent\" nature of reality. He further contends that, with quantum theory, modern physicists have pursued this idea about the paradoxical ambivalence of reality into the subatomic world, \"where they find that entities like electrons and photons can exist either as waves or particles, energy or matter.\" \"Ordinary consciousness\" cannot accept such riddles, he says, but modern physicists can, and so can those who learn \"stoned thinking.\" In states of \"altered consciousness\" we wipe out contradictions and resolve perplexities such as the mind-body problem. We see that \"mind and body are really the two expressions of the same phenomenon-just as waves and particles are two phases of expression of the entity called an electron.\" I will return to Weil's invocation of quantum physics in support of his arguments, because it reflects a basic misunderstanding that underlies much of the present revolt against science and science-based medicine. There is more of this kind of thing in the remainder of his \"Stonesville\" chapter, much of which defies rational belief or is just plain wrong about the facts. Weil states, for example, that \"stoned\" thinking enables us to gain control of our autonomic, or involuntary, nervous system, and that the practical application of this thinking in the form of \"autonomic feedback control\" enables patients to control high blood pressure more effectively and safely than by the use of antihypertensive drugs. He claims that allopathic physicians \"have no effective drug for high blood pressure.\" Now, even in 1972, when The Natural Mind was first published, this statement was dubious, to say the least; and it was certainly false in 1985 when the book was republished and supposedly updated. Weil tells us that patients can be taught to lower their blood pressure by a form of training called \"feedback control.\" The fact is that \"feedback control\" (or \"the relaxation response,\" as it is called by Dr. Herbert Benson, its chief advocate and another well-known guru of alternative medicine) produces at most only small and usually transient reductions in blood pressure. Feedback control has never been shown to be as effective in the long-term control of moderate to severe hypertension as any of a variety of pharmacological agents prescribed for this purpose. There are always risks of side effects with any active pharmaceutical, and antihypertensive agents are no exception. When properly used, however, they have proven beyond reasonable doubt to be a major advance in medical therapeutics. In fact, they are one big reason for the significant decline over the past three decades in the incidence of stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure, all of which can result from uncontrolled, severe hypertension. Weil would have been correct if he had simply observed that anti-hypertensive drugs are often used excessively, particularly when blood pressure is only mildly elevated. He would also have been correct had he suggested that a reduction in stress and a change in diet and lifestyle will often help in the management of such cases. But in The Natural Mind he suggests that self-treatment is the treatment of choice in many if not most cases. In his more recent books about self-healing approaches to health care, he is more prudent: he advises patients to check their own blood pressure and to seek guidance from an allopathic physician if simple remedies are not working. Unfortunately, the antiallopathic thrust in his teaching is more apt to be heeded than his cautions and his qualifications. Seriously hypertensive patients who delay seeking proper medical treatment may, as a result, suffer great harm. The neglect of available and often effective standard medical treatment for many kinds of illness would seem to be an inevitable consequence of the dogma promulgated in the seventh chapter of The Natural Mind. Here are other examples of Weil's casual dismissal of common sense and medical fact in this chapter, and of his penchant for sweeping generalizations that cannot stand analysis. \"My intuitions about disease are: first, that its physical manifestations are mostly caused by nonmaterial factors, in particular by unnatural restraints placed on the unconscious mind; and second, that the limits to what human consciousness can cause in the physical body are far beyond where most of us imagine them.\" Or, again: \"Since leaving the world of allopathic practice, I have witnessed a number of impressive nonallopathic cures of ... dramatic illnesses, including cancer and life-threatening infections.\" And later: \"To the straight mind nonallopathic healing sounds very mystical. Faith healing is held in contempt by most rational people, despite the abundant evidence of cures.\" (The italics are mine.) Weil's later books make many claims for such \"cures,\" as we shall see, but despite his reference to \"abundant evidence,\" he almost never gives us anything more than the claim itself\u2014unsupported by objective and documented observations. To Weil, subjective belief, if persuasive enough to the patient, should be adequate to support the claim of reality. And by \"reality\" he does not refer simply to the patient's state of mind, but to the physical dimensions of the disease itself. The allegedly miraculous \"cures\" are not simply dramatic improvements in symptoms, but the disappearance of all physical evidence of disease. And why shouldn't this be reasonable if one believes, like Weil, that consciousness is the primary reality and that the physical aspects of disease, indeed the entire material world itself, are simply another aspect of mind? The extent to which Weil reveres consciousness regardless of its thought content is revealed in the final sections of his \"Stonesville\" chapter. Here he favors us with his views on psychosis, on the Jungian theory of shared universal consciousness, and on the reality of mental telepathy, extrasensory perception, and hallucinatory experiences. On psychosis: \"Psychotics are persons whose nonordinary experience is exceptionally strong ... every psychotic is a potential sage or healer.\" With regard to the National Institute of Mental Health's research efforts to find the physical basis of psychosis: \"If it sticks to its present course, NIMH will be the last institution in America to recognize the positive potential of psychosis\u2014a potential so overwhelming that I am almost tempted to call psychotics the evolutionary vanguard of our species. They possess the secret of changing reality by changing the mind; if they can learn to use that talent for positive ends, there are no limits to what they can accomplish.\" With respect to C.G. Jung's ideas, Weil says: \"It appears that at some level of the unconscious we pass beyond personal awareness into a universal awareness unlimited by time and space. Most of us may think we never experience such a thing, but it may be that we simply never pay attention to it. I am convinced it happens.\" He then cites examples of such experiences caused by the ingestion of hallucinogenic herbs in Indian sacramental rituals. About shared consciousness and mental telepathy, he has this to say: \"Not only do I think each of us can share consciousness, I think all of us are already doing it all the time.... Extrasensory perceptions are not unusual talents possessed by specially gifted individuals. They are normal unconscious events, and scientists who attempt to document them by laboratory experiments will never get to experience them directly.\" One might think that this kind of talk, written more than 25 years ago by a youthful and angry rebel against medical scientific orthodoxy, would be an embarrassment to the 56-year-old leader of a movement that aspires to integrate alternative concepts into the curriculum and the practice of conventional medicine. Not so. In a brief preface to the edition of The Natural Mind that appeared this year, Weil explicitly reaffirms his early views: \"The philosophy of my first book is the same philosophy that underlies my writing about health.\" To be even more specific, he adds: \"The seed of my thinking about conventional and alternative medicine can be found in Chapter 7 of this book.\" So we must take him at his word: he really does believe in miracles and in faith healing, in the ability of mind to cause and to cure disease, and in the existence of a consciousness that is in some real sense independent of the brain. In fact, these ideas reverberate in all of his later writing. The seventh chapter of The Natural Mind is simply the first and most forceful statement of a philosophy that has softened and blurred a bit, as Weil's career has progressed, but is fundamentally unchanged. And this philosophy poses serious intellectual problems for Weil's current attempt to integrate alternative and conventional medical practices. II. The Natural Mind was followed by two more popular books about consciousness and mind-altering drugs\u2014The Marriage of the Sun and Moon: A Quest for Unity in Consciousness (1980); and, with Winifred Rosen, From Chocolate to Morphine: Everything You Need to Know About Mind-Altering Drugs (1983). Neither book dealt directly with alternative medicine. His next book on medicine was Health and Healing (1983, republished in 1998). By then Weil had established himself in Tucson as a general medical practitioner and was on the part-time clinical faculty of the College of Medicine of the University of Arizona, where he gave an elective course of lectures about alternative medicine. Health and Healing was the first of a series of five books he was to write in the years from 1983 to 1998 and, like most of them, it was a national best-seller. It established Weil as a leading figure in the alternative medicine movement. More than any of his writings before or after, it provided a broad and fairly systematic exposition of his opinions on the nature of health and healing, on allopathic medicine, and on the varieties of alternative or unconventional medicine. In the preface to the 1998 edition of Health and Healing, Weil remarks that \"it remains the philosophical and theoretical basis of all my subsequent work in medicine.\" Consider Weil's strange discussion in this book of sickness and health. \"Sickness is the manifestation of evil in the body,\" he proclaims, \"just as health is the manifestation of holiness. Sickness and health are not simply physical states.... They are rooted in the deepest and most mysterious strata of Being.\" He introduces these ideas in the context of his views on the connection between religion, magic, and medicine. \"In our society,\" he observes, \"the commonality of religion, magic, and medicine is obscured. Our medical doctors have narrowed their view to pay attention only to the physical body and the material aspects of illness. As a result ... they do not see or integrate the nonphysical forces that animate and direct the physical body,\" and they do not realize that \"health and illness are particular manifestations of good and evil, requiring all the help of religion and philosophy to understand and all the techniques of magic to manipulate. Science and intellect can show us mechanisms and details of physical reality\u2014and that knowledge is surely of value\u2014but they cannot unveil the deep mysteries. You cannot restore health in yourself or in others until you know in your heart what health is.\" Lest we despair of ever knowing in our heart what health is, Weil unveils the mystery: \"Health is wholeness\u2014wholeness in its most profound sense, with nothing left out and everything in just the right order to manifest the mystery of balance. Far from being simply the absence of disease, health is a dynamic and harmonious equilibrium of all the elements and forces making up and surrounding a human being.\" Health, it seems, is a mystery explained by another mysterious principle. This is the \"mystery of balance.\" Weil follows this revelation with an additional \"ten principles of health and illness,\" the most mysterious of which is the last: \"Proper breathing is a key to good health.\" He explains that breathing, since it can be voluntary or involuntary, is a \"bridge between the conscious and unconscious minds as well as between mind and body. Proper breathing nourishes the central nervous system, establishes a harmonious pattern for other bodily rhythms, and also regulates moods and emotions.... Improper breathing is a common cause of ill health. By decreasing general vitality, it increases susceptibility to agents of disease. It can also directly cause problems in many different systems of the body. Learning how to breathe and working consciously with breath is a simple, safe, effective, and inexpensive way to promote good health of mind and body.\" \"Breathing\" is an important and recurring theme in Weil's prescriptions for health and healing, and it holds a prominent place in Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, which appeared in 1997. As far as I can see, his opinions on this subject are largely nonsense. There is not the slightest medical evidence that \"improper breathing is a common cause of ill health.\" All the clinical and physiological evidence points to exactly the reverse relationship. It suggests that many types of disease and physiological dysfunction can affect breathing. Sometimes this secondary change in breathing can be serious enough to change the normal intake of oxygen or the normal elimination of carbon dioxide in ways that further impair health; but the primary causes of the problem are the diseases or the physiological disturbances that cause the abnormal pattern of breathing, not the breathing itself. While it is true that conscious attention to breathing can help individuals to relax, there is no evidence that the breathing exercises Weil advocates have any special advantage over any other techniques for relaxation, or that they have any special therapeutic powers. Like so many of his other pronouncements, Weil's claims about breathing come ex cathedra from his own self-asserted authority as guru and healer. Much of what he has to say about health and healing in this book and in his later works is just like this fanciful section on breathing\u2014a bald assertion without any credible rationale or supporting objective evidence. Then there is Weil's typically ambiguous assessment of conventional, or allopathic, medicine. First he concedes that it is not all bad, and that \"regular medicine is the most effective system I know for dealing with many common and serious problems,\" among them acute medical and surgical emergencies. But then he adds that \"regular medicine is on very shaky ground\" in dealing with other common problems. \"I would look elsewhere than conventional medicine for help if I contracted a severe viral disease like hepatitis or polio, or a metabolic disease like diabetes. I would not seek allopathic treatment for cancer, except for a few varieties, or for such chronic ailments as arthritis, asthma, hypertension (high blood pressure), multiple sclerosis, or for many other chronic diseases....\" This is a startling list of major diseases to be ruled off-limits for conventional medicine. One wonders which of the remaining chronic diseases Weil is willing to concede to the allopaths, and how he knows where to draw the line. Some of Weil's criticisms of medical practitioners in this and other books are nonetheless valid. I agree with him that conventional physicians are often too interested in the disease and not enough interested in the patient; too inclined to use expensive technology and potent pharmaceuticals when simpler and more conservative approaches would work at least as well. And he is correct in noting that mainstream medicine, despite its many successes, still has only a limited ability to change the course of many serious chronic illnesses. Yet that hardly justifies Weil's sweeping and irresponsible dismissal of allopathic medicine's role in the diagnosis, the management, and the palliation of all the serious illnesses that he enumerates and the indeterminate list to which he alludes. He implies that alternative medicine could do better, but there is no published evidence to support that opinion. And even if Weil's assertions about the superiority of alternative methods for the treatment of some diseases were correct, how could patients be expected to know when to seek help from alternative healers unless they knew in advance what was wrong with them? One of the main reasons to consult a physician is to determine whether symptoms need to be taken seriously and what might be causing them. Weil's advice could result in dangerous delays in the diagnosis and the treatment of serious illness, unless he were also to recommend that patients first seek competent medical evaluation and advice before considering unconventional treatments. That may be what he had in mind in recently establishing an \"integrative medicine\" clinic at the University of Arizona, in which allopathic physicians prescribe both conventional and unconventional treatments. Still, without credible evidence that unconventional treatments are equivalent to, or better than, standard medical care, even that eclectic approach is seriously flawed. III. One of Weil's central themes in Health and Healing, and in his subsequent work, is his criticism of mainstream medicine's reliance on pharmaceuticals instead of herbal medicines. The latter are presently enjoying a great resurgence in popularity, due largely to the endorsement of prominent advocates such as Weil, and to the promotional activities of a \"natural products\" industry that received a big boost in 1994, when Congress gave the industry permission to market herbal preparations with less rigorous oversight by the FDA than the agency exercises over drugs. Manufacturers of herbal preparations can avoid many of the customary rigors of FDA drug regulation simply by labeling these products \"dietary supplements.\" In 1997, the herbal medicine market had sales of nearly $4 billion, and a stroll down the aisles of almost any supermarket or chain drugstore will confirm that business is booming. A cover story in Time magazine a few weeks ago was all about this burgeoning new herbal remedy business and the popular craze for \"natural\" medicines. Weil's preference for herbs and his dislike of synthetic pharmaceutical products probably stem from his earlier training in botany and his long interest in the psychedelic properties of plants. It also reflects his belief in the virtues of \"natural\" healing methods that patients themselves can employ without recourse to physicians or expensive medical technology. Herbs can be purchased without prescription and are relatively inexpensive in comparison with prescription drugs. In earlier times herbs were the only medicinal remedies available, and botany was a part of the medical school curriculum. But then scientists learned how to extract and synthesize the active constituents of medicinal herbs, and medical botany was replaced by modern pharmacology. Modern pharmacological science now provides physicians with a vast armamentarium of clinically effective synthetic compounds, many derived from or closely related to substances found in nature, others created in the laboratory. These pure compounds can be standardized and tested for purity, clinical potency, and safety far more easily than the complex and highly variable natural plant materials doctors formerly prescribed. In some advanced Western countries-in Germany, for example\u2014herbal medicines are still widely prescribed, but the manufacture, the purity, and the potency of these preparations are far more carefully regulated by the government than in the United States. Weil doesn't like the modern pharmaceutical industry and he wants us to return to our former dependence on herbs. His arguments are on balance unconvincing, but they are not without some reason. Weil has an arguable case, I think, when he criticizes the pharmaceutical industry for promoting expensive new drugs that have little or no advantage over older and less expensive drugs, and for sometimes being insufficiently attentive to their risks. I also have some sympathy with his criticism of the excessive prescribing of potent pharmaceuticals by physicians, and the common practice of prescribing many drugs simultaneously without sufficient attention to their toxic or interactive effects. There is no doubt that improper use of pharmaceuticals, including mistakes in dosage and even inadvertent administration of the wrong drug, causes many serious mishaps in hospital and office practice. Even the proper use of drugs can sometimes cause fatal reactions. Misuse of antibiotics can cause the development of drug-resistant strains of bacteria. Still, the fact remains that pharmaceuticals are an essential part of medical practice. Without them there would be no effective treatment or palliation of many serious diseases. On balance, the good done by modern pharmaceuticals far outweighs the harm, though zealous advocates of \"natural\" remedies (Weil among them) insist otherwise. Even in Germany, where botanical medicines are widely used by allopathic physicians, pharmaceutical drugs are the mainstay of treatment for serious illnesses. Weil claims that the presence of many different active and inactive ingredients, known and unknown, makes natural botanical products safer and more effective than synthetic pharmaceuticals. This is mostly speculation, since there have been very few clinical trials directly comparing herbs with pharmaceuticals in the treatment of specific ailments. What Weil does not mention, here or elsewhere in his books, are the problems created by the lack of purity and standardization of herbal products. A recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine contained several reports of serious clinical complications resulting from adulterants or contaminants in commercial preparations of herbs. As an accompanying editorial in the Journal noted, there can be no safe and rational use of herbal medicines without regulation of their purity and their potency\u2014even assuming that there were evidence of potentially useful clinical effects. Weil has a good word to say for almost all alternative healing methods, except for some practices used by so-called \"holistic\" physicians. \"Holistic medicine\" is an outdated term that formerly referred to many of the same methods in common use by today's alternative healers, but also included other less widely used methods of diagnosis and treatment that have not attracted much attention recently. Why Weil singles the latter out for disapproval is not entirely clear, since his criticisms would seem to apply equally to many of the alternative methods that he does endorse. In any case, after a general review of the latter, he concludes that the belief of the healer and the patient in the effectiveness of the various forms of alternative treatment is the common explanation that ties them all together. This is his conclusion: \"Since belief alone can elicit healing, the occasional success of treatments based on absurd theories is not mysterious.\" Weil next considers the healing power of the placebo effect, by which he means the faith of the patient and the practitioner in the therapeutic value of whatever treatment is being used. He says that all treatments depend more or less on this faith, and that is why any treatment, real or imaginary, may be able to cure any disease in certain patients by helping them to mobilize their innate healing powers. Sometimes the result is mainly due to the direct physical action of the treatment, and sometimes it is mainly due to the patient's own belief in the treatment, and sometimes it appears to be a combination of effects. Weil probably believes that herbal remedies, diet, physical exercise, and other lifestyle changes belong mainly in the first category. Faith healing, therapeutic touch, magnetism, and most of the other more esoteric alternative healing methods would probably be placed in the second category. Meditation, breathing exercises, biofeedback, acupuncture, musculoskeletal manipulations, and yoga would probably be placed in the third category. How does Weil know that any of these alternative methods, or any combination of them, regardless of the way they work, can cure disease? Because he has been told about, or thinks that he has seen, apparent cures of supposedly incurable diseases that could not be otherwise explained. And where is the documented, objective evidence of such cures? There isn't any. We simply must trust Weil's opinion, and the belief of those who report these events to him. Weil's books are full of such stories, none supported by anything resembling scientific evidence. Here are some examples. In Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, Weil tells about a letter he received from a patient who wrote: \"Six years ago (I'm now twenty-seven) the doctors threw the ugly `C-word' at me and made it sound like a death sentence. (It was bone cancer.) They decided that they were the authorities and I was the victim and the only way was their way. I walked out of their offices never to return. I took up biking (about five hundred miles a week) and running (about sixty miles a week), and ate fresh fruit, juices, and whole grains ... nothing else. Too bad more people out there won't acknowledge what a little self-determination and using one's subconscious can do to return a person to wholeness.\" The patient goes on to say that he or she is now entirely well and hopes to \"work toward developing programs for others to offer them alternative pathways toward health and wholeness.\" How do we know that this person really had \"bone cancer\" and what really happened? We don't know, of course, but that doesn't seem to concern Weil, who cites the case without further comment as evidence of self-induced healing of a serious disease. In the same book, Weil tells about a woman patient who had \"an unusual form of Parkinson's disease\" which caused her to have frequent seizures during sleep. Presumably in response to Weil's advice, she tried \"acupuncture, yoga, massage, meditation and other stress-reduction work,\" and finally \"respiratory biofeedback,\" which eventually caused the seizures to stop. Here again, there is no medical documentation of the diagnosis or the alleged effects of the alternative treatments. A final example comes from Spontaneous Healing (1995). It concerns a man with scleroderma (a usually progressive and fatal disease of the skin and internal organs, thought to be an autoimmune disorder) who cured himself with vinegar, lemons, aloe vera juice and vitamin E. How does Weil know this really happened? Apparently, the patient told him so. It was only a testimonial but, as Weil explains in Spontaneous Healing, he finds these stories meaningful. \"I collect this material, save it, and take it seriously. In its totality and range and abundance it makes one powerful point: People can get better ... from all sorts of conditions or diseases, even very severe ones of long duration.\" That people usually \"get better,\" that most relatively minor diseases heal spontaneously or seem to improve with simple common remedies, is hardly news. Every physician, indeed every grandmother, knows that. Yet before we accept Weil's contention that serious illnesses such as \"bone cancer,\" \"Parkinson's disease,\" or \"scleroderma\" are similarly curable, or respond to alternative healing methods, we need at least to have some convincing medical evidence that the patients whom he reports in these testimonials did indeed suffer from these diseases, and that they were really improved or healed. The perplexity is not that Weil is using \"anecdotes\" as proof, but that we don't know whether the anecdotes are true. Anecdotal evidence is often used in the conventional medical literature to suggest the effectiveness of treatment that has not yet been tested by formal clinical trials. In fact, much of the mainstream professional literature in medicine consists of case reports\u2014\"anecdotes,\" of a kind. The crucial difference between those case reports and the testimonials that abound in Weil's books (and throughout the literature of alternative medicine) is that the case reports in the mainstream literature are almost always meticulously documented with objective data to establish the diagnosis and to verify what happened, whereas the testimonials cited by alternative medicine practitioners usually are not. Weil almost never gives any objective data to support his claims. Almost everything is simply hearsay and personal opinion. To the best of my knowledge, Weil himself has published nothing in the peer-reviewed medical literature to document objectively his personal experiences with allegedly cured patients or to verify his claims for the effectiveness of any of the unorthodox remedies he uses. He is not alone in this respect. Few proponents of alternative medicine have so far published clinical reports that would stand the rigorous scientific scrutiny given to studies of traditional medical treatments published in the serious medical journals. Alternative medicine is still a field rich in undocumented claims and anecdotes and relatively lacking in credible scientific reports. IV. The growing interest of the medical establishment in studying alternative medicine may soon establish the credibility\u2014or the incredibility\u2014of alternative medical notions. In the absence of supporting evidence, however, skepticism is surely in order, particularly since belief in much of what Weil is saying about mind and body, and the ability of consciousness to operate in the physical world, requires a rejection of the fundamental physical laws upon which our current views of nature and the human body are based. This does not appear to ruffle Weil, who believes that these laws have already been changed. Indeed, he argues that physicians need to understand that modern quantum physics has overturned much of classical physical theory and is revealing a new perspective on nature, in which the observing mind is the primary reality, and can cause natural phenomena to behave oddly. It is time for us to reject the old-fashioned scientific materialism, says Weil. \"What most medical doctors do not know is that the scientific model of reality has changed radically since 1900 and no longer views the universe as an orderly mechanism independent of the consciousness observing it.\" In one of the final chapters of Health and Healing, called \"What Doctors Can Learn from Physicists,\" Weil offers his interpretation of the revelations of quantum physics. Experimental data have shown that when observed one way, light seems to be acting like a wave, and when observed another way, it acts like a stream of particles. Quantum theory embraces that paradox in a probabilistic, mathematical description of subatomic physical phenomena that seems incomprehensible to common sense and ordinary experience, but that accords with the experimental data. Weil's interpretation of quantum theory is that it forces us \"to consider consciousness [by which he presumably means the mind of the observer] as an active agent in the formation of reality, inseparable from it.\" And so he concludes that \"in the world of ordinary experience, the materialistic and mechanistic theories of the past may continue to seem right and work as reasonable approximations, but if consciousness has to be included to explain observed properties of atomic particles, it cannot be independent of systems composed of those particles, whether rocks, stars, plants, or, especially, human beings.\" According to Weil, quantum physics in effect validates his \"stoned thinking,\" because it demonstrates that ultimate reality is in the mind of the observer, and thoughts can make anything happen. Thus Weil can believe in miraculous cures even while claiming to be rational and scientific, because he thinks that quantum theory supports his views. Yet the leading physicists of our time do not accept such an interpretation of quantum theory. They do not believe quantum theory says anything about the role of human consciousness in the physical world. They see quantum laws as simply a useful mathematical formulation for describing subatomic phenomena that are not adequately handled by classical physical theory, although the latter remains quite satisfactory for the analysis of physical events at the macro-level. Steven Weinberg has observed that \"quantum mechanics has been overwhelmingly important to physics, but I cannot find any messages for human life in quantum mechanics that are different in any important way from those of Newtonian physics.\" And overriding all discussions of the meaning of quantum physics is the fundamental fact that quantum theory, like all other scientific law, is only valid to the extent that it predicts and accords with the evidence provided by observation and objective measurement. Richard Feynman said it quite simply: \"Observation is the ultimate and final judge of the truth of an idea.\" Feynman also pointed out that scientific observations need to be objective, reproducible, and, in a sense, public\u2014that is, available to all interested scientists who wish to check the observations for themselves. Surely almost all scientists would agree with Feynman that, regardless of what theory of nature we wish to espouse, we cannot escape the obligation to support our claims with objective evidence. All theories must conform to the facts or be discarded. So, if Weil cannot produce credible evidence to validate the miraculous cures that he claims for the healing powers of the mind, and if he does not support with objective data the claims he and others make for the effectiveness of alternative healing methods, he cannot presume to wear the mantle of science, and his appeal to quantum theory cannot help him. Some apologists for alternative medicine have argued that since their healing methods are based on a \"paradigm\" different from that of traditional medicine, traditional standards of evidence do not apply. Weil sometimes seems to agree with that view, as when he talks about \"stoned thinking\" and the \"ambivalent\" nature of reality, but more recently\u2014as he seeks to integrate alternative with allopathic medicine\u2014he seems to acknowledge the need for objective evidence. This, at least, is how I would interpret one of his most recent and ambitious publishing ventures, the editorship of the new quarterly journal Integrative Medicine. Integrative Medicine describes itself as a \"peer-reviewed journal ... committed to gathering evidence for the safety and efficacy of all approaches to health according to the highest standards of scientific research, while remaining open to new paradigms and honoring the healing power of nature.\" The Associate Editors and Editorial Board include prominent names in both alternative medicine and allopathic medicine, who presumably support that mission. Yet the first two issues will disappoint those who were looking for original clinical research based on new, objective data. Perhaps subsequent issues will be different, but in any case it is hard to understand the need for Weil's new journal if he truly intends to hold manuscripts to accepted scientific standards: there already exist many leading peer-reviewed medical journals that will review research studies of alternative healing methods on their merits. During the past decade or so, only a few such studies have passed rigorous review and have been published in first-rate journals. Recently, more studies have been published, but very few of them report significant clinical effects. And that is pretty much where matters now stand. Despite much avowed interest in research on alternative medicine and increased investment in support of such research, the evidentiary underpinnings of unconventional healing methods are still largely lacking. V. Health and Healing, published in 1983, was the last of Weil's comprehensive and broadly conceived commentaries on health and disease. Beginning in 1995, with Natural Health, Natural Medicine, he produced a series of three \"how-to\" manuals on wellness and self-care, which established his current reputation as the people's doctor and \"America's most trusted medical expert.\" The next was Spontaneous Healing, and the third Eight Weeks to Optimum Health. These volumes follow the familiar, commercially tested patterns of health care manuals by offering their readers \"proven programs\" for achieving health and warding off disease. Advice on nutrition, herbal therapy, lifestyle, and environmental modifications, plus suggestions for psychological self-help, are liberally interspersed with anecdotes and testimonials about patients who are alleged to have achieved dramatic\u2014sometimes apparently miraculous\u2014results through the use of the recommended methods. The recommendations range from commonsensical, generally accepted, and medically sound advice on nutrition and modification of lifestyle to odd, almost bizarre recommendations that have nothing more than Weil's confident assurances and putative \"experience\" to back them up. Statements are usually made about the curative or preventive powers of some food or herb or healing practice, without the citation of any published evidence. Recipes abound, as do step-by-step guides for certain ritualistic health practices. The rituals and meditations contribute a quasi-religiosity to these practices, which undoubtedly enhance their appeal. All of this is pretty familiar stuff in the self-help medical literature, but Weil manages to make it dramatic and fresh enough to attract vast numbers of followers. The most recent of Weil's publications is Ask Dr. Weil, a compilation of questions and answers that have appeared on his website. To judge from the range of questions and the confidence with which they are answered, Weil considers himself an authority on almost every field in medicine. Like his previous books, it includes strong, unqualified recommendations for unlikely and totally unproven remedies, such as massive intravenous doses of Vitamin C to hasten the healing of surgical wounds, and homeopathic medicines and hypnotherapy for the treatment of lupus. It also includes perfectly sensible advice about diet, exercise, and stress reduction that would be given by almost any competent medical practitioner and would find abundant support in the standard medical literature. In addition to his books, other channels for the dissemination of Weil's medical wisdom include audiocassettes and compact discs on such subjects as \"Eight Meditations for Optimum Health\" and \"Sound Body, Sound Mind: Music for Healing with Andrew Weil, M.D.\" His influence is also spread through videotapes of lectures and seminars, and appearances on television shows such as \"Larry King Live.\" Even when compared with the ballyhoo surrounding the other icons of alternative medicine, the marketing success of \"Andrew Weil, M.D.\" is extraordinary. To understand it, one has to appreciate the synergistic interaction between the special talents of the man and the current momentum of the alternative medicine movement. The alternative medicine movement has been around for a long time, but it was eclipsed during most of this century by the success of medical science. Now there is growing public disenchantment with the cost and the impersonality of modern medical care, as well as concern about medical mistakes and the complications and side-effects of pharmaceuticals and other forms of medical treatment. For their part, physicians have allowed the public to perceive them as uninterested in personal problems, as inaccessible to their patients except when carrying out technical procedures and surgical operations. The \"doctor knows best\" attitude, which dominated patient-doctor relations during most of the century, has in recent decades given way to a more activist, consumer-oriented view of the patient's role. Moreover, many other licensed health-care professionals, such as nurse-practitioners, psychotherapists, pharmacists, and chiropractors, are providing services once exclusively reserved to allopathic physicians. The net result of all these developments has been a weakening of the hegemony that allopathic medicine once exercised over the health care system, and a growing interest by the public in exploring other healing approaches. The authority of allopathic medicine is also being challenged by a swelling current of mysticism and anti-scientism that runs deep through our culture. Even as the number and the complexity of urgent technological and scientific issues facing contemporary society increase, there seems to be a growing public distrust of the scientific outlook and a reawakening of interest in mysticism and spiritualism. All this obscurantism has given powerful impetus to the alternative medicine movement, with its emphasis on the power of mind over matter. And so consumer demand for alternative remedies is rising, as is public and private financial support for their study and clinical use. It is no wonder that practicing physicians, the academic medical establishment, and the National Institutes of Health are all finding reasons to pay more attention to the alternative medicine movement. Indeed, it is becoming politically incorrect for the movement's critics to express their skepticism too strongly in public. Weil would seem at first to be ideally suited to be a leader of the alternative medicine movement at this juncture. He is articulate, self-assured, intellectually nimble\u2014and wonderfully ambiguous. Ambiguity, after all, should be helpful to those who would defend systems of healing that are based on irrational or non-existent theories and are supported by no credible empirical evidence. But Weil wants to do more than to defend and to advocate the use of alternative healing. He wants to reform the medical establishment. His goal, he says, is to change the \"paradigm\" of medicine by integrating alternative methods and modes of thought into the teachings and practice of mainstream medicine. That is his declared mission at the University of Arizona College of Medicine. He seems to believe that he is qualified to accomplish this great reform because he has no difficulty in arguing on both sides of the debate between alternative and traditional healing. In an interview he gave last year, when asked whether he sometimes feels torn between his traditional medical training at Harvard and the new alternatives, Weil replied: \"I really think I'm in the middle. Sometimes I'm attacking traditional medicine, sometimes I'm defending it; sometimes I'm defending alternative medicine and sometimes attacking it, so I think I'm pretty even-handed in my criticism. I'm unique in that I'm not aligned with any one school of thought.\" That may be how Weil really thinks about himself and his \"integrative\" approach, but on close examination his position makes little sense. He cannot have the argument both ways. As Weil clearly points out in his earlier books, alternative healing is based on a conception of nature and a theory of learning the truth about nature that is fundamentally at odds with the \"straight,\" evidence-based thinking of mainstream medicine. As defined by Weil, and by most of the other gurus of alternative medicine, alternative and mainstream medicine are not simply different methods of treating illness. They are basically incompatible views of reality and how the material world works, and they cannot easily be combined into any rational and coherent \"integrated\" curriculum. Is there an objective real world out there, of which human bodies are a part? If so, how do we learn about it? How do we determine whether a method of healing is effective or not? Do we follow the universal rule of science, as explained by Feynman, that objective, verifiable observation is the ultimate and final judge of the truth of an idea, or do we use the subjective methods advocated by the alternative medicine gurus and described by Weil in his \"Stonesville\" chapter? Without agreement on such basic issues, it is hard to know what Weil means by being \"even-handed\" in dealing with the two types of medical practice. Sometimes he seems to believe in the primacy of objective evidence and talks like a scientist, but more often he does not. This is inconsistency and confusion, not even-handedness. It is hardly a useful basis for the \"new paradigm\" of \"integrative medicine\" that Weil is promoting. There is no doubt that modern medicine as it is now practiced needs to improve its relations with patients, and that some of the criticisms leveled against it by people such as Weil\u2014and by many more within the medical establishment itself\u2014are valid. There also can be no doubt that a few of the \"natural\" medicines and healing methods now being used by practitioners of alternative medicine will prove, after testing, to be safe and effective. This, after all, has been the way in which many important therapeutic agents and treatments have found their way into standard medical practice in the past. Mainstream medicine should continue to be open to the testing of selected unconventional treatments. In keeping an open mind, however, the medical establishment in this country must not lose its scientific compass or weaken its commitment to rational thought and the rule of evidence. There are not two kinds of medicine, one conventional and the other unconventional, that can be practiced jointly in a new kind of \"integrative medicine.\" Nor, as Andrew Weil and his friends also would have us believe, are there two kinds of thinking, or two ways to find out which treatments work and which do not. In the best kind of medical practice, all proposed treatments must be tested objectively. In the end, there will only be treatments that pass that test and those that do not, those that are proven worthwhile and those that are not. Can there be any reasonable \"alternative\"?

Other Canadian statistics indicate the incidence of ischemic strokes in people under 45 is about 750 a year. The researchers believe that their data indicate that 20% are due to neck manipulation, so there may be \"gross underreporting\" of chiropractic manipulation as a cause of stroke. [Beletsky V.

Naturopathic accrediting agency loses approval. The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) is no longer recognized as the accrediting agency for naturopathic schools. CNME was recognized in 1987 and accredited three of the four full-time naturopathic colleges. But in 1998, the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity recommended denial of that CNME's petition for continued recognition, and on January 16, 2001, [U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley concurred](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/accreditation.html). The committee's recommendation was based on evidence that CNME had not responded appropriately to violations of its standards at Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine and Health Sciences. None of the naturopathic college Web sites mentions that CNME lost its recognition. Three of the schools remain accredited and the fourth is a candidate for accreditation by recognized regional accrediting agencies that are not health-related. Naturopaths are licensed in eleven states and are pressing for licensure in several others. Although Riley's decision may make it more difficult to promote licensing, it has received almost no publicity. Riley's decision cannot be appealed, but CNME is likely to reapply for accreditation in the future. Florida doctors offered insurance against frivolous malpractice suits.

The Washington State Court of Appeals has upheld an administrative decision to discipline former chiropractor John D. Brown for unprofessional conduct for practicing with an expired license. In 2000, the Commission of Chiropractic Quality Assurance charged that Brown had performed chiropractic manipulations but called his practice \"alphabiotics.\" which he claimed is a sacrament of the Alphabiotic Church, of which he said he is a priest. He testified that he was performing alphabiotic \"alignment\" and not a chiropractic adjustment. However, the Commission concluded that \"alphabiotics\" treatments are indistinguishable from chiropractic and that certain techniques he used are associated with risk of stroke. It also concluded that his failure to warn of the risk of stroke\u2014and an inadequate response when one of his patients suffered a stroke during an adjustment\u2014were below the state standard of care required for chiropractors. The Commission levied a $30,000 fine and revoked Brown's license for ten years. The [Alphabiotics International](http://www.alphabiotics.com/) Web site, which lacks a clear description of what its practitioners do, states that alphabiotics \"can't be fully explained\" but \"must be experienced to be fully understood.\" However, the Commission concluded that Alphabiotics is a chiropractic variant in which treatment is limited to neck adjustment.

Physical therapists may be barred from treating \"subluxations.\" On January 15, 2001, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) declared that Medicare+Choice organizations \"may not use non-physician physical therapists for manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation.\" [ [CMS operations policy letter #OPL2002.023, Jan 15, 2002](http://www.chirobase.org/08Legal/mcpt.html#opl23)] The American Physical Therapy Association has responded with a [letter seeking clarification](https://www.apta.org/news/chiro_challenge/apta_statement). The problem has arisen because in the early 1970s, Congress amended the Medicare law to include coverage for \"manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation of the spine . . . which has resulted in a neuromuscular condition for which such manipulation is appropriate.\" To enable payment, chiropractors held a consensus conference that produced a 7-page document defining 18 types of \"subluxations,\" many of which are fancy terms for the minor degenerative changes that occur as people age and are not changed by chiropractic treatment. The significance of the CMS letter is unclear. Scientific practitioners (medical doctors and physical therapists) define \"subluxation\" as incomplete or partial dislocation\u2014a condition in which the bony surfaces of a joint no longer face each other exactly but remain partially aligned. No such condition can be corrected by chiropractic treatment. [The vast majority of chiropractors use the term to mean other things](http://www.chirobase.org/01General/chirosub.html). Some describe subluxations as \"bones out of place\" and/or \"pinched nerves\"; some think in terms of \"fixations\" or loss of joint mobility; and some occupy a middle ground that includes any or all of these concepts. Physical therapists are justified in seeking to preserve their right to perform manual manipulation to relieve back and neck discomfort. They do not actually treat any type of subluxation. However, it remains to be seen whether the semantic tangle created by the Medicare law will be used to restrict them.

A ... Sham nutritionists are practitioners who hold themselves out to the public as qualified in nutrition and dietetics, but who do not practice on the basis of nutrition science or standards of conduct observed by ethical practitioners. Sham nutritionists are characterized by : - Their use of bogus credentials to feign expertise - Their use of invalid methods of health or nutrition assessment; - Their inappropriate prescription practices. [See Jarvis, \"Recognizing today's nutrition quacks,\" Nutrition & the MD, 1985;11:(12):1-2)] Sham nutritionists generally obtain their credentials from certification or diploma mills. The Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education defined a diploma or degree mill as \"an organization that awards degrees without requiring its students to meet educational standards for such degrees established and traditionally followed by reputable institutions. A degree mill either receives funds from its so-called students on the basis of fraudulent misrepresentation, or it makes it possible for the recipients of its degrees to perpetrate a fraud on the public.\" [U.S. Office of Education. Pollution in Higher Education: Efforts of the U.S. Department of Education in Relation to Degree Mills. 3/74.] NCAHF uses parallel criterion to label as \"certification mills\" those organizations that sell certifications which declare recipients to be \"nutritionists\" or \"nutritional consultants\" without requiring them to meet established educational standards. People who obtain spurious credentials do so for the purpose of misrepresenting themselves as qualified experts. They may use such credentials to go into the nutrition counseling business, or to obtain employment in health or nutrition agencies. Sometimes well-meaning people inadvertently patronize these mills because out of a mistaken idea that the purveyor is a legitimate off-campus study program. The main clue that should serve as a tip-off is that the course of study is relatively easy. Beware of schools that are only \"authorized\" or \"approved,\" but not accredited. Accreditation itself may also be open to question. NCAHF has found a number of \"accreditation mills\" \u2014 organizations that sell bogus accreditation to degree mills! One way to check the validity of a program is to check with the registrar of a state college or university. They have an up-to-date reference book that is used to determine the validity of credits being transferred from other schools by incoming students. The most egregious degree mills are the counterfeiters of legitimate diplomas. These scam artists print phony degrees bearing the names of Harvard, Yale and other prestigious schools. The FBI shut down a number of such operations in a project known as Dipscam in the 1980s. A publication that tracks unusual and bogus sources of degrees is Bear's Guide to Earning College Degrees Non-Traditionally NCAHF advises against obtaining any nutrition degree by correspondence if the intent is to serve as a nutrition counselor. It is not possible to obtain a quality education in this manner that will enable a person to function as a competent nutrition counselor. This is because for many people nutrition advice is tantamount to medical advice with a potential for serious health consequences. At best, correspondence courses can provide basic nutrition knowledge. Sham nutritionists often use hair analysis, muscle-strength testing (\"applied kinesiology\"), iridology, electronic body scanning devices (e.g., Dermatron, VEGA, Interro, Electro Acuscope), computerized dietary questionnaires, herbal crystallization analysis, live cell analysis (blood smear viewed through microscope by video), sublingual tests, and many more, to convince their clients that they need dietary supplements. Some tests resemble legitimate clinical tests, making it difficult for non-experts to discern that they are not appropriate. Sham nutritionists typically prescribe costly dietary supplements, whereas ethical nutritionists emphasize changes in lifestyle (i.e., food selection, preparation, exercise, etc). Sham nutritionists generally either sell supplements directly to their clients or send them to health food stores.

Fasting has a long history as a symbolic demonstration of religious devotion, act of protest, or commitment to a political cause. Various so-called \"natural health\" or \"hygienic\" practitioners advocate fasting to \"cleanse the body\" or as a cure-all.

Fasting involves voluntary total food deprivation (water only or distilled water only), juice-fasting which permits fruit juices or distilled water and lemon juice.

Other Shelton disciples include: - Judy Mazel, author of The Beverly Hills Diet (1981), said to be \"ludicrous\" and \"full of misinformation so strange that it would be funny, except that so many people seem to believe it.\" - Firewalk guru Tony Robbins, author of Unlimited Power which also taught nutrition nonsense (See NCAHF Newsletter, Jan-Feb, 1995). Contrary to the teachings of proponents, fasting doesn't \"cleanse\" or \"rest\" the liver. If anything, fasting overworks the liver by saturating it with toxins produced by fasting itself [2]. Fasting can be dangerous, especially when undertaken or supervised by ideologists who are blind to its actual effects. Shelton's fasting regime was responsible for several deaths. A 49-yr-old man died of bronchial pneumonia that resulted from a 30-day distilled water diet sponsored by \"Dr. Shelton's Health School\" in Texas (said to be sixth such death in five years while undergoing treatment at the school) [3] Proponents of fasting often evoke the dangerous \"healing crisis\" theory of naturopathy alleging that adverse symptoms experienced by the faster are \"poisons being expelled by the body.\" The misguided theory that adverse symptoms should be expected and welcomed as the body's \"re-tracing\" is explained by Stanley Bass, ND, DC, PhC (Philosopher of Chiropractic): The toxins being discarded are saving you from more serious disease which will result if you keep them in your body too much longer-possibly hepatitis, kidney disorders, blood disease, heart disease, arthritis, nerve degenerations or even cancer-depending upon your hereditary or structural weaknesses. Be happy you're paying your bills now in an easy payment plan. With some, colds which haven't appeared for a long time may occur, or even fevers. THIS IS NATURE'S WAY OF HOUSECLEANING. DON'T\u2014but DON'T try to stop these symptoms ...These symptoms are part of a curing process, and don't try to cure a cure. Those who have lived worse lives and poisoned themselves more will experience more severe symptoms. Headaches may occur at the beginning; fever and/or colds may appear; the skin may break out; there may be a short interval of bowel sluggishness, occasional diarrhea, feelings of tiredness and weakness, disinclination to exercise, nervousness, irritability, negativity or mental depression, frequent urination, etc. REALIZE DEEPLY that your body is becoming younger and healthier every day because you are throwing off more and more wastes which would eventually have brought pain, disease and suffering. Those who have the worst symptoms . . . and follow through to their successful termination are thus avoiding some of the worst diseases which would eventually have developed had they continued their careless eating habits. The notion that adverse symptoms should be disregarded, or even rejoiced about, caused Bivian Lee to ignore serious symptoms of cardiac myopathy that developed during a very-low-calorie Herbalife diet program. When Lee blacked out, his wife discovered his condition and made an appointment for him to see a physician. Sadly, Lee died in front of his 4-year-old daughter before the appointment could be kept [4]. Physical Effects of Fasting Except for the brain, which consumes more calories than any other organ and has a constant need for glucose whether one is asleep or awake, one's metabolic rate varies with physical activity and by day and nightime effects. The body's ongoing need for nutrition is met by stores in the cells and liver, circulating blood, and gastrointestinal contents. Fasting causes blood sugar to drop. This leads to a breakdown (catabolism) of muscle and other protein tissue for energy. During fasting, catabolism is a kind of \"self-cannibalism\" the by-products of which (ammonia and urea) lead to acidosis that produces weakness, fatigue, irritability, depression, depressed libido, and a sick feeling. Fasting does not cleanse the system, but loads it with metabolic toxins while decreasing its ability to destroy and excrete these. Fasting leads to rapid loss of water, sodium, and potassium. This decreases blood volume which produces postural hypotension (low blood pressure when standing up), and fainting. Severe potassium depletion can cause a fatal heart rhythm disturbance. The body cannot differentiate between voluntary fasting and starvation and deaths have occurred even with medically supervised fasts and near-fasts. People who survive prolonged fasts (starvation) may suffer anemia, decreased immunity, osteoporosis, kidney damage, or liver damage. Depressed gastrointestinal or digestive functions may persist for weeks or months [v]. The worst thing about fasting is its destruction of lean and vital tissue needed for a healthy and active life. Fasting, like colonic irrigation, laxatives, sweat baths, and other naturopathic regimes are at best useless, and at worst, can be fatal. Fasting is particularly dangerous for children. Case. A 3.5 yr-old girl died of malnutrition and pneumonia following a 27-day water fast [6]. Her parents were disciples of a naturopath, Kenneth Jaffrey, who believed that fasting was beneficial. The couple placed the little girl on a diet of distilled water for 27 days to clean her body of toxins that they believed had built up through expose to orthodox medicine. The girl's father was described as \"intolerant of medical practitioners\" and \"arrogant in view of life.\" At death, the child was half of her expected weight [7]. Case. A 9-year-old girl died in Ottawa, Canada after being on a water-only diet for 40-days. Mellissa Larochelle was treated at home in the northern Ontario town of Hearst with the diet which, according to provincial police \"apparently has some religious overtones to it. It's somehow connected to the 40 days and nights Jesus fasted and its supposed to purge your system,\" they said. Mellissa was seized by the Children's Aid Society and hospitalized in Ottawa but died on March 16, 1990. The girl's grandmother, Rollande Turgeon, 55, was sentenced to 6 months in jail on January 18, 1991 after pleading guilty to negligence causing bodily harm. Turgeon had taken courses and was accredited by the American Hygiene Association. She operated a so-called fasting clinic at her house. Turgeon was treating Mellissa for an ear infection. In passing sentence the judge said that Turgeon had made a grave error in judgment by not contacting doctors sooner. He stated that \"she was blinded by the principles of fasting and didn't believe in medical intervention.\" [8] Psychology of Fasting The psychology of fasting is consistent with asceticism (self-denial). Ascetics find pleasure in pain. This reversal of perception is rooted in a negative self-concept. Ascetics feel badly when good things happen to them because they do not feel worthy. They feel good when they are deprived of what gives normal people pleasure because they are getting what they feel they deserve. Puritans were ascetics. They are remembered for the concept that \"if it feels good, don't touch it,\" \"if it tastes good, don't eat it,\" and \"if it looks good, cover your eyes!\" Ascetics love to give up things. When they are sick they often think, \"If I give up something more, I will be better.\" Fasting and austere diets that amount to near-fasting have appeal to ascetics for whom sacrifice has become the route to health and eternal salvation. Little wonder that many religious zealots demonstrate their extreme devotion by fasting. The importance of psychological factors in the desire to fast can be seen in case reports. Case. A 36-yr-old male adherent to the Temple Beautiful diet died of malnutrition attempting to become a holy man who could live on air alone. Five years earlier, David Blume had been pursuing an idyllic career as an English teacher at Nathaniel Hawthorne college in New England. His students loved him. He was a tall, handsome man with clear, bright eyes and a gift for sharing ideas. Blume lost his teaching job because of budget cuts, and was unable to secure satisfactory employment. During his period of vulnerability, he meet Steven Haasz, founder and leader of Temple Beautiful. Haasz was a disciple of Ann Wigmore, originator of the wheatgrass fad. Blume chose the most rigorous of the group's dietary options and began subsisting almost entirely on raw wheatgrass juice. His aim was to become a \"breatharian\"\u2014a holy man who could live on air alone. On October 6, 1979, Blume's lifeless body was found on the floor of his shabby Philadelphia apartment. He was 6 feet tall and weighed 87 lbs [9]. Case. Several \"patients\" of Arthur Andrews, operator of the California Health Sanctuary at Hollister, CA, died following prolonged fasting. The California medical licensing board brought charges against Andrews for practicing medicine without a license because the purpose of the fasting had been to heal medical conditions. The defense argued that Andrews' regime was intended to \"heal the soul,\" which was a religious matter. Andrews was fined $1,000 for the unlawful practice of medicine, but was allowed to continue operating as a religious retreat as long as he did not practice medicine [10]. NCAHF strongly advises against the use of prolonged fasting for health purposes, and believes that requiring children to fast is a form of child abuse.

LeBlanc, in talking with a reporter a decade after the B-vitamin tonic boom had collapsed. \"Who is to say that those people weren't helped for those ailments? The doctors? Who can believe them? No, my friend, there's still much that's not known about nutrition.\" [2] About one thing, at least, LeBlanc was right. Nutrition, as a science, was as yet incomplete. Because of what was not yet known and the complexity of what was known, nutrition, during the 20th century, has provided a happy hunting ground for those who would beguile the American public into buying their questionable wares. \"In 1900,\" one of the nutrition pioneers has written, \"we were almost blind to the relations of food to health.\" Six years later, the year the first Pure Food and Drugs Act became law, a research scientist spoke of protein, carbohydrates, and fats as \"still the nutritional trinity.\" In that same year, however, a number of significant papers were published proving the trinity by no means adequate. Other food factors, as yet not clearly recognized, must be included in the diet if good health was to be maintained. A growing wave of research by food chemists confirmed this view, and a decade later pathologists, hitherto preoccupied with the aftermath of the germ theory, joined forces with the chemists in nutritional research. In 1911. a Polish chemist, Casimir Funk, working at the Lister Institute in London, coined the word \"vitamine\" for these needed food factors. The next year Funk published a paper suggesting the theory that various diseases\u2014beriberi, scurvy, pellagra, rickets\u2014resulted from the lack of vitamins in the diet. Empirical observations in the past had pointed in this direction. Now controlled research began to establish such surmises as demonstrated fact. At the University of Wisconsin in 1913 Elmer McCollum identified the need in animal diets for a fat-soluble nutrient which, adopting Funk's nomenclature, he christened Vitamin A. By 1926 two components in vitamin B, as well as vitamins C, D, and E, had also been found as necessary to health. During the 1930's, while Congress struggled to enact a stronger food and drug law, scientists in their laboratories identified the chemical structures of the vitamins and, in some cases, created them by synthesis. Nor were vitamins the only indispensable nutrients. Research confirmed or discovered the need for amino acids and minerals, even though in the most minute amounts. Successive scientific studies revealed the ever greater complexity of nutrition. Nonetheless, in McCollum's view, 1940 marked a plateau, the successful achievement of the primary goals of nutritional science, to discover what chemical substances were required for an adequate diet in domestic animals and man. More than 40 such nutrients had, by then, been proved necessary [3]. Since the days of the pyramids, food and health had been inextricably intertwined in folklore, and food faddism ran rampant in 19th-century America. Relics of ancient myths, indeed, still cherished in the popular mind, made the task of 20th-century nutritional proprietors much easier. Commercial exploitation of food folklore began at least as early as the origin of the packaged cereal industry. Religion, health, and business enterprise converged in Battle Creek. Corn Flakes began as Elijah's Manna, and one of the early therapeutic uses suggested for Grape Nuts was as a preventive for appendicitis [4]. Popular interest in the nascent nutritional revolution, coupled with popular concern about food shortages during World War I, opened the way for an upsurge of food promotion with health overtones. Since advertising techniques had just reached the stage to make the most of such an opportunity, Americans, during the prosperity decade, were constantly besought to buy physical well-being and to banish ailments by eating cheese, bread, and cereals, by imbibing milk and carbonated drinks. Yeast and chocolate bars vaunted their vitamin content. Vitamin pills, like Mastin's Vitamon Tablets\u2014\"Give You That Firm Flesh Pep\"\u2014received a big play. And cod liver oil, long a staple in the proprietary field, enjoyed a new vogue with the discovery that it was a source of vitamin D. So-called extracts of this oil were promoted with claims that the vitamin value was retained while the fishy taste was banished [5]. The Food and Drug Administration discovered otherwise. Beginning to assay these products in 1926, the agency found therapeutic claims exaggerated and vitamin content low or missing. Combining persuasion with legal action, the FDA succeeded in eliminating from the labeling of many \"extracts\" any reference to cod liver oil. Moreover, the whole broad front of \"health foods\" increasingly troubled the agency. In 1929, through a press release, Walter Campbell issued a warning to the American people. \"The use of the word ['health'],\" Campbell said, \"implies that these products have health-giving or curative properties, when, in general, they merely possess some of the nutritive qualities to be expected in any wholesome food product. The label claims on these products are such that the consumer is led to believe that our ordinary diet is sorely deficient in such vital substances as vitamins and minerals, and that these so-called 'health foods' are absolutely necessary to conserve life and health.\" Such misrepresentation, Campbell promised, the FDA would \"combat.\" [6] The next year Campbell's aide, Paul Dunbar, speaking before trade associations of canners and wholesale grocers, scolded the sinners in their ranks. Nutrition news, he said, had \"appealed immensely to the popular fancy. . . . In its ignorance of the present limitations of scientific knowledge it has been disposed to accept without reservation the most extreme, and in some cases ridiculous claims for the wholesomeness and health-giving qualities of various products. Unfortunately, a certain element of the advertising profession proceeds upon the theory that a market may be obtained for almost any product if its imaginary virtues are exploited in impressive scientific terms, and unfortunately this theory appears to be correct. A glowing statement to the effect that Jones' carrot bread or Smith's turnip breakfast food contains all the known vitamins, will restore the elasticity of youth to the bones and muscles of the aged, and will ward off all known diseases is likely to be seized upon with avidity, especially by those who are in need of the very rejuvenating effects they are promised by the enthusiastic advertiser. The magic words 'health giving' are today the most overworked and loosely applied in the advertising lexicon.\" [7] \"Do you want the consuming public to get the idea,\" Dunbar asked the processors, \"that they should turn to this particular delicacy only when in unsound physical condition? Don't you want your product to appeal to the well rather than to the invalid class?\" The Food and Drug Administration began taking actions in a modest way against unwarranted nutritional claims. Breakfast food factories across the country were inspected for labels of doubtful propriety. A small unit was created, which in 1935 became the Division of Vitamins, to study the some 400 products\u2014foods and drugs\u2014being promoted with general or specific claims of vitamin efficiency. In Chicago, 23,365 packages of Congoin were seized\u2014the product was the \"tea.\" \"Absolutely alone,\" Congoin's advertising had promised, \"it will support life for weeks on end.\" Cases were won against a new and growing type of racket, the multi-vitamin cure-all. The product might be, like Catalyn, milk sugar, wheat starch and bran, and epinephrine, but its label boasted falsely\u2014potency in all vitamins from A through G, and promised to cure high and low blood pressure, Bright's disease, dropsy, and goiter [8]. If FDA activity might induce caution in the multi-vitamin promoter, other trends in the 1930's spurred him on. While scientists insisted that all needed nutrients could be secured through a varied and well-balanced diet, careful surveys of depression America revealed that one-third of the nation's families consumed a diet that had to be regarded as poor [9]. Widespread publicity given to such surveys worried even the well fed, and the grimmest quotations torn from the context of such scientific reports appeared promptly\u2014and remained for years\u2014in the pamphlets penned by purveyors of nutrition nonsense. As the second World War loomed, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council appointed a Food and Nutrition Board to develop a table of \"Recommended Daily Allowances for Specific Nutrients.\" In 1941 the first list was issued, indicating the number of calories and the quantities of nine nutrients needed for good nutrition by most persons with higher than average requirements. The Board recognized that people sick or suffering from malnutrition might need more. They acknowledged that 11 other nutrients were essential for health, but, because of inadequate data or because deficiencies were not likely to occur, desirable quantities of these could not be specified. The Board recommended, in view of diet inadequacies discovered in the surveys, that some foods be \"enriched\" with vitamins that had by then been synthesized by chemists. This concept was not entirely new. Iodine had been added to salt as early as 1924 to help prevent the development of goiter. Vitamin D had later been added to milk and vitamin A to margarine. The Food and Nutrition Board proposed enriching bread and other grain products with several vitamins and iron. So as the war came, with the hazard of new food shortages, the staple diet of Americans was more adequate in nutrients than it had ever been before [10]. By this time too, the Food and Drug Administration had been given by Congress new and more effective authority over health food claims. The 1938 law declared as misbranded a food promoted for \"special dietary purposes\" which failed to label information about \"its vitamin, mineral, and other dietary properties\" which the FDA deemed \"necessary in order fully to inform purchasers as to its value for such uses.\" Under this provision the agency set forth not \"recommended\" but \"minimum daily requirements\" of the key known nutrients and required manufacturers to label their products in terms of these requirements [11]. Under the law, too, a \"food\" was also a \"drug\" if therapeutic claims were made for it, and the FDA's burden of proving a drug misbranded was less demanding than under the earlier law. Thus new weapons lay at hand to combat inflated nutritional claims. Fortunate this was, for the battle threatened to loom large indeed. Many factors favored the nutritional promoter. The war ears did bring a drab diet to civilians, as well as an increase in emotional strain. To treat ailments, real or imaginary, physicians in private practice were in short supply. As a consequence, self-diagnosis and self-treatment expanded. Wartime and postwar prosperity made it easier for the common citizen to pay the high prices charged by nutritional salesmen for their wares. The continuing concern by reputable nutritionists to safeguard and improve the American diet aided the disreputable, who asserted that their supplements would do just that. After the war, better eating habits plus the \"enrichment\" program improved the nation's nutritional level. The millennium, however, was not yet reached. Postwar surveys continued to show inadequacies. A comprehensive study in 1955, for example, revealed that about one-tenth of America's families consumed a diet that was nutritionally poor, and nearly half the families fell below the Food and Nutrition Board's recommended level with respect to one or more essential nutrient [12]. The proper solution, nutritional experts stated, lay in wiser food selection. not in expensive commercial supplements. But those with vitamins to sell made the most of the surveys. Even large manufacturing concerns of great prestige, medical scientists asserted, oversold the value of their vitamins [13]. Promoters less scrupulous sought to frighten the nation into the conviction that America faced widespread starvation. The initial successes of the FDA, employing the weapons of the 1938 law, in circumscribing patent medicine quackery tended to push fringe promoters toward the greener pastures of nutrition. Vaguer claims seemed legally safer. Vitamins and minerals were seldom sold blatantly as cancer or diabetes cures. The supplements and tonics, rather, promised to \"increase vigor\" or \"prevent wearing out\" because of nutritional deficiency. Often such promises were accompanied by \"adroit references to disturbances of the digestive, circulatory, and nervous systems.\" In all this carefully worded doctrine, the would-be customer might well read or hear the idea of \"cure.\" But because of the sly phrasing, and the complicated nature of nutritional science, the Food and Drug Administration faced a formidable regulatory task [14]. Policing the claims of nutritional promoters became a heavy burden for the FDA also because increasingly salesmen in the realm of food faddism relied on oral speech. This reduced the risk of detection. It also put the pitchman in direct contact with his potential customer. Thus was revived the face-to-face persuasiveness of the old-time patent medicine barker. The Nutrilite network of door-to-door salesmen proved to be a prototype for other similar ventures, like Abundavita and Nutri-Bio. Nutrilite officers, under the terms of the 1951 injunction, promised not only to limit their claims drastically but also to inform their salesmen what they could and could not say about this vitamin-mineral-alfalfa-parsley-watercress mix. In the privacy of residential living rooms, FDA inspectors, posing as customers, sometimes discovered that salesmen failed to exercise the agreed-upon restraint. But legal action against isolated vendors did not hamper Nutrilite's growth. Five years after the injunction, when the Federal Trade Commission looked into Nutrilite's sales practices, the force had expanded by a third and totaled 20,000 doorbell-ringing women and men. Sales in 1956 amounted to $26,000,000 [15]. Another forum for nutritional pitchmen who possessed hortatorical skill was the lecture platform. Gayelord Hauser, a suave and talented performer, revived in the 1930's the ancient art of the popular health lecture course. Heralded by advertising, the course began with a free lecture or so, continued for a fee. Hauser, a man on cordial terms with American movie stars and English nobility, lauded five \"wonder\" foods-skim milk, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, yogurt, and blackstrap molasses-and touted his own writings on nutrition. His appeal was amazing. When Look Younger, Live Longer was published in 1950, the book stayed on best seller lists for over a year and during that time sold a third of a million copies [16]. Of the two score and more lecturers who entered upon the nutritional lyceum circuit, not all were as smooth and polished as Gayelord Hauser. One of the rougher breed was Adolphus Hohensee. In 1943 the Better Business Bureau of St. Louis sent a telegraphed inquiry to the American Medical Association: Who was Hohensee? The AMA did not yet know. As the months passed, the AMA took increasing interest in this recruit to the ranks of nutrition spielers. So did the FDA [17]. Hohensee, diligent inquiry revealed, had set forth from Chevy Chase, near Washington, shortly before, promoting his line of Vita Health Foods. Nothing in his background seemed to qualify him as a nutrition expert. To be sure, be had been born in Poland, the same country as Casimir Funk. But Hohensee had had no formal training in vitamin research. He had come to America early in the century as a young boy. So far as the FDA could learn, Hohensee's schooling ended in 1918 with a single semester of high school level work, taken at the Washington Missionary College in Takoma Park. For this he received four hours of credit. Hohensee worked for a time as a soda jerk. His whereabouts during the 1920's could not be discovered. In 1933 Hohensee operated a real estate scheme in Galveston. He collected fees from owners who wished to sell their property, but be expended little effort at making sales. Charged with mail fraud, Hohensee pleaded guilty, spent a month in jail, with five years of probation to follow. He returned to Washington and entered the sightseeing tour business with his wife's car. Within three years he had acquired 140 cabs and some gas stations. During these years Hohensee's life was rugged. He was arrested for various misdemeanors, including the passing of bad checks. Four charges of assault were brought against him, but none was prosecuted. In the early 1940's, for reasons of his own, Hohensee shifted from transportation to nutrition. Soon after launching his travels as lecturer, he also shifted his home base, moving from the Washington suburbs to a farm near Scranton, which he named El Rancho Adolphus [18]. Hohensee was 42 in 1943, a tall, broad-shouldered man, stocky and robust, weighing over 200 pounds. His neck was thick, his face fat, his head round and balding. He sported a small black mustache which he kept waxed and pointed. His eyes were dark and piercing. Hohensee's physical stamina seemed never to wane. He could lecture night after night for two to three hours without tiring. His sharp, loud, and commanding voice, a voice devoid of jollity but skilled at expressing sarcasm and scorn, never weakened during his lectures. It was a powerful and flexible instrument, ranging from \"whispering confidentiality to shouting hate\" through all the variations in between. Hohensee dressed with some elegance, although his strenuous antics during an evening of lecturing often left him rumpled [19]. Billing himself as an M.D. in his early forays, Hohensee quickly met challenge. So he sought to acquire whatever kinds of health degrees he could. He secured in 1943 an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Medicine from the Kansas City University of Physicians and Surgeons, an institution that had been listed as unaccredited by the AMA for 15 years and that was closed in 1944 by the Missouri State Board of Medical Examiners. Hohensee added Doctor of Naturopathy degrees, without attendance, from schools in Oklahoma and Indiana. And in 1946 he passed an examination and was granted a chiropractic license by the state of Nevada, neglecting to say, as the law required, that he had once been convicted of a federal offense [20]. Hohensee's stock in trade, during his early days as lecturer, consisted of a wide variety of nutritional products which he had ordered packaged as the Adolphus Brand, bearing labels of his own design. Included were peppermint, soybean lecithin, B-complex vitamins, wheat germ oil, mineral capsules, calcium tablets, an herb laxative even a tar shampoo. And Hohensee's own private inquiry into the literature of nutrition had resulted in numerous pamphlets, especially The Health, Success and Happiness series, which included such individual titles as The Normal Ration; High Blood Pressure; Arthritis and Rheumatism; Better Eyes without Glasses; and Your Personality Glands [21]. Adroitly turning his lecture audiences into customers for both products and pamphlets, Hohensee had scarcely begun his career before he encountered opposition. In November 1943 in Seattle, charged with selling drugs without a license, he pleaded guilty and paid a $50 fine. The next month Hohensee faced the same charge in Tacoma and fought the case before a jury, handling his own defense. He was convicted, and the verdict stood up upon appeal. Wrote a spokesman for the Tacoma Better Business Bureau, \"We feel this man, although lacking formal education, is a shrewd, capable adversary, thoroughly unscrupulous and dangerous.\" [22] The next spring Hohensee lost two cases in San Francisco, paying a $300 fine for posing as a medical doctor and another $200 for selling drugs without a license. By this time his protracted conflict with the Food and Drug Administration had begun. just before Christmas in 1943, Hohensee had shipped an enormous quantity of remedies and reading matter from Seattle to Los Angeles. The FDA seized both, charging the former misbranded by the latter under both food and drug provisions of the law. Hohensee did not come by to claim his property, and the court condemned calcium, peppermint, pamphlets, and all to destruction. The next year Hohensee let another large seizure, shipped from Arizona to California, go by default [23]. It was costly to lose his wares in this way, but not a major deterrent. The sales Hohensee made during a series of lectures in a single city, the FDA estimated, might gross 40 to 50 thousand dollars, and a mighty high proportion of the gross was net. At this rate he could well afford to sacrifice a good many seizures. Since the seizures did not keep Hohensee away from his new and profitable mode of life, the FDA began criminal action. \"I am going to keep on with this thing,\" the lecturer had told some Food and Drug officials, \"until they get me behind bars.\" [24] But Hohensee insisted his procedures did not violate the law. Following the early seizures, he told FDA officials at a hearing while the criminal case was being prepared, he had paid out big money to get all his labels changed. An expert in the field had given his OK. The processors who sold him his products provided the proper guaranty that label claims met the requirements of the law. As to the pamphlets, they were not part of the label \"in any way, shape or form.\" [25] \"These are separate booklets that I have written,\" Hohensee said, \"books that are being sold, not given away. . . . In checking the book nowhere do we refer to Adolphus Brand products. That booklet has nothing to do with the merchandise.\" \"When you sell these booklets,\" Hohensee was asked, \"do you refer to any of your products?\" \"I do not.\" \"When you sell these products do you refer to any of these booklets?\" \"Not that I remember.\" For the trial, Food and Drug inspectors found a witness who did remember. Charles Russ had attended every lecture in one of Hohensee's Phoenix series. Hohensee, Russ said, would hold a package of health food in his hand while describing all the wonderful things it would do. Both products and pamphlets were placed on tables at the back of the hall, where they were sold, sometimes in combination offers, a bottle free if a bottle and book were bought together. Russ in fact had purchased everything, he said, acquiring so many Hohensee remedies it took three shelves to hold them. He had arranged them in order, so he could take several handfuls of pills in a single session of therapy [26]. The government used Russ' recollections to good effect, during the trial at Phoenix in February 1948, to demonstrate that Hohensee's pamphlet references to vitamins and minerals, even though they did not mention the Adolphus Brand, were labeling nonetheless. A number of medical experts testified to the absurdity of Holiensee's nutritional doctrines. Despite tribute to Hohensee from several satisfied customers, the jury, whose foreman was a local merchant named Barry Goldwater, found Hohensee guilty of misbranding [27]. Hohensee's sentence did not put him behind bars: he was fined $1,800. In conformity with his earlier promise, he continued on his lucrative nutritional \"crusade.\" But once more\u2014as in his earlier modifications in his labeling\u2014be changed his tactics. No longer did Hohensee sell his various vitamins and minerals in the halls where he was lecturing. Instead, he arranged for these wares to be stocked in health food stores in the cities where he delivered his speeches. This posed no problem, for the upsurge of nutritional promotion by fringe operators brought with it a great proliferation of health food stores. Selling an incredible assortment of so-called natural foods and vitamin-mineral mixtures, these stores served as rallying points for the growing body of believers in the new nutritional gospel propagated by prophets like Hohensee, a gospel that condemned the normal American food supply and made purchase of special supplements necessary for physical and mental salvation. Those who operated the stores supported the itinerant lecturers, advertising their coming, providing mailing lists for personal invitations to lecture series, and selling their panaceas and books of doctrine [28]. If Hohensee stopped vending his vitamins in person, he nonetheless kept on collecting money at his lectures. Sale of his booklets brought in a steady flow of cash. The matriculation fees for his paid series of lectures\u2014$25 a person, or $35 for man and wife\u2014brought in more. At each free lecture preceding the paid series, Hohensee took up a free will offering to pay rent on his auditorium. He added a series of gadgets for use in preparing food\u2014without which the nutrient qualities were lost: a tenderizer, a blender, a Lucite set of kitchen implements. Prices were high: the tenderizer sold for $195. El Rancho Adolphus, in its owner's glowing words, became a veritable Eden of pristine health. Paying visitors were welcome; lots were for sale. When litigation threatened, Hohensee begued, in his speeches and in the magazine he mailed (for a fee) to the faithful, for contributions to a fund for his defense. Thus life was lucrative for the ex-taxi driver\u2014even aside from his profits on nutritional wares sold by the health food stores [29]. Master showman that he was, Hohensee's success came in part from the preconditioning of most members of his audiences to his type of nutritional gospel. Already converts to food faddism, they had heard earlier speakers condemn the American food supply and would attend similar speeches by other lecturers after Hohensee had moved on. Women outnumbered men in Hohensee's audiences, many of them single or widowed or married but childless. Elderly. couples living on pensions were well represented. Although some young couples came, the age level of the main group of listeners ranged from the late 40's to the early 60's. The general educational background, Food and Drug inspectors judged, was modest, not above the high school level. Those who listened to Hohensee had some money to spend but were not rich. Among the men, some were skilled workers\u2014carpenters, masons, machinists. A good many of Hohensee's hearers came, perhaps, to alleviate boredom. Few appeared to be very sick, although many certainly thought they were, afflicted with the aches and pains and glooms of aging. As they sat waiting for Hohensee to begin his lecture, they complained to each other about their state of health and swapped symptoms [30]. Knowing his listeners' fears and foibles, Hohensee kept them shelling out money\u2014throughout each evening's stint of lecturing. His talks were rambling and unstructured, but he was alert to mood and adept at changing his theme or style to keep things lively. His bag of tricks was fully packed. His rapport was excellent. Hohensee called the women \"girls\" and \"sweethearts,\" got them to asking questions and to testifying to the good they had received from the suggestions he had made on earlier evenings. He often interrupted his monologue to ask questions of his audience, easy questions to which they knew the answers. He mixed humor, most of it corny, with narrative episodes possessing a touch of drama, some of them autobiographical and intended to reflect his own fame. He uttered homilies on human relations and offered a lot of homespun psychology, urging his auditors to perk up, forget their troubles, wax enthusiastic, feel better. Hohensee quoted the Bible frequently, referred often to God's purposes for mankind, which, as to dietary matters, coincided exactly with Hohensee's own. He told suggestive stories (but not too naughty), teased his listeners about their sexual shortcomings, and promised better things\u2014'The sex act itself should last for one hour\"\u2014for those who used his wares. He spoke awesomely of his own nutritional experimentation, throwing in jawbreaking scientific words as if be lived with them on very intimate terms. He cited the work of other researchers, picking quotations that suited his purposes from papers by reputable scholars and from government reports. He got what acclaim he could by identifying with other and better known spokesmen for the nutritional fringe, showing his classes, for example, a picture of himself with Bernarr Macfadden [31]. Hohensee frightened his listeners with frequent references to their proximity to \"the Marble Orchard,\" with vivid descriptions of the horrors of disease, with distorted excursions into anatomy purporting to demonstrate bow the normal diet stagnated the blood, corroded the blood vessels, eroded the kidneys, and clogged the intestines with a putrefying mess. Yet he also reassured them: follow his doctrines and use his products and they would live to be 180 and go with him on man's first journey to the moon. Hohensee paraded himself as a noble man abused by powerful enemies, a gigantic Medical Trust, headed by \"the American Murderers Association\" and including the drug trade, dominated by the Rockefellers, the Better Business Bureau, and the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA's hatchet men, he said, pursued him and infiltrated his audiences like spies. In between his diatribes and homilies, Hohensee told his audience simple concrete things to do, explaining precisely why and how these would benefit their health. Hot and cold baths for the hands and feet, for example, would stir up the stagnant blood. Many of Hohensee's fasting regimens, of course, involved Adolphus products for sale at the local health store. Recipes must be cooked in his tenderizer or pulverized in his blender or got together with the aid of his Lucite knife. However dramatic the Hohensee anecdote, however passionate the tirade, a sales pitch of some kind was not far off. As to the Food and Drug interlopers, Hohensee was right. The $1,800 fine had not deterred him. The agency began to gather evidence for another case. Agents, incognito, began to attend his lectures, even began to take down his words verbatim with wire recorders. In Phoenix once again, during February and March of 1952, an inspector sat through Hohensee's four free and 14 paid lectures, taking copious notes. The first night Hohensee started in an angry mood. The Phoenix papers and a radio station had refused his advertising, for which the Drug Trust and the BBB were certainly to blame. Then Hohensee shifted his attack to the dangers of foods and medicines in widespread use. Packages of some of these products rested on the table beside him. As he named them\u2014Bisquick, Shredded Wheat, Alka-Seltzer, Hadacol\u2014Hohensee picked them up and tossed them behind him to the floor. He paused, surveying the remaining packages carefully, then looked accusingly at the women sitting in the front row. Who, he asked, had taken his bottle of Lydia Pinkham's? He wanted it back so he could throw it away. Next Hohensee tore open a loaf of bakery bread, pulled out the center and wadded it into a ball, bouncing it on the floor. The bread, he said, had been made from devitamized and demineralized flour. Then be took the intestines from his anatomical manikin named Fanny, held them aloft beside the ball of bread, and asked how a ball like that could ever make it through. For the benefit of any Food and Drug stooges present, Hohensee declared, he wanted it clearly understood that he was not selling or recommending any product in his lectures. His only goal was to teach a way of preparing and cooking food, to describe a proper diet for eliminating all our aches and pains. Those who resorted to such a diet could rebuild all the organs of the body (except the kidneys), dissolve the incrustations in the brain that prevented adequate thinking, and dissolve incrustations between the laminations of the eyeball which impaired sight and made glasses necessary. God must have known that man would abuse his eyes, Hohensee said, since he placed the ears and nose so conveniently for hanging glasses. The American diet was sadly deficient in vitamins and minerals, Hohensee told his listeners, and he picked up and read from a government publication to clinch the point. Yet FDA Commissioner Crawford had recently written in a magazine article that Americans were better fed than ever before. Crawford, said Hohensee, was a short and sickly man, constantly puffing on a cigarette. At this point the lecturer sold subscriptions to his magazine, The Life Span. Women at the menopause, said Hohensee, often went to their doctors and got shots. The estrogen in these shots was nothing more or less than horse urine. He had refused to sell urine from El Rancho Adolphus horses to the Drug Trust, which made vaccinations and inoculations from the pus of sick horses. Such injections caused both polio and cancer. Scrutinizing the faces of his audience at a later lecture, Hohensee told them that 90 per cent of them had worms. Worms were a major menace. They might be from two to 20 feet long, some with their heads in your stomach and the rest of their bodies in your intestines. His cleansing diet would remove them. This diet was also a preliminary to removing gallstones. Hohensee's gallstone remedy\u2014the resurrection of an old-time patent medicine trick\u2014helped persuade his listeners to willing acceptance of all the rest of his health counsel. He prescribed his laxative and told listeners to follow it up with olive oil. The oil released fluids in the bile duct which formed soapy concretions in the stool. Nobody could miss them. At a later lecture, Hohensee had members of his class testify as to the results. One woman proudly announced that she had counted 120 stones. \"Oh, that is wonderful,\" said Hohensee. \"I was very happy to know one of my students will stand up in a class like this and tell them I have eliminated 120 gallstones. Am I right, students?\" There was loud applause. \"And then you wonder why I come here without fear of the Medical Trust or their rotten bunch of racketeers, the Better Business Bureau?\" The applause continued. Hohensee's basic pattern of fear and hope conformed to, as it helped create, a major nutritional myth. Other lecturers, door-to-door salesmen, writers, TV pitchmen, health food store proprietors, shared in its construction and propagation. Thousands of Americans came to believe in it implicitly, so that they bet their dollars, staked their health, upon its doctrines. They could be roused to fierce antagonism against any scientist, businessman, or government regulator who questioned the myth's basic tenets. One of the cardinal principles of this myth held that most disease resulted from improper diet. This was, of course, untrue. A few dietary deficiency diseases did exist, but even these had been largely vanquished in America by the nutritional revolution. It was easy, in America, to buy and eat an adequate diet. The nation's citizens, indeed, would have to go out of their way to avoid being properly nourished. Where deficiencies might exist, the proper solution lay not in spending money for expensive food supplements vended by the ill informed, but in eating better. Only a physician could detect deficiencies, in any case, and only he possessed the knowledge to prescribe therapeutic vitamins and other nutrients if needed. Yet the prophets to the faddists, with goods to sell, persevered in blaming all ills on the American food supply [32]. A subsidiary principle in the faddist's mighty myth blamed soil depletion for the alleged well-nigh universal malnutrition. The land on which food was grown had lost its zip, been drained of the minerals and vitamins which once it held. \"Laboratory tests prove,\" Hohensee wrote in one of his pamphlets, \"that the fruits, the vegetables, the grains, the eggs, even the milk and the meats of today are not what they were a few generations ago. . . . No man of today can eat enough fruits and vegetables to supply his system with the mineral salts he requires for perfect health, because his stomach isn't big enough to hold them!\" [33] This doctrine too was false. The soil's quality does affect the quantity of the crop grown, but has very little influence on its quality. Unless the necessary elements are present in the soil, crops will not grow. Only with respect to iodine has there been depletion. A third aspect of the myth held chemical fertilizers responsible for poisoning the land and the crops grown on it. Here the purveyors of specious nutrition counsel employed an ancient stunt, taking a legitimate concern and distorting it to suit their purposes. Pesticide residues, inadequately removed, did pose a hazard to health. New and more powerful pesticides came increasingly into use, and legitimate scientists expressed alarm. Congress took up the problem and in 1947 and 1954 passed laws to help the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration exercise more effective Control [34]. The faddists, however, did not relax. Their prophets, like Hohensee, urged the eating of only \"natural\" foods raised by \"organic\" farming, in which only animal fertilizer was used. El Rancho Adolphus apple juice, Hohensee told his classes, came only from non-sprayed apples fertilized by animal manure; all other apple juice, he said, was contaminated with insect poisons which would destroy the kidneys [35]. Artificial fertilizers, according to the myth, besides being poisons, devitalized the soil and thus ruined the nutrients in food, making necessary the purchase of food supplements. Still another facet of the myth, based in part on very old folk beliefs, put great stress on the special dietary value of various \"wonder\" foods. Hauser had his own particular list, and Hohensee too employed this doctrine. One of his favorites was garlic. \"In addition to being good for a specific condition of high blood pressure,\" he wrote, garlic \"also seems to have a profound cleansing effect upon the intestines and, of course, the blood.\" [36] Among other things, it inhibited growth of the tuberculosis germ. To prove garlic's potency in the system, Hohensee advised putting a piece up the rectum at night: by morning its taste would be apparent in the mouth. These claims for garlic were utter nonsense. Some of the other socalled wonder foods might have some value as foods, experts were willing to agree, but they possessed no miraculous properties and were not indispensable in diet. One more aspect of the myth held that cooking utensils made of certain metals poisoned the food prepared in them. Aluminum was the particular bugaboo, a scare doctrine at least half a century old. Hohensee had propagated this theory right from the start. He also denounced the hazards of peeling vegetables with metal knives. Like other fringe operators, be had his own \"safe\" tenderizer and Lucite knives to sell [37]. Processed foods, according to the myth, possessed a double danger. The milling of cereals, the canning of foods, even the pasteurizing of milk, according to the specious nutritionists, destroyed the natural nutrients. At the same time, food processors poured into their products a mounting array of additives, chemicals intended to deter spoilage, improve texture, and perform other like functions, although the real result, the faddists said, was the slow poisoning of the public. Reputable nutritionists assured the nation that most food values survived milling, canning, and freezing, and insisted that the nutritional losses from pasteurizing milk were far outweighed by the gains. The health faddist's penchant for raw fruits and vegetables, the experts said, was certainly extreme. As with pesticides, food additives posed a genuine problem, but one which the nutritional lecturer distorted beyond all reason. Congress acted to ensure that substances added to processed foods be proved safe before being permitted in use, passing a law in 1958 giving the FDA jurisdiction in this field [38]. The public debate leading to the law provided many frightening charges to bolster the scare doctrines of nutritional lecturers. Hohensee constantly condemned \"dead\"\u2014that is, processed\u2014foods and praised the \"live\" foods eaten at El Rancho Adolphus [39]. He had had excellent fortune, he told his classes, curing cancer with chlorophyll. A final major principle in the nutritional myth concerned subclinical deficiencies. This represented a clever borrowing of a recognized medical concept: a given person's diet might not contain an adequate amount of a given nutrient, although the amount lacking was so small or had continued for so short a time that no symptoms of deficiency were yet observable. As translated by the fringe operators, almost everybody might be so threatened, and the imminent dangers to health were catastrophic. Going further, they blamed many of life's day-to-day difficulties, like weariness, tension, a sense of discouragement, on subclinical deficiencies. The hypochondriac especially found conviction in this theory. If a doctor had examined him and discovered nothing wrong, when he himself knew in his bones that there must be, it was reassuring to find out from a food supplement salesman that there was such a thing as vitamin deficiencies which even a physician could not detect. The answer, of course, lay in the insurance of multivitamin mixtures. \"Good cheer and optimism,\" Hohensee asserted, \"are impossible if you are suffering from hidden hunger or an undernourished brain [40]. It must have been with difficulty that Hohensee maintained his own optimism, since regulatory agencies, disbelieving the nutrition myth that underlay his profitable venture, seemed so intent on curbing him. The Federal Trade Commission issued an order forbidding him to continue certain advertising claims. The Food and Drug Administration again hailed him into court. Such Adolphus Brand products as the peppermint, the wheat germ oil, and the herb laxative, the indictment charged, were misbranded, since their labels failed to state the purposes, conditions, and diseases for which they were intended. Intent should be determined, the FDA argued, from the whole host of fantastic claims which Hohensee uttered, night after night, to his classes in Phoenix and Denver. The case came to trial in Scranton in November 1954, but not until after one false start. Although the government had assembled its witnesses, Hohensee appeared without a lawyer and asked for a delay. It was granted. Hohensee then flew out to Denver to finish another class. In his audience appeared a woman who ran a health food store which earlier had been an outlet for Hohensee's products. The government had called her to be a witness in order to prove that Hohensee's wares had moved in interstate commerce. Spotting her, Hohensee publicly proclaimed her to be a rat who had sold him out to the Drug Trust and their hatchet men. \"The time is coming,\" he proclaimed, \"just like it was in Christ's time, when anyone who dares to tell the truth, Satan's forces will always find a double-crosser, a Judas, to sell him, who speaks the truth, to his adversaries. . . . But I'm not complaining. My Saviour was willing to be nailed to the cross to help people. Is that right, class? I'm still going strong.\" Hohensee's good cheer seemed somewhat frazzled [41]. The Scranton jury found Hohensee guilty. Sixteen months later the judge fined him and sentenced him to a year and a day in prison. Another year went by, after a futile appeal, before he began to serve his sentence. In the meantime Hohensee pursued his craft with desperate earnestness, lecturing in many cities around the country [42]. In Houston occurred an episode that may further have dampened his good cheer. Acting on an anonymous tip, reporters and photographers hurried to a restaurant [43]. \"Hohensee sat at a back table,\" wrote Marie Dauplaise of the Houston Press, \"all by himself, polishing off a dinner of forbidden fruits. There was fried red snapper. (He'd told us at the lecture when he bounced the 'death-dealing' skillet on the floor that frying destroys the good qualities of food.) There were thick slices of white French bread. ('It knots in a ball in your stomach, and stays there in a big lump.') He was rinsing this down with huge gulps of beer. (He'd characterized his enemies at his lectures as 'alcohol drinkers,' and bad people were 'barflies.') Apple pie was his final gastronomic delight.\" [44] Thus surprised, Hohensee grabbed his beer bottle and hid it under his chair, covering his telltale plate with a piece of newspaper. Rolling up another section of the paper into a weapon, he started after one of the photographers. But it was too late. The picture was already in the camera. \"'Nature Doc' Dines Out,\" ran the headline atop the picture, \"and Knocks a Decade Off His 180-Year Life Span!\" [45] Perhaps one reason Hohensee permitted his hunger to override his professed principles lay in his skipping of breakfast a day or two before. The lecturer had spent the night in jail, charged with violating Houston's ordinance against itinerant vendors. When the morning meal was brought him, he refused to touch it. \"I won't even drink water,\" he said [46]. The arrest had taken place in the evening soon after Hohensee had begun to instruct his class. When he saw what was happening, he shouted to his students: \"The lecture's over! These men say I'm under arrest! Come down to the station and bail me out.\" His loyal partisans crowded around the detectives, screaming insults. Some 75 followed their leader down to the station house, where they milled around the halls, rebuking the police, and murmuring about a Communist plot. Hohensee played up to them. Turning to reporters present, he shouted, \"How much did the medical trust pay you for this night's work?\" The fierce dedication of Hohensee's supporters was matched by the adherents of other nutritional prophets. Whenever fringe operators went to trial, fans crowded the courtroom. They bombarded Congress, the Food and Drug Administration, and other agencies with bitter cards and letters, condemning the persecution of their heroes, damning an alleged conspiracy against them on the part of the FDA, the AMA, and respectable sectors of the food and drug industries. The angry elements seemed to be merging. \"Major food peddlers of nutritional quackery who have been prosecuted by FDA,\" said Commissioner George Larrick in 1957, '\"have formed a sort of 'FDA Alumni Assn.' and banded together to fight FDA and effective law enforcement.\" The pseudo-nutritionists organized effectively and prompted their followers to campaigns of mass protest [47]. The active antagonism of food faddists was a reaction to increasingly vigorous efforts by the Food and Drug Administration to combat nutritional nonsense. Another major promoter besides Hohensee, V. Earl Irons, who distributed his Vit-Ra-Tox products out of Boston, had been sentenced to jail. And dozens of seizures were taking misbranded food supplements vended by lecturers and door-to-door salesmen off the market. But the job was too big. As always, FDA resources were limited, and nutritional cases complex and difficult to develop and prosecute. Despite the increased regulatory attention being given it, nutritional quackery grew larger. It had reached the stage, the AMA estimated, of a half-billion-dollar annual racket. \"We believe,\" said Wallace Janssen, FDA's director of public information, \"that at present more 'bunk is being peddled to the public concerning food than on any other subject.\"[48] In 1957 the FDA began a major educational campaign to supplement its increased regulatory efforts. Not that public warnings had not come from many quarters throughout the preceding years. From the 1920's on, the AMA's magazines had carried countless articles pointing out the dangers of pseudo-nutritional doctrines. Morris Fishbein avowed in 1938 that \"public interest in vitamins has led to a more extraordinary exploitation than in almost any other field of medicine, except perhaps the glands.\" Hohensee felt constantly the necessity of castigating Fishbein, whom he termed \"the medical dictator.\" University professors of nutrition and of home economics, the American Dietetic Association, the American Public Health Association, organizations of food technologists, the Nutrition Foundation (an industry-sponsored group), the National Better Business Bureau, writers for newspapers and magazines, and other concerned parties also spoke out against the follies of food faddism and particularly the waste in money and risks in health inherent in relying on the expensive products dispensed by the fringe operators. But all these warnings bulked small in mass compared with the total wordage written and spoken by the false food prophets. Millions of Americans did not or would not hear [49]. More strenuous educational efforts, FDA officials hoped, might reap a larger measure of success. District offices were instructed to make the debunking of false nutritional claims a deliberate campaign. Speeches on the theme before consumer and service groups were increased. Newspapers and radio stations were provided with information. From Washington a new and hard-hitting pamphlet, Food Facts v. Food Fallacies, was distributed by the thousands. Writers were given welcome and provided with statistics and case histories. Arthur S. Flemming, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, issued a special release and held a press conference to publicize the issue [50]. The AMA, like the FDA, had become alert to the growing menace. Inquiries and complaints about door-to-door nutritional salesmen, noted Oliver Field, director of the Bureau of investigation, had come to bulk the largest of any category in the bureau's files. So the AMA also launched an intensified campaign of education against nutritional quackery, treating the subject in Today's Health, the magazine for lay readers, preparing a large display for exhibit at state and county fairs, issuing new pamphlets, and making a movie on \"The Medicine Man\" for showing before clubs and school and church groups. The film vividly revealed the techniques of a health lecturer vending his wares. Those who had witnessed Hohensee in action might, in seeing the movie, experience a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu [51]. \"The Medicine Man\" received its first showing at an AMA Public Relations Institute in Chicago in August 1958. At this meeting the announcement was made that the leading foes of nutritional quackery had organized a united front. Spokesmen for the AMA, FDA, and NBBB reported joint efforts to expand the educational crusade. \"It will take widespread and repeated dissemination of literature and other visual aids,\" said FDA's Kenneth Milstead, \"to make an impression on the public.\" [52] So battle was joined at a new level between the promoters and the opponents of nutritional nonsense, with the health of the American public at stake. At the time of the Chicago Institute, Adolphus Hohensee had served his sentence and was four months out of jail. Being behind bars had not seemed to quench his fighting mood. He resumed the rostrum and re-entered the fray [53].

In 1962 a California judge sentenced Hohensee to jail for selling \"ambrosia of the gods\"\u2014honey\u2014with curative claims. The judge recommended that Hohensee be put in charge of the prison beehives.

A horrible, crab-like disease has invaded your body, is gnawing your flesh, has pushed greedy tentacles into your vital organs. A loathsome scavenger slowly and inexorably is consuming you alive, cell by cell.\" [2] With these stark words one of the 20th century's most successful cancer-treating irregulars opened his autobiography, catching cleverly the fearsome and repulsive image in which mankind has conceived of cancer through the ages. The word \"cancer\" does derive from the Greek word for \"crab.\" [3] The crawling spread of cancer, whether external and observable or internal and secretive, is relentless, and during long centuries the diagnosis of cancer has amounted to a sentence of death, following a painful and often protracted decline. During the 20th century, important headway has been made in combatting this ancient disease. The basic processes involved in cancer's various forms are ever better understood. Diagnostic techniques are constantly improving. Great advances in therapy have come through improvements in surgery and in the use of x-rays, radium, and other radioactive substances. \"The cold knife and the hot rays\" really produce cures. Nearly a third of all patients with cancer are now being saved, as judged by the fact that they are still alive five years after diagnosis, and this proportion could be raised to a half with prompt and full application of the knowledge and skills possessed by our specialists [4]. But the age-old fear of cancer still persists. Indeed, relatively, the image of cancer has grown more grim. For the gains in fighting it have been less dramatic than medical triumphs in other areas, especially with respect to contagious diseases. Despite massive research, chemotherapy for cancer has so far yielded only modest results. Drugs can postpone death in patients afflicted with certain forms of cancer. A few antibiotics have caused some profound remission, if not cure. One rare type of cancer, treated with a combination of drugs, has yielded a high rate of five-year cures. But no chemotherapeutic agent has been found that can vanquish cancer as penicillin can often cure pneumonia. So, in the scale of killers, cancer has risen, now ranking as the number two cause of death, destined to end the lives of one out of every eight Americans [5]. The fear of cancer has doubtless been aggravated by the very necessary effort to combat it. For the word itself has appeared so often in the press during the last generation that latent concern has been Constantly quickened into conscious dread. Educational campaigns have aimed at leading the public to recognize symptoms and to seek diagnosis early enough for surgery or x-ray treatment to be effective. This effort has brought continued life to many who would have otherwise been doomed. Yet an inevitable side effect of increasing cancer-consciousness has been a rise in cancer quackery. For fear of cancer, fear that some ambiguous symptom may mean cancer, fear of surgery and radiation if one has or might have cancer, fear of the waiting period after orthodox treatment to determine its success or failure, fear that discovery has come too late to warrant treatment, fear, agonizing numbing fear, overwhelming the safeguards of rational prudence, sends desperate men and women to the cancer quack. Not that the cancer quack is a new breed, of course; he has been around almost as long as the malady itself. He flourished in the 19th century, offering his \"secret specific\" to the frightened, who, \"like a drowning person grasping at straws, seize upon the frail hope that is offered by the hand of ignorant charlatanry.\" Within the 20th century, all foes of the charlatan have been forced to keep him constantly in mind. The Sherley Amendment was provoked by the Bureau of Chemistry's loss of a cancer labeling case. Post Office fraud fighters have won a succession of victories over mail-order \"specialists\" in treating cancer. But Dr. Cramp, in successive editions of Nostrums and Quackery, noticed no diminution in their sordid ranks. Hardly a week passed without the receipt in his office of a letter announcing the discovery of a \"sure cure\" for cancer. Nor did pseudo-science wither during the decades that science was making its most notable advances. By the 1950's, some 4,000 quacks were fleecing thousands of victims who had or feared they had cancer out of about $50 million every year [6]. In 1936, the year in which Dr. Cramp published the last green-bound volume in his Nostrum and Quackery series, one of the key characters in Cramp's cancer cast showed up in Dallas, Texas. There, in a small one-story building, Harry M. Hoxsey opened a cancer \"clinic.\" [7] This venture, unlike a number of Hoxsey's previous efforts which Cramp had chronicled, turned out to be a major financial success. Hoxsey had inherited the cancer business. Early in his career he gave his father credit for the discovery of his remedy, setting the date at 1908. Later on Hoxsey told a more grandiloquent tale, pushing the date back to 1840 and transferring the distinction to his great-grandfather, who, on his Illinois farm, observed how his Percheron stallion cured a cancer of the right hock by standing knee-deep in a clump of shrubs and flowering plants. In both accounts, Hoxsey's father, a self-taught veterinarian, employed the secret anti-cancer remedy first on livestock, then on men. The elder Hoxsey died in 1919, and the cause of death was cancer, a fact his son later went to great pains to deny. Harry's mother died two years later, also of cancer. In 1921 Harry was 20, and life did not look promising. The youngest of 12 children, Harry had grown up in the rural Illinois village of Girard, had quit school after the eighth grade\u2014he later claimed receipt of a high school diploma from a correspondence school\u2014and had gone to work in the coal mines at neighboring Taylorville, selling some insurance on the side [8]. Young Hoxsey was an ambitious fellow, \"quick-brained\" and \"ingenious,\" as a federal judge later remarked, natty in dress, glib and persuasive of speech. As one of his early admirers put it, \"Harry is not a man of few words but one of many,\" and those words, not elegant in grammatical construction, definitely possessed the common touch. His endeavors were early imbued with the spirit of the motto he later displayed on a desk plaque: \"The world is made up of two kinds of people-dem that takes and dem that gets took.\" [9] Some of his siblings were shortly to sue Harry, accusing him of taking their father's cancer formula for his own profit, after his mother's death, a legacy that should have belonged to them all. The suit was never pushed to a conclusive decision. Harry's story had it that his father, just before his death, had taught him the formula by having him copy it 250 times until he learned it by heart and had given him a dramatic death-bed injunction to devote his career to healing the sick, no matter what opposition he might encounter from \"the High Priests of Medicine.\" In any case, Harry claimed, he had changed the composition of the formula [10]. About 1922 Hoxsey began to use the formula. As he later told the tale, a Civil War veteran with cancer of the lip had come to him and begged for treatment. Harry had demurred, saying he had no license to practice medicine.\" \"Nobody needs a license to save lives,\" the veteran had argued. \"If I was drowning would you stand by and watch me go down because a sign on yonder tree says 'No Swimming Allowed'?\" \"There's no adequate answer to that kind of logic,\" Hoxsey said in retrospect, \"and I didn't waste any time trying to find one.\" He used the cancer paste on the venerable veteran, who thereafter, throughout his life, was willing to testify in public utterance and in print that he had been cured. While practicing spasmodically in Taylorville, Hoxsey joined up with two Chicago men to form the National Cancer Research Institute, a common law trust to exploit the use of his father's formula. When his associates backed out of this enterprise to give their support to another cancer venture, Hoxsey expanded his Taylorville operations into the Hoxide Institute. Supported by some of the town's businessmen, Hoxsey took over from the Order of the Moose an old frame house and began to advertise his treatment far and wide. \"CANCER, the copy read, \"Any person suffering from this malady . . . is invited to apply for authoritative information as to the cures that have been effected and are now being effected at Taylorville, under strictly ethical medical supervision, painlessly, without operation, and with permanent results.\" Inquirers were told to write the secretary of the Taylorville Chamber of Commerce [12]. Patients responded to the advertising, and shortly the local paper began to run stories of deaths that were occurring at the Institute. Local doctors began to be concerned. One of them wrote the \"high priests\" at the American Medical Association telling of examining a man who had received the Hoxide treatment. The paste had been applied to a tumor on the cheek. \"Two days before ... [the man] died,\" the doctor wrote, \"I was called to see him and found necrosis of not only soft tissue of his face, but a complete destruction of the malar bone. This man died of hemorrhage at the hospital.\"[13] To keep the secret of his medicine, the doctor said, Hoxsey bought the separate ingredients each at a different drugstore. The key ingredient, analysis at AMA headquarters revealed, was arsenic. Thus Hoxsey's vaunted remedy was an escharotic, a corrosive chemical that ate away the flesh. Through the ages physicians had employed such corrosive agents in treating external cancers, but this mode of procedure had become outmoded. \"Pastes went out with the bustle,\" a cancer authority has noted, \"so far as scientific medicine is concerned.\" Such chemicals could not distinguish between tissues that were cancerous and tissues that were sound. The risk of damage to healthy flesh was tremendous. The escharotic might eat into the blood vessels and cause death through bleeding. Surgery was much safer and more certain [14]. The goings-on at Taylorville brought Hoxsey into conflict both with the AMA and with the law. Dr. Cramp blasted the Hoxide Institute's methods in the AMA Journal. Tragedy awaited \"sufferers from carcinoma,\" he wrote, \"who are beguiled by false beacons displayed by the highly respectable citizens of Taylorville\" into resorting to Hoxsey's treatment. He detailed instances of tragedy that already had occurred. \"The promoters of the scheme\" were reaping \"a rich harvest from gullibility and suffering.\" [15] Hoxsey sued the AMA in response to its criticism, asking a quarter of a million dollars libel judgment. The case dragged on, and finally the AMA insisted that it be brought to trial. The Hoxsey Institute was not prepared, and the judge dismissed the suit. In the meantime, Hoxsey had gone to court as defendant instead of plaintiff. Charged with responsibility for the death of one of his victims, he was accused of practicing medicine without a license. He pleaded guilty and paid a $100 fine [16]. The Hoxide Institute in Taylorville closed its doors in 1928, but Harry Hoxsey did not abandon the corrosive legacy inherited from his father. Twice again in quick succession he sought to duplicate his Taylorville venture in Illinois towns, first in Jacksonville, then in Girard. He launched his return to his home town with a mammoth \"Hoxsey Day,\" under the aegis of the Chamber of Commerce, a day that had all the trappings of a Fourth of July celebration. The Girard band played. Living testimonials from among the citizenry, including the Civil War veteran, bespoke their gratitude to Hoxsey before the large audience assembled in the town square under a boiling sun. An eclectic doctor from Indiana lauded the Hoxsey method. A local minister delivered an oration imbued with religious and patriotic zeal. \"I love my country,\" he told the crowd, \"because its heroes are such characters as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, who love to serve and not to rule. I love Hoxsey because he does not want to rule the world but serve the world.\" [17] Hoxsey himself addressed his former neighbors. \"There is a lot of knockers,\" he said, \"who do not know what they are talking about, and especially around a man's home town, and if those knockers are here today and have the mind of a six year old child and don't leave here today, a walking, talking dyed-in-the-wool Hoxsey fan and convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that this treatment is a cure for cancer they are either deaf, dumb or blind, or else they are crazy.\" Regular doctors were \"hard-hearted,\" interested in getting \"their hand greased with plenty of money,\" wanting to drive their Packards and their Stutzes. AMA officials had been invited to attend the rally, but they had not come. \"Why don't they fight in the open? Why don't they take this platform? Why don't they prove the Hoxsey affair is a fake as they say? . . . But no, friends, they haven't got the guts to accept this challenge.\" And Hoxsey presented his gallery of patients who said they had been cured, quizzing them publicly on the details of their experience. \"Anyone in the hearing of my voice,\" he challenged, \"who will prove that the Hoxsey Method does not cure more than 50 per cent of its patients, or if they will prove or show that there is another method under God's skies as good as the Hoxsey, he can receive the reward which we have offered on our large posters.\" Applause was frequent, the local editor observed, and when one speaker asked if the audience wished to endorse Hoxsey in his attempts to save lives, \"the response was so nearly unanimous that those who remained sitting for any reason could be counted on the fingers.\" If the citizens were impressed, the AMA was not. \"Perhaps,\" Cramp wrote, \"Girard will flourish briefly\u2014especially the local undertaker and those individuals who have rooms to rent. . . . If that is what the citizens . . . want, the Hoxide fakery will doubtless give it to them. They will also get the doubtful privilege of the reputation of living in a town that fattens off the sufferings of those unfortunates who are lured there by the false hope that an ignorant faker has discovered a 'cure' for one of the most dreadful scourges afflicting the human race.\" [18] Hoxsey's Girard endeavors were indeed brief, and twice more be paid a fine for practicing in Illinois without a license. A cooperative venture across the river in Iowa did not work out much better. Hoxsey teamed up in Muscatine with another uneducated promoter of a cancer cure, Norman Baker, but the two fell out, the state stepped in, and Hoxsey was barred by injunction from treating cancer patients. During the next several years, Hoxsey was much on the move. He set up shop in Detroit, in Wheeling, then in Atlantic City. Wherever he went, the AMA dogged his footsteps. Legal actions were sometimes instituted. Finally, in 1936, Hoxsey went south. Dallas promised to be a safer and more prosperous haven, at least for a time [19]. As had been true beginning with his Illinois enterprises, Hoxsey strove to concentrate on the business and promotional sides of his Dallas clinic, leaving the diagnosing and treating mainly to a series of eclectic, homeopathic, and osteopathic physicians whom he employed. But he could not bring himself to abstain completely from therapy. Again convicted of practicing medicine without a license, Hoxsey was fined $25,000 and sentenced to five months in jail. A higher court, however, set aside this verdict. Hoxsey managed to acquire an honorary Doctor of Naturopathy degree and was licensed in Texas as a naturopath [20]. Hoxsey's early years at Dallas coincided with the early years of the chemotherapeutic revolution. His burgeoning business owed not a little of its success to this fact. For, in addition to treating external cancers with escharotic substances, the clinic offered to treat internal cancers by \"chemical\" means. Hoxsey was to claim that his internal medicines had been used by his father and inherited from him. But the evidence seems to suggest that, in his Illinois days, only the corrosive paste was employed in therapy, used, to be sure, not only in treating skin cancers, but also for cancer\u2014or purported cancer\u2014of the breast and female organs. Exactly when he began using his \"tonics\" for hidden cancers within the body is not clear. Perhaps he acquired his formulas from Norman Baker during the tempestuous joint operation in Muscatine. At any rate, in his early Dallas days, Hoxsey boasted he could cure internal cancers with medicines. To a public increasingly fearful of cancer and increasingly hopeful of chemotherapy, such an appeal offered a gleam of hope [21]. The ingredients in Hoxsey's internal medicines, kept secret until revealed in court actions, varied somewhat from time to time. Two liquid mixtures played the central role, one brownish-black in color, the other pink. The brownish-black liquid contained water, potassium iodide (used mainly in medical practice as an expectorant to loosen tenacious sputum in cases of bronchitis), cascara sagrada (an herbal laxative), sugar syrup, and usually prickly ash, buckthorn, alfalfa, and red clover blossoms. The pink liquid, besides the other ingredients, contained lactate of pepsin, a vehicle used to help the stomach tolerate nauseating medicines; the pink variety was prescribed when patients encountered some of the unpleasant side effects occasionally experienced when taking potassium iodide [22]. Why his colored mixtures cured cancer, Hoxsey and his spokesmen were frank to confess they did not completely know. \"We have been too busy treating cancer victims\u2014and fighting court battles to keep our clinic open\u2014\" he asserted in his autobiography, \"to spare the time, personnel and facilities for objective study.\" His hypothesis, in its bluntest version, held that a major chemical imbalance in the body caused normal cells to mutate into a cancerous form, and his medicines restored the original chemical environment, checking and killing the cancerous cells. This hypothesis could be elaborated at length\u2014as in an address delivered by Hoxsey's medical director\u2014into a complicated fantasy of irrelevant scientific and pseudo-scientific jargon that sounded very impressive to the layman but caused genuine cancer experts to grieve. What made things worse, as the experts assessed the Hoxsey theories, was that the Hoxsey literature condemned the only treatments yet found valid in cancer therapy. \"In my opinion,\" wrote medical director J.B. Durkee, \"x-ray and radium have no place in the treatment of cancer. . . . They further upset basic cell metabolism rather than do anything to correct it.\" Durkee's lecture, in printed form, played a prominent role in Hoxsey's \"scientific\" confrontation of his would-be patients [23]. Equally important in that confrontation were testimonials from earlier patients. Just as on \"Hoxsey Day\" at Girard, so in Dallas Hoxsey could present \"satisfied\" users of his method, men and women who credited him with saving their lives. They would. respond to letters from inquirers, talk to investigating groups, testify in court, and write their touching expressions of gratitude for Hoxsey to print and distribute far and wide. Hoxsey's promotional documents did not claim that all cancers could be cured. Indeed, be specifically denied this was the case. Cures were less certain if x-ray or radiation treatment had been used first. But with Hoxsey's \"entirely revolutionary\" internal medicine, many cancers could be cured. The cure rate for breast cancer, for example, according to Dr. Durkee's speech, was 50 to 60 per cent. And countering his caveats, in the minds of those who read Hoxsey's literature, were the compelling case histories [24]. When a fearful patient showed up at the door of Hoxsey's first small Dallas clinic, or later at the larger building which growing business led him to acquire, the patient's case history was transcribed by a clerk. The sufferer's own suspicions were taken down, plus a record of anything he had been told by doctors whom be might have consulted earlier. Documentary records of previous diagnosis or treatment, like the results of a biopsy, were solicited. Then came some laboratory tests: various blood studies, a urinalysis, a test for syphilis. Very rarely a biopsy was secured, Chest and pelvic x-rays were made and a general physical examination given by a member of the staff. The medical director reviewed the records and, if cancer was diagnosed, prescribed the Hoxsey treatment. Patients said to have external cancer were treated with Hoxsey's current version of the escharotic powder. They and patients said to be suffering from internal cancer were put on the internal medication, usually the brownish-black liquid first, three teaspoonfuls a day. \"Supportive\" treatment of vitamins, laxatives, and antacids was also prescribed. Then the patient saw the business manager and arranged for the payment of the clinic's charges: the basic fee in Dallas was first $300, later increased to $400, plus certain other costs. Hoxsey insisted, as he had asserted throughout his career, that many indigent sufferers were treated free [25]. As the years went by, thousands of patients from all over the nation made the trip to Dallas, learning of Hoxsey through his printed pamphlets or by word of mouth. Some had diagnosed their own symptoms without consulting doctors and had reached the fearful decision that cancer had attacked them. Others, with cancer diagnosed by physicians, sought out Hoxsey instead of submitting themselves to surgery. Still others had already undergone operations and x-ray treatments, but in their despair determined to miss no bets. The Dallas methods were also exported to other states. A few physicians and osteopaths around the country, after spending some time in Dallas, returned to their own cities and sought to treat cancer the Hoxsey way, receiving by mail their supply of the brownish-black and pink tonics [26]. As his clinic prospered, Hoxsey sought to bolster its prestige. In 1945, accompanied by three Congressmen, he showed up at the National Cancer Institute in Washington. The year after Hoxsey had begun his Dallas operation, Congress had created the National Cancer Institute to confront, with all the resources of modern science, a major health problem in which the public was displaying an increasing concern. Besides conducting its own research, the NCI was eager to discover helpful clues wherever they might be found. Suggestions coming from outside the agency were often turned over for appraisal to the National Advisory Cancer Council, a group of the nation's leading experts in the cancer field. To avoid burdening the Council with trivial and patently futile suggestions, criteria had been established to govern which methods of treating cancer, among those proposed, warranted investigation and possible testing. When Hoxsey, the Congressmen in tow, showed up at the Institute, the NCI's chief, Dr. R.R. Spencer, explained these criteria. The Institute, he said, would be glad to present Hoxsey's case to the advisory council if he would furnish certain information. He must reveal his formula and explain his techniques of treatment in detail. He must also present a record of at least 50 cases treated by his method. Each case must represent an individual in whom the presence of internal cancer had been confirmed by competent biopsy, who had been treated by physicians and given up as hopeless, and who then had been treated by Hoxsey and had survived from three to five years [27]. Such stipulations, of course, were much more stringent than those required for publishing testimonials. Hoxsey impressed Dr. Spencer as reluctant to reveal his formula. Nonetheless, after the interview in Washington, Hoxsey went back to Dallas and sent to the National Cancer Institute data on 60 cases. The information did not come near to meeting the criteria. It was too fragmentary and incomplete to warrant investigation. In Hoxsey's view, the NCI did not make a conscientious study of his results because it was under the thumb of the AMA. \"I was,\" he wrote, \"bitterly disappointed, disillusioned and sbocked.\" [28] From Senator Elmer Thomas of Oklahoma, Hoxsey managed to get a more sympathetic response. One of the Senator's constituents credited Hoxsey with saving his son's life and urged Thomas to pay a visit to the Dallas clinic. Thomas came. In a sort of formal hearing, transcribed by a court reporter, the Senator quizzed a group of satisfied users whom Hoxsey had assembled and was obviously impressed. Hoxsey offered to put his treatment to any kind of test the Senator might arrange, and Thomas promised to return to Washington and try to interest government medical experts in such a trial of strength. No test eventuated, but Hoxsey printed up the verbatim testimony of the \"hearing\" and distributed it far and wide [29]. Hoxsey's posture on having his methods tested had been used before by the cancer irregulars and would be tried again. Vigorous public protestations that a test was desired, frequently repeated and broadly circulated, impressed the layman, especially when he was desperately seeking help against a dreaded malady for himself or for his loved ones. Such protestations betokened the promoter's self-confidence, his apparent willingness to abide by the rules of the scientific game. The layman could not so easily grasp that the promoter was either too ignorant to understand the real rules of adequate scientific testing or else insincere in his protestations, either unwilling or unable to provide the type of sophisticated data from which expert scientists could draw valid conclusions. When scientists rejected proffered tests, on grounds that the data were insufficient, it was easy for the promoter to raise the ancient cry of persecution. Physicians did not dare find out the truth, he could say, for fear that their lucrative methods of treatment might become outmoded. This pitch too brought sympathetic response from many laymen, well aware that regular medical treatment often was expensive. Such an appeal played also on a latent suspicion of complicated science that was present, as well as awe and respect, in the mass mind. Hoxsey continually proclaimed that he wanted tests. In the year that Senator Thomas visited him, Hoxsey wrote the Texas State Medical Board: \"If you will come out here to the clinic and we cannot prove to you that we have cured cancer after radium, x-ray, and surgery had failed, we will give you $10,000, or better still, we will take 25 cases of cancer and let the entire Dallas County Medical Society or any doctor in America take 25 cases, and if we do not cure two to their one in sixteen weeks, we will donate $10,000 to .my charitable organization in Dallas County.\" Two years later Hoxsey expressed his eagerness for testing to two scientists who visited the clinic at the behest of the American Cancer Society. The next year he again submitted case data to the National Cancer Institute, and again, after careful appraisal, the Institute determined that the material did not meet its basic requirements. Hoxsey's 77 case reports were accompanied by only six biopsies; only two of these were from patients treated for internal cancer, neither of which revealed anything that could be identified as cancer cells. Despite this, a committee of the National Advisory Cancer Council perused the Hoxsey records case by case. No single case met the Council's criteria. Clinical tests were naturally refused [30]. By this time Hoxsey had interested another Senator in his operations. William Langer of North Dakota had already gone on record as complimenting another unproved cancer remedy. Now he quizzed the National Cancer Institute rigorously on its approach to Hoxsey's problem. After a visit to Dallas, Langer brought Hoxsey much publicity by introducing a resolution in the Senate under which a subcommittee would have been authorized to make \"a full and complete study and investigation\" to determine if Hoxsey's methods \"in the treatment of cancer have proved a cure for such disease.\" [31] If Hoxsey had not had tests, he had certainly undergone trials. The results of these court actions in Dallas doubtless had much to do with the buoyancy with which he fraternized with senators and the boldness with which he spoke his mind. A new effort to convict Hoxsey of practicing without a license had come to naught when the jury could not agree upon a verdict. Nor was Hoxsey found guilty in a damage suit brought by a widower who charged that his wife's death had been due to negligent and improper treatment at the clinic. Hoxsey, moreover, won two judgments in libel suits involving Morris Fishbein. And a federal district judge refused the government an injunction to stop Hoxsey's distribution of his tonics in interstate commerce [32]. The AMA had not forgotten Hoxsey, and in 1947 Fishbein had written an excoriating editorial in the journal entitled \"Hoxsey\u2014Cancer Charlatan.\" To warn a wider audience, Fishbein had also co-authored an article called \"Blood Money\" for the Hearst chain's weekly magazine section, carried by the San Antonio Light. Fishbein repeated the phrase \"cancer charlatan\" in reference to Hoxsey and termed his father \"a veterinarian and dabbler in faith cures\" who had himself succumbed to cancer after claiming to have found a cure for it. Hoxsey promptly sued, asking a million dollars libel damages [33]. He won the case, receiving, however, not a million dollars but only two, one for himself, one for his father, Elderly judge William Atwell, who heard the case, concluded from the testimony that Fishbein, acting from \"a mistaken sense of public duty\" and bearing Hoxsey \"no malice,\" had indeed been guilty of libel. Yet Hoxsey, whose methods of promotion depended in part on making the public believe that the AMA was hounding him, had suffered no serious damage from the article\u2014hence the nominal award. Hoxsey had no license to practice medicine in Texas, and yet he had applied his yellow arsenic powder to the breast of a woman and this had resulted in her death. But, the judge ruled, Hoxsey did have the right to employ physicians, even though they were \"not especially learned men,\" and patients had the right to go to them for treatment. \"Pay your money,\" judge Atwell said, \"and take your choice.\" The judge seemed to have been much impressed by the testimony of the satisfied users whom Hoxsey had paraded to the witness stand. They said they had had cancer, and they said they had been cured. \"Healing,\" Atwell was persuaded, had occurred, and the circumstances brought to his mind the healing of Christ [34]. Judge Atwell was also on the bench when, in 1950, the government sought to enjoin Hoxsey from shipping his medicines for internal cancer across state lines. Not until this date had court decisions broadened the definition of labeling under the 1938 law so as to make it seem applicable to Hoxsey's methods of operation. The Food and Drug Administration first instituted a seizure action against tonics sent from Dallas to a Hoxsey practitioner in Denver, but Hoxsey let this action go by default. Now, in Judge Atwell's courtroom, he fought [35]. Food and Drug officials had worked prodigiously to develop a persuasive case. Their goal was to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of Hoxsey's tonics in treating internal cancer and to disprove Hoxsey's oft-repeated claims that cases had been cured. Dr. David 1. Macht, a distinguished specialist in pharmacological and experimental therapeutics, long a Johns Hopkins professor, was called to the stand [36]. \"Doctor,\" he was asked by the district attorney, \"is there any recognized therapeutic use of any of these items [in the tonics, including potassium iodide, or cascara sagrada, or buckthorn, and other items, any therapy for malignant cells, that you are aware off'\" [37] \"Absolutely no basis for it,\" he replied, \"and I am speaking not only as a pharmacologist, but as a member of the American College of Physicians.\" Potassium iodide, indeed, another specialist testified on the basis of his own researches, \"would speed up the growth of cancer.\" Hoxsey's tonics, still another noted cancer research scientist said, had not cured cancer in mice. In an experiment which he conducted for the Food and Drug Administration, malignant growths in mice treated with the medicine were uniformly larger at autopsy than at the beginning of the tests [38]. In preparing for the trial, Food and Drug inspectors had tracked down the case histories of scores of Hoxsey's patients. Men, women, and children who had talked with Senator Thomas, those whose names had been used in Hoxsey's promotions, those whose cases had been submitted to the National Cancer Institute, all were investigated. Patients still living were talked with; members of the families of those who had died were interviewed. Physicians with whom Hoxsey's patients had consulted before or after going to the Dallas clinic were queried, their records checked. Hospital records, the records of pathological clinics, were studied. Hoxsey's former employees were questioned. From all this inquiry a pattern emerged. This pattern the government sought to make clear in court. Selecting 16 cases\u2014nine of them persons whose testimony had been given in Hoxsey's pamphlet considered as labeling\u2014the government called to the stand the patients or their survivors, diagnosticians, pathologists, surgeons, and other scientific experts. Hoxsey's claimed \"cures\" of internal cancer as represented by these typical cases, the government sought to show, all fell into three classes. Either the patients had never had cancer, although treated for it at the Dallas clinic. Or they had been cured of cancer by proper surgical or radiation treatment before consulting Hoxsey. Or they had had cancer and either still were so afflicted or had died [39]. One of the most poignant cases presented involved a high school boy of 16 who, after a football injury, developed an extremely malignant cancer in a leg bone. When the boy's physician recommended amputation, the parents could not face this prospect and took their son instead to Hoxsey's clinic. The medical director, the father testified, had guaranteed a cure. For some four months the lad took Hoxsey's tonics. They did no good. Several months later the boy was dead. Had the amputation been performed, the physician who had first treated the boy testified, he would have had a fighting chance [40]. Hoxsey, who did not take the stand himself, based his defense mainly on another round of testimonials. Indeed, some of his former patients who were government witnesses continued, despite the evidence, to express their loyalty to him. Twenty-two other patients took the stand for the defense to bless the Hoxsey treatment. Half of these cases had been treated for skin cancers with Hoxsey's escharotic powders and pastes. The issue of the external treatment was not on trial, but judge Atwell let these witnesses testify anyhow. Cancer specialists did not deny Hoxsey might cure some cases of skin cancer with his tissue-eating chemicals. The method, however, was outdated and unnecessarily painful and hazardous. Modern surgical and radiation techniques could cure upwards of 95 per cent of such cases more safely and humanely [41]. Of Hoxsey's 11 patients testifying that they had been cured of internal cancer, the only evidence that three had ever had the disease was their own affirmation. In four other cases, the government introduced rebuttal testimony to show that the patients had been cured before consulting Hoxsey. In the four remaining cases, the sole evidence that the patients had indeed had cancer was the testimony of Dr. Durkee, Hoxsey's medical director. In cross-examining Durkee, the district attorney brought out the inadequacy of his qualifications to speak with authority in this field. A 1941 graduate of a Chicago osteopathic college, Durkee had interned for less than a year at a small unaccredited osteopathic hospital in Nebraska, where he had seen only four or five cases of cancer. Then he had practiced for several years in a Texas village, encountering perhaps 10 to 15 cancer patients. In 1946 he had joined Hoxsey's staff. There he had seen some 35 to 50 patients a day, examining each one for an average of five to ten minutes. He did not \"need a biopsy to make a diagnosis of cancer,\" he testified, and rarely used the technique. Biopsies that Durkee had submitted to pathological laboratories, other evidence showed, were so poorly prepared as to be useless, His knowledge of the pharmacological action of the drugs in the Hoxsey tonics was vague, his explanation of the Hoxsey theory of cancer and its cure as fuzzy from the witness stand as in his public address reproduced in the labeling pamphlet [42]. Despite Durkee's confusion, despite the government's carefully presented case, Harry Hoxsey won the contest. Judge Atwell would not grant the injunction. He could not agree that Hoxsey's treatment was either injurious or futile. \"Some it cures,\" he ruled, \"and some it does not cure, and some it relieves somewhat.\" Its \"percentage of efficient and beneficial treatments,\" the judge decided, was \"reasonably comparable to the efficiency and success of surgery and radium.\" [43] Atwell's decision did not surprise FDA officials. His admission into the record of the self-diagnosis of cancer by Hoxsey's lay witnesses, his willingness to hear testimony about external cancer, had been straws in the wind. In any case, the Food and Drug men suspected that Atwell himself had once been a Hoxsey patient [44]. The government appealed. Persuaded that Atwell had been swayed by incompetent testimony, that be had misapprehended the impact of evidence presented by medical experts, the government asked the circuit court to grant the injunction which Atwell had refused. After a careful scrutiny of the two large volumes of testimony, the three-judge court unanimously acceded to this request. A layman's opinion as to whether be had had cancer and been cured, the judges said, was \"entitled to little, if any, weight.\" Only a biopsy could permit accurate diagnosis. Only surgery, x-ray, and other radioactive substances could cure\u2014such was the judgment of the \"overwhelming weight of disinterested testimony. A judge \"should not be so blind and deaf as to fail to see, hear and understand the import and effect of such matters of general public knowledge and acceptance.\" Hoxsey's entire promotional campaign sought to persuade the cancer sufferer that \"he had an excellent chance to become one of those cases in which the medicine would be successful.\" Yet with respect to Hoxsey's own testifiers in his labeling, the government had demonstrated that the brownish-black and pink tonics had not proved efficacious. Atwell had erred, therefore, abusing his discretion. He must grant the injunction which the government had sought [45]. Before Atwell could ponder this directive, Hoxsey asked the Supreme Court to reverse the circuit court's decision. But the highest tribunal would not grant certiorari. So Atwell yielded to the circuit court's demands. The injunction he issued, however, followed a form suggested to him by Hoxsey's attorneys rather than the form presented by the government. The decree did not flatly bar Hoxsey's internal medicines from shipment in interstate commerce. It forbade their interstate shipment unless\u2014and here was an effort to appeal to the McArmulty decision of half a century before\u2014unless they were labeled to show that there existed a conflict of medical opinion concerning their curative claims. Such a ruling, Food and Drug officials knew, would shut no doors at all [46]. Since the circuit court had found as fact that Hoxsey's internal remedies could not cure cancer, no legal room existed for the assertion of differences of medical opinion. So the government sought from the circuit court a writ of mandamus that would require Atwell to issue the injunction in the proper form. In the legal maneuvering over the writ, Hoxsey again appealed to the Supreme Court and was denied. The circuit court, using a less rigorous remedy than a writ of mandamus, nonetheless made it clear to Atwell that the disputed clause in his injunction was in \"direct conflict\" with the court's earlier ruling\u2014McAnnulty did not apply\u2014and must be excised. In October 1953, nearly three years after the case had gone to trial, judge Atwell issued the injunction without the \"conflict of medical opinion\" clause. But the issue was still not finally settled. Hoxsey went to court once more, appealing for a stay of execution of the injunction on the grounds that his constitutional rights had been violated, an appeal the government termed \"frivolous.\" Another year went by before the Supreme Court, refusing to hear the circuit court's denial of Hoxsey's plea, put an end to the extended litigation. In October 1954 the injunction at long last went into effect [47]. The government's injunction, won at great cost, did not stop Hoxsey's Dallas operation. Two years later, indeed, one estimate put his annual gross at $1.5 million extracted from some 8,000 patients. Curtailing his interstate shipments and exchanging his labeling for a \"prescription\" approach, Hoxsey continued to manage his clinic, staffed by osteopaths who dispensed the tonics to cancer sufferers much as before. \"There's only one way they'll ever close that Hoxsey Clinic,\" he told one audience, \"and that's to put a militia around it.\" To attract patients to Dallas, Hoxsey set out on a massive drumbeating campaign. He used favorable, passages from the trial testimony as \"advertising,\" planting such extracts and laudatory comments in mass-appeal magazines, sometimes in exchange for a fee. He brought to Dallas a group of doctors from around the country\u2014many of whom the AMA considered less than fully reputable\u2014and published their favorable reactions. He went on extensive lecture tours, speaking to fringe groups who shared his antagonism toward organized medicine. He paid a writer to ghostwrite his autobiography and sent a copy to every Senator and Representative. He made motions as if to run for the governorship of Texas. He leagued together with other foes of the FDA and the AMA in accusing these organizations of conspiring to stifle medical freedom [48]. One of Hoxsey's new allies in his expanded fight was Gerald B. Winrod, the Kansas evangelist. A militant fundamentalist, Winrod had fought modernism in religion during the 1920's. Later he turned his attention to right-wing politics, providing the inspiration for Sinclair Lewis' portrait of \"Buzz\" Windrip in It Can't Happen Here. A visit to Germany in 1934 confirmed Winrod's pro-Nazi inclinations, although he played this down while nearly winning the Republican Senatorial nomination from Kansas in 1938. During the war he was indicted for sedition for expressing views calculated to injure morale in the armed forces, but the death of the judge halted the trial. After the war, Winrod's personal organ, the Defender, brought to a hundred thousand subscribers a mixture of fervent fundamentalism in religion and morals, right-wing political extremism, violent antagonism toward Jews and Negroes, hostility to fluoridation and mental health programs. The Defender also accepted flying saucers and championed unorthodox healers [49]. Winrod helped publicize Glyoxylide, the specious cancer remedy devised by a Detroit physician, William Frederick Koch. A group of ministers in Winrod's circle even set up a religious front, the Christian Medical Research League, to market this purported cure. And Winrod also joined hands with Hoxsey. Over many months the Wichita evangelist praised the Dallas clinic in the pages of the Defender, in pamphlets, in a book, in radio speeches. Winrod's motives were not unmixed. Although he asserted that he himself, when young, had been cured by the Hoxsey treatment-a tribute which Senator Langer inserted in the Congressional Record\u2014Winrod's publicity, whatever his gratitude, was not freely given. According to evidence later introduced in court, Hoxsey paid Winrod over $80,000. This fact was not apparent to Defender readers who learned of Hoxsey's marvelous \"cures \" along with their fundamentalist Sunday School lessons. After a Hoxsey defeat in court, Winrod wrote a letter to his constituency asking them to offer \"daily, persistent, argumentive prayer\" for Hoxsey, according to Luke funds to carry forward Hoxsey's \"anti-cancer crusade\" and the names and addresses of at least five cancer victims to whom Hoxsey literature might be sent. Winrod signed this appeal \"Yours in Christ's Service.\" [50] Hoxsey had other similar allies. The American Rally was an isolationist organization, established in 1952 \"For Peace, Abundance and the Constitution.\" Like Winrod's journal, it opposed fluoridation and polio vaccine and believed in flying saucers. In 1955 the Rally's magazine came out for Senator Langer for president in the 1956 election, lauding him as the \"Abraham Lincoln of the 20th Century.\" Shortly the Rally discovered a vice-presidential candidate fit to run with Langer, Harry Hoxsey. Introducing Hoxsey to a Rally convention in Chicago, its executive head said, \"The spirit of Lincoln is here tonight.\" Hoxsey responded with such Lincolnian phrases as: \"The AMA killed my daddy . . . the same bunch of rats I've been kicking ever since.\" [51] The American Rally shared with other dissident groups belief in \"medical freedom,\" defined as the right of every individual to seek treatment from Hoxsey's clinic and other clinics and practitioners frowned on by the orthodox medical profession. Two such groups were the American Association for Medico-Physical Research and the American Naturopathic Association. Hoxsey and his associates spoke before their meetings. At a naturopathic convention in Chicago, Hoxsey addressed himself to the theme, \"Who Are the Real Cancer Quacks and May God Have Mercy on Their Souls.\" From the same rostrum during this meeting, an address was also given by Fred J. Hart [52]. Hart was one of Albert Abrams' many heirs. Listing his fields of endeavor as \"Agriculture and Research,\" Hart had been associated with the College of Electronic Medicine, which sought to keep Abrams' doctrines flourishing, as early as 1935 and had become president by 1946 when the name was changed to the Electronic Medical Foundation. In 1954 the government had secured an injunction banning shipment in interstate commerce of numerous therapeutic machines fabricated by the Foundation. Hart was the moving spirit, the next year, in creating a new group to fight for \"medical freedom,\" the National Health Federation. Hart became president, one of Hoxsey's lawyers served as legal representative in Washington, and several of the FDA's most stubborn antagonists sat on the Federation's board. At membership rallies in California, Hart pleaded for funds to help Hoxsey carry on his fight, and Hoxsey asserted that he was giving the royalties from his autobiography to help finance the Federation [53] The Food and Drug Administration was not an independent agent, spokesmen for the Federation charged. As Hart once put it, Commissioner \"Larrick has to do what the medical trust tells him or he'd lose his job and he wouldn't like to wash dishes for a living.\" The medical profession, the drug industry, the food manufacturers (who added \"poisons\" to their cans), according to the Federation's journal, were all allied against the people. \"The House of Rockefeller\" owned \"the drug, food, milk, serum, news and money trusts\" and it owned the Eisenhower administration too. As a result, the FDA's administrative actions were marked by \"viciousness,\" and the agency allowed its employees \"to blackmail and slander firms and individuals without restraint.\" The Federation aimed at making the FDA \"a servant of the people; rather than leaving it as it now is\u2014a ruthless enemy, as tiranical [sic] in its actions as any Russian bureaucrat.\" The cover of the Federation's magazine in which this statement appeared again appealed to Lincoln, carrying his picture\u2014and Washington's too\u2014and the caption, \"They Too Fought for Liberty Against Great Odds.\" [54] Federation representatives lobbied on the federal and state levels, seeking an investigation of FDA policies and procedures, striving for the right of other practitioners besides M.D.'s to have access to federal research funds, seeking to limit fluoridation and cancer quackery control measures, trying to secure a ban on publicity by regulatory agencies about court cases until the final judgment was rendered, and much else. The Federation's literature flowed forth in quantity, seeking to win support from such groups as the Gold Star Mothers and the D.A.R. Petitions to Congress were sponsored, many in behalf of Hoxsey, asking an investigation of the FDA. Nearly 200,000 petitions had already reached the Capitol, Hoxsey told a Federation meeting in California in 1957, and this was \"driving\" the FDA \"nuts.\" Letter-writing campaigns were also stimulated among the faithful. \"Using specialists in mass psychology,\" Commissioner Larrick stated, \"the promoters held numerous meetings under the guise of 'scientific lectures' to organize a protest movement among those prejudiced against recognized medical treatment. They used radio, television, circulars, 'religious' publications and even huge barnside signs, to encourage the public to write to Congressmen and the President, demanding investigations of FDA 'persecution' of their leaders.\" The faithful disciples of Hoxsey and his allies responded eagerly. \"We have had,\" said Larrick, \"a torrent of belligerent letters to answer.\" One result of this deliberate effort to arouse the hostility of common citizens is revealed in a sentence from one wornan's letter: \"I do not trust the government anymore.\" [55] Hoxsey's cancer treatment metastasized from Texas into other states, particularly Pennsylvania. There its chief champion and promoter was state senator John Haluska. Having lost his mother and a young son from cancer, Haluska gave Hoxsey credit for saving his sister's life after regular doctors had given her up. (Her physicians later testified she had been cured by x-ray before going to Dallas.) Administrator of a hospital in Spangler, Haluska had been ousted for trying to convert the nurses home into a cancer clinic according to the Hoxsey pattern. Then Haluska. remodeled an appliance store and garage in Portage, a coal-mining town in the mountains of western Pennsylvania, employed one of Hoxsey's former medical directors, and offered to treat cancer sufferers. The medication was slightly different, not tonics but pills\u2014first red and black pills, then red, green, and yellow pills, the size of small lima beans. The pills contained, however, most of the ingredients in Hoxsey's tonics. When Hoxsey visited Portage, he was welcomed with a motorcade and a banquet at which Haluska apotheosized him as \"the greatest man in the country today\u2014greater than President Roosevelt was, and greater than President Truman and President Eisenhower.\" Similar praise resounded through the chamber of the Pennsylvania senate, with Hoxsey taking a bow from the balcony, as Haluska in a long oration announced the opening of the Portage clinic and lauded the Hoxsey methods. To his fellow senators, Haluska also introduced Kathy Allison, a young girl from Indiana. \"Here, Mr. President,\" he said, taking Kathy into his arms, \"is that little angel who, according to medical science, had to meet the angels soon. Today, she is going to school; was X-rayed last week and found to be cancer-free and is playing like any other normal child.\" Hoxsey had treated her; God had spared her. \"Senator Haluska's Great Speech\" was published in Winrod's Defender, and thousands of reprints spread across the country [56]. The Portage clinic opened in 1955 to brisk business. One early customer, a perfectly healthy FDA inspector, received an examination lasting a minute or two and was told he had cancer of the prostate. Quickly Food and Drug officials and a federal marshal visited the clinic and, amid a hostile throng of townspeople, seized half a million pills. After long delay, the seizure action came to trial. Hoxsey, testifying that he was not financially interested in the Portage venture, although serving as adviser, sat out the six-week jury trial at the defense table. Again, as at Dallas, satisfied users praised the Hoxsey methods. Again the government presented medical experts who condemned the Hoxsey medications as useless in cancer and refuted Hoxsey's alleged cures. Even little Kathy Allison, eight months after her touching appearance in the Pennsylvania Senate, had died of cancer of the chest. The jury condemned the Portage pills and ordered them destroyed [57]. While waiting out the law's delays, the Food and Drug Administration took an unprecedented step. The 1938 law authorized the dissemination of information regarding drugs in situations involving imminent danger to health or gross deception of the consumer. This provision had not hitherto been used. As the Pennsylvania seizure trial kept being postponed, and as cancer victims continued visiting Dallas and Portage, the FDA weighed the value of a major public warning. Might not such an outburst of publicity for Hoxsey, even though critical, do more harm than good, giving a clue to the desperate, who might sense Hoxsey's promises and disregard FDA's explanation of the dangers? On the other hand, a flood of letters was reaching FDA from cancer victims or their families, frightened people who had been advised to consult Hoxsey and were inquiring for the facts. One such letter came from a college girl in California who, while studying a semester in the nation's capital, had heard a speech on quackery by a man from the FDA. Now her father had cancer and was planning to go to Dallas. She wanted \"to discover the truth as far as it is known.\" The official who had made the speech telegraphed her that Hoxsey's treatment was \"totally ineffective,\" sent fuller information by airmail, and wrote that he had talked about her father's case with the director of the National Cancer Institute, to whom her father's physician should immediately phone. Might there not be many such citizens who could be prevented by a public warning from wasting their money and risking their lives? FDA officials decided to act [58]. In April 1956 the FDA issued its warning, terming Hoxsey's methods \"worthless,\" and \"imminently dangerous to rely on . . . in neglect of competent and rational treatment.\" The basic facts of the Texas injunction trial were tersely given. Besides relying on the daily press, FDA officials made a special effort to circulate the warning notice among farm, lodge, and church periodicals, asking those tempted to try Hoxsey's treatment to write to the FDA first for fuller facts. For months pathetic inquiring letters reached Washington at the rate of 50 to 100 a day. To spread the warning even further, the FDA prepared a \"Public Beware!\" poster, printed in red and black, which was displayed in the 46,000 post offices and postal substations throughout the land. These warnings, FDA officials concluded, did much good. While they triggered a new barrage of angry letters from Hoxsey's admirers, mailed to Congress, to the FDA and to the press, they cut down on customers in Dallas and Portage. A conservative FDA estimate held that, in the 30 weeks after the first warning, at least 3,000 people had been dissuaded from trying Hoxsey's futile treatment [59]. Hoxsey sought to enjoin the government from issuing its warnings. But Hoxsey lost his case, just as his Pennsylvania collaborators had lost their seizure action. While the seizure action was still on appeal, the government sought an injunction to stop the Portage clinic from operating in interstate commerce. After the government had presented its case in court, the Portage opposition collapsed. Haluska and his aides agreed to the injunction, promised to drop their appeal in the seizure case, and offered to withdraw a suit they had launched to stop further FDA investigations of their clinic. In October 1957 the FDA could issue a new release stating that the government had \"now been successful in all pending Federal court actions involving the 'cancer remedies' known as the Hoxsey treatment.\" [60]. The release, despite its announcement of victories, contained a somber note. \"The public should know . . .,\" the text read, \"that such actions will not end the menace of this treatment since the Federal Government does not have the power to stop a clinic in any State from treating cancer patients within that State with the nostrums which comprise the Hoxsey treatment. Millions of copies of false promotional literature are still in circulation; much of it reporting cures of persons who are now dead.\" [61] But Hoxsey's tide had turned. The Portage clinic closed shortly thereafter. At his home base the pressures mounted inexorably. Texas court actions revoked the licenses of Hoxsey's doctors and granted a permanent injunction to prevent his practicing medicine in Texas. Hoxsey then leased his clinic to another operator. Again the FDA moved in. The agency secured a supplemental consent decree of permanent injunction by which this operator promised to write all persons who had employed the Hoxsey treatment since 1957 that it could no longer be obtained. Since late 1960, therefore, except for a sporadic instance here and there about the country, the Hoxsey method of treating cancer at clinics has disappeared. Testimonials from patients claiming \"cures\" by the method, however, have continued to appear in the pages of health magazines, along with formulas for the Hoxsey medications and the addresses of herbalists who will supply the raw ingredients from which the medications may be made [62]. The decade of litigation against Hoxsey had cost the federal government perhaps a quarter of a million dollars [63] .This expensive victory did not provide a shield against any other wares than the clinic-prescribed brownish-black and pink tonics and the variously colored pills. While Hoxsey had been the largest unorthodox cancer promoter of the 1950's, he had had competitors. During the efforts to close the Portage clinic, a world-noted cancer authority, Dr. David A. Karnofsky, had addressed the American Cancer Society's Pennsylvania division [64]. Besides Hoxsey's treatment, he said, 13 other major promotions were available to Americans who feared they had cancer. In 1966 the American Cancer Society, issuing a catalogue of Unproven Methods of Cancer Treatment, came up with a list twice as long as Dr. Karnofsky's. While the scientific search went on, in public and private laboratories, for chemicals that might better aid in controlling cancer, the unscrupulous and misguided continued to tell Americans that the miraculous discovery had already occurred. Among the fearful and the desperate, these false prophets continued to find victims for their worthless wares.

The report features hidden-camera segments that expose what patients experience. JAMA publishes negative chelation therapy study. Dr. D. George Wyse and colleagues at the University of Calgary have found that cardiac patients receiving chelation therapy fared no better than those who received placebo treatment. The patients were randomly assigned to get intravenous infusions twice weekly for 15 weeks and monthly treatments for 12 more weeks. Thirty-nine patients in each group completed the 27-week protocol and were followed for about six more months. The chelation and placebo groups showed no difference in exercise capacity or feelings of well-being, but both groups increased their ability to walk on a treadmill by an average of one minute. [Knudson ML and others. [Chelation therapy for containing disodium EDTA and various other substances. Its proponents falsely claim that it is effective against kidney and heart disease, arthritis, Parkinson's disease, emphysema, multiple sclerosis, gangrene, psoriasis, and many other serious conditions. Chelation therapy with calcium EDTA is one of several legitimate methods for treating cases of lead poisoning, but [the protocol used by \"chelation therapists\" uses sodium EDTA and has no proven value](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/chelationfraud.html). Dr. Wyse's study was designed with help from members of the American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), which is the main proponent organization. In 1999, the Federal Trade Commission obtained a [consent decree](http://www.quackwatch.org/02ConsumerProtection/ftcchelation.html) barring ACAM from advertising that chelation is effective against cardiovascular disease or any other disease of the circulatory system. But the agreement permits ACAM members to continue to lie about its value. U.S. Preventive Services Task Force report update. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has begun publishing its third (2000-2002) edition. The original task force was created in 1984 to determine what types of periodic physical examinations, laboratory tests, immunizations, counseling, and other measures are science-based and cost-effective. The second task force was convened in 1990. Their efforts culminated in two editions (1989 and 1996) of the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services that reflected the views of public health officials and hundreds of other experts. The 1996 version, which covers interventions for more than 80 potentially preventable diseases and conditions, is available on the [USPSTF Web site](https://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstfix.htm) in PDF format and on [Columbia University's site](http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/texts/gcps/) in text format. Segments of the third edition will be published as they become available. The guidelines and checklists are intended primarily for use by physicians, but some will be easily understood by laypersons and some will be accompanied by summaries for patients. Massachusetts medical board opposes naturopathic licensing. The Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine has approved a [statement opposing licensure of naturopaths in Massachusetts](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/relman3.html). The statement, drafted by Arnold S. Relman, M.D., Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of the New England Journal of Medicine, says: - The safe practice of primary health care requires much more clinical education and experience than NDs have received when they begin independent practice. - Most of the so-called \"natural\" methods of treatment they claim as their special province are at best of little or no proven value, and sometimes even dangerous. The distinctive philosophy of naturopathic medicine and many of its methods of diagnosis and treatment are for the most part unscientific in concept, biologically improbable, and clinically unproven. As they are used in naturopathic practice they may delay the use of needed and more effective medical treatment and thus may be harmful. - Licensure probably will do little or nothing to protect the public from the risks stemming from the inadequate clinical education and unscientific practices of NDs or of other \"natural healers.\" [Dr. Relman has also written a critical analysis of the Textbook of Natural Medicine,](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/relman1.html) which appears to be the only comprehensive naturopathy textbook published in the United States during the past 20 years.

[Hide Full Content](#twenty-nine-thousand-seven) [Licensure of Naturopathic Physicians](https://quackwatch.org/related/naturopathy/relman3/) Naturopathic physicians are asking for licensure as independent practitioners of primary health care. They think their education adequately prepares them to act as physicians for ambulatory patients, who may have a broad range of medical complaints and concerns, of known and unknown cause and of all degrees of potential severity. They say they are different from primary care medical doctors, but claim they are just as qualified to provide good medical care for most of the patients who might otherwise initially consult an office-based primary care medical doctor (such as a family physician, a general internist or a general pediatrician). They say they also provide special kinds of \"natural\" treatment that primary care medical practitioners do not. They assert that these \"natural\" treatments not only ... Naturopathic physicians are asking for licensure as independent practitioners of primary health care. They think their education adequately prepares them to act as physicians for ambulatory patients, who may have a broad range of medical complaints and concerns, of known and unknown cause and of all degrees of potential severity. They say they are different from primary care medical doctors, but claim they are just as qualified to provide good medical care for most of the patients who might otherwise initially consult an office-based primary care medical doctor (such as a family physician, a general internist or a general pediatrician). They say they also provide special kinds of \"natural\" treatment that primary care medical practitioners do not. They assert that these \"natural\" treatments not only enhance the effectiveness of standard medical care, but offer unique health care benefits not available from mainstream medical practitioners. However, the Board of Registration in Medicine of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is skeptical about these claims. The Board believes that the granting of a license to naturopathic physicians for the independent practice of primary care medicine would in effect put Massachusetts citizens at extra and unnecessary risk for receiving substandard medical care and would add nothing of commensurate value to the health care already available in the Commonwealth. Here are the Board's reasons: 1. The safe practice of primary health care requires much more clinical education and experience than NDs have received when they begin independent practice. Naturopathic students who successfully complete four years of education in an approved college of naturopathy, and pass examinations after their second and fourth years of schooling, are deemed by the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians to be ready for independent practice as primary care physicians. However, the total time assigned to the clinical teaching of standard (or \"allopathic\") medicine in the last two years of naturopathy school is less than two-thirds of that provided in medical schools. (The remainder of the clinical instruction in the naturopathic curriculum is concerned with the special philosophy and therapeutic methods of naturopathy.) Furthermore, all clinical teaching in naturopathy schools is in the outpatient clinics and private offices associated with those schools. No teaching is in hospitals, and therefore naturopathic students are not likely to become familiar with the clinical manifestations of diseases serious enough to require hospital care. Lacking hospital experience, naturopathic students are inadequately prepared to recognize and treat the early manifestations of the serious illnesses that will occasionally occur among the ambulatory patients they see in their practice. They are also inadequately educated to deal with the acute problems sometimes unexpectedly encountered in the practice of primary care medicine. In contrast, medical students receive both outpatient and inpatient training in teaching hospitals during their four years of medical school. In addition, before they can be certified as fully trained primary care physicians they are required to have at least three more years of intensive clinical experience in an approved teaching hospital residency program, where they observe and learn to treat a wide variety of ambulatory and hospitalized patients with acute and chronic, mild and severe illnesses. Medical educators are universally agreed that students newly graduated from medical school would not be qualified to practice medicine independently. Yet naturopathy educators apparently believe the opposite about their graduates, because they ask states to license them straight out of naturopathy school. In Massachusetts, medical graduates can apply for a license after they have completed only one year of approved hospital training and have passed an approved licensing examination, but they would not be certified or given hospital privileges as a primary care physician unless they had completed a total of three years of postgraduate training in family practice, general internal medicine or general pediatrics. Currently, almost all MDs who practice primary care in this state have taken at least 3 years of residency training, and this additional clinical education makes them far better qualified professionally than naturopathic physicians. The competent care of patients who consult primary care practitioners requires physicians who can recognize illnesses in their early as well as late stages. Such physicians must have the judgment to know when a seemingly mild complaint is really the sign of a serious underlying illness that may need intensive medical treatment. It is not enough for naturopaths simply to say they will refer all serious problems to hospitals or to appropriate medical specialists. They need to be adequately trained to know when a patient ought to be referred, and that requires much more medical knowledge and clinical experience than naturopathic graduates have when they complete their required education and enter practice. They also need to know how to deal with the medical emergencies that can occur unexpectedly even in outpatient practice. Naturopathic physicians claim they can do these things, but their limited training raises serious doubts about whether the public can rely on that assurance. Of course, no physician is infallible, no matter how well trained. Mistakes in clinical judgment are inevitable and occur among all health professionals. But everything else being equal, better trained practitioners are less likely to make major mistakes. There is no current shortage of fully-trained primary care MDs in Massachusetts. Why, then, should we give independent responsibility for primary care to NDs, who have had much less clinical training than the MDs who are already licensed and certified as primary care specialists? In effect, we are being asked to lower the educational standards for the independent practice of ambulatory medicine, at a time when the need is for more, rather than less, training in this important area of health care. 2. The second reason the Board of Medicine opposes the licensure of naturopaths as primary care physicians is that most of the so-called \"natural\" methods of treatment they claim as their special province are at best of little or no proven value, and sometimes even dangerous. The distinctive philosophy of naturopathic medicine and many of its methods of diagnosis and treatment are for the most part unscientific in concept, biologically improbable, and clinically unproven. As they are used in naturopathic practice they may delay the use of needed and more effective medical treatment and thus may be harmful. (a) A basic tenet of naturopathy is that so-called \"natural\" treatments are preferable to drugs or surgery and should usually be tried first. Naturopathic practitioners have no experience with, and do not use, most of the tested and accepted pharmaceutical agents that are of proven value in the treatment of a wide variety of common but serious illnesses. They rely instead on unstandardized herbal preparations that have not been evaluated by the FDA for purity, safety or effectiveness, and whose use is not supported by rigorous clinical trials in the medical literature. Nevertheless, naturopaths claim that their education and their personal clinical experience with over-the-counter herbals enable them to use these preparations effectively and safely as an alternative to prescription pharmaceuticals. [My previously submitted critique of The Textbook of Natural Medicine]and Dr. Atwood's forthcoming report to the Commission explain why the medical profession and most medical scientists are skeptical about these claims and are concerned about the dangers of using untested and unstandardized herbals as if they were safe and established therapeutic agents. There is no reason to doubt that some herbal products now in use, and others that may be introduced in the future will be found to contain substances that will be of real therapeutic value, but the active agents will have to be identified, purified and tested in the same scientific manner as have the other naturally derived pharmaceuticals now in medical use. It ignores the advance of medical science, and it jeopardizes the health and safety of patients, when naturopathic practitioners rely on untested crude botanical preparations of unknown composition and purity, instead of tested and FDA-approved pharmaceuticals. By licensing naturopathic physicians, Massachusetts would in effect be endorsing this dangerous practice. Naturopaths claim they only prescribe the herbal preparations they believe to be safe and effective on the basis of their own clinical experience, but such personal opinions are not supported by published scientific evidence, and the herbal preparations are marketed without FDA regulation or any other public control. Independent scientific tests have shown such alarming variations in the purity and content of over-the-counter herbals that the public cannot be expected to trust the assurances of NDs any more than the advertising claims of the manufacturers themselves. (b) Other treatments routinely taught at the colleges of naturopathy and used in naturopathic practice include health counseling, therapeutic nutrition, homeopathy, Oriental medicine, hydrotherapy, Ayurvedic medicine and naturopathic manipulative therapy. Counseling and therapeutic nutrition are also taught in medical schools, because they generally have a sound basis in biological science. They were a part of regular medical teaching long before the current naturopathic colleges were even founded, although it is true that much responsibility for therapeutic nutrition has recently tended to be shifted to professional dietitians and nutritionists, who work in collaboration with physicians. The other modalities used by naturopaths are not taught in medical schools, because they are for the most part unscientific and unsupported by any credible body of clinical knowledge. Their use, along with other irrational and unsupported treatments such as chelation, magnetotherapy and colonic irrigation, is sometimes cited by naturopaths as evidence of the unique contributions of their profession. However, it is hard to understand why the Commonwealth would want to put its imprimatur on health care practices that defy well established scientific principles, and have no credible support in the medical literature. (c) Naturopaths counter these criticisms with claims that their unorthodox methods are in fact validated by a large \"scientific\" literature. Their Textbook of Natural Medicine and the material they have submitted to the Commission cite numerous published articles (over 10,000 in the Textbook) to buttress these claims. But as Dr. Atwood and I have pointed out elsewhere, these citations actually provide little or no scientific support for the clinical methods of naturopathy. Careful reading of the references suggests that they have been listed more for their impressive number than for their actual content or relevance. Most of the references have nothing to do with clinical practice, and virtually none describe clinical trials or case studies in the peer-reviewed literature. In short, despite naturopathy's claims to the contrary, and all its posturing about \"science\", almost none of its special therapeutic practices are \"evidence-based\", or even biologically plausible. Naturopaths often respond to this last criticism with their own charge that most clinical practices used in conventional medicine aren't \"evidence-based\" either. However, medical practice is far more strongly supported by science and empirical evidence than naturopathy. It is true that the validity of much of medical practice has not yet been established beyond reasonable doubt by randomized, controlled clinical trials, but most current practice has at least some empirical support in the peer-reviewed literature and almost all has biologically-based plausibility. The pharmaceutical agents used by medical physicians have been clinically tested and are approved by the FDA. As new knowledge accumulates, medical therapeutics constantly improves and evolves. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of naturopathic clinical practices, many of which are based on ancient theories about the nature of health and disease, which have not changed over the years, and almost none of which have been critically tested or even documented in the medical literature. 3. The third and final reason the Board of Medicine opposes the licensure of naturopathic physicians as independent primary care practitioners is that licensure probably will do little or nothing to protect the public from the risks stemming from the inadequate clinical education and unscientific practices of NDs or of other \"natural healers.\" Judging from the laws and regulations governing their licensure in some other states, naturopathic physicians would, if licensed as independent primary care practitioners, regulate themselves and set their own standards of professional performance. That would not remedy the problems already discussed. Instead, it would in effect place the Commonwealth's approval on naturopathy as a legitimate alternative to primary medical care. It would imply that patients could safely consult naturopathic physicians, instead of medical doctors, as a source of ambulatory medical care. And yet most would agree, even the naturopaths themselves, that naturopathic practitioners are not qualified to handle the full range of medical care problems, a primary care physician is likely to see. In recognizing that certain types of medical problems, even in ambulatory patients, need the care of medical doctors, the naturopathic practitioners are virtually acknowledging that they are not sufficiently educated to practice primary care medicine totally independently. Their assertion that they would refer all medical problems that are beyond their expertise to regular physicians is not reassuring, because naturopaths lacking experience may not always know when they are dealing with such problems, or may only realize it too late. In theory, licensure of naturopaths, with appropriate limitations on the scope and independence of their practice, might answer some of these concerns. For example, nurse practitioners and physicians' assistants who, like naturopathic physicians, have substantially less than the full clinical training of a certified primary care physician, are required in Massachusetts to practice primary care under the supervision of a physician. A similar restriction on naturopathic practice might in principle address the problems related to the limited clinical training of NDs. It would not, however, deal with the fundamental incompatibility between many of the to special\" methods of naturopathy and the standards of scientific, evidence-based medicine. In any case, it is not likely that the naturopathic physicians would accept such a limitation on their independence. Thus, we believe the legislature will have to decide whether to license NDs as independent primary care practitioners (albeit with certain restrictions on scope of practice, such as limited prescribing authority and no major surgery) or not to license them at all. For all the reasons already advanced, we believe the latter choice is the only one consistent with public welfare and safety. Finally, the Board wishes to mention an argument often advanced by the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, i.e., that licensure of naturopathic practitioners who have earned the ND degree after graduation from a four-year college of naturopathic medicine would enable the public to distinguish such graduates from all the other \"natural healers\" who do not have similar educational qualifications and \u2014 according to the NDs \u2014 are therefore less qualified to provide \"natural medicine\". The other practitioners include a wide variety of healers who employ many of the same therapeutic modalities as the NDs, but usually limit their practice to one or more of these modalities and do not hold themselves out as primary care general physicians. Their education is highly variable in length and quality. A national organization known as the Coalition for Natural Health claims to represent about 2,500 of these \"natural healers\" nationwide. They oppose licensure of NDs because they believe the terms of such licensure usually restrict their freedom to practice. The Board takes no position in this debate between the Coalition for Natural Health and the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, but it would simply observe that licensure of NDs would not per se eliminate less educated \"healers\". They could be prevented from holding themselves out as \"naturopaths\" or \"naturopathic physicians\", but not from offering their services to anyone willing to pay for them. The problem of unlicensed \"healers\" has been with us for a long time and is not likely to disappear soon. In Summary: The Board of Medicine does not believe that NDs are qualified to be independent primary care physicians. Licensing them as such \u2014 even within a defined scope of practice \u2014 will add nothing of value to our existing health care system. It would instead lower the standards of health care and needlessly expose the public to the inevitable risks of inferior medical service. ____________________ Dr. Relman is Emeritus Professor of Medicine and of Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School; Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of The New England Journal of Medicine; and a member of the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine (BORM).

High vitamin A intake may increase hip fracture risk. An analysis of data from the Nurses' Health Study has found that the risk of nontraumatic osteoporotic hip fracture was significantly higher among women who had the highest total vitamin A intake compared with women with the lowest vitamin A intake. [Feskanich D and others. Vitamin A intake and hip fractures among postmenopausal women. JAMA 287:47-54, 2002] The increase was attributable to dietary intake of retinol (preformed vitamin A) rather than beta-carotene (which the body converts into vitamin A). The data were derived from a total of 72,337 women aged 34 to 77 years who were followed for up to 18 years. The authors concluded that \"long-term intake of a diet high in retinol may promote the development of osteoporotic hip fractures on women\" and that \"the amounts of retinol in fortified foods and vitamin supplements may need to be reassessed since these add significantly to total retinol consumption in the United States.\" The most significant food sources of retinol in the United States are animal liver, milk, butter, margarine, fortified breakfast cereals, and meal-replacement beverages. An accompanying editorial stated that the study's findings \"question whether women represented by this study cohort\u2014white US women of high socioeconomic status\u2014should avoid supplements containing retinol if their diet is rich in low saturated fat, low-trans margarine. low-fat dairy products, and fruits and vegetables. Other populations with diets less rich in vitamin A will require further study to avoid confronting . . . vitamin deficiency.\" [Denke JAMA 287:102-103, 2002] Naturopathy debunked on Quackwatch. Naturopaths claim to stimulate the body's natural healing processes by ridding it of waste products and \"toxins.\" Their practices combine commonsense health and nutrition measures and rational use of a few herbs with a huge variety of unscientific practices. Naturopaths are licensed as independent practitioners in eleven states and the District of Columbia and can legally practice in a few others. Those who have attended on-campus schools are pressing for licensure in the remaining states. [Quackwatch has posted several reports](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Naturopathy/index.html) to help legislators and prospective patients understand what naturopaths do. FTC zaps \"Zapper\" sellers. Marvin and Miguelina Beckwith, of Blaine, Washington, have been enjoined from making unbsubstantiated claims for any of their products. Doing business as Western Dietary Products, Inc., they had claimed that their \"Zapper Electrical Unit\" is effective against Alzheimer's, and HIV/AIDS and that various herbal products can treat and cure cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, arthritis, and HIV/AIDS [ [FTC prohibits marketers of herbal products and the \"Zapper\" from making unsubstantiated claims](https://www.ftc.gov/opa/2001/12/westdiet.htm). FTC News Release, Dec 28, 2001] The Beckwiths based the disputed claims on the theories of Hulda Regehr Clark, an unlicensed naturopath who claims she can cure these diseases, sometimes within a few hours. The government's case was supported by three lengthy affidavits that thoroughly debunked Clark's theories and treatments. Although she was not a party to this action, it might discourage others from marketing what she recommends. [Detailed information about Clark is posted on Quackwatch](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/clark.html). ACS Web site attacks questionable therapies. The [American Cancer Society Web site](http://www.cancer.org/eprise/main/docroot/eto/eto_5?sitearea=ETO) has greatly expanded and improved the quality of its information on \"complementary and alternative therapies.\" Most of the new information comes from the [American Cancer Society's Guide to Complementary and Alternative Methods](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0944235247/quackwatch-20), which was published in 2000. More than 100 methods are discussed. FDA asks doctors to report kava-related liver toxicity. On December 19, the The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a [letter asking doctors to review their cases of liver toxicity](http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/SAFETY/2001/kava.htm) to determine whether any may be related to the use of kava-containing herbal products and to report such cases to MedWatch. The request was made because products containing extracts of kava have been implicated in Europe in at least 25 cases of serious liver toxicity, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver failure. In addition, the FDA has received several reports of serious injury allegedly associated with the use of kava-containing products, with at least one report of liver failure requiring liver transplantation in a previously healthy young woman. Health care costs rising sharply. The Center for Studying Health System Change has concluded that health-care costs rose sharply in 2000, the largest increase in a decade. Despite the recent focus on increased spending for prescription drugs, the upward trend was largely attributable to rising hospital spending. The likely causes for are the retreat from tightly managed care (which may have raised the level of use of hospital services), increased leverage on the part of hospitals to demand higher payments from insurers, and labor shortages. Total health care costs in 2000 rose 7.2%, with inpatient and outpatient care accounting for 47% of the increase. Prescription drug spending, while still high, dropped to a 14.5% increase in 2000, down from an 18.4% increase in 1999. Spending for physician services decreased from 5.7% in 1999 to 4.8% in 2000. If these trends continue, in light of a slowing economy and shrinking corporate profits, employers could respond by raising their employees' out-of-pocket costs, and the number of uninsured persons could grow.
