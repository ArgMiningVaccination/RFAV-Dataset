The Proposed Budget closes a $72.2 million funding gap through a deliberate and public process, and reflects the invaluable input provided by your Board, agency and department heads, the Budget Workgroup and other County stakeholders. Alameda County's financial status has benefitted from the robust growth in the national and local economies. The County's March 2016 unemployment rate of 4.3% is less than half of what it was in early 2012. Most major industries have added jobs over the past year including private education, health services, as well as the trade, transportation and utility -related industries. While there is some slight evidence of wage growth for working -class individuals, income growth for most people beyond the very wealthy, has remained flat or declined for decades. Recognizing that economic development relies on wage growth, policy makers have begun to address income stagnation through modest increases to t he minimum wage, changes in overtime rules and extending an earned income tax credit for wage earners in California. The rise in real estate values led to a 7.1% increase in the FY 2015 -2016 assessment roll, resulting in much -needed general purpose rev enues for the County. However, higher home values and rents reduce the stock of affordable housing, placing additional strain on those who are paying a larger share of their lower incomes for housing costs. The County continues its efforts to document those most affected by economic disparities and cumulative State budget reductions. These \"human impacts\" are again included in a special section of the Proposed Budget. COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR Honorable Board of Supervisors -2- June 9, 2016 ii STATE BUDGET As stated by the Legislative Analyst's Office, the State of California 's budget is better prepared for an economic downturn than it has been at any time in decades. The May Revision of Governor Brown's FY 2016 -2017 budget proposes total discretionary reserves of $8.5 billion and $6.7 billion in the \"Rainy Day\" fund. These reserves together represent the equivalent of 45 days of working capital. However, caution is warranted based on a recent Moody's fiscal \"stress -test,\" that rated California the least prepared of the four most populous states to weather a potential rece ssion in the next two years. The financial ratings firm noted California has much higher revenue volatility, less financial flexibility and lower reserve levels than does Texas, New York or Florida. Further, the seventh year of recovery has begun to show some signs of economic weakness, which may cause those same General Fund revenues to experience slow or even negative growth in the next three to five -year period. State General Fund revenues particularly personal income tax collections are now projected to be $1.9 billion less than the Governor had estimated in January. It is important to recognize that personal income taxes comprise 70.2% of the three largest revenue sources to the State's General Fund. Given the Governor's commitment to budgetary pru dence and restraint, very few proposals for new spending are found in the FY 2016 -2017 budget submitted in January or in his May Revision. However, there are a few proposed appropriation increases and several examples of repurposing existing revenues for new statewide policy priorities, including: An additional $169 million for Medi -Cal administration costs associated with implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA); Lump sum payments to counties of $177 million for truing up health care realignment revenue after implementation of the ACA as directed by Assembly Bill 85; The first cost -of-living adjustment (COLA) in a decade for SSI/SSP recipients; A State Senate prop osal to issue bonds for affordable housing using a portion of future Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) revenues; $100 million of carbon \"cap and trade\" revenues for local climate action proposals; and Increased funding of $55 million for the Continuum of C are reform efforts. COUNTY BUDGET OVERVIEW The FY 2016 -2017 Proposed Budget for all funds totals $2.83 billion, an increase of $88.8 million or 3.24% from the FY 2015 -2016 Final Budget. The General Fund, which supports most County operations, totals a lmost $2.55 billion, an increase of $117.9 million, or 4.86%. Honorable Board of Supervisors -3- June 9, 2016 iii All Funds ($ in millions) 2015 -2016 Final 2016 -2017 MOE 2016 -2017 Proposed Change 2015 -2016 Final 2016 -2017 MOE 2016 -2017 Proposed Change 1.32 The Proposed Budget includes funding to provide mandated and essential services, meet debt service obligations, maintain a status quo level of infrastructure and capital funding, and adhere to the Board's financial management policies. Funding is recommen ded to support a workforce of over 9,634 full -time equivalent (FTE) positions and reflects a net increase of only 34 FTE, all of which were approved by your Board mid -year and are fully offset with new revenue. The Proposed Budget funds cost -of-living ad justments (COLAs) for most of our employees based on negotiated labor agreements, and for many of our community -based organizations (CBOs). The Proposed Budget includes $500.8 million for services provided by 243 CBOs, an increase of $24.0 million from FY 2015 -2016. This includes $80.1 million for services provided by the Alameda Health System (AHS). Other CBOs funded in the Proposed Budget include non-profit service providers, cities, school districts, and local hospitals. A list of all CBO contracts w ith funding recommendations is included in the Appendix of the Proposed Budget document. Measure A, the voter -approved half -cent sales tax for essential health care services, which was reauthorized through 2034 by over 75% of voters on June 3, 2014 as Mea sure AA, continues to provide over $125 million a year in crucial funding for health services. AHS receives 75% of the revenue directly and the remaining 25% is allocated by the Board of Supervisors to support other essential health services. The Proposed Budget includes only $31.5 million in Measure A funds for non -AHS essential health services as per the three -year Measure A spending plan adopted by your Board in December 2015. While this represents an increase of approximately $2.0 million, or 7.0%, co mpared to the FY 2015 -2016 Final Budget, it is $2.5 million less than the current year projected receipts of $34.0 million . Consistent with your Board's financial management policies, the Proposed Budget recommends designating $6.3 million \u2014the equivalent of 1% of discretionary revenue \u2014for both capital projects and the general reserve. Contingencies for pending labor negotiatio ns, benefit cost increases, and other contractual obligations are also included in the Proposed Budget. Honorable Board of Supervisors -4- June 9, 2016 iv CLOSING THE GAP The Proposed Budget closes a funding gap of approximately $72.2 million that was projected based on the Maintenance of Effort (MOE) funding requirement. The funding gap was determined by identifying the difference between the cost of maintaining existing programs and projected revenues. The MOE Budget for the General Fund was just over $2.55 billion, an increase of $123.4 million or 5.1%. Available revenues to finance the projected MOE costs totaled about $2.48 billion, an increase of just $50.4 million, or 2.1%. Your Board's Values -Based Budgeting (VBB) priorities and Strategic Vision initiatives were considered in developing balancing strategies within each program area. The table below summarizes the total proposed net cost reductions by program are a: PROPOSED BUDGET BALANCING General Fund Program Area Net County Cost Reductions ($ millions) General Government $16.9 Health Care 17.6 Public Assistance 7.3 Public Protection 18.4 Countywide Strategies 12.0 Total $72.2 Proposed solutions to close the $72.2 million funding gap included a combination of spending reductions, revenue increases, and one -time strategies. The $12.0 million in countywide strategies includes updated projections of property, sal es, and aircraft taxes; one -time property tax penalties; and a reduction in risk management charges to departments. The Proposed Budget recommends the use of $30.8 million or 43% in ongoing strategies and $41.4 million or 57% in one -time strategies, with most of the one -time savings coming from the Fiscal Management Reward Program (FMR). The FMR net savings have been generated through the efforts of County agencies/departments to operate their programs well within budget, mitigate future funding cuts and maintain the continuity of services. FMR is considered a one - time funding source as these savings may not be available to assist with balancing budgets in future years. A structural imbalance between ongoing revenues and expenditures remains, largely due to the State's ongoing shift of property taxes from local governments. Honorable Board of Supervisors -5- June 9, 2016 v Proposed Budget Balancing Strategies Net County Cost Reductions ($ millions) Ongoing Strategies Program appropriation reductions $3.4 Program revenue increases 27.4 Subtotal Ongoing Strategies $30.8 One-Time Strategies Fiscal Management Reward (FMR) Savings $28.6 One-time appropriation reductions 2.1 One-time revenues 10.7 Subtotal One -Time Strategies $41.4 Grand Total Balancing Strategies $72.2 PROGRAM AREA NET COS T REDUCTIONS AND FUN DING CONCERNS General Government - The General Government program area contributed net cost savings of $16.9 million through $0.2 million in spending reductions, $0.8 million in increased revenue, and $15.9 million in FMR savings. In July 2014, your Board's policy to allocate $90.0 milli on of former redevelopment agency (RDA) tax increment funds over five years to fund \"Tier 1\" capital projects in the unincorporated areas was amended to align expenditures with slower -than-anticipated receipt of former RDA property tax revenues. However, the completion of \"Tier 1\" projects could be further delayed if tax receipts do not keep pace with project plans, project cost increases and timelines. Additionally, there will be $5.0 million less available per year for \"Tier 1\" capital projects based on your Board's December 2015 decision to allocate the first $5.0 - $7.5 million of property tax revenues based on prior year receipts, toward affordable housing programs starting in FY 2016 - 2017. Housing has emerged as a key area of concern for County res idents. Reductions in federal housing funding such as the HOME Investment Partnerships Program and the Community Development Block Grant result in less funding available for the County to meet community needs and to cover the administrative costs of compli ance monitoring. Your Board has continued to respond to these challenges by investing over $100 million annually in housing programs across various agencies and departments. In addition, your Board has also committed the aforementioned $5.0 - $7.5 million per year of limited discretionary funding towards affordable housing programs across the County. Another significant funding concern is the State Board of Equalization's decision to lower the excise tax rate for gasoline for the third year in a row. Effe ctive July 1, 2016, the excise tax rate will be $0.022 lower, following reductions of $0.06 and $0.035 in FY 2014 -2015 and FY 2015 - 2016, respectively. Lower excise tax revenues may jeopardize the Public Works Agency's Honorable Board of Supervisors -6- June 9, 2016 vi ability to complete a variety of traf fic and pedestrian safety projects in the unincorporated areas. The Public Works Agency estimates that reduced excise taxes may result in a $6.0 - $10.0 million loss of critical transportation infrastructure funding. Health Care - The Health Care Servic es Agency contributed net cost savings of $17.6 million through $0.7 million in appropriation reductions, $4.8 million in increased revenue, and $12.2 million in FMR savings. The spending reductions included savings of $0.3 million from the elimination of 1.92 vacant, funded positions and a $0.5 million reduction in medical expenses and discretionary services all in the Public Health department. Revenue increases include the use of $1.7 million in one -time Tobacco Master Settlement funds, $0.5 million in Medi -Cal revenue, $1.0 million from growth in 1991 realignment, $0.1 million in Household Hazardous Waste revenue, and the allocation of an additional $1.5 million in Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) funding. The County continues to have concerns about M edi-Cal reimbursement rates not covering the cost of care for our safety net health providers. This adversely affects the entire health care network and constrains the ability of providers to invest in their systems. The Public Health department continu es to experience a decline in federal funding for Nutrition and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) programs. County general funds of $1.2 million have been included in the Proposed Budget to maintain these programs at the current service levels. In Behavioral Health, the potential diversion of future MHSA funds to finance a statewide housing bond may impact funding available to support services to the severely mentally ill. While statewide associations are pushing for counties to remain whole (i.e. receive a proportional share of bond proceeds to the MHSA revenue they may lose), this is not guaranteed. In Environmental Health, a statewide shortage of qualified inspectors has slowed hiring, resulting in lower fee revenue collections. Public Assistan ce - The Public Assistance program area achieved net cost savings of $7.3 million through revenue increases including a $4.0 million adjustment from the CalWORKs Single Allocation redistribution, $1.2 million in CalFresh Match Waiver close -out, and $2.1 million from prior years' close -out of multiple social service programs. Given that the Medi -Cal caseload in Alameda County has increased nearly 90% since January 2014, additional Medi -Cal administrative funding is needed to meet increased workloads and maintain case management standards. In addition to the underfunding of Medi -Cal, federal and State base funding for older adults programming has remained relatively flat in the past decade despite the rapid growth in the senior population. Though the May Revision includes the first cost -of-living adjustment (COLA) to the State Supplementary Payment (SSP) in a decade, the COLA falls substantially short of reversing the impact of deep cuts to SSI/SSP made to help close budget shortfalls during the Great Recession. These cuts have compromised the ability of low -income California seniors and people with disabilities to afford basic needs such as housing and food, and are exacerbated by ineligibility for food programs. Honorable Board of Supervisors -7- June 9, 2016 vii Public Protection - The P ublic Protection program area achieved net cost savings of $18.4 million through $3.2 million in appropriation reductions, $14.6 million in revenue increases, and $0.6 million of FMR savings. Appropriation reductions include decreased discretionary operat ing expenses in the Sheriff's Office of $2.7 million and $0.6 million in indigent defense contract costs. Public Protection revenue adjustments totaled $14.6 million including increases in the Sheriff's negotiated contracts and Utility User's Tax receipts ($5.5 million overall); District Attorney's revenue from fines and forfeitures ($3.0 million); additional juvenile justice funding for Probation programs ($3.4 million); and the Public Defender's case management revenue ($0.2 million). FMR savings contri buted by the Public Defender and Probation department further reduced the net cost of this program area. If Governor Brown's Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016 appears on the November 2016 ballot and is enacted by voters, State inmates convicte d of non -violent felony offenses who have completed the full sentence of their primary offense will be eligible for parole. Parolees would then be released to Post Release Community Supervision (PRCS), which would be administered by the counties. Althoug h the goal is to reduce the prison population and spending at the State level, it is unknown if additional funding will be made available for counties to support this new Probation population. While the State formula for the distribution of AB 109 Public Safety Realignment funding has been established, it is still unknown whether the County's FY 2016 -2017 base allocation will be sufficient to fund the cost of Public Safety program responsibilities realigned by the State. Furthermore, the allocation of future growth will be dependent on the development of statewide performance metrics. Trial Court Funding revenue continues to decline due to the State's revised methodology that reallocates fines and forfeiture revenues to other jurisdictions. This revenue reduction results in a significant increase in County General Fund support to meet our mandated Trial Court Funding commitments. The County may also incur increased security -related costs for the new East County Courthouse in Dublin unless additio nal funding is guaranteed from the State. FISCAL MANAGEMENT RE WARD (FMR) SAVINGS Your Board's FMR Program allows General Fund departments to carry over net savings each fiscal year to be used in subsequent years for budget balancing, one -time expenditur es and/or program enhancements. Through ongoing cost -saving and revenue generation efforts, County agencies/departments contributed $28.7 million in prior -year FMR savings to help balance the FY 2016 -2017 budget. Honorable Board of Supervisors -8- June 9, 2016 viii Program Area Use of FMR ($ millions) General Government $15.9 Health Care 12.2 Public Assistance 0.0 Public Protection 0.6 Total FMR $28.7 Ongoing efforts by agencies and departments to reduce spending and conserve resources have enabled the County to mitigate major program reductions and maintain vital services. However, departments must continue to balance these efforts with the need to fund increased costs and meet the growing demand for essential services in all program areas. UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS While your Board has adhered to your long -standing financial management policies, which include strategies and guidelines to build and maintain prudent reserves, the County has unfunded obligations that must be considered. At the close of FY 2014 -2015, the County estimated it s long -term unfunded obligations were approximately $2.79 billion or about $100.1 million more than the close of the prior year. Pension costs for current and future retirees account for $1.4 billion of the total unfunded liabilities. In addition, to dat e the County has issued debt of $607.0 million related to construction of the Acute Care Tower Replacement project for the Alameda Health System (AHS) and has remaining pension obligation bond debt of approximately $300.0 million. Other outstanding debt i ncludes the County's shared ownership of the Coliseum/Arena and other prior capital commitments for essential facilities like the Juvenile Justice Facility and Santa Rita Jail. The updated five -year Capital Improvement Plan identifies over $200 million of unfunded capital projects and deferred major maintenance on County -owned properties that, if not addressed, will increase dramatically as buildings and infrastructure continue to age. The debt incurred by the County for capital improvements was based on responsible financial plans that identified revenue sources to retire the debt over time and ensure that the County was also able to maintain its core services and other mandated commitments. The Proposed Budget includes funds for annual debt service pay ments and the County's annual required contributions to the pension fund through the Alameda County Employees' Retirement Association (ACERA). In addition, in response to your Board's directive that the County Administrator and Auditor - Controller consider options to reduce the County's unfunded pension liability using existing designations and reserves, your Board has authorized transfers totaling $400.0 million into a new designation to help reduce the County's portion of the unfunded pension liability. Further, your Board has committed to designate up to $100 million more in each of the next four years. Paying down future liabilities will reduce annual principal payments and interest, and will ultimately improve the County's ability to plan for and inve st in future projects and initiatives while maintaining strong credit ratings. Honorable Board of Supervisors -9- June 9, 2016 ix PENDING FACTORS Although the economy continues to improve, ensuring adequate and stable long -term funding for County programs and services remains a challenge. Given the length of the current economic recovery, there are concerns that sales tax and vehicle license fee -based revenues may not be sufficient in the short to intermediate -term to fund fully the cost of program responsibilities transferred by the State to counties in health care, public assistance and now public safety. Our growing reliance on federal and State f unding bears careful monitoring given the specter of election -driven policy changes and fiscal challenges that could result in funding cuts or further shifts of program responsibilities to counties without adequate financial resources. Alameda County residents rely on many important County -provided health, public safety and economic assistance services to, in the words of the County's mission statement, \"enrich their lives.\" Long -term financial issues such as the increased costs of healt h care, employee salary and benefit costs, and economically -sensitive revenue sources will continue to challenge our limited discretionary resources. Careful assessment of existing services, diligent review of proposed services and strategic decisions abou t the use of available financial resources will be vitally important over the next few years to focus on effective and efficient service delivery and long - term financial stability. A healthy economy, in the seventh year of a recovery, has reduced unemplo yment, spurred automobile sales and increased home values. Even now, Alameda County continues to experience a structural deficit where ongoing expenses are greater than ongoing revenues. Moreover, while we have been able to contribute regularly to reserv e funds, a dip in the economy that reduces property values and taxes and sales tax revenue will quickly increase the size of future budget gaps. Unfortunately, that decline in the economy and vital discretionary revenue is now closer than ever. Attention will be required to identify solutions to the structural deficit and address the increasing amount of unfunded capital projects and deferred major maintenance needs. These and other key issues may require policy decisions by your Board to guide departmen ts on effectively managing future operating cost increases in coordination with development of sustainable revenue sources. RECOMMENDATIONS County stakeholders have balanced the FY 2016 -2017 Proposed Budget through a collective effort to develop a susta inable approach to providing services in the coming year. In addition, balancing the FY 2016 -2017 Proposed Budget using a significant amount of one -time funds will necessitate careful monitoring throughout the year to ensure that expenditures remain withi n budget and estimated revenue is fully realized. As you conduct public hearings and deliberate on the FY 2016 -2017 Proposed Budget, your Board's leadership and strong fiscal management will assist the County in maintaining that critical balance between service demands and limited financial resources. Honorable Board of Supervisors -10- June 9, 2016 x Therefore, it is recommended that your Board: 1. Accept the FY 2016 -2017 Proposed Budget for review pending public hearings; 2. Set public hearings on the Proposed Budget to commence on Wednesday, June 22, 2016, at 1:00 p.m. as outlined in the Attachment; and 3. Schedule public hearings and/or public meetings to consider charges for the Emergency Medical Services District, Fire Department Emergency Medical Services, Flood Control District, and Clean Water Prot ection as detailed in the attached budget hearing schedule.

The County's almost 821 square miles encompass a varied geog raphy ranging from bay wetlands to rolling open spaces to hillside lake s and streams. Alameda is the seventh most populous county in California, and has 14 incorporated cities and several unincorporated communities. The total population is estimated to be 1,627,865 as of January 2016 , a 2% increase from a year ago. Oakland is the seat of County government and the largest city. Source: California Department of Finance, May 2016 Alameda County is characterized by rich diversity and culture. Population growth has occurred with the natural net increase of births over deaths, but also from substantial immigration, and Alameda County is now one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the Bay Area and the nation. Based on the 2010 Census, 31% of the population is foreign born. There is no majority racial or ethnic group in Alameda County. According to the California Department of Education, 67 languages were spoken by English lang uage learners in the K -12 public school systems in Alameda County in 2015 -2016.

The unemp loyment rate has dropped to 4.3% in Alameda County as of March 2016, which is about half of what it was four years ago, and better than California's 5.6% rate and the 5.0 % rate for the nation . However, many labor experts contend the drop is at least partl y attributable to people dropping out of the labor force as they give up looking for work or those who have had to settle for part -time jobs.

Listed below are t he VBB priorities established by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors . The purpose of these priorities is to protect the populations or services noted , in the order of priority listed below. The tables on the following pages detail budget adjustments that hav e been made to close the 201 6-17 budget gap and achieve a balanced budget. These adjustments are a combination of appropriation reductions and revenue increase s. In order to encourage prudent fiscal management, the County has a Fiscal Management Rewards program whereby agencies and departments can save unspent County General Fund and use it in the future as a one -time budget balancing solution or to fund one -time projects. In Fiscal Year 2016 -17, the total net VBB reduction target is $72.23 million . 1 Vulnerable populations such as infants, children, young mothers and families, frail elderly and disabled persons who require food, clothing, shelter, and health care. 2 Public safety for all residents of Alameda County through prevention and control of crime and the effective prosecution of criminals, including incarceration and alternatives to incarceration. 3 Control of drug abuse by means of education, prevention, treatment and criminal prosecution. 4 Deliberate budget measures to promote prevention as a corollary to service in addition to a focus on treatment and control. 5 Assurance that essential support services are budgeted whenever priority programs are funded. 6 Encourage and reward programs and services which promise more efficient and effective ways of del ivering essential County services. 7 Assure that the minimal level of mandated services will be provided. 22 FY 2016 -17 PROPOSED BUDGET VALUES -BASED BUDGETING ADJUSTMENTS SUMMARY ($ in millions) FTE Reductions Program VBB Reduction Fiscal Mgmt.

The Children's Services Budget highlights how the resources of the County are allocated for services that protect and promote the we ll-being of children and demonstrates the County's commitment to children. Appropriations and revenues for children's services are budgeted in many County agencies and departments. Each County agency and department carefully analyzes its total budget to i dentify the dollars appropriated for children's services to produce the Children's Services Budget. ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ _________________ A NOTE ON THE CHILDREN'S MEMORIAL COMMITTEE In an annual public ceremony, the Alameda County Children's Memorial Project remembers child victims of violence by installing a permanent plaque with the names of the children who died the previous year, and reading aloud the names of all children who have died by violence in the County in the past decade. County programs work to promote the well -being of children and prevent child abuse, reduce youth violence, provide mental health services, and raise public awareness to help reduce these rates. ____________________ ____________________ ______________________ _______________ FINANCIAL SUMMARIES Budget Overview The tables below show the financial summaries for Fiscal Year 2016 -17 compared to the previous Fiscal Year and the percentage of the total Alameda County budget that constitutes spendi ng for children's programs. Children's Services 2015 -16 Budget Maintenance Of Effort Change from MOE VBB % 2017 Budget Change from 2015 -16 Budget Amount % Appropriations 709,994,033 Year 2016 -17 Children's Services Budget reflects a $17,005,180 increase in spending and a $3,300,729 reduction in revenue compared to the prior year. The increase in spending is primarily driven by Public Assistance and Health Care. Of the incr ease in Public Assistance spending, the bulk is due to higher spending on foster care under the Title IV -E waiver. The higher Health Care spending is driven by increases in Behavioral Health Care special education programs and Administration & Indigent Health increases in HealthPAC contracts. The reduction in revenue is driven by lower program revenue in Health Care. The decrease in Health Care revenue is concentrated in Public Health and is primarily due to funding cuts for Nutrition and ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGR AM SUMMARY CHILDREN'S SERVICES 43 Children's Service s Medical Therapy programs. While Public Assistance shows a year -on-year revenue increase due to higher program spending, non -Title IV -E waiver revenue is lower than last year as the Social Services Agency received one -time additional State revenue due to the rollover of savings from the previous Title IV -E waiver project. Due to the higher year -on-year spending and lower year -on-year revenue, the County will contribute an additional $20,305,909 in funding for Children's programs in Fiscal Year 2016 -17 ver sus the prior Fiscal Year. The programs with the largest increase in County General Fund contribution are Foster Care, HealthPAC, Juvenile Hall and preventative health programs.

Source: Alameda County Social Services Agency From 2006 to 2012, under the Title IV -E waiver, there was a significant reduction in children placed in Out-of-Home Foster care. Since 2012, the number of children in Out -of-Home Foster care and the number of children receiving In -Home Services stabilized. California is now implementing Continuum of Care Re form (CCR) which is a series of changes to foster care programs with the result of improving outcomes for foster care youth. CCR focuses on decreasing Out -of-Home placements and increasing opportunities for permanency through a number of reforms. Title I V-E waiver investments have given the County a strong foundation to implement CCR, but for this reform to be successful a clear commitment of State resources to address initial implementation costs is needed.

It is compiled from data provided by Cou nty Agencies and Departments and is a complex and careful extrapolation of the portion of an Agency or Department's total budget that is for children's services. The County does not maintain a separate budget for children's services. The Children's Serv ices Budget includes services that directly benefit children, such as child and youth health services, child welfare and juvenile justice services, as well as services provided to parents or families on behalf of, or because of, the presence of a child, su ch as CalWORKs grants, child care, and child support services. A child is defined for the majority of services, as being age 0 -17 years (that is, up to the eighteenth birthday). However, services provided to youth over the age of 18 (for example, for you th emancipating from foster care) are also included in the Children's Budget. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY CHILDREN'S SERVICES 77 Administrative costs of services, such as support staff, operating costs, etc., are not identified in this report. Mandatory versus discretionary A mandatory service is defined as a service or program that is required to be provided by law. Such services are frequently, although not always, funded by the federal and/or State government, and usually require matching County funding. A discretionary service is a service that is not required to be provided by law . Discretionary services may be funded entirely by the County or by a combination of sources including federal, State, or other sources. Not included in the Children's Services Budget are al locations of universal expenditures that benefit all citizens uniformly , such as, environmental protection or countywide law enforcement services. Also excluded are parts of programs such as CalWORKs fraud prevention, job training, or substance abuse, dom estic violence and mental health programs that are provided for the adults in the programs. Budget versus actual spending is reported and readers should note that the amount appropriated for a program or service may differ from what is ultimately spent in the Fiscal Year. State funding in this document includes State general fund as well as 1991 and 2011 realignment revenue.

ALAMEDA COUNTY DEPARTMENT SUMMARY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS 117 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The Board of Supervisors is the governing body of Alameda County and also serves as the governing board of the Flood Control and Water Conservation District, Alameda County Fire Department, and a number of other public entities. In addition, Board members serve on pol icy boards of regional and district organizations. Roles and Responsibilities The Board of Supervisors sets policy for County government, subject to a variety of changing demands and expectations. Each Board member shares a responsibility to represent the County as a whole, while representing a specific district from which he or she is elected. Fiscal Responsibilities The Board of Supervisors is responsible for helping to develop, adopt and oversee the County budget, balancing expenses against revenues and reflecting mandated obligations as well as locally -identified priorities. As a primary management tool, the budget serves as a reflection of values and is subject to adjustment as conditions warrant and collective policy decisions dictate. Management Res ponsibilities A fundamental responsibility of each Supervisor is participation in the development and, from time to time, modification of policy. While a myriad of factors and forces influence the legislative process, key resources for advice and counsel are available from the County Agency/Department Heads who possess professional knowledge and procedural skill in evaluating policy options. An extension of this key function is the oversight of County operations to assure that policy, once adopted, is ful ly and appropriately carried out by the Department Heads, in collaboration with the County Administrator. By working with Agency/Department Heads, both elected and appointed, the Supervisors can assure themselves and their constituents that policy intent is fulfilled. Community The needs and interests of constituents represent a significant area of responsibility for a Board member. Being available and responsive to their constituents is a high priority for all Supervisors and consistent with the traditio n of good government in Alameda County.

Service Impacts The use of Tobacco Master Settlement Fund revenue will result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs. The use of 1991 Realignment Growth Fund revenue will result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs. The reduction in Discretionary Se rvices & Supplies and medical expenditures for Public Health may limit the ability of the Family Health Services Diagnostic Therapy program to leverage additional revenue which it could use to expand services. The elimination of vacant, funded positions in the Public Health Department may limit the ability of the Department to leverage additional revenue and provide additional support to Family Health Services. Use of Fiscal Management Reward Program savings w ill result in the loss of these funds for future one-time needs. HEALTH CARE SERVICES FUNDING CONCERNS In Fiscal Year 2016 -17 HCSA continues to face a number of funding challenges. Medi -Cal reimbursement continues not to cover the cost of care for our safe ty net health care providers. This adversely affects the health care system as a whole and constrains the ability of providers to invest in their systems. The Public Health department continues to experience a decline in federal funding for Nutrition and Women, Infant, Children (WIC) programs. Additional County general fund has been invested to maintain these programs at the same service level. In Behavioral Health, the potential diversion of Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) funds to finance a statewid e housing bond may impact services to the severely mentally ill. While statewide associations are pushing for counties to remain whole (i.e. receive a proportional share of bond proceeds to the MHSA revenue they will lose), this is not guaranteed. In ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY 238 Environmental Health, a statewide shortage of qualified inspectors has slowed hiring, resulting in lower fee revenue.

Though the May Revision highlights spending the State has committed to combat poverty since 2012, social services that were cut during the recession have not been restored to pre -recession levels, keeping the working poor and local safety net in a tenuous position. Ensuring adequate and stable funding for realigned State programs continues to be a challenge, especially given the State's caution that a recession is likely in the coming years. Sales tax and vehicle license fee based revenues are subject to fluctuation and may not be sufficient to fund the cost of program responsibilities transferred to the County for Public Assistance and Health Care programs. The Medi -Cal caseload has increased 90% since January 2014. Adequate Medi -Cal administration fundin g is critical to meet increased workloads and maintain case management standards. California has some of the lowest provider rates in the country and these rates raise concerns about consumer access at a time when Medi -Cal enrollment has increased signific antly. The Legislature approved a 10% provider rate cut in 2011 and most cuts have yet to be restored. The In -Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Maintenance of Effort (MOE) has kept county costs relatively stable over the past few years as caseloads and progr am costs have grown. If the Coordinated Care Initiative ends, the IHSS MOE would end. While State statute does not specifically indicate how the IHSS MOE would be unraveled, the process would be complicated and potentially costly to counties. Funding for t raining Adult Protective Services workers and their partner agencies has not increased in the past ten years despite the fact that cases rose 35% statewide between 2001 and 2013. Though the May Revision maintains the first cost -of-living adjustment (COLA) to the State portion of Supplemental Security Income/State Supplementary Payment (SSI/SSP) in a decade, the COLA falls substantially short of reversing the impact of deep cuts to SSI/SSP made to help close budget shortfalls during the Great Recession. Thes e cuts have compromised the ability of low -income California seniors and people with disabilities to afford basic needs such as housing and food, and are compounded by the fact that SSI/SSP recipients are not eligible for food assistance through CalFresh. MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT S IN 2015 -16 INCLUDE: DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES The Department exceeded its goals for all federal performance measures categories, collecting more child support funds for the children we serve. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 291 SOCIAL SERVICES AGEN CY ADMINISTRATION AND F INANCE Alameda County Workforce Investment Board (ACWIB) Awarded a grant by the U.S. Department of Labor \u2014the Linking to Employment Pre -release Specialized American Job Centers (LEAP) grant for $500,000. ACWIB's \"Beyond the Gates\" partne rship with Alameda County Sheriff's Office and community partners has completed over six months of planning to develop and implement a specialized American Job Center (AJC) inside Santa Rita Jail in Dublin. The AJC will provide career counseling services, training, and support services to targeted inmates, mitigating their time of unemployment and assisting in their successful re -entry into Alameda County communities. Successfully completed the first year of a two -year Vet Tech Engineering Technology prog ram, which is a collaboration with the Lawrence Livermore National Lab and the Chabot -Las Positas Community College District to train veteran student interns for entry -level engineering occupations. The first cohort of 17 students is on track to complete their training and will receive a certificate in engineering technology in spring 2016. Nine of these students successfully completed a summer internship as well. A second cohort has begun. The program was recognized by First Lady Michelle Obama at the annual Joining Forces Initiative event for its best practices in providing veterans meaningful work experience and career opportunities. In honor of National Manufacturing Day, on October 8, 2015, sponsored \"Manufacturing Rocks!\" - an event that was meant to inspire the next generation of manufacturers, engage youth and parents, help to change perceptions of manufacturing, and spark meaningful conversation. The Chair of ACWIB provided the welcome to the audience. An expert panel of five Bay Area advanced manufacturing companies demonstrated and shared their insights on the products they are producing such as robots, food, life -saving medical devices, and 3 -D printers. Students, parents, and educators were invited to participate and gain a new understandi ng of the diverse opportunities in advanced manufacturing, dispelling some of the associated myths. Feedback from attendees was very positive. The ACWIB staff is planning a similar event for the future. Completed two major research projects, including t he Anchor Institutions Research Report and a local labor market research study with analysis of projected growth to industries and occupations in Alameda County. These publications are being presented and made available to workforce stakeholders to inform future program development, planning, policy development, and resource allocation. Key industries identified for growth between 2017 and 2022 include healthcare, professional/scientific/technical services, and construction. Human Resources Created and c ompleted the reallocation of the Eligibility Technician Series to the new Eligibility Services Technician series (Eligibility Services Technician I - IV), impacting over 580 employees. The series was designed to (1) allow increased time to orient, train, and enable eligibility services technicians to learn and become proficient in increasingly difficult and complex program regulations; (2) increase the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes and service delivery to clients; and (3) establish a c areer ladder for all Eligibility Services Technicians. Recruited, hired, and/or promoted approximately 174 employees since July 2015, including but not limited to 35 managers, 48 Eligibility Services Technicians, 18 Child Welfare Workers, 11 Adult Protect ive Services Worker IIs, and 25 Social Worker II/IIIs. In addition, 20 CalWORKs participants were hired as temporary employees. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 292 Conducted 10 exams unique to Social Services, with 10 planned and/or scheduled by June 2016. The exam administration and crea tion of eligible lists will allow the departments to hire employees to fill current and upcoming vacancies based on attrition and unmet need. Worked collaboratively with the countywide Human Resources Services on Disability Centralization Program and Empl oyee Relations matters. Through these two partnerships, we were able to provide Reasonable Accommodations, Temporary Modified Work, Fitness for Duty examinations, Family Medical Leave, Workers' Compensation, and Non industrial Disability Insurance more qu ickly, reducing potential liability and allowing for cases to be monitored in an efficient and effective manner. Information Services Division (ISD) Upgraded Qmatic, a lobby flow management system that allows us to deliver exceptional customer service, re ducing wait times and improving efficiency. The system reduces costs and improves the overall customer experience in our offices. Program Integrity Division (PID) Underwent a major building renovation in July -September 2015 to allow us to hire additional staff to better support our clients. The following improvements were made: 20 additional workstations, two new offices, one new conference room, and one new bathroom. Other improvements completed or in progress include the addition of new and upgraded W i-Fi hubs to benefit our many mobile workers; a new electrical transformer to handle the increased load; new electrical circuits in the breakroom; and new solar panels on the roof and parking lot. PID caseloads have increased dramatically \u2014over 300 percent over the last five years \u2014as a result of the Affordable Care Act, as well as Alameda County's outreach efforts to enroll eligible residents in CalFresh. To help meet this demand, during FY 15 -16, we hired two additional units of Eligibility Services Techni cian IVs. Policy Co-sponsored a bill to protect children that are sexually exploited. AB 1702 would allow a court to not offer reunification services if a parent or guardian consented to, or participated in, the sexual exploitation or human trafficking of a child. This bill would provide new protections in State law to ensure that all foster youth who have been sexually exploited are not at risk of further exploitation by their parent or guardian. Continued to expand legislative and budget analysis capac ity. Over 2015 -16, SSA continued to build capacity of staff across departments on State and federal legislative and budget issues and to raise awareness of the SSA Legislative Council. Secured new competitive grant awards worth more than $2 million and ma naged a portfolio of active federal, State, and foundation grants of $6.3 million. Public Affairs & Community Relations Convened the Fatherhood and Male Involvement Advisory Council to put forth a comprehensive set of recommendations and strategies to adv ance SSA's effort in effectively engaging and serving fathers and males on behalf of children and families. The council consists of male line staff of SSA and is facilitated by executive management and a consultant. Activities have included participation in conferences on family and father involvement; ongoing collaboration and communication with the Alameda County Fathers Corps; male -focused training and networking; and dialogue with Agency management, community, and health and human service providers. T he Council continues ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 293 to work on mapping specific strategies to implement focus group conversations with consumers and staff members that will further guide the Agency toward the goals of effective father and male engagement and involvement in the lives of children and families. Installed ATM machines at all of SSA's Self -Sufficiency Centers (with the exception of the Fremont and Livermore offices) in partnership with 1st United Services Credit Union in 2015. The ATMs are surcharge -free for users of Electr onic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards. The Agency is committed to ensuring that recipients of public assistance are able to keep all of their cash assistance and that none of it is taken through ATM surcharges. In partnership with the California Reinvestment Coalition, SSA has identified the elimination of ATM surcharge fees for EBT users as a priority in our Asset Building Platform. Expanded services at three Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites to include preparation for Married -Filing Separately returns and became a Certified Acceptance Agent to assist clients in completing Individual Tax Identification Number applications for individuals who do not have a Social Security Number. SSA broke previous records for customers served and tax refunds returned to the County's low - to moderate -income individuals and families, as well as to the local economy. For tax year 2014, IRS -certified volunteers at SSA sites processed over 2,682 returns \u201426 percent more than the previous year \u2014and returned to our community $4.5 million in refunds, which was 40 percent higher than the previous year's total. Coordinated the Agency's second -year participation as a sponsor of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and California Department of Education's Summer Food Service Program. F rom June 26 - August 13, 2015, SSA served more than 3,300 free lunches to children age 18 and under. Following a successful pilot program in summer 2014, meal operations were expanded to three SSA office locations and a community partner site, Healthy Oakla nd. Approximately 90 -100 meals were served daily in total across the four sites. Staff Development Training and Consulting Team (TACT) Following the reclassification of the Eligibility Technicians (ET) to Eligibility Services Technicians (EST), provided crossover training to 705 eligibility staff and their supervisors between August 2015 and February 2016. Crossover training consisted of program updates on General Assistance, CalWORKs, CalFresh, and Medi -Cal. Completed five EST, two Child Welfare, two A dult Protective Services, and one IHSS Induction classes. This equates to over 170 new staff members undergoing induction training, lasting from four weeks to six months. Provided and coordinated over 56,000 hours of training in support of community -based organizations and more than 2,100 full -time Agency employees. SOCIAL SERVICES AGEN CY CHILDREN AND FAMI LY SERVICES (CFS) Increased services under the Pathways to Well -Bein g (PWB), formerly known as \"Katie A.\" in reference to the 2002 legal case, Katie A. v. Bonta , which mandates the provision of intensive in - home and community -based mental health services for California children who are in foster care or at imminent risk of removal from their families. Duration of PWB services is 9 months, but may be extended. In 2014, 92 youth received Intensive Case Coordination (ICC) and 82 received Intensive Home -Based Service (IHBS). In 2015, these numbers increased: 232 received ICC; 127 received IHBS. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 294 Awarded $1.1 million by the State for Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (CSEC) supports and services. In addition, in 2015 all Child Welfare Workers and Supervisors received State mandated CSEC 101 training to better prepare st aff to identify and serve children and youth impacted by commercial sexual exploitation. Over the past several years approximately 75 -100 foster youth have been identified annually as either CSEC or at very high risk of being CSEC. In FY 15 -16, more than 90 youth were identified. Under the leadership of CFS, the Alameda County Youth Transitions Partnership (YTP), a collaborative effort of public agencies and community -based organizations, is implementing and testing new strategies to meet the pressing nee ds of current and former foster youth at risk of homelessness. Grounded in principles of youth choice, trauma -informed care, and positive youth development, the YTP model is designed to provide coordination of services for transition -age youth across the key domains of stable housing, education/employment, social/emotional well -being, and permanent connections. In September 2015, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Children's Bureau awarded CFS a grant of $670,000 per year over the next three y ears to implement and refine the YTP Intervention Model. Enhanced contracted services for Substance Abuse Testing and Treatment (SATT) for CFS clients throughout Alameda County. SATT providers work closely with Child Welfare Workers to support clients' t imely engagement into drug testing and treatment services. Critical program improvements to ensure best practices and effective collaboration included the implementation of a comprehensive standardized assessment for all CFS clients referred for services; implementation of an anonymous client satisfaction survey to facilitate continuous quality improvement; and additional information and support to child welfare workers regarding drug and alcohol tests. An estimated 300 clients receive SATT services each year. SOCIAL SERVICES WORK FORCE AND BENEFITS A DMINISTRATION Awarded continued funding of $1,516,825 to implement the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) Housing Support Program (HSP) and provide services to homeless CalWORKs families. In collaboration with the Alameda County Housing and Community Development Agency, the HSP has enrolled 263 clients and housed 109 families since its inception in October 2014. This program fosters housing stability among CalWORKs families and follows a rapid rehousing model designed to help move families quickly into housing. Implemented a Tablet Loan Program for CalWORKs Welfare to Work participants who are part of the monthly Work Participation Rate (WPR) sample. Eligible participants at ea ch Self -Sufficiency Center are provided with electronic tablets to continue their job searches independently, thus supplementing their required hours in the CalWORKs Welfare -to-Work program when they fall short of meeting weekly/hourly requirements in a pa rticular month. The goal of the program is to improve Alameda County's WPR while engaging participants in educational, job search, and job skill activities. Collaborated with the Alameda County Community Food Bank (ACCFB) and other community -based organi zations to launch a 2015 CalFresh Awareness campaign entitled \"Better Food for Better Living.\" For the third year in a row, in 2015, the Board of Supervisors proclaimed May CalFresh Awareness Month in Alameda County. The 2015 campaign targeted, in partic ular, senior and disabled residents, and was aimed at increasing awareness of the CalFresh program's benefits and eliminating common misperceptions about the program. Activities include: ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY PUBLIC ASSISTANCE 295 CalFresh presentations at eight senior centers located in all four r egions of the County. Senior Health and Wellness Fairs to provide information and resources about food assistance programs that are available to seniors, such as CalFresh, Meals on Wheels, and the Market Match program. CalFresh 101 training for communit y-based organizations that want to provide application assistance for the community members they serve. CalFresh Super Clinics - enrollment clinics held at ACCFB that are staffed by SSA Eligibility Technicians, who complete on -site CalFresh interviews and enrollment into the program. The Food Bank saw the most applications collected during the Super Clinics sessions in a one-month period, with a record 103 households applying during the two and a half days. Direct mail campaign that reached 60,000 Medi -Cal recipients not receiving CalFresh, 18,000 low-income seniors, and 1,400 Head Start families. Non -broadcast advertising campaign to increase awareness of the CalFresh program's benefits, and to encourage families and individuals to apply. The non -audio ads run each day in English and Spanish on all monitors at the following Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) locations: Oakland Claremont, Oakland Coliseum, Fremont, and Hayward. The ads run four times per hour during every hour that the DMVs are open for business. The campaign is expected to run for one year with an annual cost of $36,720, and has the potential to reach one million people over the year. Worked with Oakland and New Haven Unified School Districts to identify students on Medi -Cal who would meet income requirements for the free and reduced price school meals program. This resulted in almost 500 additional students being automatically enrolled in the school meals program, which helps provide eligible children with nutritious free or reduced p rice lunches during the school day. Contracted with eight community -based organizations to outreach and enroll individuals and families of targeted difficult -to-reach populations such as individuals experiencing homelessness, individuals with limited -Engl ish proficiency, and re -entry populations into Medi -Cal. Contractors reached approximately 54,000 individuals through public service announcements and outreach activities in the community. These efforts resulted in 3,000 people being screened for Medi -Cal, and more than 650 individuals being enrolled into the Medi -Cal program.

DEPARTMENT GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND PERFORMA NCE MEASURES In the past , the State Department of Child Support Services and the federal government have focused on data -driven performance measures related to establishing paternity and child support orders as well as on the amount of distributed collect ions to the families we serve. In the last two years we have seen a change in both agencies, focusing more on the holistic and behavior -based approach of addressing families' needs. While the performance measures still exist, there is less emphasis place d on them and more emphasis placed on building relationships, obtaining right -sized orders, and helping non -custodial parents meet their obligations. We have built our fiscal year 2016 -2017 performance management plan to focus on delivering excellent and c onsistent customer service to our clients, developing and strengthening collaborative partnerships with community -based organizations, and increasing the support for the children we serve while being innovative in meeting the needs of the families we serve . While we are still using the old performance measures as goals, we are working with the State on establishing a baseline for future years. Goal: Establish paternity in 100% of the cases opened by DCSS. Objectives: Obtain court orders establishing pa rentage. Increase the number of Paternity Opportunity Program declarations (i.e., paternity declared at birth) obtained from hospitals. Enhance the early intervention process to encourage a collaborative relationship with case participants.

PUBLIC PROTECTION FU NDING CONCERNS/CONSI DERATIONS The Public Safety and Rehabilitation Act of 2016 announced by Governor Jerry Brown in January 2016 as a ballot initiative to reduce wasteful spending and reduce the State prison population, has received enough signatures to appear on the November 2016 ballot. If enacted by the voters, the bill would allow for inmates convicted of non -violent felony off enses who have completed the full sentence of their primary offense to be eligible for parole. Parolees would then be released to Post Release Community Supervision (PRCS), which would be administered by the counties. It is not known at this time if the S tate will provide additional funding to support this new PRCS population. While the formula for the distribution of AB 109 Public Safety Realignment base funding has been established, it is still unknown whether the County's allocation for Realignment will be sufficient to fund the cost of Public Safety program responsibilities realigned by the State. Furthermore, the allocation of future growth will be dependent on the development of statewide performance metrics. Trial Court Funding revenue continues to decline in the collection of fines and forfeitures due to reallocation of these revenues to other jurisdictions based on a revised allocation methodology. The ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGR AM SUMMARY PUBLIC PROTECTION 362 revenue reduction results in a significant increase in County General Fund costs for Trial Court Funding. Additionally, the new East County Courthouse in Dublin will require expanded County resources with no new funding anticipated from the State. The Proposed B udget includes a moratorium on the collection of Juvenile Probation fees as authorized by the Board. Other financial resources for the fee -supported programs will be required to keep services at the same level.

Since Proposition 47 passed in N ovember 2014, which reduces most drug possession crimes and thefts of property valued under $950 to misdemeanors, more than 2,100 petitions and applications were filed, 89% of which were granted. In addition, 15 state prisoners and approximately 100 count y prisoners were released. A Proposition 47 supported position, funded by California Endowment, and an attorney are dedicated to focus on this work, which serves thousands of eligible people in the community. Through Clean Slate, 1,308 motions with a 97% success rate were filed, helping clients to improve their lives by removing barriers to employment and housing. For the second year in a row, through a partnership with the East Bay Community Law Center, two Equal Justice Works Legal Fellows were secu red to provide collaborative, holistic, and multimodal legal assistance to residents in the criminal justice system who are trying to improve job opportunities. Through the Immigration Representation Initiative, clients were represented in immigration matters, including deportation proceedings. Through this initiative, the first project of its kind outside of New York, the Public Defender's immigration attorney provided immigration advice to public defenders representing noncitizens in criminal proceeding s in approximately 1,700 cases. Four Public Defender Social Workers assisted attorneys in assessing needs of clients and providing referrals to services in lieu of incarceration to the realigned population, serving nearly 300 clients. Learn Your Rights In California (L.Y.R.I.C.), an empowerment project designed to educate teens about their constitutional rights, was expanded. Since the program's inception in March of 2014, more than 2,400 students at high schools in Berkeley, Oakland, and San Leandro ha ve been successfully educated. Nearly 500 clients in Homeless and Caring Court, an alternative to the traditional criminal justice court, were served. Nearly 100 new high -risk parolees were accepted into parole reentry court, helping them with housing, emp loyment, educational, and drug treatment needs. In Juvenile Girls Court, 65 five young women were represented, addressing their trauma, healing, and empowerment through comprehensive case plans that targeted each young woman's unique challenges. In part nership with Alameda County Social Services Agency, eligible Medi -Cal and CalFresh clients were enrolled in the office. To further develop the holistic defense model, work continued with the vertical felony team, homicide team, and pre -arrest representatio n to clients who seek assistance prior to being charged. The Public Defender's Office collected and donated 750 books and magazines to Santa Rita Jail inmates. Over 230 coats, baby clothes, and hygiene kits were donated to those in need. ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGR AM SUMMARY PUBLIC PROTECTION 366 Public defende rs served a holiday pizza dinner to more than 100 youth in custody at Juvenile Hall, in collaboration with the Probation Department and the California Alameda Public Defenders Association. SHERIFF'S OFFICE Sheriff Gregory Ahern and Executive Management welcomed the Alameda County Civil Grand Jury to the Santa Rita Jail (SRJ). The Grand Jury investigates the workings and efficiencies of county and local governments in addition to inquiring into and inspecting conditions of local jails and detention facilities. Members of the Grand Jury commented positively on the cleanliness of the facility, the inmate educational opportunities, and facility safety processes. The United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, and Deputy United States Marshal Scott Feigelson, United States Marshals Service, conducted a Detention Facility Review of the SRJ. Their inspection addressed 51 standards divided into six sections, Administration/Management, Health Care, Security and Control, Food Service, Safety and Sanitation, and Services and Programs. The facility was found compliant with all standards. SRJ staff, accompanied by Vanir Construction Management, Inc., submitted a Senate Bill (SB) 863 proposal for a new Program/Behavioral Health Building to the B oard of State and Community Corrections (BSCC). The proposed building, to be located between Housing Units 23 and 24, will contain approximately 40,000 square feet of program and treatment space. The amount of funding being sought is approximately $55 mi llion dollars. The BSCC subsequently awarded Alameda County $54,340,000 as a result of funding from SB 863, which is subject to approval by the County of Alameda Board of Supervisors. The Inmate Services Unit held its Annual Re -Entry Expo in the SRJ Tran sition Center/Gymnasium. 68 agencies and 339 inmates attended the event. Inmates in attendance received information about a variety of services, programs, and employment opportunities available to them upon release from custody. Commander Rocky Medeiros provided a K -9 Unit, (Deputy Sheriff II Marcus Stevens and his partner, Chuna) to support security efforts. The Glenn E. Dyer Detention Facility (GEDDF) implemented Inmate Messaging. Inmate Messaging allows inmates to remain connected with their families and their lives on the outside. Inmates are able to access email through Global Tel*Link (GTL) tablets. The access provided by these tablets is restricted to family members, or friends, who have established an account with GTL. Inmate Messaging employs t he same security features as the current GTL telephone system. GEDDF began the creation of a new interview room for contact visits in Intake Transfer and Release (ITR). Since the creation of the new Line -Up room on the top floor of the facility, the ITR line-up room has fallen into disuse. The \"public\" side of the line -up room has been repurposed into an office for use by Classification staff. The \"inmate\" side of the line -up room will now serve as an additional contact visit space for use by attorneys, medical professionals, and anyone else needing a contact visit. This increases the available space for contact visits by 50% at GEDDF. GEDDF staff worked in conjunction with the United States Marshal's Office and the Federal Public Defender in the devel opment of the electronic discovery pilot program, in which a low -cost Android powered tablet has been identified and purchased by the Federal Public Defender. The device has been locked using software to only provide access to Adobe PDF and multimedia fil es as needed. Camera, Internet, and other functionality is disabled. Discovery will be loaded on microSD memory ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM SUMMARY PUBLIC PROTECTION 367 devices, reducing the need for storage and access of large boxes of paperwork, as well as the attorney and deputy time to stage contact visits a nd supervise inmates while they review video files. SRJ hosted the Santa Rita Jail Youth Education Program (S.R.J.Y.E.P.), which was open to employees of the Sheriff's Office. The program encouraged youth to make better life choices, and included a tour of the facility, which provided an opportunity for participants to speak with those incarcerated. Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Services (OHSES) emergency management staff provided personal and office disaster preparedness training to Congres sman Eric Swalwell's California District 15 staff. The Air Squadron acquired a Cessna airplane to be utilized by the Air Squadron and Sheriff's Office staff for search and rescue missions, administrative transport flights, and various public safety missio ns. OHSES implemented a unified countywide regional mass notification system to be utilized in the event of a disaster. This system is historic in the sense that Alameda County has never had a regional system. OHSES completed the Sit Stat project, a Stat e Homeland Security Grant project which allows for a common operating picture for first responders by integrating CAD from fire, police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) video wall is capable of displayi ng Sheriff's Office, Alameda County Fire, and Paramedics Plus units in real -time allowing for increased situational awareness. OHSES provided protracted mutual -aid support across a variety of disciplines to the Lake County Fire, one of the largest in rece nt California history. A total of 1,958 structures were destroyed, including 1,280 homes, 27 multi -family structures, 66 commercial properties, and 585 other minor structures. The Crime Laboratory implemented a Rapid DNA Service (RADS) program designed to test the most probative samples from every sexual assault kit collected in the county (excluding Oakland). These select samples come directly from the hospital which allows la boratory work to begin sooner and simplifies the analytical process by eliminating the need for documenting and screening of the entire sexual assault kit. The Crime Laboratory worked with the District Attorney's Office to send off the final 104 backlogge d sexual assault kits to a private DNA laboratory for processing. The kits were from various Alameda County police agencies that had never been submitted to any forensic laboratory for examination. The first two batches which were tested, totaling approx imately 220 kits, resulted in 82 DNA profiles being uploaded to Combine DNA Index System (CODIS), 42 arrestee/offender hits, and five forensic (case -to-case) hits. The DA's Office has identified grant funding to pay for the outsourcing of an additional 1, 075 kits, and the Crime Lab will be partnering with them to perform technical reviews and CODIS entries. On July 11, 2015, the Crime Laboratory became fully accredited by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board - International. The Laboratory successfully passed all 451 accreditation criteria which are the most stringent for forensic testing labs worldwide. Within the Management Services Division, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office worked with law enforcement an d government agencies throughout California Region II to host the ninth consecutive year of Urban Shield, which provides training, knowledge, and skills to first responders, homeland ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGR AM SUMMARY PUBLIC PROTECTION 368 security officials, emergency management officials, private and non -gover nmental partners, and other personnel to perform key tasks required in any large scale disaster. During 2015, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office Regional Training Center (RTC) received California Peace Officer Standards Training (POST) approval and began to develop and teach several new classes, which included Evidence and Property Function Management and Law Enforcement Casualty Care. The RTC worked with POST to expand the Public Safety Emergency Dispatcher course catalog to include Instructor Developme nt, which instruct students in the POST basic course instructional system, roles and responsibilities of law enforcement training instructors, lesson planning, presentation and facilitation techniques/skills, use of learning resources and adult learning concepts. It also included Tactical Dispatcher, which instructs dispatchers in the roles and responsibilities associated with tactical operations and Terrorism Awareness, Train the Trainer, which permits dispatchers to instruct others in the recognition of potential terrorist threats when they come into a dispatch center, and how to aid in the management of necessary resources. In 2015, the Backgrounds and Recruiting Unit attended 13 separate recruiting events/job fairs and also hosted a recruiting booth at the Alameda County Fair for 17 days. The Backgrounds Unit focused its efforts in working with local military veteran organizations to identify potential candidates as part of the Hire a Hero/Hire a Veteran program. The Human Resource Unit successfully f acilitated the hiring of recruits for three academies which started in January, August, and December 2015. The Support Services Unit created a new dispatch code 423 for sworn personnel to track positive interactions with the community. Within the Law Enf orcement Services Division, the Deputy Sheriffs' Activities League (DSAL) Youth Soccer League was expanded to accommodate 1,300 youth, more than 100 volunteer coaches, 21 certified referees, and a 12 -member Soccer Advisory Board made of local residents. The \"Talk With A Cop\" program continues to be a valuable resource, which allows about 600 youth annually the chance to discuss concerns about law enforcement with deputies. This program is held at the REACH Ashland Youth Center and at several schools withi n the San Lorenzo Unified School District. The Community Oriented Policing and Problem Solving Unit (COPPS) participated in numerous community events throughout the year, which included schools, homeowner associations and seasonal festivals. This unit al so administers the Crime Free Multi -Housing Program which has fifty apartment communities participating in the process to become crime -free. The Unit also successfully administered the Alcohol Policy Ordinance, which included enforcement operations, educa tion, and inspections. In October of 2015, the COPPS Unit participated in the \"Fam Fest\" community event at the REACH Ashland Youth Center in San Leandro. The event included a 5K run with 518 runners.

The term CBO is defined broadly throughout this chapter to describe the direct human services contracts with both non -profit and for -profit services providers, as well as cities, school dis tricts, and local hospitals. Consistent with the Board of Supervisors' adopted budget policies for FY 2016 -17, the Proposed Budget includes a 3.5% cost -of-living adjustments (COLA) for eligible CBO contractors totaling $6.1 million. CBOs eligible for COLA s are those whose contracted allocations are funded in whole or part with County General Fund revenue. The 3.5% COLA was calculated solely on the General Fund amount. Those CBOs under contract for specific rate or payment amounts are not eligible. Gener al Government CBO expenditures decreased by $50,267 as a result of program changes under the Housing and Community Development service program. There is a $16 million increase in Health Care CBO Contracts. This increase includes $11.6 million in statutory rate increases for mental health providers, $5.8 million in cost -of-living adjustments, and $4.4 million for other program changes. Of the $393 million in health care contracts, $80.1 million i s for contracted health care services delivered by Alameda Hea lth System. The $6.6 million increase in Public Assistance CBO Contracts is due to changes in CalWORKs as well as Community Housing and Shelter Services. Increases include $275,000 in COLAs. Public Protection CBO Contracts include a $1.2 million increase a s the result of service program changes under both the Community Probation Program and Community Policing. CBO funding includes $17 million for Health Measure A funded contracts in the Health Care Services Agency.
