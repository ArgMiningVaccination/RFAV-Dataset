Reddy, MD Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents Acute vs. Chronic Omega-3 Herbs Yoga Diet Lifestyle By reducing chronic inflammation\u2014also known as low-grade or systemic inflammation\u2014you may be able to boost your defense against several major diseases. In addition to fine-tuning your diet and overall self-care, you can reduce chronic inflammation with the help of certain natural substances and alternative therapies. Westend61 / Getty Images Acute vs. Chronic Inflammation Unlike acute inflammation in which the immune system responds to infection or injury by activating inflammatory chemicals that combat foreign substances, chronic inflammation isn't beneficial for the body. Often resulting from lifestyle factors like stress and poor diet, chronic inflammation occurs when the immune system continually releases those inflammatory chemicals, even when there are no foreign invaders to fight off. By working to reduce chronic inflammation, you may be able to protect against a number of conditions shown to be inflammation-related, including: Heart disease Cancer Stroke Diabetes Alzheimer's disease Asthma Irritable bowel syndrome Here's a look at several approaches to reducing inflammation naturally. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Maintaining a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids (naturally available in foods like fish oil and flaxseed oil) and low in certain omega-6 fatty acids found in foods like red meat and dairy products may help lower inflammation and guard against diseases like breast cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, and asthma, according to a research review published in 2002. Shown to thwart the production of pro-inflammatory substances, omega-3 fatty acids are also available in supplement form. Herbs Preliminary research suggests that some herbs may help reduce inflammation. In an animal study published in 2007, for instance, scientists discovered that curcumin (a compound found in the curry spice turmeric) can overpower pro-inflammatory proteins called cytokines. And in in-vitro research published in 2005, investigators found ginger may reduce inflammation more effectively than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as aspirin). In fresh or dried form, both turmeric and ginger can be used in cooking. If you're considering the use of any type of herbal supplement in your efforts to reduce inflammation, make sure you consult your physician before starting your supplement regimen. Yoga People who regularly practice yoga may have reduced levels of interleukin-6 (a marker of inflammation), according to a 2010 study of 50 women. Analyzing blood samples from the participants, researchers observed that those who practiced yoga had 41% lower levels of interleukin-6 than those who didn't practice yoga. Diet Following a diet that focuses on anti-inflammatory foods is also considered essential to reducing inflammation. Find out more about foods to eat on an anti-inflammatory diet. Lifestyle Making healthy changes to your lifestyle should be your first step in reducing inflammation. The following approaches may have an inflammation-fighting effect: Managing stress (possibly with the help of mind-body practices like meditation and tai chi) Avoiding smoking Limiting alcohol intake Exercising regularly Getting sufficient sleep What Is Serrapeptase? A Word From Verywell If you're considering using diet, supplement, or any form of alternative medicine for inflammation, make sure to consult your physician first. Self-treating any condition and avoiding or delaying standard care may have serious consequences. 4 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
