The Defense Health Program (DHP) Operation and Maintenance (O&M) appropriation funding provides for worldwide medical and dental services to active forces and other eligible beneficiaries, veterinary services, occupational and industrial health care, specialized services for the training of medical personnel, and medical command headquarters. Included are costs associated with the delivery of the TRICARE benefit which provides for the health care of eligible active duty family members, retired members and their family members, and the eligible surviving family members of deceased active duty and retired members. The FY 2019 budget request of $33,729.2 million includes realistic cost growth for health care services either provided in the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) or purchased from the private sector through the managed care support contracts, and for pharmaceuticals. This budget includes funding for continued support of Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health (TBI/PH) and Wounded, Ill and Injured (WII) requirements. It complies with the Congressional mandate related to support of Centers of Excellence (COE) and DoD's initiatives for operations efficiencies, including assumed savings for military healthcare reform and efficiency initiatives such as the restructure of the TRICARE T-17 Contract Administration Fees and modifications to Long-Term Health Care reimbursement. Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funding is divided into seven major areas: In-House Care, Private Sector Care, Information Management, Education and Training, Management Activities, Consolidated Health Support, and Base Operations. The DoD Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund (MERHCF) is an accrual fund to pay for DoD's share of applicable Direct Care and Private Sector Care operation and maintenance health care costs for Medicare-eligible retirees, retiree family members and survivors.Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA-19, Introductory Statement DHP-3The DHP appropriation also funds the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) program for medical Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT), research to reduce medical capability gaps, and support to both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) medical laboratory facilities. The DHP appropriation Procurement program funds acquisition of capital equipment in MTFs and other selected health care activities which include equipment for initial outfitting of newly constructed, expanded, or modernized health care facilities; equipment for modernization and replacement of uneconomically reparable items; and Military Health System (MHS) information technology (IT) requirements.

Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA-19, Introductory Statement DHP-10President's Management Plan - Performance Metrics Requirements: The Military Health System (MHS) continues to refine existing performance measures and develop specific criteria to determine and measure outputs/outcomes as compared with initial goals. The Quadruple Aim provides a focused and balanced approach to overall performance. This approach includes not only production but outcome measures related to medical readiness, a healthy population, positive patient experiences and the responsible management of health care costs. Individual Medical Readiness - This measure provides operational commanders, Military Department leaders and primary care managers use this measure to monitor the medical readiness status of their personnel, ensuring a healthy and fit fighting force medically ready to deploy. This represents the best-available indicator of the medical readiness of the Total Force (Active Component and Reserve Component) prior to deployment. Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - Satisfaction is measured using a standard survey instrument comparable to those used by civilian plans. The goal is to improve MHS beneficiary overall satisfaction with TRICARE to a level at or above benchmark satisfaction with civilian plans. Increasing satisfaction with the Health Plan indicates that actions being taken are improving the overall functioning of the health plan from the beneficiary perspective. Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - This measure focuses on the annual overall cost growth for the Prime enrollees and includes all costs related to health care delivered to enrollees. The objective is to keep the rate of cost growth for the TRICARE Prime enrollees to a level at or below the increases for the Civilian health care plans at the national level. Currently the measure provides insight to issues regarding unit cost, utilization management, and Purchased care management. The Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA-19, Introductory Statement DHP-11metric has been enhanced to properly account for differences in population demographics and health care requirements of the enrolled population. Since enrollment demographics can vary significantly by Service, and across time, it is important to adjust the measure. For example, as increasing numbers of older individuals enroll, the overall average medical expense per enrollee would likely increase. Conversely, as younger, healthy active duty enroll, the overall average would likely decrease. Through the use of adjustment factors, a comparison across Services and across time is made more meaningful. Output related measures that influence Medical Cost Per Member Per Year: Inpatient Production Target (Medicare Severity Adjusted Relative Weighted Products, referred to as MS-RWPs) - Achieving the production targets ensures that the initial plan for allocation of personnel and resources are used appropriately in the production of inpatient workload. Outpatient Production Target (Relative Value Units, referred to as RVUs) - Achieving the production targets ensures that the initial plans for allocation of personnel and resources are used appropriately in the production of outpatient workload. Below is reporting for FY 2017 performance measures related to the Quadruple Aim, and two output measures related to production plan targets. The overall success of each measured is discussed below: Individual Medical Readiness - The Military Health System achieved the goal for the Total Force Medical Readiness for FY 2017 with a score of 86 percent compared to the goal of 85 percent. This represents the fourth year in a row that the MHS has surpassed the performance goal for the measure, and constant MHS attention and effort to ensure that performance can be sustained into the future. Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA-19, Introductory Statement DHP-12Beneficiary Satisfaction with Health Plan - Satisfaction with Health Care Plan performance for FY 2017 exceeded the goal of 57 percent for the fiscal year. Performance levels this year exceeded the goal for all beneficiary categories and enrollment status. This has been a continuous process to maintain and improve performance to levels comparable with the civilian sector, and performance must be maintained. The major areas that drive performance for this measure are related to Claims Processing Timeliness, Interaction during Health Care, and Access to Health Care. Given there have been no changes with Claims Processing Timeliness, the focus will be on Health Care Interactions and Access, which are areas with continued focus for improvement with in the MHS. Initiatives related to specialty and primary care access for the Military Treatment Facilities appear to be working. Medical Cost Per Member Per Year - Annual Cost Growth - The Year to Date performance estimate for FY 2017 is 1.0 percent vs goal of 3.4 percent. While final claims data are still lagging, the system was able to achieve the goal during the fiscal year. Pharmacy continued to show improvements through the Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee explicit formulary management and actionable Prime enrollee leakage reports for non-maintenance medication further reductions overall costs were achieved. Additionally improvements to specialty care provider efficiency and primary care management for Prime enrollees are positively impacting performance. Inpatient Production Target (MS-RWPs) - For the most recent reported monthly data for FY 2017, the MHS produced 191 thousand MS-RWPs against a target of 204 thousand MS- RWPs, slightly below the target. These numbers are based on the records reported to date, and may increase slightly as all records are completed. Part of the reason for the decrease was related to earlier than expected closures of some smaller hospitals. NDAA 2017 required a review of inpatient care locations where clinical readiness of providers and staff can be sustained at sufficient levels. Implementation plans are expected to be completed during FY 2018 providing better Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Introductory Statement Exhibit PBA-19, Introductory Statement DHP-13estimates for FY 2019 with a renewed focus of improved readiness for Military providers. Outpatient Production Target (RVUs) - With an increased emphasis on paying for performance, the system has seen a renewed focus on production of outpatient care. For FY 2017, the production 80.6 million relative value units, surpassed the goal of 80.2 million relative value units. Initiatives are already underway related to improve specialty and primary care efficiency for the Military Treatment Facility specialty and primary care efficiency.(This page intentionally left blank)Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Operation and Maintenance Funding Exhibit O-1, Funding by BA/AG/SAG (Budget Years) DHP-15 (This page intentionally left blank)Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Summary of Price and Program Growth Exhibit OP-32, Summary of Price and Program Growth DHP-17FY 2017 Rate Employees 0 -25 -1 3 142 411Army Supply 201 02.49% 5 -196 0 0-35,365 0 00.00% 0 0 0 506DLA (Const & 1,231 03.33% 41 -508 764 0-1.83% -14 29 779Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Summary of Price and Program Growth Exhibit OP-32, Summary of Price and Program Growth DHP-18FY 2017 Rate 11,454 01.80% 14,005 14,282 DWCF Purchases 611Navy Surface Warfare Ctr 843 01.42% 12 6 861 00.81% 7 10 878 614Space & Naval Warfare 0 3 677DISA Telecomm Svcs - Reimbursable27 64 22 1,288Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Summary of Price and Program Growth Exhibit OP-32, Summary of Price and Program Growth DHP-19FY 2017 Rate 42 02.38% 1 0 43 927Air Def Contracts & Space Support (AF)2,970 01.68% 50 -3,020 0 Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Summary of Price and Program Growth Exhibit OP-32, Summary of Price and Program Growth DHP-20FY 2017 Rate 0 0 (Interest and 01.73% 16 489 1,432 01.82% 26 2 1,460 Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Personnel Summary Exhibit PB-31R, Personnel Summary DHP-21FY 2017 FY Foreign National Direct Hire 1,232 937 981 44 Total Direct Hire 63,527 62,090 62,053 Foreign -44 Reimbursable Civilians 209 206 (Total) 83,061 82,417 59,259 -16 Foreign National Direct Hire 1,219 910 954 44 Total Direct Hire 63,146 60,185 National Indirect Hire 1,153 1,269 1,225 -44 Reimbursable Civilians 201 201 201 0 Average Annual Civilian Salary Cost ($ in thousands) 95.4 97.3 97.7 0.4 Contractor FTEs Explanations Contractor FTEs: FY 2018 contractor FTEs have been updated to reflect current estimates based upon actual execution and assumed savings.

The decrease to FY 2018 brings the programmed endstrength back to baseline. Additional decrease is attributed to Military Treatment Facility Management realigned to Base Operations Support (-450) and incremental reduction to shape a properly sized and highly capable Defense Health Program work force (-18). The increase from FY 2018 to FY 2019 (+116) is attributed to Army MEDCOM's realignment of FTEs (+65) from Consolidated Health Support (+60) and Information Management/Information Technology (+5) to In-House Care for sustained operations at United States Medical Material Center, Korea. Additional FTEs were internally realigned within the Army program to support ongoing requirements at OCONUS medical and dental treatment facilities (+9). The increase also results from a smaller adjustment in FY 2019 over FY 2018 to reduce the effects of civilian hiring restrictions over the last few cycles (+42). Explanation of changes in Contractor FTEs: The net decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 (- 1,042) reflects FY 2017 for Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) (-552), Defense Health Agency (DHA) (-354) and National Capital Region Medical Directorate (-200) contractors not reflected in the FY 2018 program offset by an increase in embedded clinical pharmacists support in Military Treatment Facilities to support patient medication monitoring to identify, resolve, monitor and prevent medication therapy problems (+64).

Reduction in Funding Due to Updates to the TRICARE Contract Administration Fee Structure:-506,000 The TRICARE Managed Care Support Contracts (MCSC)will realize efficiencies due to improvements in the administration fee structure between the previous (T- 3) MCSC and the new MCSC (T-17), that started on January 1, 2018. The reduction in administrative overhead costs is a result of the following initiatives: (1) consolidation of CONUS TRICARE regions from three to two, (2) implementation of stringent contractor financial incentives, and (3) retention of beneficiary enrollment fees by the Government and not the contractors under the new fee payment structure. The FY 2018 Managed Care Support Contract baseline funding request is $6,838,409K. 2) b. Reduction in Funding Due to Updated Changes to Copayments As Per the Interim Final Rule (IFR):-299,000 Reduction for estimated savings associated with the updated retiree copayments under the TRICARE Prime and Select Health Plans, effective January 1, 2018, as promulgated in the interim final rule (IFR) published on September 29, 2017 (Volume 82, Number Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Private Sector Care III. Financial Summary ($ in thousands) Private Sector Care PSC-68C. Reconciliation of Increases and Decreases Amount Totals 188). For Select beneficiaries, the IFR, wherever practical--converts the current cost-shares, from a percentage to a fixed dollar amount. For TRICARE Prime retirees, the IFR restructures and updates copayment amounts. The simplicity of this approach will make participation in the TRICARE network more attractive to providers. The FY 2018 Managed Care Support Contract baseline funding request is $6,838,409K. 3) c. Reduction for Estimated Savings Associated with the Adoption of CMS Rates for TRICARE Long Term Care and Inpatient Residential Facilities Reimbursement:-97,000 Reduction for estimated savings associated with the adoption of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) reimbursement rates for Long Term Care Hospitals(LTCH) and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities(IRF) providing care to TRICARE beneficiaries. Previously, TRICARE paid LTCH and IRF billed charges minus individually negotiated discounts; ultimately paying an average of 70% of billed charges. This initiative is compatible with the private sector which reimburses based upon CMS standard discounted rates. The FY 2018 Managed Care Support Contract baseline funding request is $6,838,409K. 4) d.

The decrease from FY 2018 to FY 2019 (-25) is attributed to the realignment of 30 military end strength to the Defense Health Agency Program Element Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Education and Training Education and Training EDT-162associated with Executive Agent organizations for the Armed Services Blood Program Office, Military Vaccine Agency, Defense Medical Readiness Training Institute, and the Armed Forces Medical Examiner (-30). Other changes result from net zero internal realignments to meet emerging requirements (+5). Explanation of changes in Civilian FTEs: The decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 (-191) results from FY 2017 Civilian FTEs executing higher than programmed. The result is a decrease in FY 2018 (-145) to attain the FY 2018 baseline. In addition, Military Health System Modernization Study reduction of civilian staff (-22), phasing Pre- Deployment Trauma Training Program into the core curriculum (-9), transfer of Wounded Warrior Program to the Department of the Army (-9), and continuation of the initiative to reduce Management Headquarters (-6). The increase from FY 2018 to FY 2019 (+12) results from a smaller adjustment in FY 2019 over FY 2018 to reduce the effects of civilian hiring restrictions over the last few cycles (+6) and correction to return FTEs realigned to RDTE in error during a Workforce Analysis update. Returns FTEs to Education and Training (+6). Explanation of changes in Contractor FTEs: The decrease from FY 2017 to FY 2018 (-54) is attributed to lower CMEs budgeted in FY 2018 than FY 2017 (-53). Contractor FTEs are determined based on calculation methodologies developed by each component and applied to each budgeted cycle. Other adjustment consists of Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery's Service Requirements Review Board (-7) reduction in contracts and the establishment of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences METC Affiliation (+6). The decrease from FY 2018 to FY 2019 (-9) is attributed to deobligations and historical under execution adjustments levied against the program. Contractor FTEs Footnote: FY 2018 contractors have been updated based upon actual execution and support Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Operation and Maintenance Education and Training Education and Training EDT-163requirements.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Guidance for Development of the Force-Basic Operational Medical Research Sciences: This program element (PE) provides support for basic medical research directed toward greater knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles of science and medicine that are relevant to the improvement of Force Health Protection. Research in this PE is designed to address areas of interest to the Secretary of Defense regarding Wounded Warriors, capabilities identified through the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, and sustainment of Department of Defense DoD and multi-agency priority investments in science, technology, research, and development. Medical research, development, test, and evaluation priorities for the Defense Health Program (DHP) are guided by, and will support, the Quadrennial Defense Review, the National Research Action Plan for Improving Access to Mental Health Services for Veterans, Service Members, and Military Families, the National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic Resistance, and the National Strategy for Biosurveillance. Research will support efforts such as the Precision Medicine Initiative which seeks to increase the use of big data and interdisciplinary approaches to establish a fundamental understanding of military disease and injury to advance health status assessment, diagnosis, and treatment tailored to individual Service members and beneficiaries, research focused on protection against emerging infectious disease threats, the advancement of state of the art regenerative medicine manufacturing technologies consistent with the National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing, the advancement of global health engagement and capitalization of complementary research and technology capabilities, improving deployment military occupational and environmental exposure monitoring, and the strengthening of the scientific basis for decision-making in patient safety and quality performance in the Military Health System. The program also supports the Interagency Strategic Plan for Research and Development of Blood Products and Related Technologies for Trauma Care and Emergency Preparedness. Program development and execution is peer-reviewed and coordinated with all of the Military Services, appropriate Defense agencies or activities and other federal agencies, to include the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Homeland Security. Coordination occurs through the planning and execution activities of the Joint Program Committees (JPCs), established to manage research, development, test and evaluation for DHP-sponsored research. The JPCs supported by this PE include military infectious diseases (JPC-2), military operational medicine (JPC-5), and combat casualty care (JPC-6). Funds in this PE are for basic research that promises to provide important new approaches to complex military medical problems. As the research efforts mature, the most promising efforts will transition to applied research (PE 0602115) or technology development (PE 0603115) funding. In FY 2016, Congressional Special Interest (CSI) funds were provided for Core Research Funding. Because of the CSI annual structure, out-year funding is not programmed.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification At the President's direction in late 2013, a National Strategy was created to address the critical issue of antimicrobial resistance. This strategy was devised using an interagency approach and ultimately approved at the executive level (2014). Inherent in this work are DoD sponsored efforts to support the DoD's beneficiaries, but also complement national efforts to prevent, detect, and control illness and death related to infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One critical need identified is for new therapeutics, to include antibiotics. This effort's focus is on the development of new/novel antibiotics, especially those targeting the most resistant and worrisome Gram negative bacterial pathogens, using existing expertise at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and leveraging other WRAIR capabilities to evaluate viable candidate targets for advanced discovery. This project supports (both directly and indirectly) Global Health Security Agenda priorities to respond rapidly and effectively to biological threats of international concern. B.

Expeditionary Medicine is focused on care on the battlefield and in field hospitals prior to transporting patients out of theater to CONUS, and studies trauma resuscitation, hemorrhage control, and other life-saving interventions to keep critically wounded patients alive in the golden hour and to the next level of care. The AFMS is the only service transporting patients on long aeromedical evacuation missions. Therefore, the En-Route care thrust area studies include investigation on the impact of transport on patient and providers (including cabin altitude, noise, vibration, and environmental issues affecting physiology on the aircraft), patient safety factors during transport, medical technologies for use during transport, and research to support education and training with simulation for En-Route care providers.

FHP also includes Innovations and Personalized Medicine. Operational medicine is focused on in garrison care - our next most critical issue post OIF/OEF - and how to care for the whole patient and consideration of comorbidities in treatment of wounded warriors and dependents. For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), medical development programs include the Prostate Cancer Center of Excellence (CoE), the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM), the Pain CoE, the Breast Cancer CoE, and the Gynecological Cancer CoE. The Prostate CoE, formerly a CSI, was chartered in 1992 to conduct basic, clinical, and translational research programs to combat diseases of the prostate. The Center's mission is fulfilled primarily through its three principal programs -- the Clinical Translational Research Center, the Basic Science Research Program, and the Tri-Service Multicenter Prostate Cancer Database, which encompasses its clinical research work with other participating military medical centers. These affiliated sites contribute data and biospecimens obtained from prostate cancer patients who participate in clinical trials. CNRM brings together the expertise of clinicians and scientists across disciplines to catalyze innovative approaches to TBI research. CNRM research programs emphasize aspects of high relevance to military populations, with a primary focus on patients at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Beginning in FY17, the Breast Cancer CoE funding line and the Gynecological Cancer CoE funding line are transferred from the Army to USUHS. B.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Continuing FY17 work, FY18 funding will support the modeling of collected malaria surveillance and intervention data to measure the impact of previous interventions in Vietnam. The Ministry of Health has agreed in principal to provide malaria data from 2010-2015 to study the impact of environmental, climatic and control/elimination factors on malaria burden. This effort will be enhanced by continuation of ongoing surveillance efforts with the Ministry of Health with expanded collection of blood samples to evaluate current malaria infection by microscopic and PCR detection of malaria parasites and historic malaria exposure by antibody testing. These activities will improve the understanding of malaria parasite diversity and the distribution of drug resistance along the Vietnam-Cambodia-Laos border region. The focus of efforts with the Ministry of Health will be studying malaria transmission within the country and transport of malaria parasites along the Laos-Cambodia-Vietnam border, a new project will be initiated to detect malaria infection in people returning from working in Africa. This project will provide insight into the transport of which may impact malaria transmission patterns in Vietnam. In FY18 efforts with the Ministry of Defense will focus on completing the cross-sectional study approved in FY17. This study will be conducted in Gai Lia Province on the Cambodia border and provide information on subclinical malaria infection. Subclinical infections are not captured in routine surveillance activities; this gap impacts Vietnam's malaria elimination program and US force health protection strategy as these cases are part of the malaria transmission cycle. Clinical studies on malaria drug resistance will continue in FY18. The Ministry of Defense is reviewing a new clinical study for malaria drug resistance in Dak Nong Province on the Cambodia border, this study began in Q3 FY17 and will continue for two years. FY 2019 Plans: Building on partnerships with the Ministries of Health and Defense surveillance activities will continue in border areas with known malaria drug resistance. Surveillance efforts will be augmented by pilot testing intervention products and packages that could be utilized by the Vietnam National Malaria Control Program and the US DoD to inform malaria prevention and control programs. Surveillance and malaria control/elimination products and strategies will be evaluated using approaches harmonized with the World Health Organization and US DoD Defense Malaria Assistance Program. Study results and recommendations will be reported in refereed professional journals and policy recommendations submitted to the Vietnamese and US Governments.

Sepsis is the common path to end-organ damage and death for a large proportion of globally-important infectious diseases. This project will improve the understanding of disease pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms through network and biomarker analysis thus offering unique opportunities for improving sepsis diagnosis and management. Through systematic biology, it will develop insight into the disease pathogenesis of sepsis, and host factors which predict susceptibility, and sepsis severity provides opportunity for targeted interventions to forestall morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, enhanced knowledge of emerging antimicrobial resistance in strategic regions informs ongoing surveillance and mitigation efforts of critical importance to deployed forces. Successful completion of this project will provide reliable antimicrobial resistance data for forces deploying to Egypt and the region and also document improved methods for the treatment and management of sepsis. ACESO is an international consortium of sepsis researchers led by NMRC that has established a network of sepsis research sites in SE Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa to improve clinical outcomes and advance our understanding of pathogenesis, biomarkers of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance trends. The largest infectious disease hospital in Egypt, Abbassia Fever Hospital, provides critical severe infection and antimicrobial resistance data from the North African Theater. This project supports (both directly and indirectly) Global Health Security Agenda priorities: Combat Antibiotic Resistance Bacteria (CARB); Prevent Avoidable Epidemics; Detect Threats Early; and Respond Rapidly and Effectively to biological threats of international concern B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: Mitigate the Global Impact of Sepsis Through ACESO (CARB) (Navy) Description: This project seeks to demonstrate that the impact of sepsis from resistant and other high risk organisms in Egypt can be mitigated through the ACESO approach of discovering common, host-based pathogenic pathways for improved recognition and management of sepsis. This project will improve understanding of pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms through network and biomarker analysis to offer unique opportunities for improving sepsis diagnosis and management. Most specifically, ACESO will execute biomarker discovery identifying diagnostic and prognostic biomarker panels which may improve sepsis management in all environments including resourced and austere. FY 2017 Accomplishments: FY17 efforts supported continued enrollment of severely ill patients in an observational study in Cambodia at Takeo Provincial Hospital and in Ghana at Komfo Anoyke Teaching Hospital (KATH). The goals of this study are to 1) identify diagnostic and prognostic markers, 2) investigate common pathogenic pathways, 3) describe the spectrum of pathogens causing sepsis, 4) describe the treatment strategies currently in use, and 5) assess the long-term sequelae.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 infection and evidence of systemic inflammation were considered for enrollment. Laboratory testing augmented the testing routinely performed at the hospital microbiology laboratory, and included diagnostic tests (e.g. blood cultures, malaria smears, HIV tests, and serology), molecular diagnostics, and assays measuring the host-response (RNA sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics). Sophisticated analytic and statistical approaches are being applied to the complex data set to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers for sepsis and to investigate common pathogenic pathways. The Vietnam-Australia-US military study of drug resistance patterns in Central Vietnam was closed in Jan 2017 due to a lower than expected malaria burden. Preliminary data supports previous findings, reported in FY16, that there is no resistance for 1st choice malaria drug treatments. Additionally, a review of Vietnam malaria burden, control measures and environmental factors was initiated; the preliminary findings suggest increased average daily temperature was a primary factor of decreased malaria rates. Recruitment for the cross-sectional study in Gai Lia Province (on the border with Cambodia) started in Dec 2016 and was completed in Feb 2017. Sample and data analysis are ongoing, however, preliminary results from the >3,000 participants indicate the rate of patients without symptoms, but still carrying malaria parasite, was >1.25% in this study population, representing a silent malaria transmission risk in this forested, border region on the Cambodia-Vietnam border. The study of Vietnamese workers returning from Africa was initiated in Q2 FY17 with concurrent records review was stated for malaria patients recently returned from Africa presenting for care at two referral medical facilities in Ha Noi in 2014-2016. Preliminary results were accepted for presentation at the Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand from 06-08 Dec 2017. These data suggest delayed malaria clearance in patients returning from Africa was likely due to delayed medical treatment and not from malaria drug resistance. FY 2018 Plans: FY18 funding will support the continuation of the observational study at the Takeo Provincial Hospital in Cambodia and Komfo Anoke Teaching Hospital in Ghana, the sophisticated analytic and statistical approaches leading to development of the diagnostic and prognostic biomarker panels, and verification of the initial findings. FY18 funding will also support the start of observational study at the Abbassia Fever Hospital and the sophisticated analytic and statistical approaches will be applied to this complex data set to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers for sepsis and to investigate common pathogenic pathways.

Research in the Directed Energy sub-project area seeks to develop technologies to \"detect to warn\" and \"detect to protect\" AF operators such that they can take appropriate actions to prevent or minimize exposure leading to adverse health effects. Research in the Occupational and Environmental Health sub-project area involves the assessment and implementation of innovative new technologies that enable effective surveillance, detection, identification, and mitigation of hazardous chemical, biological, and physical hazards that present a health risk to our forces and threaten to degrade and disrupt the missions they execute. Air Force FHP efforts focus on health protection across the spectrum of AF air and ground operations. These include hazards presented to high performance and high flyer aircraft crews facing extreme environments within their flight envelopes that are potentially more sensitive to physiologic and cognitive stressors and rely on aircraft systems to provide life support for protection. Because Air Force installations are typically very strategically important in combat execution, they are more often tied to performing ops at fixed locations; therefore, they drive the need to detect and identify the USAF and environment-specific risks posed by chemical, biological, directed energy, and other radiological and physical hazards immediately and on-site so that operations can be resumed as quickly as possible. This requires enhanced monitoring capability, such as man-portable gold-standard hazard detection. Research is needed to improve these capabilities and to account for emerging threats. The mission needs driving the ability to detect also drives the need to rapidly reduce or mitigate threats once discovered. State of the art detection and monitoring equipment, therefore, is also an important FHP research need. B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project seeks to deliver improved capabilities across the full spectrum of operations in the areas of Directed Energy and Occupational and Environmental Health. Research in the Directed Energy sub-project area seeks to develop technologies to \"detect to warn\" and \"detect to protect\" AF operators such that they can take appropriate actions to prevent or minimize exposure leading to adverse health effects. Research in the Occupational and Environmental Health sub-project area involves the assessment and implementation of innovative new technologies that enable effective surveillance, detection, identification, and mitigation of hazardous chemical, biological, and physical hazards that present a health risk to our forces and threaten to degrade and disrupt the missions they execute. Air Force FHP efforts focus on health protection across the spectrum of AF air and ground operations. These include hazards presented to high performance and high flyer aircraft crews facing extreme environments within their flight envelopes that are potentially more sensitive to physiologic and cognitive stressors and rely on aircraft systems to provide life support for protection. Because Air Force installations are typically very strategically important in combat execution, they are more often tied to performing ops at fixed locations; therefore, they drive the need to detect and identify the USAF and environment-specific risks posed by chemical, biological, directed energy, and other radiological and physical hazards immediately and on-site so that operations can be resumed as quickly as possible. This requires enhanced monitoring capability, such as man-portable gold-standard hazard detection. Research is needed to improve these capabilities and to account for emerging threats. The mission needs driving the ability to detect also drives the need to rapidly reduce or mitigate threats once discovered. State of the art detection and monitoring equipment, therefore, is also an important FHP research need. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) N/A C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project area conducts research to identify, evaluate and control occupational hazards in the workplace-including all settings such as deployed, in the aircraft, in the industrial (in garrison) environment or during emergency response. Information gained means risks are more fully understood with respect to potential mission impact or long-term health effect (Go vs. No Go above some pre-defined hazard level). Key focus areas include a better understanding of dosing, rates of dosing, and mechanistic effects of chemical, biological, radiological, directed energy, and other occupational exposure threats. This includes subtle cognitive effects where there is potential mission impact. Technological opportunities towards non-invasive sensing of the human and the environment are growing and can be exploited to enhance understanding of the risks and enable development of appropriate mitigation and treatment options.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR) is an interdisciplinary translational cancer research program of the Department of Surgery, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), the Murtha Cancer Center, and the Urology Service at WRNMMC. The CPDR conducts state-of-the-art clinical and translational research with emphasis on precision medicine to enhance the readiness of active duty personnel juxtaposed with the continuum of medical care for military retirees and beneficiaries. The CPDR enriches the training of the next generation of physicians/ scientists who directly benefit the quality, outcomes, and stability of the military health care delivery system. Ground-breaking discoveries through strong academic and clinical research; e.g., over 24 yrs. and 450 publications) have led to major advances in translational prostate cancer research and treatment. The CPDR integrates expertise of urologic and epidemiologists, bio-statisticians, medical technologists, research nurses, patient educators, bioinformaticians, and program management specialists. All these areas of expertise provide state-of-the-art resources for in-house and collaborative research in prostate cancer. The program is also committed to translational research training for future generations of physicians and scientists at leading DoD medical institutions (USU, WRNMMC, JPC, NMCSD, MAMC, FY Excellence (USUHS) Description: The CPDR is at the forefront of \"cutting-edge\" clinical, basic science and epidemiologic research. The emphasis is on improving diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of prostate cancer involving new modalities such as MRI guided biopsy, gene- based biomarkers, and precision medicine strategies targeting causal gene alterations in prostate cancer. The CPDR multi- center database is a unique programmatic resource, enrolling over 27,500 DoD health care beneficiaries under suspicion for prostate cancer, with longitudinal follow up to 23 years. This database continues to highlight emerging issues in prostate cancer management such e.g., treatment outcomes, racial/ethnic differences, quality of life and discovery of novel molecular prognostic markers. In light of current issues related to overtreatment of early detected prostate cancers and poorly understood biology of prostate cancer, CPDR's long-term biospecimen banks, high-impact discoveries and collaborations are leading towards better diagnostic and prognostic molecular markers and therapeutic targets with promise in improving the management of the disease. The CPDR's health disparity research focus has uniquely benefited from studying a prostate cancer patient cohort, with a high representation of African American men, in an equal-access military health care system. Ground-breaking studies of the most validated prostate cancer gene, ERG, in over 1,500+ patients provide the first definitive information on prostate cancer biology underscoring racial/ethnic differences with potential to enhance personalized medicine. The CPDR's state-of-the-art research infrastructure and framework is providing education and training for over 100 next generation physicians, scientists, medical and graduate students within DoD medical institutions.8.443 7.250 8.203 Volume 1 - 142UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115DHA: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Agency Page 83 of 109 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 Cancer Center of Excellence Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2019 FY 2018 Plans: Precision Focus: Refine and develop modalities for diagnosing and prognosing clinically significant cancers prostate cancers.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification To better protect mounted warriors from the effects of underbody blast (UBB) caused by landmines or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), UBB Testing medical research project will provide new data on the biomechanics of human skeletal response that occurs in an attack on a ground combat vehicle. The data will provide a biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin (the Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin or WIAMan project) and the required biomedically-valid injury criteria that can be used in Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) to characterize dynamic events, the risk of injury to mounted warriors, and to support acquisition decisions. This new data will also benefit the overall DoD effort in vehicle and protection technology for the UBB threat. This work is needed to overcome the limitations of the current test manikin and injury criteria which were designed for the civilian automotive industry for frontal crash testing and as such are not adequate in the combat environment. The current manikins do not represent the modern Warrior and were not designed for the vertical acceleration environment associated with UBB events. Consequently, current LFT&E crew survivability assessment methodologies are limited in their ability to predict the types and severity of injuries seen in these events. Due to this technology gap, military ground vehicles are being fielded without fully defined levels of injury risk and crew survivability for UBB events. The data produced by this project will be used to satisfy a critical need for a scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: Underbody Blast Testing Description: Testing will provide an understanding of the biomechanics of skeletal injuries that occur in a combat vehicle UBB event involving a landmine or IED, and the biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin and associated biomedically-validated injury criteria that can be used to characterize dynamic events and injury risks for LFT&E crew survivability assessments and vehicle development efforts to better protect Warriors from UBB threats. FY 2018 Plans: Biofidelity response corridors are being used to validate second generation prototypes of the WIAMan. Human injury assessment curves continue to be developed for the lower extremities, pelvis and spine from laboratory testing that created thresholds of cadaveric fractures and subsequent severe injuries (i.e., complex fractures). Laboratory testing to generate female post mortem human subject injury tolerances continue and are being used to inform the analysis of alternatives for developing a female specific manikin.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project funds research to develop candidate Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) vaccines, to assess their safety and effectiveness in human subjects, and to protect the military personnel from risks associated with HIV infection. All HIV technology development is conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Evaluations in human subjects are conducted to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of candidate vaccines, as required by FDA regulation. Studies are conducted stepwise: first, to prove safety; second, to demonstrate the desired effectiveness of the vaccine in a small study (to demonstrate early proof-of-concept); and third, to demonstrate effectiveness in large, diverse human population clinical trials. All results are submitted to the FDA for evaluation to ultimately obtain approval (licensure) for medical use. This project supports studies for effectiveness testing on small study groups after which they transition to advanced developers for completion of effectiveness testing in larger populations. This program is jointly managed through an Interagency Agreement between the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. This project contains no duplication with any effort within the Military Departments or other government organizations. The cited work is also consistent with the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering Science and Technology focus areas. B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification DoD Cancer Moonshot - Applied Proteogenomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes (APOLLO) Consortium (USUHS) DoD's Cancer Moonshot requirement is a mission of the Murtha Cancer Center (MCC) at USU under the authority of a tri-federal Memorandum of Agreement signed July 2016 by the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (DoD), the Under Secretary of Health, Department of Veterans Affairs(VHA), and the Acting Director of the National Cancer Institute (NIH), for a tri-federal program of Clinical Proteogenomics Cancer Research. DoD's Cancer Moonshot promotes readiness and mission accomplishment of the active duty service member (ADSM) force, as well as military beneficiaries, retirees, and veterans. There are about 1,000 ASDMs who are stricken with a new cancer diagnosis annually, and MCC serves as the DoD's Health Affairs-approved Center of Excellence for cancer care and research for these ADSMs. MCC's mission is to bring translational cancer research to all patients in order to improve their health and mission performance, and to help prevent, screen, detect, and treat cancer; minimize side effects of cancer treatments;, and return to duty ADSMs stricken with cancer, as well all other DoD beneficiaries. DoD's Cancer Moonshot initiative allows for the provision of state-of-the-art molecular analysis of tumors and blood of cancer patients which will result in increased force readiness through more targeted treatment of cancers with fewer side effects, as well as better screening for cancer risk and development. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: DoD Cancer Moonshot - Applied Proteogenomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes (APOLLO) Description: Description: DoD's Cancer Moonshot at USU's MCC is a research program consisting of two overall projects, the first known as APOLLO (Applied Organizational Learning and Outcomes), and the second as DoD Framingham. APOLLO is a novel high-throughput molecular analysis of every DNA (gene), RNA, and protein expression molecule in cancer patient tumors. Such analysis has never been done on a large scale across multiple cancer types, and small pilot studies demonstrate that the APOLLO project will result in unprecedented findings across all types of cancer (with specific focus on cancers of the greatest threat to ASDMs). These new findings will be identified by using state-of-the-art tissue collection procedures in the operating rooms of all patients undergoing cancer surgery at MCC collection protocol sites (e.g.. Walter Reed NMMC;NMC Portsmouth; Diego; Womack the entire DNA genome and RNA sequence at USU, while analyzing the entire protein expression profile of these same cancers in MCC's Proteomics Laboratory, as well as other affiliated protein laboratories.

These combined data sets will be housed in National Cancer Institute (NCI) secure cloud-based servers with restricted access for analytics by teams of bioinformatics experts (i.e., from government, university, and corporate entities) across the United States working on this endeavor. This complete bio molecular (global) expression profiling of thousands of cancers of all types seen in military treatment and other facilities will predictably result in a myriad of new discoveries regarding the way cancers develop, progress, respond to treatment, evade treatment, and spread. It also will result in new ways to combat cancers and minimize side effects of cancer treatment, as well as identify novel cancer screening and prevention opportunities, while focusing on militarily-relevant cancers and ADSMs with cancer, distinguishing it from any effort that might develop in the future in a civilian organization, as none of this scale exists today. There are five specific APOLLO sub-projects, which are classified based on the organ type of cancer under study: APOLLO 1 = Lung cancer; APOLLO 2 = Gynecological cancer; APOLLO 3 = Prostate cancer; APOLLO 4 = Breast cancer; and APOLLO 5 = all other cancer types. Both of these projects in the DoD Cancer Moonshot program were specifically developed to focus on ADSM with cancer (readiness), utilize molecular laboratories that are American owned and operated (U.S. DoD and DOE), keep all sensitive de- identified clinical and molecular data on U.S. government computers and servers for maximum data security and analysis (through the NCI), and benefit the nation through any and all discoveries that are made. FY 2018 Plans: APOLLO - Collect 1,000 cancer specimens (all cancer types) and run them though the DNA, RNA, and protein molecular analysis lab platforms of USU, and perform initial data analytics on the results.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: DoD Cancer Moonshot Program - DoD Framingham Longitudinal Study Description: DoD Framingham is a novel project that is enabled by the blood serum specimens stored at the DoD Serum Repository at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) in Silver Spring, Maryland. This facility stores blood serum drawn from over 10 million ADSMs who were required to undergo mandatory semiannual blood testing for the last 25 years, resulting in this repository with over 65 million blood serum specimens. MCC tumor registry data, which includes every ADSM who developed cancer while on active duty, is matched to data in the Serum Repository. This allows MCC to identify the blood serum of ADSMs who ultimately develop cancer at key times, i.e., before they had cancer, during their cancer treatment, and after their successful cancer treatment. Four different serum specimens (two before, one during, and one after cancer diagnosis and treatment) from every ADSM who developed certain types of cancer over a ten-year period of time are then sent to the Nation's foremost protein identification (mass spectroscopy) center, i.e., the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) run by the Department of Energy (DOE). This enables identification of the entire proteome circulating in the blood serum of these cancer patients before, during, and after cancer diagnosis. Comparing the proteomes will allow for identification of new protein biomarkers and indicators of treatment response and failure both of individual patients and across all patients with a specific type of cancer. Smaller studies of this nature done by MCC researchers have proven that this is an effective strategy to identify novel diagnostic and treatment protein expression biomarkers that can be assayed in new blood tests for cancer.

By using serums that go back many years before the ADSM was diagnosed with cancer, the earliest markers of cancer that will be identified, and assays will be performed by another U.S. governmental agency with the best protein detection and analysis tools in the world. Eight specific DoD Framingham sub-projects, classified based on the organ type of cancer, will be conducted: Framingham 1 = Oropharyngeal cancer; Framingham 2 = Lymphoma; Framingham 3 = Bladder cancer; Framingham 4 = Kidney cancer; and Framinghams 5 through 8 subtypes will be determined by MCC and NCI experts in the coming months. Both the APOLLO and Framingham projects in the DoD Cancer Moonshot program were specifically developed to focus on ADSM with cancer (readiness), utilize molecular laboratories that are American owned and operated (U.S. DoD and DOE), keep all sensitive de-identified clinical and molecular data on U.S. government computers and servers for maximum data security and analysis (through the NCI), and benefit the nation through any and all discoveries that are made. FY 2018 Plans: Identify Framingham 2 (Lymphoma) serum specimens and run them through the serum protein analysis lab platform, and perform initial data analytics on the results. A de-identified dataset will be obtained from the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch related to serum samples identified by and pulled from the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR). This data set will include the following: 1) case status (i.e., case or control); 2) year of diagnosis; 3) year of the sample acquisition; 4) year of birth of the subject; 5) gender of the subject; 6) tumor stage at time of diagnosis for the cases; and 7) p16 status at time of diagnosis for the cases. If information on recurrences of the cancer for the case subjects is available, that will be provided as well (i.e., in yes/no format and with date of recurrence if applicable). Specimens to be used in this study will be serum samples from the DoDSR. The DoDSR is a repository of serially collected serum samples obtained from active duty service members from the time of their military in-processing through their discharge, taken at a minimum at two year intervals FY 2019 Plans: Identify Framingham 3 serum specimens and run them through the serum protein analysis lab platform, and perform initial data analytics on the results.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Defense Health Program (DHP) appropriations' distribution and execution of funding is currently dispersed amongst multiple, disparate accounting systems, which is in direct conflict with Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) guidance prioritizing the standardization of financial management systems and business processes. Currently DHP funding is distributed and executed across three disparate systems. The current Defense Health Agency (DHA) structure hinders the overarching goal for audit ready initiatives and agency standard financial business processes. The identified solution for DHA to meet these challenges is to deploy a single operational financial management system (FMS) with minimal mission and business impact.

Navy Medicine also funds, when appropriate, a number of small-scale, opportunistic business improvements when the technology makes a sudden advance. These projects are generally not in the scope of the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) Central Programs such as the development/integration of Defense Optical Fabrication Enterprise Management System (DOFEMS) into a fully automated system to support workload distribution, performance metrics, staffing requirements, supply management, calculation of operating costs from the current independently or manually DOFEMS system. This effort will be a web based centralized management tool and provide a standalone standard set of Lab Management software for all 26 Navy labs. Additionally, the re-design of HIV Management System (HMS) will be more user friendly, less time to perform everyday tasks and prevents the need to maintain separate databases. The re-design will also automate and minimize functions that require manual assistance and assist in fulfilling new requirements. For the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS), this program element supports IM/IT development requirements within four AFMS Chief Information Officer defined core capabilities as essential to Air Force Medical Service IM/IT mission support. Data warehousing, reporting services, systems integration, and custom application development are featured in almost all IM/IT systems and application requests. The information needs of the AFMS are growing in volume, complexity, and delivery formats. In order to meet future requirements, aggregation of more and varied data sources require increasingly complex data warehousing capabilities. Demand for dynamic analytic capability will require investments in business intelligence, predictive analytic tools, open source research data models, and emerging personalized medicine analysis. Information is still largely produced in an ad hoc manner without standard methodologies, mapping of business requirements, transparent analytic models, and distributed by office productivity software. Centralized production of standard reports, balance sheets, and dynamic query tools would relieve many managers and action officer of routine work and increase leadership decision support. AFMS medical readiness reporting and tracking has set the standard in the DoD for over a decade but multiple applications now encompass what has merged into a common process of tracking unit capability and personal health assessments. Consolidation of medical readiness applications would streamline disability, medical readiness, deployment surveillance, and flying status tracking and reporting who currently must move between multiple applications. For the Air Force, the funding in this program element provides for sustainment of the IM/IT Test Bed (IMIT-TB) capability, which is a dedicated OT location and staff encompassing the entire spectrum of healthcare services and products available in MTFs, to provide risk controlled testing of designated core and interim medical applications in a live environment. Defense Health Agency (DHA) Health Information Technology (HIT) [previously known as Tri-Service IM/IT] - DHA HIT RDT&E activities includes funding for development/integration, modernization, test and evaluation for the Defense Health Agency initiatives, and any special interest that are shared within all centralized components of the Defense Health Program (DHP). The DHP RDT&E appropriation includes the following TMA initiatives: Electronic Commerce System (E-Commerce): This system was developed for centralized collection, integration, and reporting of accurate purchased care contracting and financial data. It provides an integrated set of data reports from multiple data sources to management, as well as tools to control the end-to-end program change management process. E-Commerce is composed of several major applications including: Contract Management (CM), utilizing Prism software to support contract action development and documentation; Resource Management (RM), employing Oracle Federal Financials and TED interface software to support the budgeting, accounting, case recoupment, and disbursement processes; Document Management, utilizing Document software to provide electronic storage, management, and retrieval of contract files; Management Tracking and Reporting, utilizing custom software to Volume 1 - 186UNCLASSIFIED PE 0605013DHA: Information Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Agency Page 5 of 73 R-1 Line #8Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2019 Defense Health Agency Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0605013DHA / Information Technology Development provide reports to assist in the management and tracking of changes to the managed care contracts as well as current and out year liabilities; the Purchased Care and Contractor's Resource Center web sites that provide up-to-date financial information for both TMA and the Services concerning the military treatment facilities (MTFs), and expenditures for MTF enrollee purchased care and supplemental care. E-Commerce includes an infrastructure of over 60 servers supporting development, test, and production. E-Commerce is employed by several hundred users in more than 7 different organizations. Project oversight and coordination must be provided to ensure that the needs of the disparate organizations are met without influencing system performance or support to any individual user. Server configurations must remain current with respect to security policies, user authorizations, and interactions with other systems and functions.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Legacy Data Repository (LDR) will provide the strategy, analysis, and solution to assume data management and governance for legacy Clinical and Business data for Defense Health Agency's Solutions Delivery Division systems that will be decommissioned as the Military Health System (MHS) Genesis electronic health record is deployed. As MHS Genesis deploys to each site, legacy systems cannot decommission without a legacy data repository to safely and securely migrate data - absence a LDR solution negates and ignores the underlying requirement. Clinicians without access to legacy patient history can create a direct patient safety issue. The legacy component of a patient's Legal Medical Record will no longer be accessible once MHS Genesis rolls out. LDR will identify, capture, organize, disseminate, and synthesize required legacy data needed to support medical information requirements for Business Intelligence (BI), Continuity of Care, and Archival in support of Defense Health Modernization Systems (DHMS) deployment plans, legacy system decommissioning plans, and operations and sustainment activities within their areas of responsibility. This initial investment would allow the MHS to realize cost savings by decommissioning systems with overlapping capabilities to MHS Genesis, and reduce the legacy system footprint across the enterprise. Further, LDR would make legacy data available for clinicians through a clinical viewer to compliment the longitudinal record of MHS Genesis. This project will enable clinicians to holistically view a service member's medical record through both MHS Genesis and a legacy viewer. Downstream system dependent on legacy data would also be benefited through a persistence of this information. As the LDR takes responsibility for legacy data, it must be retained within a flexible, scalable, and cost effective platform, but must also maintain the discipline of existing MHS data governance and management standards. While meeting these data governance and management standards, legacy data will be maintained in a variety of formats and degrees of normalization and structuring (i.e. discrete data, document, object, and file level).

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Army, the Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBO2) clinical trials focus on research related to the development of treatment modalities using HBO2 for chronic post- concussion syndrome after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Three HBO2 human clinical trials were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of HBO2 treatments for Service members who have experienced one or more concussions and who are symptomatic at, or after, the time of post-deployment health reassessments: 1- A pilot phase II (narrow population safety and effectiveness) study of hyperbaric oxygen for persistent post-concussive symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (HOPPS), 2- Brain Injury and Mechanisms of Action of Hyperbaric Oxygen for Persistent Post-Concussive Symptoms after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (BIMA), and 3- Development of Normative Datasets for Assessments Planned for Use in Patients with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (Normal). A fourth retrospective study, Long Term Follow-up (LTFU), is focused on the lessons learned from long-term follow-up of subjects enrolled in the Department of Defense (DoD) primary HBO2 trials. To support these protocols, four HBO2 study sites were established within the Military Health System. Each of the research sites consisted of a hyperbaric oxygen chamber enclosed in a mobile trailer, a second mobile trailer for testing and evaluation of the subjects, and a third subject staging trailer. This information is intended to inform DoD policy decisions regarding the use of HBO2 therapy as a treatment for mTBI. B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program was established in the Defense Health Program (DHP), Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation during FY 2001, and is funded in the year of execution. The objective of the DHP SBIR Program includes stimulating technological innovation, strengthening the role of small business in meeting Department of Defense (DoD) research and development needs, fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing the commercial application of DoD-supported research and development results. The program funds small business proposals chosen to enhance military medical research and information technology research. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program was established in the DHP, RDT&E appropriation during FY 2015, and is funded in the year of execution. The STTR Program, although modeled substantially on the SBIR Program, is a separate program and is separately financed. Central to the program is expansion of the public/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small businesses and nonprofit research institutions. The unique feature of the STTR program is the requirement for the small business to formally collaborate with a research institution in Phase I and Phase II. STTR's most important role is to bridge the gap between performance of basic science and commercialization of resulting innovations. The mission of the STTR program is to support scientific excellence and technological innovation through the investment of Federal research funds in critical American priorities to build a strong national economy. The programs' goals are to stimulate technological innovation, foster technology transfer through cooperative research and development between small businesses and research institutions, and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal research and development. Both the SBIR and STTR programs address the President's multi-agency science and technology priority of innovation in life sciences, biology, and neuroscience through coordination with the Joint Program Committees, which manage multi-Service DHP-sponsored research.

FY 2018 Program Funding Summary ($ in Millions) N/A Remarks D. Acquisition Strategy The PE 6.7 Program Manager solicits proposals annually. Civilian and military intramural DoD laboratory investigators are eligible to apply. Awardees may collaborate with extramural (e.g., academia or industry) entities. Submitted proposals undergo a two-level review - one technical and one programmatic. A technical assessment of the proposals is solicited from the respective subject matter experts within the Joint Program Committees and the advanced development community. Following this, a programmatic review is performed by senior Service experts representing the science and technology base and advanced development. After the programmatic review, funding recommendations are forwarded to the Defense Health Agency - J9/Research and Development for final approval prior to award. E. Performance Metrics Principal Investigators will provide quarterly reports and a final report. Performance is measured based on the number of products for which testing either certifies use in a given environment (e.g., sufficiently ruggedized, airworthiness testing) and/or results in a recommendation of a specific product, and delivery of an enhanced product or knowledge product. The benchmark performance metric for research supported in this PE will be the enhancement of a maturity level that is typical of TRL 9.

Description of Operations Supported: Provides resources needed to fund the incremental (above baseline) costs to support Operation FREEDOM'S SENTINEL (OFS) in Afghanistan, Operation INHERENT RESOLVE (OIR) in Iraq and the Levant, increasing efforts to support European allies and deter aggression (European Reassurance Initiative), and supporting a partnership-focused approach to counterterrorism. The resource amounts provided are consistent with the Department's force level budgetary assumptions. These incremental funds provide medical and dental services to active forces, mobilized Reserve Components (RC), and their family members in support of these operations. The Defense Health Program (DHP) baseline budget request does not fund the medical and dental support requirements within the Area of Responsibility (AOR). Other DHP operational requirements in support of these operations include: Pre/Post deployment processing for personnel, aeromedical transportation of casualties from Germany to the U.S., and contracted civilian medical personnel to backfill deployed permanent Military Treatment Facility (MTF) staff. Additional support requirements include telemedicine for theater and post deployment health assessments (between 3-6 months after deployment). In House Care: -Incremental costs for health care for casualties above the baseline budget -Incremental costs for deployment related prophylactic pharmaceuticals -Backfill of deployed permanent medical personnel Private Sector Care -Healthcare for mobilized RC and their family members Consolidated Health Support -Aeromedical transportation of casualties from Germany to the USDefense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP-5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Summary: in Thousands) DHP OCO 96,415 61,857 72,627 Narrative Justification: Funding in this budget activity group directly supports pre-post deployment activities such as medical records reviews, hearing and vision exams, medical evaluations, immunizations and behavioral health screening for all deploying and returning soldiers. Funding also supports backfill of deployed personnel with medical staff to sustain the delivery of patient care in Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Increase in requirement from FY 2018 to FY 2019 is based on increase in forecasted deployments. Impact if not funded: The Military Treatment Facilities' (MTFs') primary mission is to provide healthcare to uniformed service personnel. Funding is required to Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP-5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group DHP-529provide the additional medical and dental care for the mobilized forces not funded in the baseline budget. Without this funding, MTF services and access to care will be adversely impacted. MTFs would have to reduce access to care for non-active duty beneficiaries (retirees and family members) resulting in disengagement of these beneficiaries to the private sector for healthcare services. If funding is not provided to backfill the healthcare positions vacated in the MTFs by deployed medical personnel, components will have to redirect funding from other direct care system requirements to sustain the continuity of healthcare to patients.Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP-5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group DHP-530A. Subactivity Group -Private Sector Care ($ in Thousands) FY 2018 2019 Actual Estimate Estimate 277,066 Narrative Justification: Funding provides Reserve Component (RC) personnel and their family members with healthcare, pharmacy and dental benefits. Mobilized RC personnel and their family members are eligible for medical and dental similar to active duty personnel, including access to private sector care providers through the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contract (MCSC) provider networks. This access to MCSC provider networks also supports those beneficiaries living in remote locations outside the established network areas. TRICARE Reserve Select program, offered to RC members who enroll and share premiums with the government, is not included in this requirement. Impact if not funded: Providing healthcare to mobilized RC personnel and their families is congressionally mandated. This is a must-pay bill and the cost will be incurred regardless of the availability of funding. If funding is not provided, lower priority healthcare requirements will be delayed so that funding can be shifted to pay for the healthcare services.Defense Health Program Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Budget Estimates Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group Exhibit OP-5 - DHP OCO, Operation and Maintenance by Subactivity Group DHP-531Narrative Justification: Requirements in this budget activity group cover costs associated with the cost to transport wounded warriors by aircraft from outside the theater of operations to the United States and costs to resupply medical evacuation equipment and ground transportation costs for patients outside of the theater. Projections for deployed active and reserve component forces in FY 2019 contribute to an increase in the overall requirement. Impact if not funded: Aeromedical transport missions would require additional internal funding offsets such as delays in infrastructure improvements and equipment or supply procurement. A.
