It is one of the things that all Naturopathic Doctors are trained in. Some go on to specialize in homeopathy, focusing their practice on the use of this one modality. Other Naturopathic Doctors use it as just one of the options they have to treat with. However, you do not need to be a doctor to be a homeopath. Some of the best homeopaths in the world have spent their lives dedicated to learning this very complex system without going to medical school. So, when you get down to it, homeopathy is a powerful, energetic type of medicine. It uses remedies that have been potentized by diluting them. You'd have to speak to a quantum physicist to really get an understanding of how that works. All I can tell you is that when it's been explained to me, it makes sense, but there is no chance I could repeat it. What I do know is that by pairing up your symptoms with a remedy that has the same symptom picture, you can take the remedy and it's as if they cancel each other out so that you no longer have the symptoms. It sounds simple, right? Not exactly. Every person is so different that finding the correct, matching remedy is quite challenging. This is why it can take years of study to be really good at homeopathy. Naturopathy, on the other hand, is a medical practice that gives the body what it needs to heal. It is medicine that looks at each person as a whole, treating the person instead of the parts. It is medicine that looks to find the cause of ailments and fix it so the symptoms disappear. Homeopathy, again, is just one of the tools that a Naturopathic Doctor can use to help people achieve optimal health. "}
