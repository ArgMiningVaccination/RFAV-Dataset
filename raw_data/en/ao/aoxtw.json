The black garbage bags, filled with cardboard to make them look like body bags with coronavirus victims inside, were placed outside the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC. The demonstration also included a motorcade in which a truck carried a giant inflatable chicken made to look like Mr Trump. The protest was organised in part by left-wing non-profit organisation The Center for Popular Democracy, the Washington Post reported.

He later walked back the comments, saying he was speaking \"sarcastically\". Earlier this week, the head of the US agency in charge of developing a vaccine against coronavirus said , a drug endorsed by Mr Trump that is yet to undergo thorough vetting. Dr Rick Bright said he was removed on Tuesday as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the government agency for developing and procuring treatments and vaccines, and moved to a lesser position in the National Institutes of Health. Since mid-March, Mr Trump has advocated for the use of chloroquine to treat COVID-19 infections, with scant evidence from studies of its safety or effectiveness. The House of Representatives voted on Thursday to add another nearly half-trillion US dollars to efforts to stimulate an economy ravaged by the coronavirus shutdown. The funds will be used to support small businesses, finance hospitals and expand COVID-19 testing. With the Trump administration pressing for a return to some form of economic stability, several states have taken steps to ease lockdowns. \"We're opening our country. It's very exciting to see,\" Mr Trump said. People in Australia must stay at least 1.5 metres away from others and gatherings are limited to two people unless you are with your family or household.
