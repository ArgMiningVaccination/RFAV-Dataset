The primary focus is on diseases and conditions for which sufficient data existto evaluate an association with physical activity, the strength of such relationships, and their potential biologic mechanisms. Because most of the research to date has addressed the health effects of endurance- type physical activity (involving repetitive use oflarge muscle groups, such as in walking and bicy- cling), this chapter focuses on that type of activity. Unless otherwise specified, the term physical activity should be understood to refer to endurance-type physical activity. Less well studied are the healtheffects of resistance-type physical activity (i.e., that which develops muscular strength); when this type of physical activity is discussed, it is specified as such. Much of the research summarized is based on studies having only white men as participants; itremains to be clarified whether the relationships described here are the same for women, racial and ethnic minority groups, and people with disabilities. Physical activity is difficult to measure directly. Three types of physical activity measures have been used in observational studies over the last 40 years. Most studies have relied on self-reported level ofphysical activity, as recalled by people prompted by a questionnaire or interview. A more objectively measured characteristic is cardiorespiratory fitness (also referred to as cardiorespiratory endurance) which is measured by aerobic power (see Chapter 2for more information on measurement issues). Some studies have relied on occupation to classify people according to how likely they were to be physically active at work.Epidemiologic studies of physical activity and health have compared the activity levels of peoplewho have or develop diseases and those who do not. Cohort studies follow populations forward in time to observe how physical activity habits affect disease occurrence or death. In case-control studies, groups of persons who have disease and separate groups ofpeople who do not have disease are asked to recall their previous physical activity. Cross-sectional stud- ies assess the association between physical activity and disease at the same point in time. Clinical trials, on the other hand, attempt to alter physical activitypatterns and then assess whether disease occurrence is modified as a result. Results from epidemiologic studies can be used to estimate the relative magnitude or strength of an association between physical activity and a health outcome. Two such measures used in this chapter are risk ratio (RR) and odds ratio (OR). For thesemeasures, an estimate of 1.0 indicates no association, when the risk of disease is equivalent in the two groups being compared. RR or OR estimates greater than 1.0 indicate an increase in risk; those less than 1.0 indicate a decreased risk. Confidence intervals(CI) reported with estimates of association indicate the precision of the estimate, as well as its statistical significance. When the CI range includes 1.0, the effect is considered likely to have occurred by chance; therefore the estimate of association is not consid-ered statistically significantly different from the null value of 1.0. Overall Mortality Persons with moderate to high levels of physical activity or cardiorespiratory fitness have a lowermortality rate than those with sedentary habits or86Physical Activity and Health low cardiorespiratory fitness. For example, com- pared with people who are most active, sedentarypeople experience between a 1.2-fold to a 2-fold increased risk of dying during the follow-up interval (Slattery and Jacobs Mao 1992; Paffenbarger et al. 1993). Associations are generally stronger for measured cardiorespiratory fitness than for reported physical activity (Blair, Kohl, Paffenbarger 1989). Blair, Kohl, and Barlow (1993) showed that low levels of cardio- respiratory fitness were strongly associated withoverall mortality for both women (RR = 5.35; 95% CI, 2.44-11.73) and men (RR = 3.16; 95% CI, 1.92- 5.20). The association with physical inactivity was weaker for men (RR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.06-2.74), and there was no association for women (RR = 0.95; 95%CI, 0.54-1.70). Though cardiorespiratory fitness may be the better indicator of regular physical activity, the level of reported physical activity has been associated with reduced all-cause mortality. Paffenbarger, Lee, and Leung (1994) evaluated several types of recalled activity (walking, stair climbing, all sports, moderate-level sports, and total energy expended in activity per week) as predictors of all-cause mortality among male Harvard alumni. Among these men, the relative risk of death within the follow-up period was reduced to 0.67 with walking 15 or more kilometers per week(reference group, < 5 kilometers/week), to 0.75 with climbing 55 or more flights of stairs per week (refer- ence group, < 20 flights/week), to 0.63 with involve- ment in moderate sports (reference group, no involvement), and to 0.47 with 3 or more hours ofmoderate sports activities per week (reference group, < 1 hour/week). Most importantly, there was a signifi- cant trend of decreasing risk of death across increas- ing categories of distance walked, flights of stairs climbed, and degree of intensity of sports play. Researchers have also examined age-specific ef- fects of different levels of physical activity on all-cause mortality. Kaplan and colleagues (1987) have shown that physical activity level has an effect on death rates among both older and younger persons. Data from a study of 9,484 Seventh-Day Adventist men aged 30 years or older in 1958 who werefollowed through 1985 indicated that both moderate and intense levels of activity reduced overall risk ofdeath even late in life (Lindsted, Tonstad, Kuzma 1991). Both moderate and vigorous levels of activity were equally protective at age 50 years. The protec- tive effect of high levels of activity lasted only until age 70 , but the protective effect for moderate activitylasted beyond age 80. The studies cited thus far in this section assessed physical activity or cardiorespiratory fitness at baseline only and then followed up for mortality. A stronger test for a causal relationship is to examine the effect that changing from lower to higher levels of physical activity or cardiorespiratory fitness hason subsequent mortality. Two large studies provide such evidence. Among middle-aged Harvard male alumni who were sedentary in 1962 or 1966, those who took up moderately intense sports activity dur- ing the study's 11 years of follow-up had a 23 percentlower death rate (RR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58-0.96) than those who remained sedentary (Paffenbarger et al. 1993). (By comparison, men who quit smoking during the interval had a 41 percent decrease in death rate [RR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.43-0.80].) Men45-84 years of age who took up moderately intense sports extended their longevity on average by 0.72 years; added years of life were observed in all age groups, including men 75-84 years of age (Paffenbarger et al. 1993). Similar reductions in death rates with increases in cardiorespiratory fitness were reported for men inthe Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study. Blair and colleagues (1995) reported a reduction in death rates among healthy men (aged 20-82 years) who im- proved their initially low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness. The men performed two maximal exercisetests an average of 4.8 years apart; follow-up for mortality after the second test occurred an average of 4.7 years later. Among men in the bottom fifth of the cardiorespiratory fitness distribution, those who improved to at least a moderate fitness level had a 44percent lower death rate than their peers who re- mained in the bottom fifth (RR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41- 0.75). After multivariate adjustment, those who became fit had a significant 64 percent reduction in their relative mortality rate. In comparison, menwho stopped smoking reduced their adjusted RR by about 50 percent.87The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease Conclusions The data reviewed here suggest that regular physical activity and higher cardiorespiratory fitness decrease overall mortality rates in a dose-response fashion. Whereas most studies of physical activity and health address specific diseases and health conditions, the studies in this chapter provide more insight into thebiologic mechanisms by which mortality rate reduc- tion occurs. Cardiovascular Diseases Despite a progressive decline since the late 1960s, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including coronaryheart disease (CHD) and stroke, remain major causes of death, disability, and health care expenditures in the United States (NCHS 1994; Gillum 1994). In 1992, more than 860,000 deaths in the United States were attributed to heart disease and stroke (DHHS1994). High blood pressure, a major risk factor for CVD, affects about 50 million Americans (National Institutes of Health [NIH] 1993), including an esti- mated 2.8 million children and adolescents 6-17 years of age (Task Force on Blood Pressure Controlin Children 1987). The prevalence of CVD increases with age and is higher among African Americans than whites. The majority of population-based research in the area of physical activity and health has focused on some aspect of CVD. Cardiovascular Diseases Combined Most of the reported studies relating physical activityto CVD have reported CVD mortality as an endpoint; two also reported on nonfatal disease, and one re- ported on CVD hospitalization (Table 4-1). Sevencohort studies evaluated the association between level of physical activity and the risk of total CVD (Kannel and Sorlie LaCroixet al. 1996). All relied on a single point-in-time estimate of physical activity, in some cases assessed as long as 26 years before the end of the observational period, and four had follow-up periods of > 14 years. Four of the seven studies found both an inverseassociation and a dose-response gradient between level of physical activity and risk of CVD outcome (Kannel and Sorlie 1979; Paffenbarger et al. 1984;Kannel et al. 1986; LaCroix et al. 1996). One study among men found an inverse association among themoderately active group but less of an effect in the vigorously active group (Lindsted, Tonstad, Kuzma 1991). One study of women 50-74 years of age found no relationship of physical activity with CVD mor- tality (Sherman et al. 1994). Five large cohort studies have related cardiores- piratory fitness to the risk of CVD mortality (Arraiz,Wigle, Ekelund et Paffenbarger 1989; Sandvik et al. 1993; Blair et al. 1995), but only one provided a separate analysis for women (Blair, Kohl, Paffenbarger 1989). Each of these studies demonstrated an inverse dose-responserelationship between level of cardiorespiratory fit- ness and CVD mortality. Three of the five studies relied on a maximal or near-maximal exercise test to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness. One study (Blair et al. 1995) demonstrated that men with low cardio-respiratory fitness who became fit had a lower risk of CVD mortality than men who remained unfit. Taken together, these major cohort studies indi- cate that low levels of physical activity or cardiores- piratory fitness increase risk of CVD mortality. Findings seem to be more consistent for studies of cardiorespiratory fitness, perhaps because of itsgreater precision of measurement, than for those of reported physical activity. The demonstrated dose- response relationship indicates that the benefit de- rived from physical activity occurs at moderate levels of physical activity or cardiorespiratory fitness andincreases with increasing levels of physical activity or higher levels of fitness. Coronary Heart Disease Numerous studies have examined the relationship between physical activity and CHD as a specific CVDoutcome. Reviews of the epidemiologic literature (Powell et al. 1987; Berlin and Colditz 1990; Blair 1994) have concluded that physical activity is strongly and inversely related to CHD risk. Although physical exertion may transiently increase the risk of an acutecoronary event among persons with advanced coro- nary atherosclerosis, particularly among those who do not exercise regularly (Mittleman et al. 1993; Willich et al. 1993; Siscovick et al. 1984), physically active people have a substantially lower overall riskfor major coronary events.88Physical Activity and Health Table 4-1.

Studies published before 1978 predominantly classified physical activ- ity level by job title or occupational activities. Studies thereafter usually defined activity level by recall of leisure-time activity or by such activity combinedwith occupational activity. These later studies were also able to control statistically for many potentially confounding variables in addition to age. Most of these studies focused on men in the age ranges associated with increasing risk of CHD (30-75 years);only four included women. Although in several stud- ies, CHD mortality was the sole outcome variable, most included both fatal and nonfatal disease. All but one (Morris et al. 1973) were cohort studies; lengths of follow-up from baseline assessment ranged from 4to 25 years. All studies related a single baseline estimate of physical activity level to risk of CHD during the follow-up period. Some study populations have had more than one follow-up assessment for CHD. For example, three follow-up assessments (at 10, 12, and 23 years) have been reported for men in the Honolulu Heart Pro-gram (Yano, Reed, McGee 1984; Donahue et al. 1988; Rodriguez et al. 1994). Each represented follow-up further removed from the original determination of physical activity. Thus, the diminishing effect seen over time might indicate changing patterns of physicalactivity\u2014and thereby a lessening of validity of the original physical activity classification (Table 4-2).Oddly, in the 12-year follow-up, the reduction in CHD risk observed among both active middle-aged men (RR = 0.7) and active older men (RR = 0.4) when compared with their least active counterparts was not diminished by bivariate adjustment forserum cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), or blood pressure (Donahue et al. 1988). In the 23-year follow-up, however, the reduction in CHD risk among active men (RR = 0.8) was greatly diminished by simultaneous adjustment for serum cholesterol,BMI, blood pressure, and diabetes (RR = 0.95), leading the authors to conclude that the beneficial effect of physical activity on CHD risk is likely mediated by the beneficial effect of physical activity on these other factors (Rodriguez et al. 1994). Thesereports thus illustrate not only the problem of lengthy follow-up without repeated assessments of physical activity but also the problem of lack of uniformity in adjustment for potential confounding factors, as well as the underlying, thorny problem of adjustment formultiple factors that may be in the causal pathway between physical activity and disease. Studies have in fact varied greatly in the extent to which they have controlled for potential confounding and in the factors selected for adjustment. Although early studies were not designed to dem- onstrate a dose-response gradient between physical91The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease Dose Adjustment for confounders Main findings response*and other comments Inverse association; relative to highest fitness No Point estimates adjusted for age, BMI, sex, and level, persons in \"moderate\" and \"low\" smoking categories had risks of 0.8 (95% CI, 0.1-7.6) and 5.4 (95% CI, 1.9-15.9), respectively Inverse association; relative to men in lowest Yes Extensive control for confounding influences fitness quartile, multivariate adjusted RR in quartiles 2, 3, and 4 were 0.59, 0.45, and 0.41, respectively Inverse association; relative to men who Yes For each minute of improvement in exercise test remained unfit (lowest 20% of distribution), time, adjusted CVD mortality risk was reduced those who improved had an age-adjusted RR 8.6% of 0.48 (95% = cardiovascular interval; HMO = health maintenance organization; ICD = International Classification of Diseases (8 and 9 refer to editions); RR = relative risk. *A dose-response relationship requires more than 2 levels of comparison.

Of the 17 recent studies that found an inverse relationship and were able to examine dose- response relationships, 13 (76 percent) demonstrated an inverse dose-response gradient between level ofphysical activity and risk of CHD, whereas 2 showed a dose-response gradient only for some subgroups. The relationship between cardiorespiratory fit- ness and risk of CHD was examined in seven cohort studies (follow-up range, 4-20 years). All but two (Lie, Mundal, Erikssen 1985; Erikssen 1986) used estimates of aerobic power based on submaximalexercise testing. None of these studies included women. Similar to the studies of physical activity and CHD, these all related a single baseline assess- ment of cardiorespiratory fitness to risk of CHD during the follow-up period. Most controlled statis-tically for possible confounding variables. All seven studies showed an inverse association between cardiorespiratory fitness and CHD. Of the six studies that had more than two categories of cardio- respiratory fitness, all demonstrated an inversedose-response gradient. Two recent meta-analyses of studies of physical activity and CHD have included independent scoringfor the quality of the methods used in each study (Powell et al. 1987; Berlin and Colditz 1990). Both concluded that studies with higher-quality scores tended to show higher relative risk estimates than those with lower-quality scores. In the Berlin andColditz quantitative meta-analysis, the pooled rela- tive risk for CHD\u2014comparing risk for the lowest level of physical activity with risk for the highest level\u2014 was 1.8 among the studies judged to be of higher quality. In contrast, the pooled relative risk for thestudies with low-quality scores was in the null range. CVD Risk Factors in Children Because CHD is rare in children, the cardiovascular effects of physical activity in children are assessed through the relationship of physical activity withCHD risk factors such as elevated low-density lipo- protein cholesterol (LDL-C), lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and elevated blood pressure. The presence of CHD risk factors in chil- dren is of concern because of evidence that athero-sclerosis begins in childhood (Stary 1989), that presence of CHD in adults is related to elevated blood92Physical Activity and Health Table 4-2.

Recently, Armstrong and Simons-Morton (1994) reviewed the research literature on physical activity and blood lipids in children and adolescents, includ- ing over 20 observational and 8 intervention studies. They concluded that the cross-sectional observa- tional studies did not demonstrate a relationshipbetween physical activity level or cardiorespiratory fitness and total cholesterol, LDL-C, or HDL-C, especially when differences in body weight or fat were taken into account, suggesting that activity and body fat are not independently related to serumlipids. However, highly physically active or fit chil- dren and adolescents tended to have higher HDL-C than their inactive or unfit peers. The intervention studies generally showed favorable effects of exer- cise on LDL-C or HDL-C only in children andadolescents who were at high risk for CHD because of obesity, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or having a parent with three or more CHD risk factors. Alpert and Wilmore (1994) recently reviewed the research literature on physical activity and blood pressure in children and adolescents, including 18 observational and 11 intervention studies. Theseauthors found evidence in studies of normotensive children and adolescents that higher levels of physi- cal activity tended to be related to lower blood pressure. The associations were generally reduced in magnitude in those studies that adjusted for BMI,suggesting that lower body fat mass may at least partly explain why physical activity is related to lower blood pressure. Intervention studies tended to show that training programs lowered blood pressure by 1-6 mm Hg in normotensive children and adoles-cents, although the effects were inconsistent for boys and girls and for systolic and diastolic blood pres- sure. In hypertensive children and adolescents, physi- cal activity interventions lowered blood pressure to a greater degree than in their normotensive peers(by approximately 10 mm Hg), although statistical significance was not always achieved because of small sample sizes. Interpreting these studies on lipids and blood pressure in children and adolescents is hindered by several factors. Studies used a variety of physical activity categorizations, and the interventions cov-ered a wide range of frequency, type, duration, andintensity, which were not all specified. The difficul- ties of assessing physical activity by self-report inchildren and adolescents, together with the highly self-selected population in the observational studies, may account for the less consistent findings on lipids and physical activity that were reported for children and adolescents than for adults. The relationshipbetween dose of physical activity and amount of effect on blood pressure or serum lipids in children has not been adequately addressed. Nonetheless, there appears to be some evidence, although not strong, of a direct relationship between physical activity and HDL-C level in children and adolescents. There is also evidence that increasedphysical activity can favorably influence the lipid profile in children and adolescents who are at high risk of CHD. Similarly, the evidence suggests that physical activity can lower blood pressure in chil- dren and adolescents, particularly in those who haveelevated blood pressure. Stroke A major cardiovascular problem in developed coun- tries, stroke (ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke) is the third leading cause of death in the United States(NCHS 1994). Atherosclerosis of the extracranial and intracranial arteries, which triggers thrombosis, is thought to be the underlying pathologic basis of ischemic stroke. Cigarette smoking and high blood pressure are major risk factors for ischemic stroke,whereas high blood pressure is the major determi- nant of hemorrhagic stroke. The studies cited in this section examined the association between reported level of physical activity and stroke. No published studies have examined the association between car-diorespiratory fitness and stroke. Fourteen population-based studies (four that include women) relate physical activity to risk of all types of stroke; these closely parallel the study designs and populations previously cited for CVD and CHD (Table 4-3). Thirteen of the studies were cohort studies (follow-up range, 5-26 years). Onlyeight found an inverse association. As with the earlier studies on CHD, the earlier studies of stroke did not permit a dose-response evaluation. Among later studies that could do so by virtue of design, half did not find a gradient. This outcome, coupledwith some suggestion of a \"U-shaped\" association103The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease in two studies (Menotti and Seccareccia 1985; Lindsted, Tonstad, Kuzma 1991), casts doubt on thenature of the association between physical activity and risk of both types of strokes combined. Because of their different pathophysiologies, physical activity may not affect ischemic and hemor- rhagic stroke in the same way; this issue requires more research. Only one study distinguished be- tween ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (Abbott etal. 1994). In this study, inactive men were more likely than active men to have a hemorrhagic stroke; physi- cal activity was also associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke in smokers but not in nonsmokers. Thus the existing data do not unequivocally support an association between physical activity and risk of stroke. High Blood Pressure High blood pressure is a major underlying cause ofcardiovascular complications and mortality. Organ damage and complications related to elevated blood pressure include left ventricular hypertrophy (whichcan eventually lead to left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure), hemorrhagic stroke, aortic aneurysms and dissections, renal failure, and retinopathy. Atherosclerotic complications of high blood pressure include CHD, ischemic stroke, andperipheral vascular disease. Although rates of hyper- tension have been declining in the United States since 1960, nearly one in four Americans can be classified as being hypertensive (DHHS 1995). Prospective observational studies relating physi- cal activity level or cardiorespiratory fitness to risk of hypertension are summarized in Table 4-4.Several cohort studies have followed male college alumni after graduation. One found later develop- ment of hypertension to be inversely related to the reported number of hours per week of participation in sports or exercise while in college (Paffenbarger,Thorne, Wing 1968). In a later follow-up of the same cohort, using information on physical ac- tivity during mid-life, vigorous sports were asso- ciated with a 19-30 percent reduction in risk of developing hypertension over the 14-year period(Paffenbarger et al. 1991). Follow-up of a different cohort of male college alumni similarly showed the least active men to have a 30 percent increased risk of developing hypertension (Paffenbarger et al.1983). In a study of 55- through 69-year-old women followed for 2 years, the most active women werefound to have a 30 percent reduced risk of develop- ing hypertension (Folsom et al. 1990). One randomized trial for the primary prevention of hypertension has been conducted. A 5-year trial of a nutrition and physical activity intervention showed that the incidence of hypertension for the interven- tion group was less than half that of the control group(Stamler et al. 1989). Participants in the intervention group lost more weight than those in the control group, reduced more of their sodium and alcohol intake, and were more likely to become more physi- cally active. Although the effects of the nutritionaland physical activity components of this interven- tion cannot be separated, the study does show that the risk for developing hypertension among persons who are at high risk for the disease can be lowered by weight loss and improvements in dietary and physi-cal activity practices. Like physical inactivity, low cardiorespiratory fitness in middle age is associated with increased risk for high blood pressure. After adjustment for sex, age, baseline blood pressure, and body mass index, persons with low cardiorespiratory fitness had a 52 percent higher risk of later developing high bloodpressure than their fit peers (Blair et al. 1984). Taken together, the cohort studies show that physical inactivity is associated with an increased risk of later developing hypertension among both men and women. Three of the studies had more than two categories of physical activity for comparison, and each demonstrated a dose-response gradientbetween amount of activity and degree of protection from hypertension. Point estimates for quantifica- tion of risk suggest that those least physically active have a 30 percent greater risk of developing hyper- tension than their most active counterparts. Unfor-tunately, none of these studies was conducted in minority populations, which have a disproportion- ate burden of hypertensive disease (DHHS 1995). Several randomized controlled trials have been conducted to determine the effects of exercise on blood pressure in people with elevated blood pres- sure levels. The reduction of elevated blood pressureis important for preventing stroke and CHD, for which high blood pressure is a risk factor with a dose-response relationship (NIH 1992).

The two meta-analyses indepen-dently concluded that aerobic exercise decreases both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by ap- proximately 6-7 mm Hg. Some of the studies were conducted with persons with defined hypertension (> 140/90 mm Hg), and others were conducted withpersons with high normal blood pressure. Most of the studies tested aerobic training of 60-70 percent maximum oxygen uptake, 3-4 times/week, 30-60 minutes per session. Three trials have specifically examined the effect of different intensities of exercise on blood pressure. Hagberg et al. (1989) randomly assigned 33 hyper-tensive participants to a nonexercising control group and to two groups participating in different intensi- ties of exercise (53 percent and 73 percent of VO 2 max) for 9 months. Both exercise groups had compa- rable decreases in diastolic blood pressure (11-12mm Hg), and the lower-intensity group had a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure than the higher- intensity group (20 mm Hg vs. 8 mm Hg). All the decreases were statistically significant when com- pared with the control group's blood pressure level,except the 8 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure in the higher-intensity group. Matsusaki and colleagues (1992) randomly assigned 26 mildly hypertensive participants to two exercise intensities (50 percent VO 2 max and 75 percent VO2 max) for 10 weeks. The pretest-to-posttest decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the lower-workload group were significant (9 mm Hg/6 mm Hg), but those in the higher-intensity group were not (3 mm Hg/5 mm Hg). Marceau and colleagues (1993) useda randomized crossover design to compare intensi- ties of 50 percent and 70 percent VO 2 max training on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure in persons with hypertension. A similar reduction in 24-hour blood pressure was observed for both training intensities(5 mm Hg decrease), but diurnal patterns of reduc- tion were different. These trials provide some evidence that moderate- intensity activity may achieve a similar, or an evengreater, blood-pressure-lowering effect than vigor ous-intensity activity. Because few studies have directly addressed the intensity question, however, the research base is not strong enough to draw a firm conclusion about the role of activity intensity in lowering blood pressure. It is not clear, for example, how the findings could have been affected by severalissues, such as use of antihypertensive medications, changes in body weight, lack of direct intervention- control comparisons, dropout rates, and total caloric expenditure. Biologic Plausibility Multiple physiological mechanisms may contributeto the protective effects of physical activity against CVDs. Postulated mechanisms involve advantageous effects on atherosclerosis, plasma lipid/lipoprotein profile, blood pressure, availability of oxygenatedblood for heart muscle needs (ischemia), blood clot- ting (thrombosis), and heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias) (Haskell 1995; Leon 1991a; Gordon and Scott 1991). Other effects of activity that may be associated with modifications of CVD risk include reduced incidence of obesity, healthier distribution ofbody fat, and reduced incidence of non-insulin- dependent diabetes. These other effects are dis- cussed in later sections of this chapter. Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis begins when cholesterol is trans-ported from the blood into the artery wall by lipopro-teins, particularly LDL (Getz 1990; Yanowitz 1992). The formation of atherosclerotic plaques is increased at sites where the blood vessel lining is injured, which may occur in areas where blood flow is uneven (e.g., near the origin or branching of major vessels).An inflammatory reaction leads to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the wall of the artery. In animal studies, exercise has been seen to protect against the effects of excess cholesterol and other contributors to the development of athero- sclerosis (Kramsch et al. 1981). In addition, longi- tudinal studies of men with coronary artery diseasehave shown that endurance training, together with a cholesterol-lowering diet and interventions for other CVD risk factors, can help prevent the progression or reduce the severity of atherosclerosis in the coronary111The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease arteries (Ornish et al. 1990; Schuler et al. 1992; Hambrecht et al. 1993; Haskell et al. 1994). There isalso an inverse relationship between cardiorespira- tory fitness and ultrasound-measured severity of atherosclerosis in neck arteries to the head (carotid arteries) (Rauramaa et al. 1995). Plasma Lipid/Lipoprotein Profile The relationships of physical activity to blood lipid and lipoprotein levels in men and women have been reviewed extensively (Leon 1991a; Krummel Stefanick and Wood 1994). Of more than 60 studies of men and women, about half found that exercisetraining is associated with an increase in HDL. HDL, a lipid scavenger, helps protect against atherosclero- sis by transporting cholesterol to the liver for elimi- nation in the bile (Tall 1990). Cross-sectional studies show a dose-response relationship between theamount of regular physical activity and plasma levels of HDL (Leon 1991c). In these studies, the HDL levels of endurance-trained male and female athletes were generally 20 to 30 percent higher than those of healthy, age-matched, sedentary persons. Moderate-intensity exercise training appears to be less likely to increase HDL levels in young tomiddle-aged women than men in the same age range (Leon 1991a; Kummel et al. 1993; Durstine and Haskell 1994). Moderate-intensity exercise was seen to increase HDL as much as more vigorous exercise in one randomized controlled trial of women(Duncan, Gordon, Scott 1991). Studies have found that even a single episode of physical activity can result in an improved blood lipid profile that persists for several days (Tsopanakis et al. 1989; Durstine and Haskell 1994). Evidence also shows that exercise training increases lipopro- tein lipase activity, an enzyme that removes choles-terol and fatty acids from the blood (Stefanick and Wood 1994). Exercise training also reduces elevated levels of triglycerides (Leon 1991c; Durstine and Haskell 1994), another blood lipid associated with heart disease. Blood Pressure The mechanisms by which physical activity low- ers blood pressure are complicated (Leon 1991a; American College of Sports Medicine [ACSM]1993; Fagard et al. 1990) and are mentioned only briefly here (see also Chapter 3). Blood pressure isdirectly proportional to cardiac output and total resistance in the peripheral blood vessels. An epi- sode of physical activity has the immediate and temporary effect of lowering blood pressure through dilating the peripheral blood vessels, and exercisetraining has the ongoing effect of lowering blood pressure by attenuating sympathetic nervous system activity (Leon 1991a; ACSM 1993; Fagard et al. 1990). The reduced sympathetic activity may reduce renin-angiotensin system activity, reset barorecep-tors, and promote arterial vasodilatation\u2014all of which help control blood pressure. Improved insulin sensi- tivity and the associated reduction in circulating insulin levels may also contribute to blood pressure reduction by decreasing insulin-mediated sodiumreabsorption by the kidney (Tipton 1984). Ischemia Clinical symptoms of atherosclerotic CHD occurwhen the heart muscle (myocardium) needs more oxygen than can be supplied from blood flowing through narrowed coronary arteries. This oxygenshortage leads to ischemia in the heart muscle\u2014that is, to inadequate oxygenated blood for myocardial demand. Adaptations to a gradual reduction in blood flow may reduce the likelihood of myocardial is- chemia. For example, new blood vessels may developfrom other coronary arteries to provide an auxiliary blood supply (Cohen 1985). A person with advanced atherosclerotic CHD may remain free of symptoms at rest but may develop ischemic chest pain (angina pectoris) or electrocardiographic changes duringphysical exertion, which generally result from too high a myocardial oxygen demand for the blood supply available through partially occluded coronary arteries and collateral vessels (Smith and Leon 1992). Less commonly, angina pectoris may result fromtransient constriction (spasm) of a large coronary artery, generally at the site of an atherosclerotic plaque, or from spasm of small arterial vessels that have no evidence of plaque formation. A recent review has summarized adaptations in the coronary circulation that are induced by endur- ance exercise training and that can decrease thelikelihood of ischemia (Laughlin 1994). Data ob- tained primarily from research on animals have112Physical Activity and Health demonstrated that exercise leads to a greater capacity to increase coronary blood flow and an improvedefficiency of oxygen exchange between blood in the capillaries and the heart muscle cells. These func- tional changes are the result of a remodeled vascular structure , improved control of blood flow dynamics, and promotion of biochemical pathways for oxygentransfer. The first and most consistent structural adapta- tion to exercise is an increase in the interior diameter of the major coronary arteries and an associated increase in maximal coronary blood flow (Leon and Bloor 1968, 1976; Scheuer 1982; Laughlin 1994). The second vascular adaptation is the formation ofnew myocardial blood vessels (capillaries and coro- nary arterioles) (Tomanek 1994; Leon and Bloor 1968). Animal studies also have shown that exercise training alters coronary vascular reactivity and thereby improves control of blood flow and distribu-tion (Overholser, Laughlin, Bhatte 1994; Underwood, Laughlin, Sturek 1994). This adaptation may reduce the incidence of spasms in the proximal coronary arteries and arterioles (Laughlin 1994). In addition, exercise training results in a reduced workload on theheart due to both an increase in compliance of the heart and a relative reduction in peripheral resistance; together, these reduce myocardial oxygen demand (Jorgensen et al. 1977). Thrombosis An acute coronary event is usually initiated by dis- ruption of an atherosclerotic plaque within an artery (Smith and Leon 1992). Platelet accumulation at the injury site initiates a cascade of processes leading to clot formation (thrombosis), which further reduces or completely obstructs coronary flow. A majorobstruction of flow in a coronary artery may lead to the death of heart muscle (myocardial infarction) in the area served by that artery. These obstructions can, in addition, trigger potentially lethal disturbances in the rhythm of the heart (cardiac arrhythmia). Thrombosis, usually occurring at the site of rupture or fissuring of an atherosclerotic plaque, isthe precipitating event in the transition of silent or stable coronary artery disease to acute ischemic events, such as unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, or sudden cardiac death, and in the occur- rence of ischemic stroke (Davies and Thomas 1985;Falk 1985). Endurance training reduces thrombosis by enhancing the enzymatic breakdown of bloodclots (fibrinolysis) and by decreasing platelet adhe- siveness and aggregation (which helps prevent clot formation) (Kramsch et al. 1981; Leon 1991b). Arrhythmia Although persons with coronary artery disease havean increased risk of ventricular fibrillation (a life-threatening heart rhythm disturbance) during acute physical activity, persons with a healthy cardiovas- cular system do not incur this elevated risk (Siscovick et al. 1984; Mittleman et al. 1993; Willich et 1984; Thompson, Funk, etal. 1982; Haskell 1995; Dawson, Leon, Taylor 1979). Exercise training may reduce the risk of ventricular fibrillation in healthy persons and in cardiac patients by improving myocardial oxygen supply and de- mand and by reducing sympathetic nervous systemactivity (Leon 1991c). Evidence from epidemiologic studies shows that a physically active lifestyle re- duces the risk of sudden cardiac death (Leon et al. 1987). A meta-analysis of studies that examined use of physical activity for cardiac rehabilitation showedthat endurance exercise training reduced the overall risk of sudden cardiac death even among persons with advanced coronary atherosclerosis (O'Connor et al. 1989). Conclusions The epidemiologic literature supports an inverseassociation and a dose-response gradient between physical activity level or cardiorespiratory fitness and both CVD in general and CHD in particular. A smaller body of research supports similar findingsfor hypertension. The biological mechanisms for these effects are plausible and supported by a wealth of clinical and observational studies. It is unclear whether physical activity plays a protective role against stroke. Cancer Cancer, the second leading cause of death in theUnited States, accounts for about 25 percent of all deaths, and this percentage is increasing (NCHS 1996; American Cancer Society [ACS] 1996). TheACS has estimated that 1,359,150 new cases of113The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease cancer and 554,740 cancer-related deaths will occur among Americans during 1996 (ACS 1996). Physicalinactivity has been examined as an etiologic factor for some cancers. Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer has been the most thoroughly investigated cancer in epidemiologic studies of physi-cal activity. To date, nearly 30 published studies have examined the association between physical activity and risk of developing colon cancer alone. Studies that combined colon and rectal cancers as a single endpoint\u2014colorectal cancer\u2014are only briefly reviewed here because current research, sum- marized in this section, suggests that the relation-ship between physical activity and risk of colon cancer may be different from that for rectal cancer. Among nine studies that have examined the relation- ship between physical activity and colorectal cancer, one reported an inverse relationship (Wu et al.1987), and three reported positive associations that were not statistically significant (Garfinkel and Stellman 1988; Paffenbarger, Hyde, Wing 1987 [for analysis of two cohorts]). One (Kune, Kune, Watson 1990) reported no significant associations, and inthe four other studies (Albanes, Blair, Taylor 1989; Ballard-Barbash et al. 1990; Markowitz et al. 1992; Peters et al. 1989), the associations lacked consis- tency in subpopulations within the study, anatomic subsites of the large bowel, or measures of physicalactivity. Colorectal adenomas are generally thought to be precursors to colorectal cancers. A single study of colorectal adenomatous polyps has reported an inverse relationship between risk of adenomas and level of total physical activity (Sandler, Pritchard,Bangdiwala 1995). Another study of colorectal ad- enomas also found an inverse association, but only for running or bicycling, and only with one of two different comparison groups (Little et al. 1993). Colon Cancer Of the 29 studies of colon cancer, 18 used job title as the only measure of physical activity and thus ad- dressed only occupational physical activity. These studies are a mix of mortality and incidence studies, and few have evaluated possible confounding by socioeconomic status, diet, and other possible riskfactors for colon cancer. Nonetheless, findings fromthese 18 studies have been remarkably consistent: 14 studies (Brownson et al. 1989; Brownson et al. 1991;Chow et al. 1989; Vena et al.1985; Vena et al. 1987) reported a statistically sig- nificant inverse relationship between estimated oc- cupational physical activity and risk of colon cancer. Four studies (Arbman et al. 1993) found no significant relationship between occupational physical activity and risk of colon cancer. The 18 studies were conducted in a variety of study populations in China, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey,and the United States. Eleven studies assessed the association be- tween leisure-time or total physical activity and colon cancer risk in 13 different study populations (Table 4-5). These studies either measured physical activity and tracked participants over time to ascer- tain colon cancer outcomes or compared recalledhistories of physical activity among colon cancer patients with those among controls. In eight study populations, an inverse association was reported between physical activity and risk of colon cancer, and results were generally consistent for men andwomen. The three studies that examined the effect of physical activity during early adulthood (Polednak 1976; Paffenbarger, Hyde, Wing 1987; Marcus, Newcomb, Storer 1994) found no effect, which could indicate that the earlier activity did not affect risk ofcolon cancer later in life. In studies that used more than two categories of physical activity, 10 potential dose-response relationships between level of physi- cal activity or cardiorespiratory fitness and colon cancer risk were evaluated. Five of these showed astatistically significant inverse dose-response gradi- ent, one showed an inverse dose-response gradient that was not statistically significant, three showed no gradient, and one showed a positive relationship that was not statistically significant. Two studies of colon adenomas (Giovannucci et al. 1995; Kono et al. 1991) reported an inverserelationship between leisure-time physical activity and risk of colon adenomas.114Physical Activity and Health Table 4-5.

Five of the studies in Table 4-5 controlled for dietary components in analyses and continued to observe a significant inverse association (Gerhardsson, Floderus, Norell 1988; Slattery et al. 1995; Longnecker et al. 1995), and in one study (Whittemore et al.1990), adjust- ment for dietary intakes altered findings in one study population but not in the other. Together, the research on occupational and leisure-time or total physical activity strongly sug- gests that physical activity has a protective effectagainst the risk of developing colon cancer. Rectal Cancer Many of the studies on physical activity and coloncancer risk also studied rectal cancer as a separate outcome. Of 13 studies that investigated occupa- tional physical activity alone, 10 reported no statis-tically significant association with rectal cancer risk (Garabrant et al. 1984; Vena et Minder 1989; Peters et al. 1989;Dosemeci et al. 1993), two reported significant in- verse associations (Kato, Tominaga, Ikari 1990; Fraser and Pearce 1993), and one reported a significantdirect association (i.e., increasing risk with increas- ing physical activity) (Arbman et al. 1993). Six of the studies that investigated the associa- tion between leisure-time or total physical activityand the risk of developing rectal cancer failed to find a significant association (Gerhardsson, Floderus, Norell al.1995). In another study, Whittemore and colleagues (1990) observed a statistically significant inverse association in one study population and no effect in the other. Paffenbarger, Hyde, and Wing (1987) found an inverse relationship in one cohort and adirect relationship in the other. Taken together, study results on both occupa- tional and leisure-time or total physical activity suggest that risk of rectal cancer is unrelated to physical activity. Hormone-Dependent Cancers in Women Of the epidemiologic studies examining the relation-ship between physical activity and hormone- dependent cancers in women, 13 have investigated the risk associated with breast cancer, two with ovarian cancer, four with uterine corpus cancer (mostly endometrial), and one with a combination ofcancers. It should be noted that studies of physical activity in women have been especially prone to misclassification problems because they did notTable 4-5.

Studies of leisure-time or total physical activity and hormone-dependent cancers in women are summarized in Table 4-6. Breast Cancer Four of the 13 breast cancer studies considered only occupational physical activity. Two of those studies described significant inverse associations (Vena et al. 1987; Zheng et al. 1993), and two others reported no significant association (Dosemeci et al. 1993; Pukkala et al. 1993). Only two (Dosemeci et al. 1993;Pukkala et al. 1993) adjusted for socioeconomic status, and none gathered information about repro- ductive factors and thus could not control for those potential confounding variables. The epidemiologic studies of leisure-time or total physical activity and breast cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results (Table 4-6). Of these 10studies, two reported a significant inverse associa- tion (Bernstein et al. 1994; Mittendorf et al. 1995), three reported an inverse association that was not statistically significant (Frisch et al. 1985,1987; Friedenreich and Rohan 1995), three Taylor 1989; Taioli, Wynder 1995). The other two reported a direct association,although in one this did not reach statistical signifi- cance (Dorgan et al. 1994), and in the other itremained statistically significant (after adjustment for confounding) only for physical activity at age 30- 39 years (Sternfeld et al. 1993). Even among the studies that controlled for po- tential confounding by reproductive factors, find- ings were inconsistent (Bernstein et al. 1994; Dorgan Sternfeld 1995). Results were inconsistent as well among studies that included primarily postmeno- pausal women (i.e., all but the study by Bernstein and colleagues [1994]). Nonetheless, it is possible that physical activ- ity during adolescence and young adulthood mayprotect against later development of breast cancer. Five of the studies cited here have examined this possibility. Among these five studies, two found a strong and statistically significant reduction in risk (Bernstein et al. 1994 [RR = 0.42]; Mittendorfet al. 1995 [RR = 0.5]), one found a nonsignificant reduction in risk (Frisch et al. 1985 [RR = 0.54]), and two found a null association (Paffenbarger, Hyde, Wing 1987; Taioli, Barone, Wynder 1995).

Other Hormone-Dependent Cancers in Women Too little information is available to evaluate the possible effect of physical activity on risk of ovarian cancer. Zheng and colleagues (1993) found no sig- nificant associations between occupational physical activity and risk of ovarian cancer. On the otherhand, data from the Iowa Women's Health Study showed that risk of ovarian cancer among women who were most active was twice the risk among sedentary women (Mink et al. 1996). Findings are limited for uterine corpus cancers as well. Zheng et al. (1993) found no relationship between physical activity and risk of cancer of theuterine corpus. Among the endometrial cancer stud- ies, one (Levi et al. 1993) found a decreased risk associated with nonoccupational activity, and one (Sturgeon et al. 1993) found combined recreationaland nonrecreational activity to be protective. An- other study (Shu et al. 1993) found no protectiveeffect of nonoccupational activity in any age group and a possible protective effect of occupational activ- ity among younger women but not among older women. In Frisch and colleagues' (1985) study of the combined prevalence of cancers of the ovary, uterus, cervix, and vagina, nonathletes were 2.5 times morelikely than former college athletes to have these forms of cancer at follow-up. Because these cancers have different etiologies, however, the import of this finding is difficult to determine. Thus the data are either too limited or too inconsistent to firmly establish relationships be- tween physical activity and hormone-dependent can-cers in women. The suggestive finding that physical activity in adolescence and early adulthood may protect against later development of breast cancer deserves further study.Table 4-6.

Results of these studies are inconsistent. Seven studies haveinvestigated the association between occupational physical activity and prostate cancer risk or mortal- ity. Two described significant inverse dose-response relationships (Vena et al. 1987; Brownson et al. 1991). Two showed a nonsignificant decreased riskwith heavy occupational activity (Dosemeci et al. 1993; Thune and Lund 1994). In one publication that presented data from two cohorts, there was no effect in either (Paffenbarger, Hyde, Wing 1987).The remaining study (Le Marchand, Kolonel, Yoshizawa 1991) reported inconsistent findings byage: increasing risk with increasing activity among men aged 70 years or older and no relationship among men younger than age 70. The 10 studies of leisure-time physical activity, or total physical activity, or cardiorespiratory fitness and risk of prostate cancer have also produced inconsistent results (Table 4-7). Two of the studiesdescribed significant inverse relationships (Lee, Paffenbarger, Hsieh 1992; Oliveria et al. 1996), although one of these (Lee, Paffenbarger, Hsieh 1992) observed this relationship only among men aged 70 years or older.

Two studies found that men who had been athletically active in college had significantly in- creased risks of later developing prostate cancer (Polednak 1976; Paffenbarger, Hyde, Wing 1987).One study found no overall association between physical activity and prostate cancer risk but found a higher risk (although not statistically significant) of more aggressive prostate cancer (West et al. 1991). The two studies of the association of cardiorespi- ratory fitness with prostate cancer incidence were also inconsistent. Severson and colleagues (1989)found no association between resting pulse rate and subsequent risk of prostate cancer. Oliveria and col- leagues (1996) found a strong inverse dose-response relationship between fitness assessed by time on a treadmill and subsequent risk of prostate cancer. Thus the body of research conducted to date shows no consistent relationship between prostatecancer and physical activity. Testicular Cancer Two studies investigated physical activity and risk ofdeveloping testicular cancer; again, results are in- consistent. A case-control study in England found that men who spent at least 15 hours per week inrecreational physical activity had approximately half the risk of sedentary men, and a significant trend was reported over six categories of total time spent exer- cising (United Kingdom Testicular Cancer Study Group 1994). A cohort study in Norway (Thune andLund 1994) was limited by few cases. It showed no association between leisure-time physical activity and risk of testicular cancer, but heavy manual occupational activity was associated with an ap- proximately twofold increase in risk, although thisresult was not statistically significant. Thus no mean- ingful conclusions about a relationship between physical activity and testicular cancer can be drawn. Other Site-Specific Cancers Few epidemiologic studies have examined the asso-ciation of physical activity with other site-specific cancers (Lee 1994). The totality of evidence provides little basis for a suggestion of a relationship.Biologic Plausibility Because the data presented in this section demon-strate a clear association only between physical ac- tivity and colon cancer, the biologic plausibility of this relationship is the focus of this section. The alteration of local prostaglandin synthesis may serve as a mechanism through which physical activity mayconfer protection against colon cancer (Shephard et al. 1991; Lee 1994; Cordain, Latin, Beanke 1986). Strenuous physical activity increases prostaglandin F 2 alpha, which strongly increases intestinal motil- ity, and may suppress prostaglandin E2, which re- duces intestinal motility and, released in greater quantities by colon tumor cells than normal cells, accelerates the rate of colon cell proliferation (Thor et al. 1985; Tutton and Barkla 1980). It has been hypothesized that physical activity decreases gas-trointestinal transit time, which in turn decreases the length of contact between the colon mucosa and potential carcinogens, cocarcinogens, or promoters contained in the fecal stream (Shephard 1993; Lee 1994). This hypothesis could partly explain whyphysical activity has been associated with reduced cancer risk in the colon but not in the rectum. Physical activity may shorten transit time within segments of the colon without affecting transit time in the rectum. Further, the rectum is only intermit-tently filled with fecal material before evacuation. Despite these hypothetical mechanisms, studies on the effects of physical activity on gastrointestinal transit time in humans have yielded inconsistent results (Shephard 1993; Lee 1994). Conclusions The relative consistency of findings in epidemio-logic studies indicates that physical activity is asso- ciated with a reduced risk of colon cancer, and biologically plausible mechanisms underlying thisassociation have been described. The data consis- tently show no association between physical activ- ity and rectal cancer. Data regarding a relationship between physical activity and breast, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, and testicular cancers are toolimited or too inconsistent to support any firm conclusions. The suggestion that physical activity in adolescence and early adulthood may protect against later development of breast cancer clearly deserves further study.125The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus An estimated 8 million Americans (about 3 percent of the U.S. population) have been diagnosed with diabe- tes mellitus, and it is estimated that twice that many have diabetes but do not know it (Harris 1995). More than 169,000 deaths per year are attributed to diabetesas the underlying cause, making it the seventh leading cause of mortality in the United States (NCHS 1994). This figure, however, underestimates the actual death toll: in 1993, more than twice this number of deaths occurred among persons for whom diabetes was listedas a secondary diagnosis on the death certificate. Many of these deaths were the result of complications of diabetes, particularly CVDs, including CHD, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and congestive heart fail- ure. Diabetes accounts for at least 10 percent of allacute hospital days and in 1992 accounted for an estimated $92 billion in direct and indirect medical costs (Rubin et al. 1993). In addition, by age 65 years, about 40 percent of the general population has im- paired glucose tolerance, which increases the risk ofCVD (Harris et al. 1987). Diabetes is a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders that have in common elevated blood glucose and associated metabolic derangements. Insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM, or type I) is characterized by an absolute deficiency of circulat- ing insulin caused by destruction of pancreatic betaislet cells, thought to have occurred by an auto- immune process. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM, or type II) is characterized either by elevated insulin levels that are ineffective in normalizing blood glucose levels because of insulinresistance (decreased sensitivity to insulin), largely in skeletal muscle, or by impaired insulin secretion. More than 90 percent of persons with diabetes have NIDDM (Krall and Beaser 1989). Nonmodifiable biologic factors implicated in the etiology of NIDDM include a strong genetic influence and advanced age, but the development of insulinresistance, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intoler- ance are related to a modifiable factor: weight gain in adults, particularly in those persons in whom fat accumulates around the waist, abdomen, and upper body and within the abdominal cavity (this is alsocalled the android or central distribution pattern) (Harris et al. 1987).Physical Activity and NIDDM Considerable evidence supports a relationship be- tween physical inactivity and NIDDM (Kriska, Kriska and Bennett 1992). Early suggestions of a relationship emerged from the observation that soci- eties that had discontinued their traditional lifestyles(which presumably included large amounts of regu- lar physical activity) experienced major increases in the prevalence of NIDDM (West 1978). Additional evidence for the importance of lifestyle was provided by comparison studies demonstrating that groups ofpeople who migrated to a more technologically ad- vanced environment had higher prevalences of NIDDM than their ethnic counterparts who remained in their native land (Hara et al. 1983; Kawate et al. 1979; Ravussin et al. 1994) and that rural dwellershad a lower prevalence of diabetes than their urban counterparts (Cruz-Vidal et al. 1979; Zimmet 1981; Taylor et al. 1983; King, Taylor, Zimmet, et al. 1984). Many cross-sectional studies have found physi- cal inactivity to be significantly associated with NIDDM (Taylor et al. 1983; Taylor et al. 1984; King, Taylor, Zimmet, et al. 1984; Dowse et al. 1991;Ramaiya et al. 1991; Kriska, Gregg, et al. 1993; Chen Lowenstein 1986; Frish et al. 1986; Holbrook, Barrett-Connor, Wingard 1989). Cross-sectional studies that have examined the relationship between physical activity and glucose intolerance in personswithout diabetes have generally found that after a meal, glucose levels (Lindg\u00e4rde and Saltin 1981; Cederholm and et al. 1991; al. 1993) values (Lindg\u00e4rdeand Kromhout 1994; Regensteiner et al. 1995) were significantly higher in less active than in more active persons. However, some cross- sectional studies did not find that physical inactivitywas consistently associated with NIDDM in either the entire population or in all subgroups (King, Taylor, Zimmet, et al. 1984; Dowse et al. 1991; Kriska, Gregg, et al. et al. 1987; Jarrett, Shipley,Hunt 1986; Levitt et al. 1993; Harris 1991). For example, the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that higher126Physical Activity and Health levels of occupational physical activity among Mexi can Americans were associated with less NIDDM (Harris 1991). However, in contrast to findings from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (Chen and Lewenstein 1986), this associa- tion was not found for either occupational or leisure- time physical activity among blacks or whites. Two case-control studies have found physical inactivity to be significantly associated with NIDDM(Kaye et al. 1991; Uusitupa et al. 1985). One was a population-based nested case-control study, in which women aged 55-69 years who had high levels of physical activity were found to be half as likely to develop NIDDM as were same-aged women with lowlevels of physical activity (age-adjusted OR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7) (Kaye et al. 1991). Moderately active women had an intermediate risk (OR = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9). Prospective cohort studies of college alumni, female registered nurses, and male physicians have demonstrated that physical activity protects againstthe development of NIDDM (Table 4-8). A study ofmale university alumni (Helmrich et al. 1991) dem- onstrated that physical activity was inversely relatedto the incidence of NIDDM, a relationship that was particularly evident in men at high risk for develop- ing diabetes (defined as those with a high BMI, a history of high blood pressure, or a parental history of diabetes). Each 500 kilocalories of additionalleisure-time physical activity per week was associ- ated with a 6 percent decrease in risk (adjusted for age, BMI, history of high blood pressure, and paren- tal history of diabetes) of developing NIDDM. This study showed a more pronounced benefit from vig-orous sports than from stair climbing or walking. In a study of female registered nurses aged 34-59 years, women who reported engaging in vigorous physical activity at least once a week had a 16 percent lower adjusted relative risk of self-reported NIDDM duringthe 8 years of follow-up than women who reported no vigorous physical activity (Manson et al. 1991). Similar findings were observed between physical activity and incidence of NIDDM in a 5-year pro- spective study of male physicians 40-84 years of age Table 4-8. Cohort studies of association of physical activity with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) Definition of Definition of Study Population physical activity NIDDM Helmrich et al. Male college alumni Leisure-time physical activity Self-reported physician- (1991) (walking, stair climbing, and diagnosed diabetes sports) Manson et al.

Male physicians Single questions regarding number Self-reported physician- (1992) of times per week of vigorous diagnosed diabetes activity127The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease (Manson et al. 1992). Although the incidence of diabetes was self-reported in these cohorts, concernsabout accuracy are somewhat mitigated by the fact that these were studies of health professionals and college-educated persons. In these three cohort stud- ies, two found an inverse dose-response gradient of physical activity and the development of NIDDM(Helmrich et al. 1991; Manson et al. 1992). In a feasibility study in Malmo, Sweden, physical activity was included as part of an intervention strategy to prevent diabetes among persons with impaired glucose tolerance (Eriksson and Lindg\u00e4rde 1991). At the end of 5 years of follow-up, twice as many in the control group as in the interventiongroup had developed diabetes. The lack of random assignment of participants, however, limits the generalizability of this finding. A study conducted in Daqing, China, also included physical activity as an intervention to prevent diabetes among persons withimpaired glucose tolerance (Pan, Li, Hu 1995). After 6 years of follow-up, 8.3 cases per 100 person-years occurred in the exercise intervention group and 15.7 cases per 100 person-years in the control group.It has been recommended that an appropriate exercise program may be added to diet or drugtherapy to improve blood glucose control and re- duce certain cardiovascular risk factors among per- sons with diabetes (American Diabetes Association 1990). Diet and exercise have been found to be most effective for controlling NIDDM in persons whohave mild disease and are not taking medications (Barnard, Jung, Inkeles 1994). However, excessive physical activity can sometimes cause persons with diabetes (particularly those who take insulin for blood glucose control) to experience detrimentaleffects, such as worsening of hyperglycemia and keto- sis from poorly controlled diabetes, hypoglycemia (insulin-reaction) either during vigorous physical activity or\u2014more commonly\u2014several hours after prolonged physical activity, complications from pro-liferative retinopathy (e.g., detached retina), compli- cations from superficial foot injuries, and a risk of myocardial infarction and sudden death, particularly among older people with NIDDM and advanced, but silent, coronary atherosclerosis. These risks can beminimized by a preexercise medical evaluation and by taking proper precautions (Leon 1989, 1992).

Biologic Plausibility Numerous reviews of the short- and long-termeffects of physical activity on carbohydrate metabo- lism and glucose tolerance describe the physiologi- cal basis relationship Ruderman, Schneider 1981; Harris et al. 1987). During a single prolonged session of physical activ- ity, contracting skeletal muscle appears to have asynergistic effect with insulin in enhancing glucose uptake into the cells. This effect appears to be related to both increased blood flow in the muscle and enhanced glucose transport into the muscle cell. This enhancement persists for 24 hours or more asglycogen levels in the muscle are being replenished. Such observations suggest that many of the effects of regular physical activity are due to the overlapping effects of individual physical activity sessions and are thus independent of long-term adaptations toexercise training or changes in body composition (Harris et al. 1987). In general, studies of exercise training have suggested that physical activity helps prevent NIDDM by increasing sensitivity to insulin et al. 1984;R\u00f6nnemaa et al. 1986). These studies suggest that physical activity is more likely to improve abnormal glucose tolerance when the abnormality is primarily caused by insulin resistance than when it is caused by deficient amounts of circulating insulin (Holloszyet al. 1986). Thus, physical activity is likely to be most beneficial in preventing the progression of NIDDM during the earlier stages of the disease process, before insulin therapy is required. Evidence supporting this theory includes intervention pro-grams that promote physical activity together with a low-fat diet high in complex carbohydrates (Barnard, Jung, Inkeles 1994) or programs that promote dietalone (Nagulesparan et al. 1981). These studies have shown that diet and physical activity interventionsare much less beneficial for persons with NIDDM who require insulin therapy than for those who do not yet take any medication or those who take only oral medications for blood glucose control. Cross-sectional studies also show that, com- pared with their sedentary counterparts, endurance athletes and exercise-trained animals have greaterinsulin sensitivity, as evidenced by a lower plasma insulin concentration at a similar plasma glucose concentration, and increased I21I-insulin binding to white blood cells and adipocytes (Koivisto et al. 1979). Insulin sensitivity and rate of glucose dis-posal are related to cardiorespiratory fitness even in older persons (Hollenbeck et al. 1984). Resistance or strength-training exercise has also been reported to have beneficial effects on glucose-insulin dynamics in some, but not all, studies involving persons whodo not have diabetes (Goldberg 1989; Kokkinos et al. 1988). Much of the effect of physical activity appears to be due to the metabolic adaptation of skeletal muscle. However, exercise training may contribute to improved glucose disposal and glucose-insulin dynamics in both adipose tissue and the working skeletal muscles (Leon 1989, 1992; Gudat, Berger, Lef\u00e8bvre 1994; Horton 1991). In addition, exercise training may reduce other risk factors for atherosclerosis (e.g., blood lipid abnormalities and elevated blood pressure levels), as discussed previously in this chapter, and therebydecrease the risk of macrovascular or atherosclerotic complications of diabetes (Leon 1991a). Lastly, physical activity may prevent or delay the onset of NIDDM by reducing total body fat or specifi- cally intra-abdominal fat, a known risk factor for insulin resistance. As discussed later in this chapter, physical activity is inversely associated with obesityand intra-abdominal fat distribution, and recent studies have demonstrated that physical training can reduce these body fat stores (Bj\u00f6rntorp, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, Sullivan 1979; Brownell and Stunkard Krotkiewski 1988). Conclusions The epidemiologic literature strongly supports aprotective effect of physical activity on the likeli- hood of developing NIDDM in the populations129The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease studied. Several plausible biologic mechanisms exist to explain this effect. Physical activity may alsoreduce the risk of developing NIDDM in groups of people with impaired glucose tolerance, but this topic needs further study. Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, ischaracterized by both degeneration of cartilage and new growth of bone around the joint. Because its prevalence increases with age, osteoarthritis is the leading cause of activity limitation among older persons. The etiology of osteoarthritis is unknown,and the risk factors and pathogenesis of osteoarthri- tis differ for each joint group. Whether an active lifestyle offers protection against the development of osteoarthritis is not known, but studies have examined the risk of devel- oping it in relation to specific athletic pursuits. Cross-sectional studies have associated competitive\u2014as opposed to recreational\u2014running at high levels and for long periods with the development of os- teoarthritis seen on Sarna 1994; Kujala et al. 1995). On the other hand, both cross-sectional and cohortstudies have suggested that persons who engage in recreational running over long periods of time have no more risk of developing osteoarthritis of the knee or hip than sedentary persons (Lane 1995; Lane et al. 1986, 1993; Panush et al. 1995; Panush et al. 1986;Panush and Lane 1994). There is also currently no evidence that persons with normal joints increase their risk of osteoarthritis by walking. Studies of competitive athletes suggest that some sports\u2014specifically soccer, football, and weight lifting\u2014are associated with developing os- teoarthritis of the joints of activities in which spe- cific joints are used excessively have also beenassociated with the development of osteoarthritis. For example, baseball pitchers are reported to have an increased prevalence of osteoarthritis in the elbow and shoulder joint (Adams 1965; Bennett 1941). These studies are limited because theyinvolve small sample sizes. Further confounding these studies is the high incidence of fractures,ligamentous and cartilage injuries, and other inju- ries to joints that occur with greater-than-average frequency among competitive participants in these sports. Because joint injury is a strong risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis, it may not be thephysical activity but rather the associated injuries that cause osteoarthritis in these competitive ath- letes. In a study by Roos and colleagues (1994), soccer players who had not suffered knee injuries had no greater prevalence of osteoarthritis than didsedentary controls. Regular noncompetitive physi- cal activity of the amount and intensity recom- mended for improving health thus does not appear harmful to joints that have no existing injury. Physical Activity in Persons with Arthritis Given the high prevalence of osteoarthritis amongolder people, it is important to determine whether persons with arthritis can safely exercise and be physically active. Experimental work with animals shows that use of injured joints inhibits tissue repair(Buckwalter 1995). More specifically, several stud- ies have indicated that running accelerates joint damage in animal models where osteoarthritis has been experimentally induced (Armstrong et al. 1993). In contrast, several short-term studies of human subjects have indicated that regular moderate- exercise programs, whether including aerobic or resistance training, relieve symptoms and improve function among people with both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (Ettinger and Afable 1994; Allegrante et al. 1993; Fisher et al. 1994; Fisher and Pendergast 1994; Puett and Griffin1994). For example, it has been shown that after regular physical activity, persons with arthritis have a significant reduction in joint swelling (Minor et al. 1988). In other studies of persons with osteoarthri- tis, increased levels of physical activity were associ-ated with improved psychosocial status, functional status, and physical fitness (Minor 1991; Minor and Brown 1993). Furthermore, regular physical activ- ity of moderate intensity has been found to raise the pain threshold, improve energy level, and improveself-efficacy among persons with osteoarthritis (Minor et al. 1989; Chow et al. 1986; Holman, Health Biologic Plausibility The biologic effects of physical activity on the health and function of joints have not been exten- sively investigated, but some level of physical activ- ity is necessary to preserve joint function. Because hyaline cartilage has no blood vessels or nerves, mature cartilage cells (chondrocytes) receive nour-ishment only from the diffusion of substances through the cartilage matrix from joint fluid. Physi- cal activity enhances this process. In the laboratory, putting pressure on cartilage deforms the tissue, creating pressure gradients that cause fluid to flowand alter osmotic pressures within the cartilage matrix (Hall, Urban, Gehl 1991). The effect of such loading on the metabolism of chondrocytes is not well described, but when loading is performed within the physiologic range, chondrocytes increaseproteoglycan synthesis (Grodzinsky 1993). In con- trast, high-intensity loading and repetitive high- impact loads disrupt the cartilage matrix and inhibit proteoglycan synthesis (Lammi 1993). The role of normal loading is confirmed by the effect of inactivity on articular cartilage. Immobility leads to decreased cartilage proteoglycan synthesis,increased water content, and decreased cartilage stiffness and thickness. Disuse may make the carti- lage more vulnerable to injury, and prolonged disuse causes loss of normal joint function as the joint cavity is obliterated by fibrous tissue. Studies of running on joint function in dogs with normal joints have confirmed that running doesaffect the proteoglycan and water content of cartilage and does not lead to degeneration of articular sur- faces or to degenerative joint disease (Arokoski et al. 1993). In contrast, in dogs with injured joints, run- ning has been shown to cause arthritis (Buckwalter1995). Conclusions Physical activity is essential for maintaining the health of joints and appears to be beneficial for control of symptoms among people with osteoar-thritis. Although there is no evidence that physical activity itself causes osteoarthritis, injuries sus- tained during competitive sports have been shown to increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis.Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and increased susceptibility to fractures. Because bone mass and strength pro-gressively decline with advancing age, this disease primarily affects older persons (Cummings et al. 1985). Osteoporosis is more common among women than among men, for at least three reasons: women have lower peak bone mass than men, women losebone mass at an accelerated rate after menopause when estrogen levels decline, and women have a longer life span than men. The most common potential fracture sites are vertebrae of the chest and lower back, the distal radius (or wrist), the hips, and the proximal hu- merus (NIH 1984). Vertebral fractures can occurspontaneously or with minimal trauma (e.g., bend- ing forward or coughing); once deformed, the verte- brae never return to their normal shape. These fractures may be asymptomatic and discovered only incidentally on a chest or spine x-ray. Accumulationof such vertebral fractures causes a bent-over or hunchbacked posture that is generally associated with chronic back pain and often with gastrointesti- nal and abdominal problems related to a lowering of the rib cage. In the United States, fractures of the hip account for 250,000 of the 1.5 million fractures that areattributed each year to osteoporosis. Hip fractures are associated with more deaths (a 15-20 percent 1-year mortality rate), permanent disability, and medical and institutional care costs than all other osteoporotic fractures combined (Cummings et al.1985; Rankin 1993). By age 90, about one-third of women and about one-sixth of men will have sus- tained a hip fracture. In both men and women, the development of osteoporosis may be related to three factors: a defi- cient level of peak bone mass at physical maturity, failure to maintain this peak bone mass during thethird and fourth decades of life, and the bone loss that begins during the fourth or fifth decade of life. Physical activity may positively affect all three of these factors. Physical activity may play a substantial role in the development of bone mass during childhood and adolescence and in the maintenance of skeletal mass131The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease as a young adult. This inference is partly based on findings that athletic young adults have a higherdensity of bone mineral than sedentary young 1993; Nichols et al. 1994; Rubin et al. 1993), on reports that athletes have a differential density of bones according to the sportthey train for (Robinson et al. 1995; Heinonen et al. 1995), and on evidence that increase in bone mass in university students is related to higher levels of physical activity (Recker et al. 1992). Beyond this hypothesized function in youth, physical activity plays a well-established role throughout the life span in maintaining the normalstructure and functional strength of bone. Pro- longed bed rest or immobility causes rapid and marked reduction in bone mineral density (Kr\u00f8lner et al. 1983; Chesnut 1993; Donaldson et al. 1970). Of particular public health interest is the degree towhich physical activity can prevent or slow the bone loss that begins occurring in women as a normal process after menopause. Cross-sectional studies of postmenopausal women have shown that bone mineral density is correlated with musclestrength (Sinaki et al. 1986; and et al 1994; Jacobson et 1984; Talmage et al. 1986), and cardiorespiratory fitness (Pocock et al. 1986; Chow et al. 1986). Longitudinal studies ofpostmenopausal women have attributed increases in both cardiorespiratory fitness and bone mass to physical activity (Chow et al. 1987; Dalsky et al. 1988). There is some evidence that through physi- cal activity, osteoporotic women can minimize boneloss or facilitate some gain in bone mineral content (Kr\u00f8lner et al. 1983; Kohrt et al. 1995). However, other studies have failed to show such benefits (Nelson et al. 1991; Sandler et al. 1989; Cavanaugh and Cann 1988). The intensity of the physicalactivity and the degree to which it stresses the bones may be crucial factors in determining whether bone mass is maintained. Thus it is likely that resistance exercise may have more pronounced effects than endurance exercise, although this has not yet beenunequivocally established. Several investigators have found that the posi- tive effect of physical activity on the bones of both premenopausal and postmenopausal women dependson the presence of estrogen. In postmenopausal women, greater gain in bone density accrues whenphysical activity and estrogen replacement therapy occur simultaneously (Prince et al. 1991; Kohrt et al. 1995). In young, premenopausal women, however, excessive amounts of vigorous training may lead to a low estrogen level and secondary amenorrhea, withsubsequent decreased bone mass and increased risk of stress fractures (Marcus et al. 1985; Drinkwater et al. 1984; Allen 1994). The exercise-associated changes in bone mineral density observed over time among both premeno- pausal and postmenopausal women are much less pronounced than those differences observed cross-sectionally between active and sedentary persons (Drinkwater 1993). Cross-sectional studies demon- strate differences of 10-15 percent in bone mineral density at various sites (Aloia et al. 1988; Lane et al. 1986; Michel, Bloch, Fries 1989; Recker et al. 1992),whereas intervention studies show smaller gains of 1-5 percent (Kr\u00f8lner et al. 1983; Dalsky et al. et al. 1991; Pruitt et al. 1992; Drinkwater 1993). These differences may be due to differences in comparison groups, to follow-up duration insuffi-cient to show large changes in bone mineral density, or to measurement at different skeletal sites. Still to be conducted are well-designed randomized clinical trials that are of sufficient size and duration to determine definitively the longitudinal effects ofphysical activity change or the differential effects of resistance and endurance activity on bone mineral density. Biologic Plausibility Bone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly remod-eling its structure by resorption and formation. Physical activity, through its load-bearing effect on the skeleton, is likely the single most important influence on bone density and architecture (Lanyon 1996). Bone cells respond to mechanical loading byimproving the balance between bone formation and bone resorption, which in turn builds greater bone mass (Lanyon 1987, 1993). The higher the load, the greater the bone mass; conversely, when the skel- eton is unloaded (as with inactivity), bone massdeclines. Glucose-6-phosphate, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide play a role in mediating the mechanical132Physical Activity and Health loading effect on bone (Pitsillides et al. 1995; Turner et al. 1995; Tang et al. 1995). Because it is musclethat exerts the largest forces on bone during physi- cal activity, the role of muscle mass and strength in maintaining skeletal integrity should be explored more fully. Nonmechanical factors, such as age, hormonal milieu, nutritional intake, and medications, are in- creasingly being recognized as important determi-nants of the bone's response to mechanical loading (Lanyon 1996). The relative contributions of each of these factors are currently under study and are not yet clearly delineated. Animal studies confirm a difference in bone response to mechanical loadingwith age and by estrogen status (Turner, Takano, Owan 1995). The potential clinical relevance of this research is to better define the optimal amount and type of exercise for maintaining or increasing bone mass, particularly with aging or in the absence ofestrogen replacement therapy after menopause. Physical Activity and the Prevention of Fractures and Falling Studies of physical activity in relation to hip frac- ture in women have generally found a lower risk of hip fracture among those who were more active. Three cohort studies have reported such a protec- tive effect. One showed a statistically significant protective effect among those reporting the mostrecreational activity at baseline (Farmer et al. 1989), one showed inverse but not statistically significant associations for both work and leisure-time physi- cal activity (Meyer, Tverdal, Falch 1993), and one showed a significant protective effect of walking forexercise (Cummings et al. 1995). Case-control stud- ies have been more equivocal. One such study found a significant protective effect for two levels of past activity, but for recent activity only moderate amounts of activity showed a significant protectiveeffect (Jaglal, Kreiger, Darlington 1993). Another case-control study showed inconsistent effects across a variety of physical activity classifications (Cumming and Klineberg 1994). Nonskeletal factors that increase the risk of fractures due to falls include limitations in activi- ties of daily living (e.g., dressing and feeding one-self); compromised gait, balance, reaction time,and muscle strength; impaired vision; medication use; and environmental Various exer- cises may help prevent falls by improving muscle strength, functional capacity, gait, balance, and reaction time. Tinetti and colleagues (1994) showeda significant decrease in falls in the elderly concomi- tant with an improvement in balance and gait achieved through exercise. Province and colleagues (1995) demonstrated a protective effect against falls through general exercise and exercises designed to improvebalance. Moreover, Fiatarone and colleagues (1994) have shown that even frail elderly persons who have multiple chronic diseases benefit substantially from resistance training. This well-controlled random- ized trial demonstrated the importance of strengthtraining in improving stair-climbing power, gait, and other measures of physical function. Moderate exercise-training techniques, such as tai chi chuan, have also been shown to decrease falling and to improve function in older adults by increasing ormaintaining aerobic power, strength, and balance (Lai et al. 1995; Wolf et al. 1996; Wolfson et al. 1996). Conclusions Physical activity appears to build greater bone massin childhood and early adolescence and to help maintain peak bone mass in adulthood. Among women after menopause, physical activity may pro- tect against the rapid decline in bone mass, but findings are inconsistent in this regard, and it isunclear whether muscle-strengthening (resistance) activity may be more effective than endurance activ- ity for this purpose. Estrogen replacement therapy has been shown conclusively to decrease bone loss after menopause, and there is evidence that thiseffect is enhanced with physical activity. However, it is not clear whether physical activity alone, in the absence of estrogen replacement therapy, can pre- vent bone loss. Physical activity, including muscle-strengthen- ing (resistance) exercise, appears to be protective against falling and fractures among the elderly, prob-ably by increasing muscle strength and balance.133The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease Obesity Obesity, a major public health problem in the United States, plays a central role in the development of diabetes mellitus (West 1978) and confers an in- creased risk for CHD, high blood pressure, osteoar-thritis, dyslipoproteinemia, various cancers, and all-cause mortality (Hubert et Bray 1985; Albanes 1987; Lee et al. 1993; Manson et al. 1995). The progressive weight gain often observed between the third and sixth decades of life may be partlyexplained by age-related changes: although energy intake tends to decline after the second decade of life, this decrease is insufficient to offset the greater decline in the amount of energy that most people expend throughout their adult years (Bray 1983;Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology 1995). In addition to these age trends, popu- lation surveys indicate that the age-adjusted preva- lence of overweight among adults in the United States has increased from about 25 percent in the1970s to 33 percent in 1988-1991 (Kuczmarski et al. 1994). The increase is evident for all race and sex groups. This phenomenon is believed to be due to high rates of inactivity combined with easy access to energy-dense food (Blackburn and Prineas 1983). Obesity, defined as an excess of adipose tissue, is difficult to measure in population-based studies.Most investigations have therefore either used a relative weight index, such as percent desirable weight (Metropolitan Life Insurance Company 1959), or have used BMI (defined by a ratio of weight to height) as a surrogate measure. Quetelet'sindex (weight [kg]/height[m] 2) has been the most frequently used BMI. Although these weight-height indices are strongly correlated with more direct measures of adiposity, such as underwater weighing, they have limitations: fatty tissue cannot be distin-guished from muscle mass or edema, and associa- tions between weight-height indices and adiposity may be nonlinear or may differ by age or ethnic group (Harrison et al. 1985; Garn, Leonard, Hawthorne 1986; Lillioja and Bogardus 1988). Despite theselimitations, BMI has shown a monotonic association with mortality in several recent cohort studies (Lee et al. 1993; Manson et al. 1995; Willett et al. 1995). Using nationally representative data, the CDC has defined overweight as a Quetelet's index at or above the 85th percentile for 29-year-olds( 27.3 kg/m 27.8 kg/m2 percent of desirable Kuczmarkski index (32.3 kg/m 2 for women, 31.1 kg/m2 for men), equivalent to a relative weight of approximately 145 percent, has been used to classify persons as severely overweight.Between 1976 and 1991, the mean weight of U.S. adults increased by 3.6 kg (almost 8 pounds), and 58 million American adults (33 percent) are now con- sidered to be overweight (Kuczmarski et al. 1994). Because substantial weight loss in adults is diffi- cult to achieve and maintain (Dyer 1994), childhood obesity and its prevention have received increasedattention. Overweight children are likely to remain overweight as adolescents and adults (Johnston 1985) and are subsequently at increased risk for high blood pressure, diabetes, CHD, and all-cause mortality (Abraham, Collins, Nordsieck 1971; Nieto, Szklo,Comstock 1992; Must et al. 1992). Moreover, paral- leling the trend seen among adults, the prevalence of overweight among U.S. children and adolescents has increased substantially over the past decade (Shear et al. 1988; Troiano et al. 1995). Physical Activity and Obesity It is commonly believed that physically active peopleare less likely to gain weight over the course of their lives and are thus more likely to have a lower preva- lence of obesity than inactive people; accordingly, itis also commonly believed that low levels of physical activity are a cause of obesity. Few data, however, exist to evaluate the truth of these suppositions. Several cross-sectional studies report lower weight, BMI, or skinfold measures among people with higher levels of self-reported physical activity or fitness (DiPietro 1995; Ching et al. 1996;Williamson et al. 1993; French et al. 1994; Folsom et al. 1985; Dannenberg et al. 1989; Slattery et al. 1992; al. 1983; Voorrips et al. 1992). Prospec- tive studies have shown less consistent results. French and colleagues (1994) reported an inverseassociation between leisure-time physical activity (either walking or engaging in high-intensity activ- ity) and later weight gain, and Ching and colleagues (1996) found that physical activity was inversely related to the risk of becoming overweight. Klesgesand colleagues (1992) reported that weight gain was134Physical Activity and Health inversely associated with leisure-time physical activ- ity among women but not among men. Williamsonand colleagues (1993), however, found no associa- tion between physical activity and subsequent weight change. Williamson and colleagues (1993) and Voorrips and colleagues (1992) proposed that de- creases in physical activity may be both a cause anda consequence of weight gain over a lifetime and that multiple measurements over time may be necessary to characterize the interrelationship. One cohort study that assessed changes in physical activity reported that among women, decreased physicalactivity performed as work was related to weight gain; no associations were found among men (Klesges et al. 1992). The relationship between physical activity and obesity in children is still under investigation. Some studies comparing obese and nonobese children have shown higher physical activity levels innonobese children (Johnson, Burke, Mayer 1956; Bullen, Reed, Mayer 1964); others have shown little or no relationship (Stefanik, Heald, Mayer 1959; Bradfield, Paulos, Grossman 1971). Somewhat in- consistent results have also been seen in cross-sectional studies, with several finding lower BMIs or skinfold measures among children with higher levels of physical activity or fitness (Wolf et al. 1993; Obarzanek et al. 1994; Strazzullo et al. 1988; Tell and Vellar 1988) and some smaller studies finding noassociation (Sallis et al. 1988; LaPorte et al. 1982). More recently, two longitudinal studies have re- ported inverse relationships between physical activ- ity and triceps skinfold measures (Moore et al. 1995) and BMI (Klesges et al. 1995) in young children. Athird longitudinal study (Ku et al. 1981) found a significant negative association between physical activity and percentage of body fat in boys but not in girls. Additional longitudinal studies of children, including measurement of changes in physical ac-tivity, will help clarify whether physical activity prevents the development of obesity. Over the past two decades, several comprehen- sive review articles two meta-analyses (Ballor and Keesey 1991; Epstein and Wing 1980), have examined the impactof exercise training on body weight and obesity. These reviews conclude that 1) physical activitygenerally affects body composition and weight fa- vorably by promoting fat loss while preserving orincreasing lean mass; 2) the rate of weight loss is positively related, in a dose-response manner, to the frequency and duration of the physical activity ses- sion, as well as to the duration (e.g., months, years) of the physical activity program; and 3) although therate of weight loss resulting from increased physical activity without caloric restriction is relatively slow, the combination of increased physical activity and dieting appears to be more effective for long-term weight regulation than is dieting alone (Brownelland Stunkard 1980; Kayman, Bruvold, Stern 1990). Independent of its effect on body weight and total adiposity, physical activity may favorably af- fect fat distribution. Several large cross-sectional studies in Europe (Seidell et al. 1991), Canada (Tremblay et al. 1990), and the United States (Kaye et al. 1990; Slattery et al. 1992; Troisi et al. 1991;Wing et al. 1991) report an inverse association between energy expenditure from physical activity and several indicators of central body fat distribu- tion, such as the waist-to-hip ratio or the waist-to- thigh-circumference ratio. Biologic Plausibility Increase in fat mass and the development of obesityoccur when energy intake exceeds total daily energy expenditure for a prolonged period (Bray 1983; Leibel, Rosenbaum, Hirsch 1995). Total energy ex-penditure represents the sum of 1) resting energy expenditure for maintaining basic body functions (approximately 60 percent of total energy require- ments); 2) the thermic effect of eating for digestion, absorption, transport, and deposition of nutrients(about 10 percent); and 3) nonresting energy expen- diture, primarily in the form of physical activity (about 30 percent) (Leibel, Rosenbaum, Hirsch 1995). This third component, nonresting energy expenditure, is the most variable. Energy balancetilts to weight gain when disproportionately more energy is taken in; theoretically, about one pound (or 0.45 kg) of fat energy is stored for each 3,500 kilocalories of excess energy intake. By increasing nonresting energy expenditure, regular physical ac-tivity contributes to weight maintenance and weight reduction. Evidence supports the metabolic and135The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease physiological benefits of incorporating physical ac- tivity into programs that prevent or exists over whether physical activ- ity following a meal increases the thermic effect of food ingestion and whether physical activity before a meal reduces appetite. The evidence suggests thatphysical activity programs do not necessarily pro- duce a compensatory increase in food intake in obese individuals (Woo, Garrow, Pi-Sunyer 1982a, 1982b). Moreover, daily physical activity may further assist in weight loss by partially reducing the decline inresting energy expenditure that occurs during diet- ing and associated weight loss (Lennon et al. 1985). This effect is plausible because endurance exercise and strength training may help preserve, to some degree, metabolically active, lean body mass, whereascaloric restriction does not (Hill, Drougas, Peters 1994; Ballor and Keesy 1991). Because abdominal fat is more responsive than gluteal lower-body fat to epinephrine stimula- tion (Wahrenberg, Bolinder, Arner 1991), activity may result in a more beneficial redistribu- tion of body fat in both sexes (Bouchard, Despr\u00e9s,Tremblay 1993). Further investigation, however, is needed to clarify the associations between go- nadal hormone levels, baseline regional fat distri- bution, and exercise-related changes in weight and body fat distribution. Conclusions Physical activity is important for weight control. Byusing energy and maintaining muscle mass, physical activity is a useful and effective adjunct to dietary management for avoiding weight gain or losingweight. Physical activity appears to favorably affect distribution of body fat. Mental Health Mental disorders pose a significant public health burden in the United States. Some disorders, such asdepression, are associated with suicide, which is currently the ninth leading cause of death among Americans (NCHS 1996). A major cause of hospital- ization and disability, mental disorders cost $148billion per year, about half of which is due to severe mental illness (National Advisory Mental HealthCouncil 1993). The annual prevalence of mental disorders in the United States population is high. Nearly three out of 10 persons 15-54 years of age who live in households report having had a mental disorder during the previous year (Regier et al. 1993; Kessler et al. 1994). The most frequently reported disorders are affective(mood) and anxiety disorders. More than one out of 10 adults suffers from a depressive disorder in any given year; between 13 and 17 percent suffer from an anxiety disorder. Women report a higher prevalence of affective and anxiety disorders than do men. Mostpeople with mental disorders do not obtain any professional treatment; only one in five people with a disorder during the previous year has received help from a health service provider. Mental disorders, mental illnesses, mental health, and psychological well-being relate to such factors as mood or affect, personality, cognition,and perception. Psychological constructs about these factors are interrelated with a person's physi- cal health status and quality of life. In studies of the effects of physical activity on mental health, the most frequently studied outcomes include mood(anxiety, depression, negative affect, and to a lesser extent, positive affect), self-esteem, self-efficacy, and cognitive functioning. The general hypothesis is that people who are physically active or have higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness have en-hanced mood (less negative and greater positive affect), higher self-esteem, greater confidence in their ability to perform tasks requiring physical activity (i.e., greater self-efficacy), and better cog- nitive functioning than sedentary persons or thosewho are less physically fit. One National Institutes of Mental Health workshop (Morgan and Goldston 1987) and numerous recent reviews have been devoted to this literature (Brown 1990; LaFontaine et al. effects of physical activity on most mental disorders\u2014including sleep and eating disorders,schizophrenia, dementia, personality disorders, and substance-related disorders\u2014are not as well studied136Physical Activity and Health (Dishman 1986; Taylor, Sallis, Needle 1985; Martinsen and Stephens 1994). This section focuses primarily on the association of physical activity with anxiety and depression.Evidence related to other psychological factors, such as positive affect, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and cog- nitive functioning, is discussed later in this chapter in the \"Health-Related Quality of Life\" section. Physical Activity and Mental Health Epidemiologic research among men and womensuggests that physical activity may be associated with reduced symptoms of depression (Ross and Hayes 1988; Stephens 1988; Stephens and Craig 1990; Farmer et al. 1988; Camacho et al. 1991),clinical depression (Weyerer 1992), symptoms of anxiety (Ross and Hayes 1988; Stephens 1988), and improvements in positive affect (Stephens 1988; Stephens and Craig 1990) and general well-being (Stephens 1988). In general, persons who are inactiveare twice as likely to have symptoms of depression than are more active persons. Most epidemiologic and intervention studies on the relationship of physical activity and mental health have used self-report questionnaires to assess symp- toms of anxiety and depression among persons from the general population, although some studies havefocused on patients diagnosed by clinicians. These questionnaires are useful for identifying persons experiencing mental distress (i.e., symptoms of anxiety or depression), but such identifications do not necessarily correspond to diagnoses of anxiety ordepression by clinicians using standard interview criteria (Fechner-Bates, Coyne, Schwenk 1994). The literature suggests that physical activity helps improve the mental health of both clinical and nonclinical populations. Physical activity interven- tions have benefited persons from the general popu- lation report mood disturbance (Simons andBirkimer 1988; Wilfley and Kunce 1986), including symptoms of anxiety (Steptoe et al. 1989) and de- pression (Morgan et al. 1970), as well as patients who have been diagnosed with nonbipolar, nonpsychotic depression Medhus, Sandvik 1985). These findings are supported by a limited number of inter- vention studies conducted in community and labo- ratory settings (Brown Landers 1990; Sime 1990).Intervention studies have primarily evaluated the effects of aerobic physical activities, such as brisk walking and running, on mental health; how other forms of physical activity, such as strength training, affect mental health requires further study. The psychological benefits of regular physical activity for persons who have relatively good physi-cal and mental health are less clear. Some interven- tion studies have found that physical activity provides mental health benefits to persons recruited from the community who are without serious psy- chological problems. These benefits included in-creases in general well-being (Cramer, Nieman, Lee 1991) and reductions in tension, confusion (Moses et al. 1989), and perceived stress and anxiety (King, Taylor, Haskell 1993). Other researchers have found that few (Brown et al. 1995; Blumenthal et al. 1989;King, Taylor, Haskell 1989) or no mental health benefits (Hughes, Casal, Leon 1986; Lennox, Bedell, Stone 1990) occurred among people without men- tal disorders who participated in physical activity interventions. Most of these studies involved relatively small sample sizes. Furthermore, the participants had littleopportunity to show improvement on objective and standardized mental health measures, since their baseline scores were already in the normal range or lower on measures of negative affect and were in the normal range or higher for positive affect. Even whenno change was observed on objective measures, in some of these studies, participants reported feeling a subjective sensation of improved physical, psycho- logical, or social well-being after participating in regular physical activity (Blumenthal et al. 1989;King, Taylor, Haskell 1993). Psychological assessments that have been used in physical activity research have included state and trait measures. State measures, which reflect how a person feels \"right now,\" are particularly useful in assessing changes in mood that occur before and after an intervention, such as a single episode ofphysical activity. Trait measures, which evaluate how a person \"generally\" feels, focus on personality characteristics that tend to be stable or sustained across the life span. Although physical activity train- ing programs can result in sustained psychological137The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease benefits, many people after a single session of physi- cal activity report improvements in transient moods,such as reduced anxiety (Morgan 1979a; Roth 1989), and have temporary reductions in muscular tension (DeVries 1981; DeVries and Adams 1972). The re- duction in anxiety may persist for 2 to 6 hours following a session of physical activity (Landers andPetruzzello 1994; Raglin and Morgan 1987). Regular daily physical activity is required to experience this calming effect on an ongoing basis. Some researchers have thus proposed that the episodic mental health benefits associated with physical activity may act asan important preventive measure that could lead to the maintenance of mental health over time (Morgan 1981; Morgan et al. 1980; Raglin 1990). A number of epidemiologic studies of populations have evaluated the associa- tions between self-reported levels of physical activity and mental health. These studies typically assessedretrospective self-reports of leisure-time physical activity during the previous several weeks or more. How these assessments relate to changes in cardio- respiratory fitness is unknown. The available evi- dence indicates, however, that increases incardiorespiratory fitness are not necessary for psy- chological benefits to occur (Brown and Wang Haskell 1989; Landers and Petruzzello 1994; Martinsen and Stephens 1994). Cross-sectional epidemiologic or community population studies support an association between physical activity and psychological well-being inthe general population. For example, in one cross- sectional study using data generated from a state telephone survey, researchers determined that adults (n = 401) who spent more time participating in regular exercise, sports, or other physical activitieshad fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety than persons reporting no physical activity or low levels of participation (Ross and Hayes 1988). These associa- tions were similar for men and women and for older and younger adults. The cause-and-effect relation-ship, however, cannot be determined because physi- cal activity and mood were measured at the same time. In another cross-sectional study (Stephens 1988), secondary analyses of two Canadian surveys (n = 23,791 and 22,250 young people and adults) and two U.S. surveys (n = 3,025 and 6,913 adults) conductedbetween 1971 and 1981 associated physical activity with fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression andwith higher positive mood and general well-being. These associations were observed in all four surveys, even though they used different measures of physical activity and mental health, and were strongest among women and among persons aged 40 years or older.However, one of the Canadian surveys found that women manifested higher positive affect when their energy expenditure scores were based on recre- ational activities only, rather than on a combination of recreational and household activities. Hence,mental health outcomes may depend on the type of physical activities being performed and perhaps on the setting in which they occur. This finding is important in that investigators have typically evalu- ated the mental health effects of recreational aerobicactivities, such as running, rather than occupational and household activities. A subsequent nationwide Canadian survey (Stephens and Craig 1990) of approximately 4,000 respondents aged 10 years and older found that persons who reported higher levels of total daily leisure-time energy expenditure had a more positivemood than persons reporting lower levels of expen- diture. Persons aged 25 years and older demon- strated an inverse relationship between physical activity and symptoms of depression. Although many cross-sectional studies suggest a positive association between physical activity and mental health, they do not necessarily indicate acause-and-effect relationship. Persons who have good mental health may simply be more likely to be active. Another possibility is that physical activity and men- tal health vary together, in which case a third vari- able, such as chronic health conditions, wouldmediate this relationship. Cohort studies provide additional insights into whether physical activity contributes to the primary prevention of mental health problems (Table 4-9). In one cohort study of 1,900 U.S. adults, a cross- sectional analysis of the baseline data revealed an association between depressive symptoms and littleor no involvement in physical activity (Farmer et al. 1988). At 8-year follow-up, little or no recreational physical activity was found to be a significant predic- tor of increased depressive symptoms among white women who had reported few depressive symptoms138Physical Activity and Health Table 4-9.

Among white men who had excessive depressive symptoms at baseline, low levels of rec-reational activity predicted continued depressive symptoms at follow-up. A cross-sectional analysis (Camacho et al. 1991) of 1965 baseline data on 6,928 U.S. residents re- vealed an inverse association between physical activ- ity (low, moderate, and high levels of participation in active sports, swimming or walking, doing exercises,or gardening) and depressive symptoms. Follow-up study of the men and women who had few depressive symptoms in 1965 showed that those who had low levels of physical activity were at greater risk than their highly active counterparts for having a highnumber of depressive symptoms in 1974. A 23- through 27-year follow-up study of 10,201 Harvard alumni men revealed that level of physical activity reported at an initial interview in 1962 or 1966 was inversely related to self- reported physician -diagnosed depression in 1988 (Paffenbarger, Lee, Leung 1994). Physical activityin 1962 and 1966 was defined as the number of hours per week spent doing physical activities (e.g., golf, gardening, carpentry, tennis, swimming, brisk walk- ing, jogging, or running); from this information, a physical activity index was computed as kilocaloriesof energy expended per week. In 1988, respondents were asked whether they had ever been told by a physician that they had health problems (e.g., CHD, emphysema), including depression, and to list the year of onset. Incidence of depression was deter-mined by an attack first experienced (at a known age of the respondent) during the follow-up period. This study was unique in that the relationship between physical activity and deaths due to suicides was also evaluated. The incidence of suicide (as identified ondeath certificates) was largely unrelated to the 1962 or 1966 physical activity history of the college alumni. However, the relative risk of depression was 27 percent lower for men who had reported playing 3 or more hours of sports each week than for men whohad reported playing none. In addition, men who had expended 1,000 to 2,499 kilocalories per week and those who had expended 2,500 kilocalories or more per week were at 17 percent and 28 percent less risk for depression, respectively, than men who hadexpended fewer than 1,000 kilocalories per week.In a study of rural Europeans (n = 1,536), a cross-sectional association was observed betweeninactivity (no physical exercise or sports participa- tion) and depression (diagnosed by research psy- chiatrists) (Weyerer 1992). However, low levels of physical activity at baseline were not a risk factor for depression at 5-year follow-up for men or women inthis study. Two of the epidemiologic studies reviewed above examined a possible dose-response relationship. In one study (Camacho et al. 1991), the baseline preva- lence of symptoms of depression was higher for per- sons reporting low levels of physical activity than for highly active persons; the risk was intermediate forthe moderately active group. At follow-up, the inci- dence of depressive symptoms revealed a significant difference only between persons in the lowest and highest activity groups. In the second study (Paffenbarger, Lee, Leung 1994), an inverse dose-response gradient was found between the baseline self-reported amount of physical activity calculated as kilocalories per week (< 1,000, 1,000-2,499, 2,500) and the follow-up incidence of physician-diagnosed depression. Men who at baseline had reported nohours of sports play per week had a similar follow-up incidence of depression as men who reported 1 to 2 hours of weekly play; but men who had participated in 3 or more hours of weekly play had a 27 percent lower risk for developing depression than the leastactive group. The findings from these two studies provide limited support for a dose-response relationship between levels of physical activity and measures of depressive symptoms or depression. However, among some endurance athletes, mood disturbances (de- creased vigor and increased fatigue, anxiety, andsymptoms of depression) have been observed with overtraining; mood improved after training was ta- pered (Morgan et al. 1987). It is therefore conceiv- able that for the general population, too strenuous a physical activity regimen may lead to deleteriouseffects on mental health (Morgan 1979b, 1994; Polivy 1994; Raglin 1990). To date, research has not iden- tified a threshold or an optimal frequency, duration, or intensity of physical activity necessary to improve mental health status.141The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease Biologic Plausibility Some researchers have proposed that exercise- induced changes in brain neuroreceptor concentra- tions opi- ates (endorphins and enkephalins) (Moore 1982) may help to favorably alter mood. The increased corebody temperature that occurs from physical activity may also decrease muscle tension (DeVries 1981). Other hypothalamic, metabolic, hormonal, or car- diorespiratory changes that result from training may eventually be linked to enhanced mental health. Psychosocial aspects of physical activity, such as having the opportunity for social interaction andsupport (Hughes, Casal, Leon 1986), experiencing increased feelings of self-mastery and self-efficacy (Simons et al. 1985; Hughes, Casal, Leon 1986), and experiencing relief from daily stressors (Bahrke and Morgan 1978), may improve mental health status insome people. Conclusions The literature reported here supports a beneficial effect of physical activity on relieving symptoms of depression and anxiety and on improving mood.There is some evidence that physical activity may protect against the development of depression, al- though further research is needed to confirm these findings. Health-Related Quality of Life For several decades, it has been recognized thathealth should not be defined simply as the absence of disease and disability; rather, health is now concep- tualized by the World Health Organization as a positive state of physical, mental, and social well-being (World Health Organization 1947). This rec- ognition has resulted in an increasing clinical, scientific, and public interest in the assessment and promotion of health-related quality of life (HRQL). Kaplan and Bush (1982) introduced the term HRQL to capture the influence that health status and health care have on the quality of day-to-day life.Viewed as a multidimensional construct that repre- sents a person's overall satisfaction with life, HRQL includes the following dimensions: cognitive, so- cial, physical, and emotional functioning; personalproductivity; and intimacy (Shumaker, Anderson, Czajkowski 1990). Rejeski, Brawley, and Shumaker(1996) have shown that physical activity has signifi- cant potential to influence HRQL. The most direct effects are likely in the areas of psychological well- being (e.g., self-concept, self-esteem, mood, and affect), perceived physical function (e.g., perceivedability to perform activities of daily living), physical well-being (e.g., perceived symptoms and perceived physical states, such as dyspnea, pain, fatigue, and energy), and, to a limited extent, cognitive function. In a recent review, McAuley (1994) concluded that a positive association exists between physical activity habits and self-esteem in both young adultsand children. The strength of this relationship in- creases when physical activity is personally valued and when measures of psychological well-being are specific rather than general. Among nonclinical and clinical samples of men and women, this associationis observed both with the long-term effects of exer- cise training and with the immediate, short-term effects of a single episode of activity. In a review of studies of middle-aged participants (mean age, 56.7 years), McAuley and Rudolph (1995) found correlations between involvement in physical activity and psychological well-being that were simi-lar to those patterns observed among younger per- sons. Further, the strength of these relationships was directly related to the length of time that the partici- pants had been involved in physical activity programs. This moderating effect requires cautious interpreta-tion because of the possibility of selective adherence. There was little evidence that the relationship be- tween physical activity and psychological well-being was affected by either sex or age. Finally, although a number of studies noted improvements in both thecardiorespiratory fitness and the psychological well- being of older adults, these improvements were not necessarily correlated (McAuley and Rudolph 1995). Involvement in physical activity may thus increase the psychological well-being of older adults indepen-dently of cardiorespiratory fitness (Brown and and Petruzzello 1994; Martinsen and Stephens 1994; McAuley and Rudolph 1995). Other data suggest that physical activity is re- lated to perceived improvement in physical function in activities of daily living. However, there is a limit142Physical Activity and Health to this effect, since sedentary people can usually do their daily tasks. Most research on this aspect ofHRQL is thus confined to populations of people who, because of health problems, have restrictions in their activities of daily living. The growing body of litera- ture on this topic indicates that patients whose physical function is compromised by heart disease(Ewart 1989) or arthritis (Fisher et al. 1993) expe- rience improved daily function from increases in physical activity. HRQL requires a number of different types of measurements; however, few studies on physical activity have used a multidimensional measure- ment scheme. Exceptions include a randomizedclinical trial involving healthy elderly persons (Stewart, King, Haskell 1993) and a 2-year obser- vational study of persons with chronic disease (Stewart et al. 1994). In the clinical trial, healthy persons who were assigned to endurance exercisehad better self-reported ratings of their physical functioning and health (e.g., physical and role func- tion, experiencing of pain, perception of health status) than control participants, yet endurance training brought no changes in self-reported en-ergy/fatigue, psychological distress, or psychologi- cal well-being. By contrast, among persons with chronic diseases, physical activity was associated with improvement in both psychological well-be- ing and physical function; however, the magnitudeof these effects was highly dependent on the status of the patient's chronic disease. Participants who have lower levels of mental or physical health may have the most to gain from physical activity (Lennox, Bedell, Stone 1990; Morgan et al. 1970; Simons andBirkimer 1988; Rejeski et al. 1995), since they have more room to improve their health status than people already possessing good health. A relatively small number of cross-sectional stud- ies have shown a strong positive association be- tween regular physical activity and cognitive and neuropsychological performance on tasks such asmath, acuity, and reaction time (Dustman, Emmerson, Shearer 1994; Thomas et al. 1994). However, longer-term training studies (2 or more years) are required to confirm whether aerobic exercise has a pronounced effect on cognitive func-tion. Also unclear are whether the effects of low- intensity physical activity are similar to those ofaerobic exercise and whether objective measures of cognitive function can elucidate the perceived cog-nitive function of participants (Dustman, Emmerson, Shearer 1994). Conclusions Physical activity appears to improve psychological well-being. Among people compromised by ill health,physical activity appears to improve their ability to perform activities of daily living. Adverse Effects of Physical Activity Although physical activity has numerous health ben- efits, its potential adverse effects must also be consid-ered. Listing the potential risks associated with physical activity is a straightforward matter. It is much more difficult to determine how commonly they occur among people who are physically active. Types of Adverse Effects Musculoskeletal Injuries Acute stress from sudden forceful movement cancause strains, tears, and even fractures. For example, a vigorous swing of a baseball bat can lead to adislocated shoulder. An attempt to accelerate for- ward in tennis can tear an Achilles tendon. Bending to retrieve an object can rupture an intervertebral disc. Injuries like these can result from any activity, exercise, or sport that features sudden movements,such as those that can occur in professional or amateur track and field, racquet sports, basketball, baseball, football, soccer, and golf. Collisions with equipment, other participants, and surfaces can also produce severe injury. Children and adolescentswith developing bodies are at special risk of perma- nent physical damage if injury occurs to the growth plates of long bones or to other bone or connective tissue structures. Activities that involve repetitive motions, some- times with traumatic contact with a ground surface or ball, are associated with other musculoskeletalinjuries. An extensive literature describes injuries related to jogging and running (Hoeberigs 1992; Rolf 1995; Van Mechelen 1992). Lower-extremity injuries appear to be the most common; of these,143The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease the knee, ankle, and foot have the highest propor- tions of injuries (e.g., torn cartilage, tendinitis,plantar fasciitis, neuromas, and shinsplints). Inju- ries are also 1987]), racquet sports (e.g., [Richie, Kelso, Bellucci 1985]), injuries [Howell 1984]). Metabolic Abnormalities Severe exertion, particularly of prolonged duration and under hot or humid conditions, can lead to hyperthermia, electrolyte imbalance, and dehydra- tion (England et al. 1982; Frizzell et al. 1986; Surgenor and Uphold 1994). Timely fluid intake and replace-ment, with proper electrolyte and caloric ameliorate such metabolic upsets. Hypothermia is a risk in many water sports and for any activities undertaken in cold weather (or even cool weather if inadequate clothing is worn). Ex-treme endurance training regimens can lead to endo- crine system alterations, sometimes resulting in anovulation and amenorrhea in females, in associa- tion with a decrease in body weight below a critical lean mass, as well as with a decrease in bone mass(Shangold 1984). Hypoglycemia can occur in people with diabetes if they do not develop a routine of regular activity in conjunction with regular monitor- ing of their blood sugar (and adjustment of their medication accordingly). Hematologic and Body Organ Abnormalities Anemia is reported in athletes vigorously engaged in sports such as long-distance running; hemoglobin- uria can occur secondary to breakage of red blood cells during the repetitive impact of distance run- ning, and hematuria can occur when distance run-ning traumatizes the bladder or other structures in the genitourinary system. Rhabdomyolysis, the leak- age of contents of muscle cells, can occur as a result of strenuous activity, such as weight lifting or mili- tary basic training, and can lead to renal failure(Kuipers 1994; Sinert et al. 1994).Hazards Cyclists, runners, and walkers often face risks asso-ciated with travel on roadways\u2014collisions with motorvehicles, injuries from falls secondary to uneven surfaces, and attacks by animals or humans. Skiers and skaters must contend with falls at high veloci- ties. Baseball players may be struck by a thrown or batted ball or injured by a spike-soled shoe. Basket-ball and soccer entail collisions with other players and frequent falls to hard surfaces. Football, hockey, and boxing, by their very nature, are sports where sanctioned and moderately controlled interpersonal violence often leads to contusions, lacerations, mus-culoskeletal injury, and fractures, as well as to concussions and chronic disability (Kraus and Conroy 1984). Infectious, Allergic, and Inflammatory Conditions Swimming increases the risk of otitis externa(\"swimmer's ear\"). Overtrained athletes may have an increased risk from immunosuppres- sion (Newsholme and Parry-Billings 1994). Exer- tion may provoke asthmatic attacks, usually occurring after exercise in susceptible individuals (Anderson,Daviskas, Smith 1989). Cardiac Events As was discussed earlier in this chapter, regularphysical activity improves cardiorespiratory fitness and reduces the risk of CVD mortality over the long term, although it can acutely increase risk for un-toward cardiac events in the short term. Persons with compromised coronary circulation may develop an- gina or acute myocardial infarction during vigorous activity (Mittleman et al. 1993; Willich et al. 1993). Arrythmias may be precipitated by a combination ofexertion and underlying heart disease, and some can lead to sudden death (Kohl et al. 1992; Koplan 1979; Siscovick et al. 1984; Thompson, Funk, et al. 1982). Compared with sedentary people who suddenly begin exercising vigorously, persons who exerciseregularly have a lower risk of exercise-related sud- den death, although even this group has a transient elevation of risk during and immediately after vig- orous exercise (Kohl et al. 1992; Siscovick et al. 1984). Nonetheless, the net effect of regular physi-cal activity is to decrease the risk of cardiac death.144Physical Activity and Health Occurrence of Adverse Effects Determining the incidence or prevalence of adverse effects of physical activity, or factors that influence the likelihood of their occurrence, is hampered by not knowing how many people have similar physical activity patterns and are thus similarly at risk of an adverse event, or how many inactive people sustainsimilar injuries. Nevertheless, a few studies have provided some insight into the occurrence of adverse events. Of the activities that are common in the United States, including jogging/running, walking, gardening, bicycling, swimming, aerobic dance, andsoftball, running has received the most attention by researchers. Injuries among runners are common, ranging from 25 through 65 percent (Jones, Cowan, Knapik 1994). Most running-related injuries involve the leg and foot and are usually self-correcting in a relatively short time. Studies of such injuries havegenerally shown that occurrence of musculoskel- etal injury is directly related to mileage run (Blair, Kohl, Goodyear 1987; Hoeberigs 1992; Marti 1988; Marti et al. 1988; Walter et al. 1989) or tofrequency or duration of running (Pollock et al. 1977). Previous injury appears to be a risk factor for subsequent injury. In one small study of people aged 70-79 years, the injury rate was lower for walking than jogging (5 percent vs. 57 percent)(Pollock et al. 1991). Whether this finding is true only among the elderly or is characteristic of these activities at all ages remains to be determined. Although few studies of aerobic dance have been conducted, the injury rate appears to be higher among those taking more than 4 classes per week (Richie, Kelso, Bellucci 1985). Conclusions A wide spectrum of adverse events can occur withphysical activity, ranging from those that cause mi- nor inconvenience to those that are life-threatening. At least some of the musculoskeletal injuries arelikely to be preventable if people gradually work up to a physical activity goal and avoid excessive amounts of physical activity or excessively high levels of intensity. Although adverse cardiac events are more likely to occur with physical exertion, the net effectof regular physical activity is a lower CVD mortality rate among active than inactive people (see earliersections of this chapter). People should be advised not to undertake physi- cal activities well beyond their normal level of exer- tion. Inactive people wishing to begin a new program of moderate activity should begin with short dura- tions and gradually lengthen them toward their target. Men over age 40 and women over age 50 whowish to begin a new program involving vigorous- intensity activity, people who have preexisting health problems, and people who are at high risk of CVD should consult a physician before embarking on a program of physical activity to which they areunaccustomed (ACSM 1991). Nature of the Activity/Health Relationship Causality The studies reviewed in this chapter indicate that physical activity is associated with a reduction in risk of all-cause mortality, all CVDs combined, CHD, hypertension, colon cancer, and NIDDM. To evalu- ate whether the information presented is sufficient to infer that these associations are causal in nature, it isuseful to review the evidence according to Hill's classic criteria for causality (Hill 1965; Paffenbarger 1988). Strength of Association. The numerous estimated measures of association for cardiovascular outcomes presented in this chapter generally fall within the range of a 1.5- to 2.0-fold increase in risk of adversehealth outcomes associated with inactivity. This range represents a moderately strong association, similar in magnitude to the relationship between CHD and smoking, hypertension, or elevated cho- lesterol. The associations with NIDDM, hyperten-sion, and colon cancer have been somewhat smaller in magnitude. The difficulty in measuring physical activity may lead to substantial misclassification, which in turn would bias studies toward finding less of an effect of activity than may actually exist. On theother hand, not controlling for all potential con- founders could bias studies toward finding more of an effect than may actually exist. Efforts to stratify studies of physical activity and CHD by the quality of145The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease measurement have found that the methodologically better studies showed larger associations than thosewith lower quality scores (Powell et al. 1987; Berlin and Colditz 1990). In addition, cardiorespiratory fitness, which is more objectively and precisely mea- sured than the reported level of physical activity, often is also more strongly related to CVD andmortality. Measures of association between physical activity and health outcomes thus might be stronger if physical activity measurements were more accurate. Consistency of Findings. Although the epidemio- logic studies of physical activity have varied greatly in methodology, in ways of classifying physical activ- ity, and in populations studied, the findings havebeen remarkably consistent in supporting a reduc- tion in risk as a function of greater amounts of physical activity, or conversely, an increase in risk as a function of inactivity. Temporality . For most of the health conditions included in this chapter (all-cause mortality, CVD, CHD, hypertension, NIDDM), longitudinal data fromcohort studies have been available and have con- firmed a temporal sequence in which physical activ- ity patterns are determined prior to development of disease. For obesity and mental health, fewer longi- tudinal studies have been conducted, and findingshave been more equivocal. Perhaps the strongest evidence for temporality comes from two studies of the effect of changes in activity or fitness level. Men who became more active or more fit had a lower mortality rate during follow-up than men who re-mained inactive or unfit (Paffenbarger et al. 1993; Blair et al. 1995). Biological Gradient. Studies of all-cause mortal- ity, CVD, CHD, and NIDDM have shown a gradient of greater benefit associated with higher amounts of physical activity. Most studies that included more than two categories of amount of physical activityand were therefore able to evaluate a dose-response relationship found a gradient of decreasing risk of disease with increasing amounts of physical activity (see Tables 4-1 through 4-8). Biologic Plausibility. Evidence that physiologic effects of physical activity have beneficial conse- quences for CHD, NIDDM, and obesity is abundant(see Chapter 3, as well as the biologic plausibility sections of this chapter). Such evidence includes beneficial effects on physiologic risk factors fordisease, such as high blood pressure and blood lipoproteins, as well as beneficial effects on circula-tory system functioning, blood-clotting mecha- nisms, insulin production and glucose handling, and caloric balance. Experimental Evidence . Controlled clinical trials have not been conducted for the outcomes of mor- tality, CVD, cancer, obesity, or NIDDM. However, randomized clinical trials have determined thatphysical activity improves these diseases' risk fac- tors, such as blood pressure, lipoprotein profile, insulin sensitivity, and body fat. The information reviewed in this chapter shows that the inverse association between physical activity and several diseases is moderate in magnitude, con- sistent across studies that differed substantially inmethods and populations, and biologically plau- sible. A dose-response gradient has been observed in most studies that examined more than two levels of activity. For most of the diseases found to be in- versely related to physical activity, the temporalsequence of exposure preceding disease has been demonstrated. Although controlled clinical trials have not been conducted (and are not likely to be conducted) for morbidity and mortality related to the diseases of interest, controlled trials have shownthat activity can improve physiologic risk factors for these diseases. From this large body of consistent information, it is reasonable to conclude that physi- cal activity is causally related to the health outcomes reported here. Population Burden of Sedentary Living Given that the relationship between activity andseveral diseases is likely to be causal, it follows that a large number of Americans unnecessarily become ill or die each year because of an inactive way of life.Published estimates of the number of lives lost in a year because of inactivity have ranged from 200,000 for inactivity alone to 300,000 for inactivity and poor diet combined (Hahn et al. 1990; Powell and Blair 1994; McGinnis and Foege 1993). Such estimates aregenerally derived by calculating the population at- tributable risk (PAR), which is based on both the relative mortality rate associated with inactivity and the prevalence of inactivity in the population. Such estimates are inherently uncertain because they do146Physical Activity and Health not take into account the reality that some people have more than one risk factor for a disease; for thesepeople, the elimination of a single risk factor (e.g., by becoming physically active) may not reduce mortal- ity risk to the level attainable for people who initially have only that one risk factor. PAR methods thus overestimate the proportion of deaths avoidable byeliminating one modifiable risk factor, in this case physical inactivity. On the other hand, PAR esti- mates of avoidable mortality do not address other important aspects of the population burden of sed- entary living. The benefits of reducing the occur-rence of CHD, colon cancer, and diabetes greatly surpass the benefits of reducing premature mortal- ity, yet the reductions in avoidable disease, disabil- ity, suffering, and health care costs have not been calculated. Similarly, the health benefits of improvedmood, quality of life, and functional capacity have not been quantified. Although the total population burden of physical inactivity in the United States has not been quantified, sedentary living habits clearly constitute a major public health problem. Dose Using the epidemiologic literature to derive recom-mendations for how much and what kind of physical activity a person should obtain is problematic, in part because the methods for measuring and classi-fying physical activity in epidemiologic studies are not standardized. Measurement of physical activity generally relies on self-reported information in re- sponse to questionnaires, although some studies use occupation to categorize a person's presumed levelof physical activity at work. Responses to questions or occupational activity categories are usually trans- formed, using a variety of methods, into estimates of calories expended per week, minutes of activity per week, categories of total activity, or other types ofcomposite scores. Numerous studies have used this type of infor- mation to estimate total amount of activity, and many have been able to explore dose-response rela- tionships across categories of activity amount. For the most part, these studies demonstrate that amount of benefit is directly related to amount of physicalactivity (see Tables 4-1 through 4-8), rather than showing a threshold level of activity necessary before health benefits accrue. Such studies are less helpful,however, in assessing the relationship of health benefits to intensity of physical activity (i.e., howhard one must work during the activity itself) be- cause few studies have separately measured or ana- lyzed levels of intensity while taking into account the other dimensions of activity (e.g., frequency, dura- tion, total caloric expenditure). As described earlier,however, for some health benefits (e.g., blood pres- sure lowering), clinical trials of exercise intensity suggest similar, if not greater, benefit from moderate- as from vigorous-intensity exercise. It is often asked how little physical activity a person can obtain and still derive health benefit. Although the dose-response relationship appearsnot to have a lower threshold, thereby indicating that any activity is better than none, some quantitation of a target \"dose\" of activity is helpful for many people. It has been shown that total amount of physical activity (a combination of in-tensity, frequency, and duration) is related to health outcomes in a dose-response fashion, but the abso- lute difference in amount of physical activity in kilocalories of energy expended between exposure categories has not been estimated routinely. Severalstudies, however, have estimated average caloric expenditure for the activity categories studied and thus allow quantitation of amount of physical activ- ity associated with improved health outcomes. Paffenbarger and colleagues (1986) found that com-pared with the least active group in the study, those who expended 71-143 kilocalories of energy per day had a 22 percent reduction in overall mortality, and those who expended 143-214 kilocalories per day had a 27 percent reduction. Leon and col-leagues (1987) showed that a difference of about 30 minutes per day of activity (light, moderate, and vigorous activity combined), equivalent to an aver- age difference of about 150 kilocalories of energy expended per day, was associated with a 36 percentlower risk of CHD mortality and a 27 percent lower risk of all-cause death, after the analysis adjusted for other factors that can effect CHD and total mortality. Slattery and colleagues (1989) found that a daily average of 73 more kilocalories of totalactivity than were expended among the least active group was associated with a 16 percent reduction in CHD mortality and a 14 percent reduction in all-cause mortality. Furthermore, in the majority (62 percent)147The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease of that study population, no vigorous activity was reported. In that group, a daily average of 150kilocalories greater expenditure in light-to-moderate activity was associated with a 27 percent lower CHD mortality and a 19 percent lower total mortal- ity. The effects of light-to-moderate activity on CHD death remained significant after the analysisadjusted for potential confounders. Similarly, in a study of NIDDM (Helmrich et al. 1991) that showed a significant inverse trend between kilocalories expended in activity and development of NIDDM, total activity of 140-215 kilocalories per day wasassociated with a 21 percent reduction in NIDDM onset. In the group that obtained this level of energy expenditure without any vigorous sports participation, the reduction in NIDDM onset was 13 percent. Based on these studies, it is reasonable to con- clude that activity leading to an increase in dailyexpenditure of approximately 150 kilocalories/day (equivalent to about 1,000 kilocalories/week) is as- sociated with substantial health benefits and that the activity does not need to be vigorous to achieve benefit. It should be emphasized that this is anestimate based on few studies, and that further re- search will be required to refine it. For example, it is not clear whether it is the total amount of caloric expenditure or the amount of caloric expenditure per unit of body weight that is important. Nonethe-less, this amount of physical activity can be obtained in a variety of ways and can vary from day to day to meet the needs and interests of the individual. An average expenditure of 150 kilocalories/day (or 1,000 kilocalories/week) could be achieved by walkingbriskly for 30 minutes per day, or by a shorter duration of more vigorous activity (e.g., 15 minutes of running at 10 minutes per mile), or by a longer duration of more vigorous activity less frequently (e.g., running at 10 minutes per mile for about 35minutes 3 times per week). Other sample activities are provided in Table 4-10. In addition to the health effects associated with a moderate amount of physical activity, the dose- response relationships show that further increases in activity confer additional health benefits. Thus people who are already meeting the moderate activity rec-ommendation can expect to derive additional benefit by increasing their activity. Since amount of activityis a function of intensity, frequency, and duration, increasing the amount of activity can be accom-plished by increasing any, or all, of those dimensions. There is evidence that increasing physical activ- ity, even after years of inactivity, improves health. Studies of the health effects of increasing physical activity or fitness (Paffenbarger et al. 1993; Blair et al. 1995) have shown a reduced mortality rate in men who become more active or more fit compared withthose who remain sedentary. This benefit was appar- ent even for men who became physically active after the age of 60. Most importantly, a regular pattern of physical activity must be maintained to sustain the physi- ologic changes that are assumed responsible for the health benefits (see Chapter 3). Thus it is crucial foreach person to select physical activities that are sustainable over the course of his or her life. For some people, a vigorous workout at a health club is the most sustainable choice; for others, activities integrated into daily life (e.g., walking to work,gardening and household chores, walking after din- ner) may be a more sustainable option. Periodic reevaluation may be necessary to meet changing needs across the life span. A related issue of pattern of physical activity (frequency and duration in the course of a day) has recently come under review. Three studies have heldconstant both total amount of activity and intensity of activity while daily pattern was varied (one long session versus shorter, more frequent sessions). Two studies showed equivalent increases in cardiorespira- tory fitness (Jakicic et al. 1995; Ebisu 1985). Onestudy showed gains in fitness for both the \"short bout\" and \"long bout\" groups, al- though on one of three measures (maximal oxygen uptake versus treadmill test duration and heart rate at submaximal exercise), the gain in fitness was signifi-cantly greater in the long bout group (DeBusk et al. 1990). These observations give rise to the notion that intermittent episodes of activity accumulated in the course of a day may have cardiorespiratory fitness benefits comparable to one longer continuous epi-sode. Whether this assumption holds true for the outcomes of disease occurrence and death remains to be determined. Nevertheless, some previous observa- tional studies have shown lower rates of CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality among people with an active148Physical Activity and Health lifestyle that included activities such as walking, stair climbing, household or yard work, and gardening\u2014activities that are often performed intermittently (Leon et al. 1987; Paffenbarger et al. 1986). This informa- tion, together with evidence that some people may adhere better to an exercise recommendation that allows for accumulating short episodes of activity asan alternative to one longer episode per day (Jakicic et al. 1995), supports the notion that accumulation of physical activity throughout the day is a reasonable alternative to setting aside an uninterrupted period of time for physical activity each day. Although moreresearch is clearly needed to better define the differ- ential effects of various patterns of activity, experts have agreed that intermittent episodes of activity are more beneficial than remaining sedentary. This con- sensus is reflected in recent physical activity recom-mendations from the CDC and the ACSM (Pate et al. 1995) and from the NIH Consensus Development Panel on Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Dis- ease (see Chapter 2, Appendix B).Conclusions The findings reviewed in this chapter form the basis for concluding that moderate amounts of activity can protect against several diseases. A greater de- gree of protection can be achieved by increasing the amount of activity, which can be accomplished by increasing intensity, frequency, or duration. None-theless, modest increases in physical activity are likely to be more achievable and sustainable for sedentary people than are more drastic changes, and it is sedentary people who are at greatest risk for poor health related to inactivity. Thus the publichealth emphasis should be on encouraging those who are inactive to become moderately active. These conclusions are consistent with the recent CDC- ACSM recommendations for physical activity (Pate et al. 1995) and the NIH Consensus DevelopmentConference Statement on Physical Activity and Car- diovascular Health (see Chapter 2, Appendix B), which emphasize the importance of obtaining physi- cal activity of at least moderate amount on a regular basis. The recommendations also encourage thoseTable 4-10.

Further study is needed to deter- mine which combinations of these interrelated fac- tors are most important for specific health benefits. Most important, however, is the recognition thatphysical activity recommendations should be tai- lored to an individual's needs and preferences. Encouraging sedentary people to become moder- ately active is likely to reduce the burden of unnec- essary suffering and death only if the activity can besustained on a daily basis for many years. Chapter Summary Despite the variety of methods used to measure and classify physical activity, the imprecision of these measures, and the considerable variation instudy designs and analytic sophistication, several findings consistently emerge from the epidemio- logic literature on physical activity and health. Physical activity of the type that improves cardio- respiratory endurance reduces the risk of develop-ing or dying from CVD (CHD in particular), hypertension, colon cancer, and NIDDM and im- proves mental health. Findings are highly sugges- tive that endurance-type physical activity may reduce the risk of developing obesity, osteoporo-sis, and depression and may improve psychologi- cal well-being and quality of life. There is promising evidence that muscle strengthening (resistance) exercise reduces the risk of falling and fractures among the elderly. Furthermore, there appears tobe a dose-response relationship between physical activity and disease prevention: higher levels of activity appear to have the most benefit, but lower levels have demonstrable benefits for some dis- eases as well. For the U.S. population, in which themajority of people are sedentary or only minimally active, achievable increases in physical activity of a moderate amount, including some resistance exercise to strengthen muscle, are likely to sub- stantially improve the health and quality of life ofmany people.Conclusions Overall Mortality 1. Higher levels of regular physical activity are asso- ciated with lower mortality rates for both older and younger adults. 2. Even those who are moderately active on a regu- lar basis have lower mortality rates than thosewho are least active. Cardiovascular Diseases 1. Regular physical activity or cardiorespiratory fit- ness decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in general and of coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in particular. Existing data are not conclusive regarding a relationship betweenphysical activity and stroke. 2. The level of decreased risk of CHD attributable to regular physical activity is similar to that of other lifestyle factors, such as keeping free from cigarette smoking. 3. Regular physical activity prevents or delays the development of high blood pressure, and exer- cise reduces blood pressure in people with hypertension. Cancer 1. Regular physical activity is associated with a decreased risk of colon cancer. 2. There is no association between physical activity and rectal cancer. Data are too sparse to draw conclusions regarding a relationship between physical activity and endometrial, ovarian, or testicular cancers. 3. Despite numerous studies on the subject, exist- ing data are inconsistent regarding an association between physical activity and breast or prostate cancers. Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus 1. Regular physical activity lowers the risk of developing non-insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus.150Physical Activity and Health Osteoarthritis 1. Regular physical activity is necessary for main- taining normal muscle strength, joint structure, and joint function. In the range recommended for health, physical activity is not associated with joint damage or development of osteoarthritisand may be beneficial for many people with arthritis. 2. Competitive athletics may be associated with the development of osteoarthritis later in life, but sports-related injuries are the likely cause. Osteoporosis 1. Weight-bearing physical activity is essential for normal skeletal development during childhood and adolescence and for achieving and main- taining peak bone mass in young adults. 2. It is unclear whether resistance- or endurance- type physical activity can reduce the acceleratedrate of bone loss in postmenopausal women in the absence of estrogen replacement therapy. Falling 1. There is promising evidence that strength train- ing and other forms of exercise in older adults preserve the ability to maintain independent liv- ing status and reduce the risk of falling. Obesity 1. Low levels of activity, resulting in fewer kilocalo- ries used than consumed, contribute to the high prevalence of obesity in the United States. 2. Physical activity may favorably affect body fat distribution. Mental Health 1. Physical activity appears to relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety and improve mood. 2. Regular physical activity may reduce the risk of developing depression, although further research is required on this topic.Health-Related Quality of Life 1. Physical activity appears to improve health- related quality of life by enhancing psychological well-being and by improving physical function- ing in persons compromised by poor health. Adverse Effects 1. Most musculoskeletal injuries related to physi- cal activity are believed to be preventable bygradually working up to a desired level of activity and by avoiding excessive amounts of activity. 2. Serious cardiovascular events can occur with physical exertion, but the net effect of regularphysical activity is a lower risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease. Research Needs 1. Delineate the most important features or combi- nations of features of physical activity (total amount, intensity, duration, frequency, pattern,or type) that confer specific health benefits. 2. Determine specific health benefits of physical activity for women, racial and ethnic minority groups, and people with disabilities. 3. Examine the protective effects of physical activ- ity in conjunction with other lifestyle character- istics and disease prevention behaviors. 4. Examine the types of physical activity that pre- serve muscle strength and functional capacity in the elderly. 5. Further study the relationship between physical activity in adolescence and early adulthood and the later development of breast cancer. 6. Clarify the role of physical activity in pre venting or reducing bone loss after menopause.151The Effects of Physical Activity on Health and Disease References Abbott RD, Rodriguez BL, Burchfiel CM, Curb JD.
