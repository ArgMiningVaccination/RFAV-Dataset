PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES This demonstration aims to transform the health care delivery system through regional, collaborative efforts led by Accountable Communities of Health (ACH) . It will test changes to payment , care delivery models and targeted services . Over the next five years, Washington will: Integrate physical and behavioral health purchasing a nd service delivery to better meet whole person needs; Convert 90 percent of Medicaid provider payments to reward outcomes instead of volume; Support provider capacity to adopt new payment and care models; Implement population health strategies that impro ve health equity; and Provide new targeted services that address the needs of the state 's aging populations and address key determinants of health The demonstration will provide up to $1.125 billion (total computable ) in the form of incentive payments to providers tied to projects coordinated by ACHs, based on achievement of milestones and outcomes. Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSR IP) incentives under this demonstration are time-limited and the project design will reflect a priority for financial sustainability beyond the demonstration period. ACHs are regionally situated, self-governing organizations with non -overlapping geographic boundaries that also align with Washington's regional service areas for Medicaid purchasing. ACHs are comp osed of managed care, provider, and many other community organizations and are focused on improving health and transforming care delivery for the populations that live within their region. ACHs are not new service delivery organizations and do not provide direct services nor are they a replacement of managed care. ACHs will lead strategies consistent with the transformation objectives based on a regional needs assessment . ACHs will be responsible for certifying achievement of milestones and performance metr ics for payment to partnering providers . Managed care organizations (MCO) will continue to serve the majority of Medicaid enrollees in the provision and coordination of State Plan services and will be incentivized to implement value based payment strategi es. The state will also offer a new Medicaid Alternative Care (MAC) benefit package for individuals eligible for Medicaid but not currently receiving Medicaid -funded long -term services and supports (LTSS). This benefit package will provide another community -based option for clients and their families to choose , which will help them avoid or delay more intensive Medicaid - funded services by supporting their unpaid caregivers . In addition to the MAC benefits, the State will also engage in activities t o support unpaid family caregivers who serve MAC beneficiaries. Similar to the MAC benefit package, the state will also establish a new eligibility category and limited benefit package termed Tailored Supports for Older Adults (TSOA).

Managed care organizations (MCOs) will continue in their current roles , serving the majority of Medicaid enrollees in the provision and Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 14 coordination of State Plan services and will be incentivized to implement value -based payment strategies . ACHs , through their governing bodies, are responsible for managing and coordinating the partnering providers. The ACHs must meet the qualifications set forth in STCs 21 -23 and must meet certain targets to earn incentive payments . In addition, they will certify whether or not the partnering providers have met the milestones as required for earning incentive payments within their region. The ACH will certify to the independent assessor (see STC 21) whether or not partnering providers have achieved the milestones. The independent assessor will review the ACH's certification and make recommendations to the state related to distribution of payment. Once the state affirms the recommendations from the independent assessor, the state will send them to the financial executor to distribute incentive payments to the partnering ACH providers . Incentive payments for partnering providers and the ACHs will transition from pay -for-reporting to outcome -based over the course of the demonstration . The performance of this initiative will be measured at the statewide and regional ACH level, and in centive payments will be paid out accordingly. The maximum allowable expenditures available for total ACH incentive payments are enumerated in STC 44 below (see Chart B). The s tate will allocate total funds across the ACHs based on a CMS -approved methodology to be submitted in the DSRIP Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D). Each regional ACH includes a coalition of partnering providers , and the ACH primary decision -making body will apply on behalf of partnering providers for such incentive payments as a single ACH. 21. Role of Independent Assessor. The state will contract with an independent assessor to review ACH project proposals using the state's review tool and consider anticipated project performance. The independent assessor has no affiliation with the ACHs or their partnering providers. The independent assessor shall make recommendations to the state regarding approvals, denials or recommended changes to project plans to make them approvable. This entity (or another entity identified by the state) will also assist with the mid -point assessment and any other ongoing reviews of ACH P roject Plan. a. Review tool . The state will develop a standardized review tool that the independent assessor will use to review ACH P roject Plans and ensure compliance with these STCs and associated protocols. The review tool will be available for public comment according to the timeframe specified in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protoco l (Attachment D). The review tool will define the relevant factors, assign weights to each factor, and include a scoring for each factor. b. Mid-point assessment. During DY 3, the state's independent assessor shall assess project performance to determine whether ACH P roject Plans merit continued funding and provide recommendations to the state. If the state decides to discontinue specific projects, the project funds may be made available for expanding successful project plans in DY 4 and DY 5, as described in the Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D). Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 15 22. ACH Management. Each ACH must identify a primary decision -making process , a process for conflict resolution and structure (e.g., a Board or Steering Committee) that is subject to the outlined composition and participation guidelines. The primary decision - making body will be the final decision -maker for the ACH regarding the selection of projects and participants based on the regional needs assessment . Each ACH and the s tate will collaborate and agree on each ACH's approach to its decision -making structure for purposes of this demonstration . The overall organizational structure established by the ACH must reflect capability to make decisions and be accou ntable for the following five domains, at a minimum . The ACH must demonstrate compliance with this STC in the ACH Project Plan. a. Financial , including decisions about the allocation methodology , the roles and responsibilities of each partner organization, and budget development. b. Clinical , including appropriate expertise and strategies for monitoring clinical outcomes. The ACH will be responsible for monitoring activities of providers participat ing in care delivery redesign projects and should incorporate clinical leadership , which reflects both large and small providers and urban and rural providers. c. Community , including a n emphasis on health equity and a process to engage the community and co nsumers. d. Data , including the processes and resources to support data -driven decision making and formative evaluation. e. Program management and strategy development . The ACH must have organizational capacity and administrative support for regional coordinat ion and communication on behalf of the ACH. 23. ACH Composition and Participation. At a minimum , each ACH decision -making body must include voting partners from the following categories: a. One or more primary care providers, including practices and facilities serving Medicaid beneficiaries; b. One or more behavioral health providers, including practices and facilities serving Medicaid beneficiaries; c. One or more h ealth plans, including but not limited to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations; if only one opening is available for a health plan, it must be filled by a Medicaid Managed Care Organization; d. One or more hospitals or health systems; e. One or more local public health jurisdiction; f. One or more representatives from the tribes , IHS facilities, and UIHPs in the reg ion, as further specified in STC 24; g.

This includes, but is no t limited to, transportation, housing, employment services, education, criminal justice, financial assistance, consumers , consumer advocacy organizations, childcare, veteran services, community supports, legal assistance, etc. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 16 The ACHs must create and exe cute a consumer engagement plan as part of the ACH Project Plan. The consumer engagement plan will detail the multiple levels of the decision -making process to ensure ACHs are accurately assessing local health needs , priorities and inequities. As part of the ACH Project Plan ACHs must provide documentation of at least two public meetings held for purposes of gathering public comment and must also provide details for how their submitted project plan incorporates feedback from the public comment process. To ensure broad participation in the ACH and prevent one group of ACH partners from dominating decision -making, at least 50 percent of the primar y decision -making body must be non-clinic, non -payer participants. In addition to balanced sectoral representation, where multiple counties exist within an ACH, a concerted effort to include a person from each county on the primary decision -making body must be demonstrated. 24. Tribal Engagement and Collaboration Protocol . The state, with tribes, IHS facil ities, and urban Indian Health Programs, must develop and submit to CMS for approval a Tribal Engagement and Collaboration Protocol (Attachment H) no later than 60 calendar days after demonstration approval date. Once approved by CMS, this document will be incorporated as Attachment H of these STCs, and once incorporated may be altered only with CMS approval, and only to the extent consistent with the approved expenditure and waiver authorities and STCs. ACHs will be required to adopt either the State's Model ACH Tribal Collaboration and Communication Policy or a policy agreed upon in writing by the ACH and every tribe and Indian Health Care Provider (IHCP) in the ACH's region. The model policy establishes minimum requirements and protocols for the ACH to collaborate and communicate in a timely and equitable manner with tribes and Indian healthcare providers. In addition to adopting the Model ACH Tribal Collaboration and Communication Policy, ACH governing boards must make reasonable efforts to receive o ngoing training on the Indian health care delivery system with a focus on their local tribes and IHCPs and on the needs of both tribal and urban Indian populations. Further specifications for engagement and collaboration in Medicaid transformation between (a) tribes, IHS facilities, and urban Indian health programs and (b) ACHs and the state, will be described by the Tribal Engagement and Collaboration Protocol (Attac hment H). At a minimum, the Tribal Engagement and Collaboration Protocol must include the elements listed below: a. Outline the objectives that the state and tribes seek to achieve tribal specific interests in Medicaid transformation; and b. Specify the process , timeline and funding mechanics for any tribal specific activities that will be included as part of this demonstration, including the potential for financing the tribal specific activities through alternative sources of non -federal share. 25. Tribal Coordin ating Entity. The federal government and the State have federal trust responsibility to support tribal sovereignty and to provide health care to tribal members and Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 17 their descendants. Part of this trust responsibility involves assessing this demonstration f or impacts, including unintended consequences, on affected IHCPs and AI/AN. The state will facilitate a tribal coordinating entity (TCE) controlled by tribes and Urban Indian Organizations (as defined in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(29)) for purposes of facilitating appropriate engagement and coordination with tribal governments and communicating advice and feedback from Indian Health Care Providers (IHCPs) (as defined in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 438.14(a)) to the state on matters related to this demonstration. The state will work with the TCE: a. To provide opportunity to review programs and projects implemented through delivery system reform efforts within this demonstration; b. For the TCE to coordinate with affected tribes and IHCPs to provide an assessment of potential impacts as a result of delivery system reform activities within this demonstration on affected IHCPs and AI/AN populations and report these assessments to CMS, the ACHs, and the State; c. To coordinate with tribes and IHCPs to establish a cross -walk of statewide common performance measures to the GPRA measures used by tribes and IHCPs; and d. To support other tribal -specific projects implemented through this demonstration to the extent appropriate. 26. Tribal Specific Projects. Consistent with the government -to-government rela tionship between the tribes and the State, tribes, IHCPs, or consortia of tribes and IHCPs can apply directly through the State to receive funding for eligible tribal specific projects. Tribes and IHCPs will not be required to apply for tribal specific pr ojects through ACHs or the TCE, and the TCE and ACHs will not participate in the approval process for tribal specific projects. a. Indian Health Care Provider Health Information Technology Infrastructure. The state will work with the tribes and IHCPs to de velop a tribal specific project, subject to CMS approval, that will enhance capacity to: (i) effectively coordinate care between IHCPs and non -IHCPs, (ii) support interoperability with relevant State data systems, and (iii) support tribal patient -centered medical home models (e.g., IHS IPC, NCQA PCMH, etc.). b. Other Tribal Specific Projects. The state will work with tribes on tribal specific projects, subject to CMS approval, that align with the objectives of this demonstration, including requirements that projects reflect a priority for financial sustainability beyond the demonstration period. c. The Tribal Engagement and Collaboration Protocol (Attachment H) will provide further specifications for process, timeline and funding mechanics for any tribal specific projects that will be included as part of this demon stration. To the extent applicable, the Tribal Engagement and Collaboration Protocol must align with project requirements set forth in these STCs. 27. Financial Executor. In order to assure consistent management of and accounting for the distribution of DSRIP funds across ACHs, the state shall select through a procurement process a single Financial Executor. The Financial Executor will be responsible for Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 18 administering the funding distribution plan for the DSRIP that specifies in advance the methodology fo r distributing funding to providers partnering with the ACHs . The funding methodology will be described in the DSRIP Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D ) and submitted to CMS for approval. a. The Financial Executor will perform the followin g responsibilities: (a) provide accounting and banking management support for DSRIP incentive dollars; (b) distribute earned funds in a timely manner to participating providers in accordance with the state approved funding distribution plans ; (c) submit sc heduled reports to the state on the actual distribution of transformation project payments, fund balances and reconciliations; and (d) develop and distribute budget forms to participating providers for receipt of incentive funds (see Attachment G).1 Financial Executor performance will be subject to audit by the state. b. The distribution of funds must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the following federal fraud and abuse authorities: the anti - kickback stat ute (sections 1128B(b)(1) and (2) of the Act); the physician self -referral prohibition (section 1903(s) of the Act); the gainsharing civil monetary penalty (CMP) provisions (sections 1128A(b)(1) and (2) of the Act); and the beneficiary inducement CMP (sect ion 1128A(a)(5) of the Act). State approval of an ACH funding distribution plan does not alter the responsibility of ACHs to comply with all federal fraud and abuse requirements of the Medicaid program. 28. Attribution Based On Residence . The state will use defined regional service areas , which do not have overlapping boundaries, to determine populations for each ACH . Determination will be made based on beneficiary residence. There is only one ACH per regional service area, as described in the DSRIP Program F unding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D). 29. ACH Provider Agreements under DSRIP In addition to the requirements specified in the DSRIP Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D), ACHs must establish a partnership agreement between the providers participating in projects. 30. Project Objectives . ACHs will design and implement projects that further the objectives, which are elaborated further in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C). a. Health Systems and Community Capacity. Creating appropriate health systems capacity in order to expand effective community based -treatment models; reduce unnecessary use of intensive services and settings without impairing health outcomes ; and support prevention through screening, early intervention, and population health management initiatives. b. Financial Sustainability through Participation in Value -based Payment . Medicaid transformation efforts must contribute meaningfully to moving the state forward on value -based payment (VBP). Paying for value across the continuum of Medicaid services 1 For a comprehensive description of the Financial Executor role, see Attachment G. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 19 is necessary to assure the sustainability of the transformation projects undertaken through the Medicaid Transformation Demonstration. For this reaso n, ACHs will be required to design project plan activities that enable the success of Alternative Payment Models required by the state for Medicaid managed care plans (see Table 1 under STC 41 for the APM goals per DY). c. Bi-directional Integration of ph ysical and behavioral health. Requiring comprehensive integration of physical and behavioral health services through new care models , consistent with the state's path to fully integrated managed care by January 2020 . Projects may include: co-location of providers ; adoption of evidence -based standards of integrated care; and use of team -based approaches to care delivery that address physical, behavioral and social barriers to improved outcomes for all populations with behavioral health needs . Along wit h directly promoting integration of care , the projects will promote infrastructure changes by supporting the IT capacity and protocols needed for integration of care , offering training to providers on how to adopt the required changes; and creating integra ted care delivery protocols and models. The state will provide i ncreased incentives for regions that commit to and implement fully integrated managed care prior to January 2020. d. Community -based Whole -person Care . Use or enhance existing services in the community to promote care coordination across the continuum of health for beneficiaries, ensuring those with complex health needs are connected to the interventions and services needed to improve and manage their health. In addition, d evelop linkages betwee n providers of care coordination by utilizing a common platform t hat improve s communication, standardiz es use of evidence -based care coordination protocols across providers, and to promote accountable tracking of those beneficiaries being served. Projects will be designed and implemented to promote evidence -based practices that meet the needs of a region's identi fied high -risk, high -needs target populations. e. Improve Health Equity and Reduce Health Disparities. Implement prevention and health promotion strategies for targeted populations to address health disparities and achieve health equity . Projects will requir e the full engagement of traditional and non -traditional providers, and project areas may include: chronic disease prevention, maternal and child health, and access to oral health services, and the promotion of strategies to address the opioid epidemic. 31. Project Milestones. Progress towards achieving the goals specified above will be assessed based on achievement of specific milestones and measured by specific metrics that are further defined in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C). These milestones a re to be developed by the state in consultation with stakeholders and members of the public and approved by CMS. Generally, progress milestones will be organized into the following categories : a. Project planning progress milestones . This includes plans for investments in technology, tools, stakeholder engagement, and human resources that will allow ACHs to build capacity to serve target populations and pursue ACH project goals in accordance with Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 20 community -based priorities. Performance will be measured b y a common set of process milestones that include project development plans, consistency with statewide goals and metrics, and demonstrated engagement from relevant providers who commit to participate in project plan activities. b. Project implementation pr ogress milestones . This includes milestones that demonstrate progress towards process -based improvements, as established by the state, in the implementation of projects consistent with the demonstration's objectives of building health and community system s capacity; promoting care delivery redesign through bi - directional integration of care and care coordination; and fostering health equity through prevention and health promotion. Examples of progress milestones include: identify number of providers and pr actices implementing evidence -based and promising practices for integration; complete a plan for regional implementation of fully integrated managed care. In addition, performance will be monitored by project -level and system -wide outcome measures consiste nt with the objectives of the demonstration outlined in STC 30 and specific project area . c. Scale and sustain progress milestones. This includes milestones that demonstrate project implementation progress, as established by the state, related to efforts to scale and sustain project activities in pursuit of the demonstration objectives. Performance will be monitored by project -level and system -wide outcome measures consistent with the objectives of the demonstration outlined in STC 30 and specific project area s. The state will identify a sub -set of project -level and system -wide measures that will transition to pay for performance. The identification of measures that transition and the timing of transition to pay for performance will be outlined in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C) . 32. ACH Performance Indicators and Outcome Measures. The state will choose performance indicators and outcome measures that are connected to t he achievement of the goals identified in STC 30 and in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C). The DSRIP performance indicators and outcome measures will comprise the list of reporting measures that the state will be required to report under each of the DSRIP projects . The state and CMS will accept GPRA measures in lieu of comparable statewide common performance measures when such substitution will reduce duplicative reporting and avoid excessive administrative burdens on tribes and IHCPs. 33. MCO Rol e in DSRIP . Managed care organizations are expected to serve in leadership or supportive capacity in every ACH. This ensures that delivery system reform efforts funded under this demonstration are coordinated from the beginning across all necessary sectors - those providing payment, those delivering services and those providing critical, community - based supports. Managed care organizations have the following roles and responsibilities under this demonstration: Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 21 a. Continue to meet all contractual requirements for the provision and coordination of Medicaid state plan services, including utilization management, care coordination and any new requirements consistent with the Medicaid transformation demonstration . b. Participate in the design and implementation of del ivery system reform projects c. Actively provide leadership in every Accountable Community of Health where a MCO is providing services, whether through participation in governance or other supportive capacity. d. Collaborate with provider networks to implement value -based payment models, aligned to the HCP -LAN framework and report on the status of those arrangements to the state when requested, e. Ensure business approaches evolve to sustain new models of care delivery and population health management, during and beyond the five -year demonstration. MCOs are expected to participate in delivery system reform efforts as a matter of business interest and contractual obligation to the state, and for this reason, do not receive incentive payments for participation in ACH -led transformation projects, with o ne exception. A portion of delivery system reform incentives is uniquely set aside to reward managed care plan attainment of value -based payment models, consistent with STC 42(a) . The incentive amounts are further defined in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (At tachment C), the DSRIP Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D) and the Roadmap (Attachment F). 34. DSRIP Planning Protocol. The state must develop and submit to CMS for approval a DSRIP Planning Protocol no later than 60 calendar days after th e demonstration approval date. CMS has 60 calendar days to review and approve the protocol. Once approved by CMS, this document will be incorporated as Attachment C of these STCs, and once incorporated may be altered only with CMS approval, and only to t he extent consistent with the approved expenditure authorities and STCs. Changes to the protocol will apply prospectively unless otherwise indicated in the protocols. The DSRIP Planning Protocol must: a. Outline the global context, goals and outcomes that the state seeks to achieve through the combined implementation of individual projects by ACHs; b. Detail the requirements of the ACH Project Plans, consistent with STC 36, which must include timelines and deadlines for the meeting of metrics associated with the projects and activities undertaken to ensure timely performance; c. Specify a set of outcome measures that must be reported at the ACH level , regardless of the specif ic projects that they choose to undertake; d. Include required baseline and ongoing data reporting, assessment protocols, and monitoring/evaluation criteria aligned with the evaluation design and the monitoring requirements in section X I of the STCs. e. Include a process that allows for potential ACH Project Plan modification (including possible reclamation, or redistribution, pending state and CMS approval) and an identification of circumstances under which a plan modification may be considered, which shall sti pulate that the state or CMS may require that a plan be modified if it becomes evident that the previous targeting/estimation is no longer appropriate or that targets were greatly exceeded or underachieved. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 22 f. When developing the DSRIP Planning Protocol, the state should consider ways to structure the different projects and demonstrate that it will facilitate the collection, dissemination, and comparison of valid quantitative data to support the Evaluation Design required in section X II of the STCs. Participat ing ACHs will use the same metrics for similar projects to enhance evaluation and learning experience between ACHs . 35. DSRIP Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol . The state must develop a DSRIP Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol to be submitted to CMS for approval no later than 60 days after the demonstration approval date . CMS has 60 days to review and approve the protocol. Once approved by CMS, this document will be incorporated as Attachment D of these STCs and, once incorporated, may be altered o nly with CMS approval, and only to the extent consistent with the approved expenditure authorities and STCs. Changes to the protocol will apply prospectively, unless otherwise indicated in the protocols. DSRIP payments for each ACH partnering provider are contingent on the partnering providers fully meeting project metrics defined in the approved ACH Project Plan. In order for providers to receive incentive funding relating to any metric, the ACH must submit all required reporting, as outlined in the DSR IP Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D). In addition, the DSRIP Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol must: a. Describe and specify the role and function of a standardized ACH report to be submitted to the state on a quarterly basis that outlines a status update on the ACH Project Plan, as well as any data or reports that ACHs may be required to submit baseline information and substantiate progress. The state must develop a standardized reporting form for the ACHs to document their progress . b. Specify an allocation formula across ACHs based on covered Medicaid lives per ACH , scale of project, type of project , level of impact on beneficiaries, number of providers, and other factors ; c. Specify parameters for an incentive payment fo rmula to determine DSRIP incentive payments commensurate with the value , impact, and level of effort required , to be included in the ACH budget plan . d. Specify that an ACH failure to fully meet a performance metric or non -compliance under its ACH Project Pla n within the time frame specified will result in a forfeiture of the associated incentive payment. e. Include a description of the state's process to develop an evaluation plan for DSRIP as a component of the draft evaluation design as required by STC 107. f. Ensure that p ayment of funds allocated in an ACH Project Plan to outcome measures will be contingent on the ACH certifying and reporting DSRIP performance indicators to the state via the independent assessor and on the ACH meeting a target level of imp rovement in the DSRIP performance indicator relative to baseline. A portion of the funds allocated in DSRIP Year 3 and DSRIP Year 4, and a majority of funds allocated in DSRIP Year 5, must be contingent on meeting a target level of improvement . ACH partnering providers may not receive credit for metrics achieved prior to approval of their ACH Project Plans. g. Require that, for DSRIP years 4 and 5, all incentive dollars are contingent upon the state achieving fully integrated managed care by January 2 020 for physical and behavioral health services . The state will report on progress toward this outcome on its annual report. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 23 h. Include criteria and methodology for project valuation, including a range of available incentive funding per project. i. Include pre -project plan milestones for capacity -building incentive payments . 36. ACH Project Plans. ACHs must develop a Project Plan that is consistent with the transformation objectives of this demonstration and describes the steps the ACH will take to achieve those objectives . The plan must be based on the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C), and further developed by the ACH to be directly responsive to the needs and characteristics of the communities that it serves. In developing its ACH Project Plan, an ACH mu st solicit and incorporate community and consumer input to ensure it reflects the specific needs of its region. ACH Project Plans must be approved by the state and may be subject to additional review by CMS. In accordance with the schedule outlined in th ese STCs and the process described further in the DSRIP Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D), the state and the assigned independent assessor must review and approve ACH P roject Plans in order to authorize DSRIP funding for DY1 and DY 2 and must conduct ongoing reviews of ACH P roject Plans as part of a mid -point assessment in order to authorize DSRIP funding for DY 3 -5. The state is responsible for conducting these reviews for comp liance with approved protocols. The independent assessor recommendations should be considered final and not subject to CMS review. The DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C) will provide a structured format for ACHs to use in developing their ACH Project Plan submission for approval. At a minimum, it will include the elements listed below. a. Each ACH Project Plan must identify the target populations, projects, and specific milestones for the proposed project, which must be chosen from the options described in the approved DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C). b. Goals of the ACH Project Plan should be aligned with each of the objectives as described in STC 30 of this section. c. Milestones should be organized as described above in STC s 31-32 of this section reflecting the overall goals of the demonstration and subparts for each goal as necessary. d. The ACH Project Plan must describe the need s being addressed and the proposed period of performance , beginning after January 9, 2017. e.

The ACH Project Plan must include a description of the processes used by the ACH to engage and reach out to stakeholders including a plan for ongoing engagement with the public, based on the process described in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C). g. ACHs must demonstrat e how the project s support sustainable delivery system transformation for the target population s. The projects must implement new, or significantly enhance existing , health care initiatives . h. For each stated goal or objective of a project, there must be an associated outcome metric that must be reported in all years. The initial ACH Project Plan must include baseline data on all applicable quality improvement and outcome measures. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 24 i. ACH Projec t Plans must include an ACH Budget Plan , which specifies the allocation of funding proposed for each metric and milestone . ACHs may not receive credit for metrics achieved prior to approval of their ACH Project Plans. 37. Monitoring. The independent assessor and the state will be actively involved in ongoing monitoring of ACH projects, including but not limited to the following activities. a. Review of milestone achievement. At least two times per year, ACHs seeking payment for providers under the DSRIP program shall submit reports to the state demonstrating progress on each of their projects as measured by project -specific milestones and metrics achieved during the reporting period. The reports shall be submitted using the standardized reporting form ap proved by the state. Based on the reports, the Independent Assessor will calculate the incentive payments for the progress achieved according to the approved ACH P roject Plan. The Independent Assessor's determination shall be considered final. The ACH shall have available for review by the state , upon request, all supporting data and back -up documentation. These reports will serve as the basis for authorizing incentive payments to providers for achievement of DSRIP milestones. b. Quarterly DSRIP Operational P rotocol Report .

The state will pursue improved coordination and improved integration between Behavioral Health, Physical Health, Home and Community Based Providers and community -level collaborators for Improved Care Coordination (as applicable) through the adoption of provider -level Health IT infrastructure and software \u2014to facilitate and Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 26 improve integration and coordination to support the programmatic objectives of the demonstration. The state will provide a Health IT strategy by April 1, 2017 that details existing HIT capabilities which support this goal, and develop a mutually -agreed upon timeframe between CMS and the state for any identified enhancements. h. The State shall ensure a comprehensive Health IT -enabled quality measurement strategy that support the programmatic objectives of the demonstration. The state will provide a Health IT strategy by April 1, 2017 that details existing HIT capabilities which support this goal, and de velop a mutually -agreed upon timeframe between CMS and the state for any identified enhancements 40. Value -based Roadmap . Recognizing that the DSRIP investments must be sustained through new payment methods, and that managed care plans will play a critical ro le in the long -term sustainability of this effort , the state must take steps to plan for and reflect the impact of DSRIP in managed care business approaches. Within 60 days of STC approval , and subsequently, by October 1st of each demonstration year, the state must submit an updated Value -based Roadmap (\"Roadmap\") which establishes targets for VBP attainment, related incentives under DSRIP for MCOs and ACHs, a description of how managed care is transforming to support new models of care , and Medicaid MCO contract changes being made to align with the Medicaid Transformation Demonstration project. The state will also address the payment mechanism, including a n implementation plan detailing when the state will submit any required documentation in order to meet payment timelines. The Roadmap will be updated annually to ensure that best practices and lessons learned can be incorporated into the state's overall v ision of delivery system reform. This Roadmap will describe what the state and its stakeholders consider the payment reforms required for a high quality and a financially sustainable Medicaid delivery system. Recognizing the need to formulate this plan to align with the stages of DSRIP, this will be a multi -year plan. It will necessarily be flexible to properly reflect future DSRIP progress and accomplishments. Progress on the Roadmap will also be included in the quarterly DSRIP report. The Roadmap shall address the following: a. Targets for regional ACH and statewide MCO att ainment of VBP Goals, per STC 4 1. b. Approaches that MCOs and the state will use with providers to encourage practices consistent with DSRIP objectives and metrics and the VBP targets. c. Use of DSRIP measures and objectives by the state in their contracting strategy approach for managed care plans. d. MCO contract amendments to include any necessary reporting of DSRIP objectives and measures. e. Alternative payment models deployed between MCOs and providers to reward performance consistent with DSRIP objectives and measures. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 27 f. Measurement of MCOs based on utilization and quality in a manner consistent with DSRIP objectives and measures, including incorporating DSRIP objectives into their annual util ization and quality management plans. g. Evolution toward further alignment with MACRA and other advanced APMs. 41. Models of Value -Based Payment . The state has established VBP goals consistent with the HCP -LAN Alternative Payment Models (APM) Framewor k2 and the Quality Payment Program (QPP) under MACRA, further defined in Table 1 . The goals are in alignment with broader U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) delivery system reform goals. Under DSRIP, regional and managed care plan-level incentives will be established. Specifically, the state agrees to VBP target thresholds at or above which incentive payments can be earned by partnering ACH providers and MCOs. See Table 1 . The state will ensure both improvement from baseline and attainm ent are taken into consideration in the development of the VBP incentive program. The thresholds will be further defined in the DSRIP planning protocol (Attachment C) and Roadmap (Attachment F). Table 1 : Percentage of Provider Payments in HCP -LAN APM Categories at or above which Incentives are Provided to Providers and MCO s under DSRIP VBP Goals 30% in Advanced APMs TBD * TBD * TBD * a. Starting in DY 1, VBP incentives will be based on the percentage of provider payments in categories 2C -4B of the HCP -LAN Framework, with progressive targets throughout the demonstration. b. By DY 2, the state will implement in its Roadmap (Attachment F) additional criteria that incentivize s ACH and MCO attainment of upside/downside provider risk arrangements (HCP -LAN categories 3 A-4B). The incentive structure will be further de fined in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C) and Roadmap (Attachment F). c. By DY 3, the additional targets (*) outlined in Table 1 above to be defined in the Roadmap, will incentivize implementation of MACRA Advanced APMs in provider contracts. Available at https://hcp -lan.org/groups/apm -fpt/apm -framework/ Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 28 d. Beginning in DY 4, to be eligible for any region or plan -level incentives under the Roadmap, at least 30 percent of all provider payments must meet or exceed category 3 A of the HCP -LAN framework with additional incentives provided for meeting categories 3B through 4B with the following elements: i. Shared upside and downside risk (where entities will be required to bear more than a nominal risk for monetary losses) ii. Payment tied to provider improvement and attainment of quality performance metrics from the Washington Statewide Common Measure set, using HCA Quality Improvement Model or similar tool. iii. Care transformation requirements consistent with ACH -led DSRIP activities , including appropriate recognition of state level best practice recommendations , such as the Bree Collaborative.3 iv. Use of certified EHR technology and health information exchange services in support of VBP methods . e. The state will submit annually, by no later than October 1 of each demonstration year, an updated Roadmap ( Attachment F) to meet the specifications of this section and to ensure the roadmap aligns with evolving MACRA and other state -based payment models. All thresholds for VBP incentive payments exclude payments for services provided by or through Indian health care provide rs. f. The Roadmap will describe how the state will validate and categorize value -based arrangements using a third -party validator. g. Contractual obligations f or MCO s are integral to this demonstration, including requirements that MCOs attain defined levels of value -based payment with their provider networks while achieving quality improvement across a core set of quality metrics to be included in the managed care cont racts . A premium withhold has been established to incentivize improved quality performance, and that withhold will increase over the five years of the demonstration. These value -based purchasing targets and quality measures align to the DSRIP program stru cture and will change to adapt to future requirements and protocols developed throughout this demonstration. 42. Challenge and Reinvestment Pools . Under DSRIP, the state will set aside no more than 15 percent of annually available DSRIP funds to reward MCO a nd ACH partnering providers for provider -level attainment of V BP targets stipulated in STC 4 1. Two pools are created to facilitate incentive payments: a. Challenge Pool. An annual budget, not to exceed 5 percent of total available DSRIP funding , is established as incentive payments for MCO attainment and progression toward VBP targets. In addition , if unearned incentives from the MCO premium 3 Bree Collaborative is a public -private consortium established in 2011 by the Washington State Legislature \"to provide a mechan ism through which public and private health care stakeholders can work together to improve quality, health outcomes, and cost effectiveness of care in Washington State.\" Annually, the Bree identifies up to three areas where there is substantial variation i n practice patterns and/or high utilization trends that do not produce better care outcomes. Recommendations from the Bree are sent to the Health Care Authority to guide state purchasing for programs such as Medicaid and Public Employees Benefits Board (PE BB). Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 29 withholds and DSRIP funding for MCO VBP attainment (see STC 41(g)) remain after the annual performance pe riod, any remaining funds will be used for incentive payments for MCOs meeting exceptional standard s of quality and patient experience, based on a subset of measures to be defined in the DSRIP planning protocol (Attachment C) and Roadmap (Attachment F). b. Reinvestment Pool . An annual budget, not to exceed 10 percent of total available DSRIP funding , is established to reward ACH partnering providers (regional) attainment and progression toward VBP targets. To the extent unearned incentives remain after the annual performance period from ACH Projects or VBP unearned incentives , any remaining funds will be used for incentive payments to the ACH for performance against a core subset of measures to be defined the DSRIP planning protocol (Attachment C) and Roadmap (Attachment F) . These funds must be spent on demonstration objectives. 43. Federal Financial Participation (FFP) for DSRIP. The state may clai m, as authorized expenditures under the demonstration, up to $1.125 billion total computable for five years, performance -based incentive payments to ACH partnering provider s or MCOs that support change in how care is provided to Medicaid beneficiaries thro ugh payment and delivery system reforms. DSRIP payments are an incentive for successfully meeting associated metrics and outcomes rather than payment of claims for the provision of medical care. For this reason, DSRIP payments shall not be considered pat ient care revenue for purposes of offsetting allowable uncompensated care costs under the DSRIP Funding and Mechanics Protocol under demonstration authority. a. DSRIP payments are not direct reimbursement for expenditures or payments for services. DSRIP pay ments are intended to support and reward ACHs and their partnering providers for delivery system transformation efforts and are eligible for federal matching at the administrative rate and not as medical assistance . DSRIP payments are not considered patie nt care revenue, and shall not be offset against disproportionate share, MCO expenditures or other Medicaid expenditures that are related to the cost of patient care (including stepped down costs of administration of such care) or other allowable administr ative expenses . b. The state may not claim FFP for DSRIP until after CMS has approved the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C) and DSRIP Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D). Once approved, the state may receive FFP for expenditures beginning January 1, 2017. c. The state may not claim FFP for DSRIP payments in each year for DSRIP Year 1 through DSRIP Year 5 until the state has concluded whether or not the ACHs , MCOs , and partnering providers have met the performance indicated for each payment. The state must inform CMS of the funding of all DSRIP payments through a quarterly payment report to be submitted to CMS within 60 days after the end of each quarter. ACH and MCO reports must contain sufficient data and documentation to allow the state a nd CMS to determine if the ACH , MCO , and partnering providers have fully met the specified metric or VBP goal , and ACHs and MCOs must have available for review by the state or Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 30 CMS, upon request, all supporting data and back -up documentation. FFP will be available only for payments related to approved DSRIP activities . d. The non -federal share of payments to ACHs , MCOs , and partnering providers may be funded by state general revenue funds, intergovernmental transfers, designated state health programs , or any other allowable source of non -federal share consistent with federal law. The funding will flow to the participating providers according to the methodology specified in the DSRIP Funding and Mechanics Protocol. e. The state must inform CMS of the funding of all DSRIP payments to providers through quarterly reports submitted to CMS within 60 calendar days after the end of each quarter, as required in STC 74. This report must identify the funding sources associated with each type of payment received by each p rovider. 44. DSRIP Funding. The amount of demonstration funds available for the DSRIP Program is shown in Table 2 below. Table 2 : DSRIP Funding and At -Risk Percentages Funding At Risk for VBP and Quality Improvement Goals under DSRIP . A share of total DSRIP funding will be at risk if the state fails to demonstrate progress toward meeting the demonstration's VBP goals as outlined in STC 41, Table 1 and quality measures to be defined in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C) . The percentage at risk will gradually increase from 0 percent in DY 1 -2 to 5 percent in DY 3 to 10 percent in DY 4 and 20 percent in DY 5. The at -risk outcome measures will be developed by the state and included in the DSRIP Planning Protocol for approval by C MS. They must be statewide and measure progress toward the state's Medicaid transformation goals. 45. Life Cycle of the Five-Year DSRIP Program . Synopsis of anticipated activities planned for this demonstration and the corresponding flow of funds. a. Demonstration Year 1 - Planning and Design: In the first year of the demonstration, the state will undertake implementation activities, including the fo llowing: i. Submit the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C) and DSRIP Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D) . Working closely with stakeholders N/A $11,795,000 $21,730,000 $38,000,000 Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 31 CMS, the state will submit the two required protocols in accordance with STCs 34, 35 and 41 by March 9, 2017. ii. Develop and oversee certification process for ACHs . The state will develop a process for ACHs to be certified to lead Medicaid transformation projects . Certification will require, among other things, that the ACHs: (1) describe their governance plan and process to ensure compliance with principles outlined in the STCs ; and (2) describe the stakeholder , tribal engagement, and public process es that will be used to solicit community input . iii. Develop and oversee project pla n application process for ACHs . The state will develop a project plan application in accordance with the approved DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C) and the DSRIP Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D) . The ACHs must complete the project plan applications within the timeframe determined by the state . iv. Review and approve project plans submitted by ACHs. Once the ACHs submit project plans and they are reviewed by the independent assessor, the state will approve applications in accor dance with the DSRIP Funding and Mechanics Protoco l (Attachment D) . v. Establish Statewide Resources To Support ACHs. The demonstration will also support ACHs with statewide resources. Specifically, ACHs will be provided with technical assistance and the opportunity to participate in learning collaboratives that facilitate the sharing of best practices and lessons learned across ACHs. The statewide resources will be developed to coordinate with other ongoing and emerging delivery system reform efforts in the state. b. Demonstration Years 2 -4: Implementation, Performance Measurement and Outcomes : i. In these years, the state will move the distribution of DSRIP payments to more outcome -based measures, making them available over time only to those ACH partnerin g providers that meet performance metrics. c. Demonstration Year 5: Performance Measurement and Sustainability : i. DSRIP investments that meet the demonstrations objectives will continue through value -based payment objectives, led by MCOs and supported by ACHs and the provider community. VI. LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS 46. Medicaid Alternative Care (). Currently eligible Medicaid beneficiaries who are eligible for, but have chosen not to receive, Medicaid -funded LTSS will be eligible for a new Medicaid Alternative Care (MAC) benefit package. These individuals do not constitute a Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 32 new MEG . The d emonstratio n allows them a benefits choice that will enable them to remain in their homes for a longer period. Eligibility criteria include: a. Age 55 or older; b. Eligible for Categorically Needy (CN) or Alternative Benefit Plan (ABP) services; and c. Eligible to receive the LTSS Medicaid benefit currently available under optional State Plan 1915(k) or HCBS authorities \u2014but have chosen to receive services under MAC instead. The state will not apply post -eligibility treatment of income to the MAC populati on because they will not be receiving LTSS. 47. MAC Benefits Package. Administered by the state, or its delegate, the MAC benefit package will be offered through a person -centered planning process where services from one or more of the service categories in STC 4 7(a) through (d) are identified in a plan of care \u2014 up to a specified limit as defined in state rule \u2014to individuals who are age 55 or older and eligible for CN or ABP coverage, \u2014and not currently receiving Medicaid -funded LTSS. Beneficiaries receiving MA C would also be eligible for Medicaid medical services but would not be eligible for other Medicaid optional state plan or 1915(c) LTSS benefits at the same time. MAC is an alternate benefit package that individuals may choose so they can remain in their home with care provided through their unpaid family caregiver. If an eligible individual chooses to access state plan or 1915(c) LTSS benefits, they would no longer be eligible to receive MAC services. With the exception of services authorized under presu mptive eligibility, services offered under this benefit will not duplicate services covered under the state plan, Medicare or private insurance, or through other federal or state programs. The following are the MAC benefits with corresponding descriptions: a. Caregiver Assistance Services. Services that take the place of those typically performed by the unpaid caregiver in support of unmet needs the care receiver has for assistance with activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL. Services include: i. Housework/errands/yardwork ii. Transportation (only in conjunction with the delivery of a service) iii. Respite (in home and out of home) iv. Home delivered meals v. Home safety evaluation vi. Minor home modifications and repairs required to maintain a safe environment b. Training and Education . Services and supports to assist caregivers with gaining skills and knowledge to implement services and supports needed by the care receiver to remain at home or skills needed by the caregiver to remain in their role. Services include: i. Support groups ii. Group training iii. Caregiver coping/skill building training iv. Consultation on supported decision making v. Caregiver training to meet the needs of the care receiver vi. Financial or legal consultation Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 33 vii. Health and wellness consultation c. Specialized Medica l Equipment & Supplies. Goods and supplies needed by the care receiver. Goods and supplies include: i. Supplies ii.

Clinical or therapeutic services that assist the care receiver to remain in their home or the caregiver to remain in their caregiving role and provide high quality care. Services are provided for the purpose of preven ting further deterioration, improving or maintaining current level of functioning. Supports and services categorized here include those typically performed or provided by people with specialized skill, certification or licenses. Services include: i. Adult day health ii. RDAD and EB exercise programs iii. Health Promotion and Wellness Services iv. Counseling 48. Tailored Supports for Older Adults (TSOA). The demonstration also establish es a new eligibility expansion category for individuals who are \"at risk\" of becoming eligi ble for Medicaid in order to access LTSS. This \"At Risk\" or \"Tailored Supports for Older Adults\" (TSOA) eligibility group is comprised of individuals that could receive Medicaid State Plan benefits under 42 CFR \u00a7435.236 and \u00a7435.217 . Under the Demonstrat ion, these individuals may access a new LTSS benefit package that will preserve their quality of life while delaying their need (and the financial impoverishment) for full Medicaid benefits. The individuals must: a. Be age 55 or older; b. Be a U.S. citizen or in eligible immigration status ; c. Not be currently eligible for CN or ABP Medicaid; d. Meet functional eligibility criteria for NFLOC as determined through an eligibility assessment; and e. Have income up to 300% of the SSI Federal Benefit Rate. i. To determine eligibility for TSOA services, the state will consider the income of the applicant, not their spouse/dependents, when determining if gross income is at or below the 300% SSI Federal Benefit Rate limit; and ii. To determine income, Washington will use the Social Security Income (SSI) -related income methodologies currently in use for determining eligibility for Medicaid LTSS. No post -eligibility treatment of income will apply and eligibility will be determined using only the applicant's income. Like the MAC population, Washington will not apply post -eligibility treatment of income to the TSOA populations. f. Resource Limits -- Have countable resources below $53,100 for a single applicant and below $53,100 plus the state spousal resource standard for a ma rried couple. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 34 i. To determine resources, the State will us the Social Security Income (SSI) -related resource rules currently in use for determining eligibility for Medicaid LTSS with the following exceptions: 1. Transfer of asset penalties do not apply 2. Excess ho me equity provisions do not apply 49. TSOA Benefits Package. Administered by the state or its delegate, the TSOA benefit package will be offered to individuals determined to be \"at risk\" for Medicaid (as described in the previous section ) will be offered thro ugh a person -centered planning process where services from one or more of the service categories in STC 4 7(a) through (d) are identified in a plan of care up to a specified limit as defined in state rule. Individuals receiving TSOA services will not be el igible for CN or ABP Medicaid -funded medical services or other Medicaid -funded optional State Plan or 1915(c) LTSS benefits. Individuals who later become CN or ABP Medicaid -eligible will no longer be eligible for TSOA services. Individuals receiving MN Me dicaid -funded medical services or are eligible for a Medicare Savings Program (MSP) are eligible for TSOA services. The following are the TSOA benefits with corresponding descriptions: a. TSOA Benefits. The TSOA benefits include all the same benefits outlin ed in STC 4 7(a) through (d). b. Personal Assistance Services. Supports involving the labor of another person to help demonstration participants carry out everyday activities they are unable to perform independently.

Transportation (only in conjunction with the delivery of a service authorized for this specific program ) v. Home delivered meals vi. Home safety evaluation vii. Home modifications and repairs (associated with the home modifications) required to maintain a safe environment 50. Person Centered Planning. The state agrees to use person -centered planning processes to identify participants', applicants' and unpaid caregivers' LTSS needs, the resources available to meet those needs, and to provide access to additional service and support options as needed. The state assures that it will use person centered planning tools that will be in compliance with th e characteristics set forth in 42 CFR 441.301(c)(1) -(3). 51. Self-Directed Supports. The state agrees to provide resources to support participants or their proxies (e.g., a surrogate, parent or legal guardian/representative) in directing their own care when that care is provided by an individual provider . This support assures, but is not limited to, participants' compliance with laws pertaining to employer responsibilities and provision for back -up attendants as needs arise. The state agrees to assure that ba ckground checks on employees and their results are available to participants. State policies and Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 35 guidelines will include, but not be limited to: criteria for who is eligible to self -direct, a fiscal agent/intermediary, and training materials to assist part icipants with learning their roles and responsibilities as an 'employer' and to ensure that services are consistent with care plan needs and allocations. a. Program enrollees will have full informed choice on the requirements and options to: self-direct serv ices; have a qualified designated representative direct services on their behalf, or select traditional agency -based service delivery. State and provider staff will receive training on these options. 52. Conflict of Interest. The state agrees that the entity responsible for assisting the individual with development of the person -centered service plan may not be an LTSS service provider, unless that service planning entity is the only qualified and willing entity available to conduct the service. If a service planning entity is the only willing and qualified entity to conduct the service , the state must establish firewalls between the service provision and planning functions to ensure conflict of interest protections. The state assures that conflict of intere st protections will be in compliance with the characteristics set forth in 42 CFR 441.301(c)(1)(v)(vi). The state also assures that the independent evaluation and determination of eligibility for LTSS is performed by an agent that is independent and qualif ied as defined in 42 CFR 441.730. 53. Home and Community -Based Setting Requirements. The state will assure compliance with the characteristics of home and community -based settings in accordance with 42 CFR 441.301(c)(4), for those services that could be auth orized under sections 1915(c) and 1915(i). 54. Quality Measures. The Quality Plan should include the following: a. Continuance of 1915(c) performance measure collection and reporting (as would be due in a 1915(c) waiver or 1915(i) State Plan Amendment) until the Comprehensive Quality Improvement System (QIS) for the entire 1115 waiver has been approved and implemented. 1. The Comprehensive Q IS should include the following areas: i. Identification of needs and goals, and access to services (Level of Care/Functional assessment and Person -Centered Plan of Care at least annually) ; ii.

The state has a system as well as policies and procedures in place through which providers must identify, report and investigate critical incidents that occur within the delivery of MAC and TSOA . Provider contracts reflect the requirements of this sys tem. The state also has a system as well as policies and procedures in place through which to detect, report, investigate, and remediate abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Providers and participants are educated about this system. Provider obligations in clude specific action steps that providers must take in the event of known or suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation. 56. Presumptive Eligibility. The state will provide the MAC and TSOA services outlined in STCs 47 and 49 to individuals during a presumptive eligibility (PE) period following a determination by the state or a qualified entity \u2014on the basis of preliminary information \u2014 that the individual appears to meet functional and financial eligibility requirements , using simplified methodology pre scribed by the state and approved by CMS. In the event the state implements a waitlist, the authority for presumptive eligibility terminates. a.

Quality Assurance and Monitoring - The state will monitor both state staff and qualified entities for adherence to policies applicable to presumptive eligibility determinations through contract mon itoring and quality assurance reviews. i. Post implementation the state will conduct a targeted review of implementation to validate PE determinations are being made in accordance with established criteria; and ii. As part of the state's Quality Improvement Strategy, a sample of PE determinations will be reviewed yearly to determine that PE was established appropriately. d. Presumptive Functional Eligibility - The following information will be collec ted as part of the presumptive f unctional eligibility assessme nt to determine if the individual appears to meet n ursing facility level of care as defined in state rule . Indicators include: i. Does the individual need daily ca re provided or supervised by a registered nurse ( RN) or licensed practical nurse (LPN) ; or ii. Does the individual have an unmet or partially met for assistance with 3 or more qualifying ADLs ; or iii. Does the individual have a cognitive impairment and require supervision due to one or more of the following: Disorientation, memory impairment, impaired decisi on making, or wandering and a need for assistance with 1 or more qualifying ADLs ; or iv. Does the individual have an unmet or partially met need for assistance with 2 or more qualifying ADLs ; and v. Functional eligibility shall be confirmed by the State for ongoi ng program eligibility. e.

For MAC: 1. The state or qualified entity will confirm the individual is presumptively eligible in a categorically needy or alternative benefit plan program that offers healthcare coverage to the target population using the state's eligibility and enrollment data system. f. Period of Presumptive Eligibility - Period of presumptive eligibility means a period that begins on the date on which a qualified entity determines that an applicant is presumptively eligible5 and ends with the earlier of: i. In the case of an individual on whose behalf a Medicaid or TSOA application has been filed, the day on which a decision is made on that application; or ii. In the case of an individual on whose behalf a Medicaid or TSOA application has not been filed, the last day of the month following the month in which the determination of presumptive eligibility was made. g. Presumptive Eligibility S ervice Level -As part of the presumptive eligibility determination the state shall assess the individual for both functional eligibility (NFLOC) and financial eligibility concurrently. 57. Estate Recovery. Participants in MAC and TSOA are exempted from Medicaid estate recovery requirements due to: a. Scope of Medicaid estate recovery ; b. Limitation on access to Medicaid -funded state plan or demonstration HCBS for MAC participants ; c. Services available to MAC participants are outside the scope of services generally defined by CMS as HCBS; and d. TSOA is a non -Medicaid population. 58. Wait List . The state may institute a waitlist for those who are eligible for MAC or TSOA services but are unable to access the services because funding for services under the demonstration is not available. If the state determines expenditures for this program will exceed the expenditure authority under STC 3-6 within a given demonstration year, the state may impose a wait list. The state will implement the waitlist and ensure that no existing beneficiaries lose services as a result of the waitlist. In the event t he state implements a waitlist, the authority for presumptive eligibility terminates. VII.

GENERAL FINANCIAL RE QUIREMENTS UNDER TIT LE XIX 78. Quarterly Expenditure Reports. The state must provide quarterly expenditure reports using Form CMS -64 to report total expenditure s for services provided through this demonstration under section 1115 authority that are subject to budget neutrality. This project is approved for expenditures applicable to services rendered during the demonstration period. CMS shall provide FFP for al lowable demonstration expenditures only as long as they do not exceed the pre -defined limits on the expenditures as specified in section IX of the STCs. 79. Reporting Expenditures Under the Demonstration. The following describes the reporting of expenditures subject to the budget neutrality agreement: a. Tracking Expenditures . In order to track expenditures under this demonstration, the state must report demonstration expenditures through the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES), following routine CMS -64 reporting instructions outlined Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 42 in section 2500 of the State Medicaid Manual. All demonstration expenditures claimed under the authority of title XIX of the Act and subject to the budget neutral ity expenditure limit must be reported each quarter on separate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver, identified by the demonstration project number ( 11-W-0030 4/0) assigned by CMS, including the project number extension which indicates the Demonstrati on Year (DY) in which services were rendered. b. Cost Settlements . For monitoring purposes, cost settlements attributable to the demonstration must be recorded on the appropriate prior period adjustment schedules (Form CMS -64.9P Waiver) for the Summary Sh eet Line 10B, in lieu of Lines 9 or 10C. For any cost settlement not attributable to this demonstration, the adjustments should be reported as otherwise instructed in the State Medicaid Manual. c. Pharmacy Rebates . When claiming these expenditures the state may refer to the July 24, 2014 CMCS Informational Bulletin which contains clarifying information for quarterly reporting of Medicaid Drug Rebates in the Medicaid Budget and Expenditures (MBES) (http://www.medicaid.gov/Federal -Policy -Guidance/downloads/CIB -07-24-2014.pdf ). The state must adhere to the requirement at section 2500.1 of the State Medicaid Manual that all state collections, including drug rebates, mu st be reported on the CMS -64 at the applicable Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) or other matching rate at which related expenditures were originally claimed. Additionally, we are specifying that states unable to tie drug rebate amounts directl y to individual drug expenditures may utilize an allocation methodology for determining the appropriate Federal share of drug rebate amounts reported quarterly. This information identifies the parameters that states are required to adhere to when making s uch determinations. Additionally, this information addresses how states must report drug rebates associated with the new adult eligibility group described at 42 CFR \u00a7435.119. States that adopt the new adult group may be eligible to claim drug expenditure s at increased matching rates. Drug rebate amounts associated with these increased matching rates must be reported at the same matching rate as the original associated prescription drug expenditures. Pharmacy rebates are excluded from the determination o f budget neutrality. Pharmacy rebates are to be reported on Form CMS -64.9 base, Service Category Line 7. d. Use of Waiver Forms. For each demonstration year, separate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver must be completed, using the nine waiver name s listed below. Expenditures should be allocated to these forms based on the guidance which follows . 1. DSHP : Expenditures authorized under the demonstration for the Designated State Health Programs (DSHP) . 2. DSRIP : Expenditures authorized under the d emonstrat ion for delivery system transformation 3. Non-Expansion Adults : Expenditures authorized under the demonstration for Medicaid beneficiaries specified in STC 18 . 4. MAC: Expenditures authorized under the demonstration for beneficiaries receiving Medicaid Alternative Care (MAC) services. 5. TSOA : Expenditures authorized under the demonstration for beneficiaries receiving Tailored Supports for Older Adults (TSOA) services. 6. Foundational Community Supports 1 : One-time community t ransition services to individuals moving from institutional to community settings and those at imminent risk of institutional placement. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 43 7. Foundational Community Supports 2 : HCBS that could be provided to the individual under a 1915(c) waiver or 1915(i) SPA. 8. HepC: Expenditures for prescription drugs (\" HepC Rx\") related to a diagnosis of Hepatitis C for individuals affected by or eligible under the demonstration . 9. MAC and TSOA Not Eligible : Expenditures authorized under the demonstration for beneficiaries receiving presumptive eligibility for TSOA and MAC services and determined ineligible. 80. Expenditures Subject to the Budget Neutrality Agreement . For purposes of this section, the term \"expenditures subject to the budget neutrality agreement\" means expenditures for the MEGs outlined in section IX of the STCs, except where specifically exempted. All expenditures that are subject to the budget neu trality agreement (including those authorized in the Medicaid State Plan , through section 1915(c) waivers) are considered demonstration expenditures and must be reported on Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver. 81. Title XIX Administrative Costs. Admini strative costs will not be included in the budget neutrality agreement, but the state must separately track and report additional administrative costs that are directly attributable to the demonstration. All administrative costs must be identified on the Forms CMS -64.10 Waiver and/or 64.10P Waiver. 82. Claiming Period. All claims for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality agreement (including any cost settlements) must be made within two years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. Furthermore, all claims for services during the demonstration period (including any cost settlements) must be made within two years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter two-year period, the state must con tinue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the demonstration on the CMS -64 waiver forms, in order to properly account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. 83. Reporting Member Months. The following describes the reporting of member months for demonstration populations: a. For the purpose of calculating the budget neutrality agreement and for other purposes, the state must provide to CMS, as part of the quarterly report required under STC 74, the actual number of eligible member months for the populations affected by this demonstration as defined in STC 20. The state must submit a statement accompanying the quarterly report, which certifies the accuracy of this information. b. To permit full recognition of \"in -process\" eligibility, reported counts of member months may be subject to revisions after the end of each quarter. Member month counts may be revised retrospectively as needed. c. The term \"eligible member months\" refers to the number of months in which persons are eligible to receive services. For example, a person who is eligible for three months contributes three eligible member months to the total. Two individuals who are elig ible for two months each contribute two eligible member months to the total, for a total of four eligible member months. 84. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process must be used during the Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 44 demonstration. The state must estim ate matchable demonstration expenditures ( TC and federal share) subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit and separately report these expenditures by quarter for each FFY on the Form CMS -37 (narrative section) for both the Medical Assistance Payme nts (MAP) and state and Local Administrative Costs (ADM). CMS shall make federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 calendar days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the Form CMS -64 quarterly M edicaid expenditure report, showing Medicaid expenditures made in the quarter just ended. CMS shall reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -64 with federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in t he finalization of the grant award to the state. 85. Extent of Federal Financial Participation for the Demonstration . Subject to CMS approval of the source(s) of the non -federal share of funding, CMS shall provide FFP at the applicable federal matching rates for the demonstration as a whole for the following, subject to the limits described in Section IX of the STCs: a. Administrative costs, including those associated with the administration of the demonstration ; b. Net expenditures and prior period adjustments of the Medicaid program that are paid in accordance with the approved Medicaid State Plan ; and c. Net medical assistance expenditures and prior period adjustments made under section 1115 demonstration authority with dates of service during the demonstration period . 86. Sources of Non -Federal Share. The state provides assurance that the matching non -federal share of funds for the demonstration is state/local /tribal monies. The state further assures that such funds shall not be used as the match for any other federal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. All sources of non -federal funding must be compliant w ith section 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations. In addition, all sources of the non -federal share of funding are subject to CMS approval. a. The CMS may review at any time the sources of the non -federal share of funding for the demonstration. T he state agrees that all funding sources deemed unacceptable by CMS shall be addressed within the time frames set by CMS. b. Any amendments that impact the financial status of the demonstration shall require the state to provide information to CMS regarding all sources of the non -federal share of funding. c. The state assures that all health care -related taxes comport with section 1903(w) of the Act and all other applicable federal statutory and regulatory provisions, as well as the approved Medicaid State Plan. 87. State Certification of Funding Conditions. The state must certify that the following conditions for non-federal share of demonstration expenditures are met: a. Units of government, including governmentally operated health care providers, may certify tha t state or local monies have been expended as the non -federal share of funds under the demonstration. b. To the extent, the state utilizes certified public expenditures (CPE) as the funding mechanism for title Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 45 XIX (or under section 1115 authority) payments, CMS must approve a cost reimbursement methodology. This methodology must include a detailed explanation of the process by which the state would identify those costs eligible under title XIX (or under section 1115 authority) for purposes of certifying publ ic expenditures. c. To the extent the state utilizes CPEs as the funding mechanism to claim federal match for expenditures under the demonstration, governmental entities to which general revenue funds are appropriated must certify to the state the amount of such state or loca l monies as allowable under 42 CFR \u00a7433.51 used to satisfy demonstration expenditures. The entities that incurred the cost must also provide cost documentation to support the state's claim for federal match; d. The state may use intergovernmental transfer s (IGT) to the extent that such funds are derived from state, tribal, or local monies and are transferred by units of government within the state. Any transfers from governmentally operated health care providers must be made in an amount not to exceed the non-federal share of title XIX payments. The state must submit an IGT Protocol (Attachment E) for CMS approval prior to using IGT for the non -federal share of demonstration expenditures. e. Under all circumstances, health care providers must retain 100 percent of the claimed expenditure. Moreover, no pre -arranged agreements (contractual or otherwise) exist between health care providers and state and/or local government to return and/or redir ect to the state any portion of the Medicaid payments. This confirmation of Medicaid payment retention is made with the understanding that payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business, such as payments related to taxes, including health care provider -related taxes, fees, business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid and in which there is no connection to Medicaid payments, are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid payment. 88. Monitoring the Demonstration. The state will provide CMS with information to effectively monitor the demonstration, upon request, in a reasonable time frame. 89. Program Integrity. The state must have processes in place to ensure that there is no duplication of federal funding for any aspect of the demonstration. X. DESIGNATED STATE HEALTH PROGRAMS 90. Designated State Health Programs (DSHP) . Funding of DSHPs is to ensure the continuation of vital health care and provider support programs while the state devotes increas ed state resources during the period of this demonstration for DSRIP initiatives that will positively impact the Medicaid program , and result in savings to the federal government that will exceed the DSHP funding . Expenditures are claimed in accordance wit h CMS -approved claiming and documentation protocols to be specified in the DSHP Claiming Protocol (Attachment B). In order to ensure achievement of the demonstration's goals, the total annual expenditure authority is subject to the requirements of STC 91. CMS has approved expenditure authority for DSHP with the agreement that this one -time investment of DSHP funding would be phased down over the demonstration period. FFP may be claimed for expenditures made for the DSHP s enumerated in Table 3 beginning January 9, 2017 through December 31, 202 1 in accordance with an approved DSHP claiming protocol as described in STC 92. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 46 Table 3: Approved DSHP through December 31, 202 1 Agency Program HCA Kidney Disease Program (KDP) ALTSA Nursing Homes, Community Residential, and Homecare ALTSA State Caregiver Support ALTSA Senior Citizen's Services Act (SCSA) ALTSA Office of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing DDA Employment & Day and Other Community Services DDA Community Residential & Homecare BHA Crisis and other non -Medicaid services BHA Program of Assertive Community Treatment (PACT) BHSIA Offender Re -entry Community Safety Program BHA Spokane Acute Care Diversion BHA Psychological Evaluations BHA Outpatient and Support Services BHA Residential Services BHA Parent in Reunification BHA Problem Gambling Services DOC Mental health transition services DOC ORCS (Offender Reentry Community Safety) DOC Medications for Releasing Offenders DOC Community -supervised violator medical treatment DOH Tobacco and Marijuana Prevention and Education DOH Family Planning Non -Title X DOH HIV/AIDS Prevention Other Health Professional Loan Repayments (WA Student Achievement Council) Other Street Youth Service (Department of Commerce) Other \"County Levy \" Health Programs (see Attachment B) 91. Limit of FFP for DSHP . The amount of FFP that the state may receive for DSHP may not exceed the limit s described below. If upon review, the amount of FFP received by the state is found to have exceeded the applicable limit, the excess must be returned to CMS as a negative adjustment to claimed expenditures on the CMS -64. a. The state may claim up to $928,481,856 million TC for DSHP expenditures incurred through December 31, 2021 . The TC DSHP amount for DY1 will not exceed $240 million . Beginning in DY 2, the TC DSHP amount will be reduced by ten (10) percent and increase to a twenty -one (21) percent reduction by DY5 (see Table 4 below) . Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 47 b. The state may continue receiving FFP each DY for the difference between the Maximum Allowable DSHP and the Maximum Allowable DSRIP spending (see \"Difference DSHP & DSRIP\" in Table 4 below). For the differences list ed each DY , as long as the state has another allowable (non -DSHP) source of non -federal share , the state may claim FFP for those additional expenditures . c. Funding At Risk for Quality Improvement Goals under DSRIP . A share of total DSHP funding will be at risk if the state fails to demonstrate progress toward meeting the quality measures to be defined in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C) . The percentage at risk will gradually increase from 0 percent in DY 1 -2 to 5 percent in DY 3 to 10 percent in DY 4 and 20 percent in DY 5. Table 4: DSHP Annual Limits : Total Computable and At -Risk Performance 0% 0% state will develop a CMS -approved DSHP claiming protocol with which the state will be required to comply in order to draw down DSHP funds for the demonstration and submit the protocol no later than 60 calendar days after the demonstration approval date . State expenditures for the DSHP listed above must be documente d in accordance with the protocols. The state is not eligible to receive FFP until an applicable protocol is approved by CMS. Once approved by CMS, the protocol becomes Attachment B of these STCs, and thereafter may be changed or updated with CMS approva l. Changes and updates are to be applied prospectively. For each DSHP, the protocol must contain the following information: Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 48 a. The sources of non -federal share revenue, full expenditures and rates. b. Procedures to ensure that FFP is not provided for any of the following types of expenditures: i. Grant funding to test new models of care ii. Construction costs (bricks and mortar) iii. Room and board expenditures iv. Animal shelters and vaccines v. School based programs for children vi. Unspecified projects vii. Debt relief and rest ructuring viii. Costs to close facilities ix. HIT/HIE expenditures x. Services provided to undocumented individuals xi. Sheltered workshops xii. Research expenditures xiii. Rent and/or Utility Subsidies that are normally funded by the United States Department of Housing and Urb an Development and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) or other state/local rental assistance programs xiv. Prisons, correctional facilities, services for incarcerated individuals and services provided to individuals who are civilly committed and unable to leave xv. Revolving capital fund xvi. Expenditures made to meet a maintenance of effort requirement for any federal grant program xvii. Administrative costs xviii. Cost of services for which paymen t was made by Medicaid or CHIP (including from managed care plans) xix. Cost of services for which payment was made by Medicare or Medicare Advantage xx. Funds from other federal grants xxi. Needle -exchange programs xxii. Abortions that would not be allowable if furnished under Medicaid or CHIP xxiii. Costs associated with funding federal matching requirements. 93. DSHP Claiming Process. Documentation of each designated state health program's expenditures, as specified in the DSHP Protocol, must be clearly outlined in the state's supporting work papers and be made available to CMS. In order to assure CMS that Medicaid funds are used for allowable expenditures, the state will be required to supply summary DSHP expenditure information with the CMS -64 by account coding at the same level as information is currently provided to support the CMS -64. Federal funds must be claimed within two years following the calendar quarter in which the state disburses expenditures for the DSHP. Federal funds are not available for expenditures disburse d before January 1, 201 7, or after December 31, 20 21. Sources of non -federal funding must be compliant with section 1903(w) of the Act and applicable regulations. To the extent that federal funds from any federal programs are Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 49 received for the DSHP liste d above, they shall not be used as a source of non -federal share. The administrative costs associated with the DSHP listed above, and any others subsequently added by amendment to the demonstration, shall not be included in any way as demonstration and/or other Medicaid expenditures. Any changes to the DSHP listed above shall be considered an amendment to the demonstration and pr ocessed in accordance with STC 7 in Section III. 94. Reporting DSHP Payments . The state will report all expenditures for DSHP pa yments to the programs listed above on the forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver under the waiver name \"DSHP\" as well as on the appropriate forms. XI. MONITORING BUDGET NE UTRALITY FOR THE DEM ONSTRATION 95. Budget Neutrality Effective Date. Notwithstanding the effective date specified in section I of the STCs or in any other demonstration documentation, all STCs, waivers, and expenditure authorities relating to budget neutrality shall be effective beginning January 1, 2017. 96. Limit on Title XI X Funding . The state will be subject to a limit on the amount of federal title XIX funding that the state may receive on selected Medicaid expenditures during the period of approval of the demonstration. Budget neutrality expenditure targets are calculate d on an annual basis with a cumulative budget neutrality expenditure limit for the length of the entire demonstration. Actual expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit must be reported by the state using the procedures described in s ection X, STC s 78 and 79 . The data supplied by the state to CMS to calculate the annual limits is subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality expenditure limit. CMS' assessment of the state's co mpliance with these annual limits will be done using the Schedule C report from the Form CMS -64. 97. Risk. The state shall be at risk for the per capita cost for demonstration enrollees under this budget neutrality agreement, but not for the number of demons tration enrollees in each of the groups . By providing FFP for all demonstration enrollees, the state will not be at risk for changing economic conditions which impact enrollment levels. However, by placing the state at risk for the per capita costs for demonstration enrollees, CMS assures that the federal demonstration expenditures do not exceed the level of expenditures that would have occurred had there been no demonstration. 98. Expenditures Included in the Calcula tion of the Annual Budget Neutrality Limit. For the purpose of calculating the overall budget neutrality limit for the demonstration, separate annual budget limits will be calculated for each DY on a TC basis \u2014by first aggregating the member months of the : (a) Disabled Adults and Children; (b) non -ABD \"Classic Adults;\" and (c) Aged Medicaid beneficiaries \u2014then multiplying that summed amount by the predetermined per member per month (PMPM) cost (see Table 5 below) . The product of the above calculation will p rovide the state with a single \"Total Expenditures \" for the demonstration's \" Non-Expansion Adults \" (NEA) for each DY . The aggregated NEA population's Total Expenditures summed across DYs will represent the budget neutrality Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 50 limit for the entire 5-year demonstration period. The federal share of this limit will represent the maximum amount of FFP that the state may receive during the demonstration period for the types of demonstration expenditures described in this section. The federal share will be calculat ed by multiplying the TC budget neutrality limit by Composite Federal Share, which is defined in STC 101 below. The demonstration expenditures subject to the budget neutrality limit are those reported under STC 79(d). Table 5: PMPM Expenditure Limits by Demonstration Hypotheticals. Demonstration eligible populations that could have been covered via the Medicaid State Plan, but instead are being implemented using demonstration authority, may be designated \"hypotheticals.\" CMS allows adjustments to the WOW baseline to accommodate cost s related to hypotheticals. Separate WOW cost limits are provided for hypothetical costs. Hypothetical costs factor into the overall budget neutrality determination only to the extent that they exceed their separate limits. Hypothetical \"savings' may no t be used to offset other costs in the overall budget neutrality test. In addition to the expenditures associated with the hypothetical MAC, TSOA and Foundational Community Supports (ACI and ACE ) MEGs , the following population/expenditures is also include d as hypothetical in the demonstration: Table 6: Hypothetical Expenditures a. HepC Rx. Expenditures for prescription drugs related to a diagnosis of Hepatitis C (\"Hep C Rx\") for demonstration enrollees will be separately tabulated but, since they are covered services under the approved state plan, will be treated as hypothetical (pass through) for the purpose of budget neutrality . The state will not accrue budget neutrality savings if actual HepC Rx expenditures are less than projections and expenditures above projections will be treated as hypothetical for the purpose of budget neutrality . Additionally, t he state will reconcile the projected , to actual , HepC Rx costs and pr ovide Excludes expenditures for individuals who received TSOA and MAC services during the presumptive eligibility period $33,226,000 $47,238,000 $51,782,000 $53,383,000 Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 51 an analysis of yearly HepC Rx spending in the Annual Budget Neutrality Report described in STC 104 below . b. If expenditures for each hypothetical group exceed s its yearly limits, the excess amounts/ \"overage\" will be subtract ed from the overall budget neutrality savings , except in the case of HepC Rx costs . 100. Expenditures Excluded From Budget Neutrality Test. Regular FMAP will continue for costs not subject to budget neutrality limit tests. Those exclusions include: a. All other non -MMIS payments, such as DSH, GME, Medicaid Quality Incentive Payments (MQIP), Proportionate Share Payments (ProShare) , gross adjustments, reconciliations , and other settlement payments ; and b. Administrative expenditures and collections . 101. Composite Federal Share Ratio. The federal share of the budget neutrality expenditure limit is calculated by multiplying the limit times the Composite Federal Share. The Composite Federal Share is the ratio calculated by dividing the sum total of FFP rec eived by the state on actual demonstration expenditures during the approval period, as reported through MBES/CBES and summarized on Schedule C. with consideration of additional allowable demonstration offsets such as, but not limited to premium collections and pharmacy rebates, by TC demonstration expenditures for the same period as reported on the same forms. FFP and expenditures for extended family planning program must be subtracted from numerator and denominator, respectively, prior to calculation of t his ratio. For the purpose of interim monitoring of budget neutrality, a reasonable estimate of Composite Federal Share may be developed and used through the same process or through an alternative mutually agreed to method. 102. Future Adjustments to the Budg et Neutrality Expenditure Limit . The budget neutrality expenditure limit may be adjusted by CMS to be consistent with decisions outside of the state Medicaid program's control, including enforcement of impermissible provider payments, state or federal judi cial action, health care related taxes, new federal or state statutes, or policy interpretations implemented through letters, memoranda, regulation or other sub -regulatory guidance that impact provision or funding levels for services under this demonstrati on. 103. Enforcement of Budget Neutrality. CMS shall enforce the budget neutrality agreement over the life of the demonstration, rather than on an annual basis. The state shall submit to CMS an annual report to determine if/how the state is meeting its expenditure goals (see STC 104 below). If th e state exceeds the calculated cumulative budget neutrality expenditure limit by the percentage identified in Table 6 below for any of the demonstration years (DY), the state must submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 52 Table 6: Maximum Budget Neutrality Caps In addition, the state shall be required to submit a corrective action plan if an analysis of the expenditure data in relationship to the budget neutrality expenditure cap indicates a possibility that the demonstration will exceed the cap. 104. Annual Budget Neutrality Report. On or before July 1, 2018 , and on July 1 of each year there after, the state shall submit to CMS an Annual Budget Neutrality Monitoring Report, which will include an assessment of the demonstration's budget neutrality status based on actual expenditures to -date (including complete or nearly complete actual expendit ures for the immediately preceding DY), the cumulative budget neutrality limit to - date, and updated projections for both the budget neutrality limit and WW expenditures through the end of the current approval period. If the state's actual expenditures are found to have exceeded the cumulative budget neutrality limit by more than the percentages described in Table 6 above, or if the state's projections show that that actual cumulative spending will exceed the budget neutrality limit for the approval period, the state must include corrective actions to ensure budget neutrality for the demonstration, with priority given to reduction of planned DSHP and/or DSRIP spending . As outlined in STC 99(a), the state will also report expenditures related to HepC Rx. 105. Budget Neutrality Monitoring Tool. The state and CMS will jointly develop a budget neutrality monitoring tool (using a mutually agreeable spreadsheet program) for the state to use for quarterly budget neutrality status updates and other in situations when a n analysis of budget neutrality is required. The tool will incorporate the \"C Report \" for monitoring actual expenditures subject to budget neutrality. A working version of the monitoring tool will be available for the state's first Quarterly Progress Rep ort in 2017. 106. Exceeding Budget Neutrality. If the budget neutrality expenditure limit has been exceeded at the end of the demonstration period, the excess federal funds must be returned to CMS using the methodology outlined in STC 101, composite federal share ratio. If the demonstration is terminated prior to the end of the budget neutrality agreement, the budget neutrality test shall be based on the time elapsed through the termination date. XII. EVALUATION OF THE DE MONSTRATION 107. Submission of a Draft Evaluation Design Update. The state must submit to CMS for approval a draft evaluation design no later than 120 calendar days after CMS' approval date of the demonstration. At a minimum, the draft evaluation design must include a di scussion of the goals, objectives, and evaluation questions specific to the entire delivery system Demonstration Year Cumulative Target Definition Percentage DY1 Cumulative Budget Neutrality Limit P lus: 2.0 percent DY1 through DY2 Cumulative Budget Neutrality Limit Plus: 1.5 percent DY1 through DY3 Cumulative Budget Neutrality Limit Plus: 1.0 percent DY1 through DY 4 Cumulative Budget Neutrality L imit Plus: 0.0 percent DY1 through DY5 Cumulative Budget Neutrality Limit P lus: 0.0 percent Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 53 reform demonstration. The draft design must discuss the outcome measures that will be used in evaluating the impact of the demonstration during the period o f approval, particularly among the target population, specific testable hypothesis, including those that focus on target populations for the demonstration and more generally on beneficiaries, providers, plans, market areas and public expenditures. The dra ft design should be described in sufficient detail to determine that it is scientifically rigorous. The data strategy must be thoroughly documented. It must discuss the data sources, including the use of Medicaid encounter data, and sampling methodology for assessing these outcomes. The draft evaluation design must include a detailed analysis plan that describes how the effects of the demonstration shall be isolated from other initiatives occurring within the state (i.e. SIM grant ). However, it is under stood that the transformation initiatives under the demonstration inherently build upon the State Health Care Innovation Plan and other ongoing transformation efforts in Washington, and the summative evaluation design will reflect this. The state commits to the development of a draft evaluation design that directly reflects the demonstration domains of focus, and will ensure separate evaluations of federally funded efforts. The draft design must describe the state's process to select an outside contractor for the evaluation. The design should describe how the evaluation and reporting will develop and be maintained to assure its scientific rigor and completion. In summary, the demonstration evaluation will meet all standards of leading academic institut ions and academic journal peer review, as appropriate for each aspect of the evaluation, including standards for the evaluation design, conduct, and interpretation and reporting of findings. Among the characteristics of rigor that will be met are the use of best available data; controls for and reporting of the limitations of data and their effects on results; and the generalizability of results. Information from the external quality review organization (EQRO) may be considered for the purposes of evaluati on, as appropriate. The state must acquire an independent entity to conduct the evaluation. The evaluation design must describe the state's process to contract with an independent evaluator, including a description of the qualifications the entity must p ossess, how the stat e will ensure no conflict of interest , and budget for evaluation activities. 108. Demonstration Hypothese s. The state will test the following hypotheses in its evaluation of the demonstration. a. Whether community -based collaborations that define community health needs can (1) support redesigned care delivery, (2) expand health system capacity, and (3) improve individual and population health outcomes - resulting in a reduction in the use of avoidable intensive services, a reduction in use of intensive service settings, bringing spending growth below national trends, and accelerating value -based payment reform. b. Whether providing limited scope LTSS to individuals \"at risk\" for Medicaid and to Medicaid beneficiaries who are not currently recei ving Medicaid -funded LTSS will avoid or delay eligibility for and use of full Medicaid LTSS benefits while preserving quality of life for beneficiaries and reducing costs for the state and federal government. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 54 c. Whether the provision of foundational community supports - supportive housing and supported employment - will improve health outcomes and reduce costs for a targeted subset of the Medicaid population. d. Whether federal funding of DSHPs enabled the state to leverage Medicaid spending to support delivery system reforms that resulted in higher quality care and in long term federal savings that exceeded the federal DSHP funding. 109. Domains of Focus . The Evaluation Design must, at a minimum, address the research questions listed below. For questions that cover broad subject areas, the state may propose a more narrow focus for the evaluation. a. Was the DSRIP program effective in achieving the goals of better care for individuals (including access to care, quality of care, health outcomes), better health for the population, or lower cost through improvement through the implementation of transformation projects by community -based collaborations ? To what degree can improvements be attributed to the activities undertaken unde r DSRIP? b. To what extent has the DSRIP enhanced the state's health IT ecosystem to support delivery system and payment reform? Has it specifically enhanced these four key areas through ACHs and provider partners : governance, financing, policy/legal issu es and business operations? c. To what extent has the DSRIP program improved quality, efficiency and effectiveness of care processes through care delivery redesign, including bi -directional integration of behavioral, physical and SUD services, alignment of care coordination, and coordination between providers, including bi -directional integrated delivery of physical, behavioral health services, SUD services, and transitional care services, and alignment of care coordination and to serve the whole person? d. What are the effects of modifying eligibility criteria and benefit packages for long -term services and supports? e. What is the effectiveness of the providing foundational community supports , described in Section VII in terms of health, quality of life, and ot her benefits to the Medicaid program ? 110. Evaluation Design Process: Addressing the research questions listed above will require a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. When developing the DSRIP Planning Protocol, the state should consi der ways to structure the different projects that will facilitate the collection, dissemination, and comparison of valid quantitative data to support the Evaluation Design. From these, the state must select a preferred research plan for the applicable res earch question, and provide a rationale for its selection. To the extent applicable, the following items must be specified for each design option that is proposed: Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 55 a. Quantitative or qualitative outcome measures; b. Baseline and/or control comparisons; c. Process and improvement outcome measures and specifications; d. Data sources and collection frequency; e. Robust sampling designs (e.g., controlled before -and-after studies, interrupted time series design, and comparison group analyses); f. Cost estimates; g. Timelines for deliverables. 111. Levels of Analysis: The evaluation designs proposed for each question may include analysis at the beneficiary, provider, and aggregate program level, as appropriate, and include population stratifications to the extent feasible, for furt her depth and to glean potential non - equivalent effects on different sub -groups. In its review of the draft evaluation plan, CMS reserves the right to request additional levels of analysis. 112. Final Evaluation Design and Implementation. CMS shall provide comments on the draft Evaluation Design within 60 calendar days of receipt, and the state shall submit a final Evaluation Design within 60 calendar days after receipt of CMS comments. The state shall implement the Evaluation Design and submit its progress in each of the quarterly and annual reports. 113. Evaluation Reports. a. Interim Evaluation Report. The state must submit a Draft Interim Evaluation Report 90 calendar days following the completion of DY 4 . The purpose of the Interim Evaluation Report is to present preliminary evaluation findings, and plans for completing the evaluation design and submitting a Final Evaluation Report according to the schedule outlined in (b). The s tate shall submit the final Interim Evaluation Report within 60 calendar days after receipt of CMS comments. b. Final Evaluation Report. The state must submit to CMS a draft of the Final Evaluatio n Report by January 30, 20 22. The s tate shall submit the final evaluation report within 60 calendar days after receipt of CMS comments. c. Cooperation with Federal Evaluators. Should CMS undertake an independent evaluation of any component of the demonstration , the s tate shall cooperate fully , to the greatest extent possible, with CMS or the independent evaluator selected by CMS. The state must submit the required data to CMS or the contractor. Requests for information and data from CMS or the independent evaluator selec ted by CMS shall be made in a timely manner and provide the state with an adequate timeframe to provide the information as agreed to by CMS and the state.

IV. Background on Washington's Financing and Accounting Systems The Financial Services Division (FSD), within the Health Care Authority (HCA), is responsible for accounting and financial management services that include accounts payable, accounts receivable , billing, data management and financial reporting and analysis. The FSD is responsible for the draw -down of federal funds in accordance with the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA). Additionally, financial managers of the various DSHPs are responsible for identifying costs eligible and allowable for federal match at the state -specific Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP) for federal reimbursement, and proper reporting. A. Agency Financial Reporting System (AFRS) The Agency Financial Reporting Sy stem (AFRS) is the state's official accounting system. This system is used to process accounting transactions (pay bills, record revenue and general ledger). The integrity of all accounting processes is audited as part of the state's Single Audit performe d by the Washington State Auditor's Office, in accordance with OMB Circular A -133. This independent audit of internal control systems, financial records, financial statements, and federal award transactions and expenditures over federally funded programs is to ensure compliance with federal regulations. B. Sources of Non -Federal Share Federal Financial Participation for DSHP expenditures, as described above, is time - limited and phases down each year of the demonstration, as described in STC 91, Table 4. The state provides assurance that the non -federal share of funds for the demonstrat ion is consistent with STC 86. The state further assures that such funds shall not be used as the match for any other federal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 65 For purposes of expenditures claimed under this protocol, the state will use cert ified public expenditures (CPE) as the funding mechanism to claim federal match for the approved state and local DSHPs as identified in STC 87(c). In addition to certifying that expenditures are eligible for FFP under the DSHP provisions of the demonstrati on project, the contributing Responsible Entities must certify that the sources of the non - federal share comply with the terms of this paragraph, excluding the types of program costs that are not eligible for FFP as defined in STC 92(b). Certified Public E xpenditure Process For each DSHP, the state must perform the following steps to determine the amount of the DSHP expenditures eligible for FFP. The payments and associated claimed expenditures must be commensurate with actual program services delivered an d actual allowable program expenditures. DSHPs with claims processed through ProviderOne7 are based on an approved unit rate. For each demonstration year, the Responsible Agency with an approved DSHP will complete an annual form to be provided to HCA. T he annual form is for HCA's internal budgeting, monitoring and reporting and is not used to inform or support federal claiming. This form will include: Name of Responsible Entity Name of Program Program account coding Budget for the demonstration year Estimated expenditures by month for the demonstration year Certification and attestation by the Responsible Entity CFO or designee On a monthly basis, HCA will collect from Responsible Entities with an approved DSHP the following information for federal claim ing purposes Actual monthly costs spent for the approved DSHP Cost documentation to support the Responsible Entity DSHP expenditures Certification and attestation by the Responsible Entity CFO or designee. The Responsible Entity will attest to the followin g specific attributes: information submitted is true, accurate, and complete information submitted is prepared in accordance with governing law and HCA instructions acknowledge that all information submitted in the CPE application is subject to audit by HCA or its authorized designee 7 ProviderOne is Washington's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS). Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 66 unallowable expenditures as defined in STC 92(b) are excluded from certified expenditures, only net expenditures are being claimed The State will perform the following steps in order to provide reasonable assurance that the C PE expenditures are accurate and allowable: Review the CPE form and supporting documentation for accuracy. Ensure the Responsible Entity's CFO or designee's attestation is obtained Inquire with the Responsible Entity if any discrepancies are discovered on the application or supporting documentation If discrepancies exist, ensure that the Responsible Entity submits a revised CPE form Using the CPE funding mechanism, the state will c laim the federal share on its quarterly CMS 64 based on the actual total computable expenditures certified by the Responsible Entity with an approved DSHP. HCA will maintain all CPE records and other supporting documentation. HCA will prepare and submit t he CMS -64 Quarterly Expense Report, identifying the expenditures allowable for federal claiming. HCA will contract with an independent auditor to annually validate the accuracy of the federal claim. Each of the Responsible Entities with an approved DSHP will be required to provide full cooperation with the independent auditor. V. DSHP Program Details General DSHP expenditures will be claimed for the following programs, as listed in Table A. A description of each of these programs and the procedures used to document expenditures for these programs are included below. A.

Certification criteria will be set forth by the state, and ACHs will submit both phases of certification information to the state within the required time frames. The state will review and approve ea ch certification phase prior to distribution of Project Design funds for that phase. a. Phase 1 certification requirements must be submitted to the state by May 15, 2017. b. Phase 2 certification requirements must be submitted to the state by August 14, 2017. Certification criteria are described further below. 2. ACHs must develop and submit a Project Plan application for approval. The components of the Project Plan are described in STC 36 and further detailed in this protocol. Completed Project Plan applications are due to the state by November 16, 2017. 3. The state and its contracted Independent Assessor will evaluate and (if appropriate) approve ACH Project Plans. ACHs with approved Project Plans are eligible to receive performance -based incentive payments. The st ate and the Independent Assessor will approve Project Plans as early as November 20, 2017, and no later than December 22, 2017. The state will develop and post a draft Project Plan Template for public feedback prior to releasing a final version. Design fu nds attached to each certification phase will support ACHs as they address specific requirements and submit their Project Plans. As ACHs develop Project Plans, they must solicit and incorporate community and consumer input to ensure that Project Plans refl ect the specific needs of the region. After the Project Plans are submitted to the state, they will be reviewed by an Independent Assessor contracted by the state. The Independent Assessor will review and make recommendations to the state for approval of P roject Plans. The state must approve of Project Plans in order to authorize DSRIP incentive funding. Project Plans may be subject to additional review by CMS. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 88 b. ACH Certification Criteria The certification process is intended to ensure that each ACH is pre pared to serve as the lead entity and single point of accountability to the state for the transformation projects in its region. The certification application solicits information to ensure that: (a) the ACH is qualified to fulfill the role of overseeing a nd coordinating regional transformation activities; (b) the ACH meets the composition standards outlined in STC 23; and (c) the ACH is eligible to receive project design funds. There are two phases to the certification process. According to a timeline dev eloped by the state, each ACH must complete both phases and receive approval from the state before submitting a Project Plan application. Phase 1 Certification: Each ACH must demonstrate compliance and/or document how it will comply with state expectatio ns in the following areas, at a minimum: 1. Governance and Organizational Structure, including compliance with principles outlined in STC 22 and decision -making expectations outlined by the state. 2. Initiation or continuation of work with regional Tribes, incl uding adoption of the Tribal Engagement and Collaboration Policy or alternate policy as required by STC 24. 3. Community and Stakeholder Engagement to demonstrate how the ACH is accountable and responsive to the community. 4. Budget and funds flow, including ho w design funds will support project plan development. 5. Clinical capacity and engagement to demonstrate engagement and input from clinical providers. 6. Other requirements as the state may establish. Phase 2 Certification: Each ACH must demonstrate that it is in compliance with state expectations in the following areas, at a minimum: 1. Governance and Organizational Structure, including compliance with principles outlined in STC 22 and decision -making expectations outlined by the state. ACHs will describe whethe r any developments or adjustments have occurred since Phase 1 Certification. 2. Tribal Engagement and Collaboration describing specific activities and events that further the relationship between the ACH and Tribes.

Provide details for how the ACH will satisfy public engagement requirements for Project Plan development outlined in STC 23. 4. Budget and funds flow to summarize strategic use of funding and decision making processes regarding incentive funding distribution. 5. Data -informed decision making strategies, including processes for applying available data to project selection and implementation planning. 6. Transformation project planning to describe progress on project selection processes. 7. Other requirements as the state may establish. c. ACH Project Plan Requirements As part of this demonstration, each ACH and its regional participating providers will be responsible for implementing a set of projects selected from the Project Toolkit. The Project Plan: Provides a blueprint of the work that each region, coordinated by the ACH, will undertake through the implementation of these projects. Explains how the regional work responds to community -specific needs, relates to the mission of the ACH, and furthers the objectives of the demonstration. Provides details on the ACH's composition and governance structure, specifically any adjustments to refine the model based on initial lessons learned. Demonstrates ACH compliance with the terms and conditions of participation in the demonstration. Incorporates the voice and perspective of the community and consumers through outreach and engagement. Each ACH will submit a Project Plan to the state for review. The Pro ject Plans will be used by the state to assess ACH preparedness in planning and implementing its local demonstration program and the regional alignment with the demonstration's overall objectives and requirements. The state's contracted Independent Assesso r will review and evaluate Project Plans and make recommendations to the state for approval/remediation of each Plan. In addition, commitments made by an ACH in its Project Plan must be consistent with the terms of a contract between the state and the ACH, outlining the requirements and Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 90 obligations of the ACH as the lead and other partnering providers in the ACH in order to be eligible to receive DSRIP incentive funding. The Project Plan Template will provide a structured format and outline the information required to be submitted by each ACH as part of its Project Plan. The template will be divided into two main sections and will include scoring criteria. Section I will focus on how the ACH, through its partnering providers, is being directly responsive to the needs and characteristics of the community it serves. It will include details regarding the ACH's overall programmatic vision, composition, and decision -making processes. Section II will ask ACHs to provide detailed project -specific plans. The state m ay add additional requirements to the Project Plan application in addition to what is outlined below. The categories for Section I of the Project Plan template will include: 1. ACH Theory of Action and Alignment Strategy : Rationale explaining how the ACH p lans to improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of care processes in its community. 2. Governance : Description of how the ACH complies with the state's governance and decision -making expectations. 3.

Value -based Payment Strategies: Description of the regional strategies to support attainment and readiness of statewide VBP targets. For each selected project, Section II requires, that ACHs provide details regarding: 1. Partnering Organizations : Description of the partnering providers, both traditional and non -traditional, that have committed to participate in projects. Partnering providers must serve and commit to continuing to serve the Medicaid population. ACHs must ensure that together, these partnering providers serve a significant portion of Medicaid covered lives in the region and represent a broad spectrum of care and related social services that are critical to improving how care is delivered and paid for. Additional details on recommended implementation partners will be provided in Project Toolkit guidance documents. 2. Relationships with Other Initiatives: The ACH will attest to securing descriptions of any initiatives that its partnering providers are participating in that are funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Ser vices and any other relevant delivery system reform initiatives currently in place and ensuring these projects are not duplicative of DSRIP projects. In DY 2, partnering providers will be required to provide descriptions and attest that DSRIP projects are not duplicative of other funded projects and do not duplicate the deliverables required by the former project(s). If projects are built on one of these other projects, or represent an enhancement of such a project, that may be permissible but the ACH will be required to explain how the DSRIP project is not duplicative of activities already supported with other federal funds. 3. Monitoring and Continuous Improvement : Description of the ACH's plan for monitoring project implementation progress and continuous improvement or adjustments in alignment with Section V (Process for ACH Project Plan Modification). 4.

Regional Assets, Anticipated Challenges and Proposed Solutions : Description of the assets that the ACH and partn ering providers bring to the delivery system transformation efforts, and the challenges or barriers they expect to confront in improving outcomes and lowering costs for the target populations. For identified challenges, the ACH must describe how it expects to mitigate the impact of these challenges and what new capabilities will be required to be successful. 7. Implementation Approach and Timing : Explanation of the planned approach to accomplishing each set of required project milestones for each of the sel ected projects. III. Project Toolkit a. Overview of Project Categories Each ACH, through its partnering providers, is required to implement at least four transformation projects and participate in statewide capacity building efforts to address the needs of Medicaid beneficiaries. These projects will be spread across the following three domains: 1. Health Systems and Community Capacity Building 2. Care Delivery Redesign (at least two projects) 3. Prevention and Health Promotion (at least two projects) The Domains, a nd the strategies defined within each Domain, are interdependent. Domain 1 is focused on systemwide planning and capacity -building to reinforce transformation projects. Domain 1 strategies are to be tailored to support efforts in Domain 2 and Domain 3; pro jects in Domain 2 and Domain 3 integrate and apply Domain 1 strategies to the specified topics and approaches. ACHs will develop detailed implementation plans. As described in Section IV, project progress will be measured based on state -defined milestone s and metrics that track project planning, implementation, and sustainability. b. Description of project domains i. Health Systems and Community Capacity Building This domain addresses the core health system capacities to be developed or enhanced to transition the delivery system according to Washington's Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 93 Medicaid Transformation demonstration. Domain 1 does not outline individual projects, but rather three required focus areas to be implemented and expanded across the delivery system, inclusive of all provider types, to benefit the entire Medicaid population. The three areas of focus are: financial sustainability through value -based payment, workforce, and systems fo r population health management. Each of these areas will need to be addressed progressively throughout the five -year timeline to directly support Domain 2 and Domain 3 transformation project success. ii. Care Delivery Redesign Transformation projects within this domain focus on innovative models of care that will improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of care processes. Person -centered approaches and integrated models are emphasized. Domain 2 includes one required project and three optional projec ts. ACHs will be required to select at least one of the optional projects for a minimum of two Domain 2 projects in total. iii. Prevention and Health Promotion Transformation projects within this domain focus on prevention and health promotion to eliminate di sparities and achieve health equity across regions and populations. Domain 3 includes one required project and three optional projects. ACHs will be required to select at least one of the optional projects for a minimum of two Domain 3 projects in total. Table 1. Menu of Transformation Projects # Project Description Health Systems and Community Capacity Building Foundational activities that address the core health system capacities to be developed or enhanced to transition the delivery system in accordance with the demonstration's goals and transformation objectives. Financial sustainability through value -based payment Paying for value across the continuum of care is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the transformation projects undertaken through this demonstration. A transition away from paying for volume may be challenging to some providers, both financially and administratively. As not all provider organizations are equipped at present to successfully operate in these payment models, pr oviders may need assistance to develop additional capabilities and infrastructure. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 94 Workforce The health services workforce will need to evolve to meet the demands of the redesigned system of care. Workforce transformation will be supported through the pro vision of training and education services, hiring and deployment processes, and integration of new positions and titles to support transition to team - based, patient -centered care and ensure the equity of care delivery across populations. Systems for popul ation health management The expansion, evolution, and integration of health information systems and technology will need to be supported to improve the speed, quality, safety, and cost of care. This includes linkages to community -based care models. Health data and analytics capacity will need to be improved to support system transformation efforts, including combining clinical and claims data to advance VBP models and to achieve the triple aim. Care Delivery Redesign Strategies that focus on innovative mod els of care to improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of care processes. Person - centered approaches and integrated models are emphasized. 2A Bi-directional integration of physical and behavioral health through care transformation The Medicaid system aims to support person -centered care that delivers the right services in the right place at the right time. Primary care services are a key gateway to the behavioral health system, and primary care providers need additional support and resources to screen and treat individuals for behavioral health care needs, provide or link with appropriate services, and manage care. Similarly, for persons not engaged in primary care services, behavioral health settings can be equipped to provide essential primary care services. Integrating mental health, substance use disorder, and primary care services has been demonstrated to deliver positive outcomes and is an effective approach to caring for people with multiple health care needs. Through a whole -person approa ch to care, physical and behavioral health needs will be addressed in one system through an integrated network of providers, offering better coordinated care for patients and more seamless access to the services they need. This project will advance Healthi er Washington's initiative to bring together the financing and delivery of physical and behavioral health services, through managed care organizations, for people enrolled in Medicaid. 2B Care coordination Care coordination is essential for ensuring that children and adults with complex health service needs are connected to the evidence - based interventions and services that will improve their outcomes. Appropriately coordinated care is especially important for high -risk Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 95 populations, such as those living wi th chronic conditions, those impacted by the social determinants of health such as unstable housing and/or food insecurity, the aging community, and those dependent on institutionalized settings. Communities are challenged to leverage and coordinate existi ng services, as well as establish new services to fill gaps. Without a centralized approach to \"coordinating the coordinators,\" a single person might be assigned multiple care coordinators who are unaware of one another, potentially provide redundant servi ces, and risk creating confusion for the individual. 2C Transitional care Points of transition out of intensive services/settings, such as individuals discharged from acute care, inpatient care or from jail or prison into the community are critical intervention points in the care continuum. Transitional care services provide opportunities to reduce or eliminate avoidable admissions, readmissions and jail use. Individuals discharged from intensive settings may not have a stable environment to return t o or may lack access to reliable care. Transitions can be especially difficult on beneficiaries and caregivers when there are substantial changes in medications or routines or an increase in care tasks. This project includes multiple care management and tr ansitional care approaches. 2D Diversion interventions Diversion strategies provide opportunities to re -direct individuals away from high -cost medical and legal avenues and into community -based health care and social services that can offer comprehensive assessment, care/case planning and management to lead to more positive outcomes. This strategy promotes more appropriate use of emergency care services and also supports person -centered care through increased access to primary care and social services, es pecially for medically underserved populations. Prevention and Health Promotion Projects focus on prevention and health promotion to eliminate disparities and achieve health equity across regions and populations. 3A Addressing opioid use public health crisis The opioid epidemic affects communities, families, and overwhelms law enforcement, health care and social service providers. Opioid use disorder is a devastating and life -threatening chronic medical condition and access to treatments that support recovery and access to lifesaving medications to reverse overdose needs to be improved. This project will support strategies focused on addressing prevention, treatment, overdose prevention and recovery supports aimed at supporting whole -person health Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 96 3B Reproductive and maternal/child ealth Focusing on the health of women and children is a primary focus for the Medicaid program as Medicaid funds more than half of the births in the state and provides coverage to more than half of Washington's children. This p roject focuses on ensuring access to ongoing women's health care to improve utilization of effective family planning strategies. It further focuses on providing mothers and their children with home visits that have been demonstrated to improve maternal and child health. Home visitors work with the expectant or new mother in supporting a healthy pregnancy, by recognizing and reducing risk factors, promoting prenatal health care through healthy diet, exercise, stress management, ongoing well-woman care, and b y supporting positive parenting practices that facilitate the infant and young child's safe and healthy development. Child health promotion is a state priority to keep children as healthy and safe as possible, which includes parents accessing timely and ro utine preventative care for children, especially well -child screenings and assessments. 3C Access to oral health services Oral health impacts overall health and quality life, and most oral disease is preventable. Oral disease has been associated with increased risk for serious adverse health outcomes. Increasing access to oral health services for adults provides an opportunity to prevent or control the progression of oral disease, and to reduce reliance on emergency departments for oral pain and relate d conditions. This project focuses on providing oral health screening and assessment, intervention, and referral in the primary care setting, or through the deployment of mobile clinics and/or portable equipment. The project seeks to leverage the primary c are workforce, and to strengthen relationships between primary care and dental providers, through stronger referral networks, improved communications, and shared incentives. 3D Chronic disease prevention and control Chronic health conditions are prevalent among Washington's Medicaid beneficiaries, and the number of individuals with or at risk for chronic disease is increasing. Disease prevention and effective management is critical to quality of life and longevity. Many individuals face cultural, linguisti c and structural barriers to accessing quality care, navigating the health care system, and understanding how to take steps to improve their health. Improving health care services and health behaviors is only part of the solution. Washington State recogniz es the impact that factors outside the health care system have on health and is committed to a Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 97 \"health in all policies\" approach to effective health promotion and improved treatment of disease. The Chronic Disease Prevention and Control Project focuses on integrating health system and community approaches to improve chronic disease management and control. IV. Project Stages, Milestones, and Metrics a. Overview In accordance with STC 35, over the duration of the demonstration, the state will shift accountabilit y from a focus on rewarding achievement of progress milestones in the early years of the demonstration to rewarding improvement on performance metrics in the later years of the demonstration. During Years 2, 3 and 4, ACHs will be required to report against several progress milestones for each project, as described further below and as detailed in the Project and Metrics Specification guide. These progress milestones are, by definition, 'pay -for- reporting' or 'P4R,' since ACHs will be rewarded based on repor ted progress. Project progress milestones are defined in the Project Toolkit, specific to each project focus, and organized into three core categories: project planning milestones, project implementation progress milestones, and scale and sustain milestone s. To monitor performance, ACHs will be accountable for achieving targeted levels of improvement for project -specific outcome measures. These measures are primarily \"pay -for-performance,\" or \"P4P,\" since ACHs are only rewarded if defined outcome metric ta rgets are achieved. However, a subset of these measures will be rewarded on a P4R basis for reasons that include: to allow ACHs time for project implementation activities; to allow time to establish necessary reporting infrastructure; and to allow for the testing of new, innovative outcome measures for project areas where there is a lack of nationally -vetted, widely used outcome measures. Performance metrics are are consistent with the objectives of the demonstration as outlined in STC 30. Table 2 below summarizes the different categories of measures. Each category is described in further detail below. Table 2. Demonstration Milestone/Metric Categories Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 Milestones NA NA Performance Metrics NA NA Payment Metrics P4R/P4P P4R/P4P P4P b. Progress Milestones (Capacity Building Elements, Progress/Planning Milestones, and Metrics) During demonstration Year 1, each ACH will be responsible for the development, submission and approval of a Project Plan application. As part of the Project Plan application, the ACH will provide a timeline for implementation and completion of each projec t, in alignment with progress milestones specified in the Project Toolkit and accompanying documents. General categories of progress milestones required to be completed for each project include: Identify target population and assess partnering providers' capacity to fulfill project requirements. Collectively, partnering providers should serve a significant portion of Medicaid covered lives in the region and represent a broad spectrum of care and related social services that are critical to improving how ca re is delivered and paid for. Engage and obtain formal commitment from partnering providers responsible for carrying out project activities. Develop a detailed implementation plan, including timing of activities, financial sustainability, workforce strate gies, and population health management. Ongoing reporting of standardized process measures, including number of individuals served, number of staff recruited and trained, and impact measures as defined in the evaluation plan. c. Performance Metrics (Statewid e and Project -level Outcome Metrics) See Appendix II for the project metrics that will be used to measure progress against meeting project goals and targeted levels of improvement against outcome -based performance indicators. Section III of the Funding and Mechanics Protocol provides further detail on how identified measures will be used to evaluate ACH performance. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 99 d. Value -based Payment Milestones Pursuant to STC 40, the state will update its Value -based Roadmap annually, which will address how the stat e will achieve its goal of converting 90 percent of Medicaid provider payments to reward outcomes by 2021. This Roadmap is a document that describes the payment reforms required for a high -quality and financially sustainable Medicaid delivery system and es tablishes VBP targets and incentives for the Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) and ACHs. This document also serves to revise and clarify the details surrounding Washington State's VBP incentives and framework. Achievement of VBP targets will be assessed at both a regional and MCO - specific level. As indicated in Table 3, ACHs and MCOs will be rewarded based on reported progress in the early years of the demonstration. This will shift to rewarding for performance on the VBP targets. Table 3. Value -based Payment Milestone Categories Through this demonstration, the DSRIP program and initiatives such as the Health Care Payment Learning Action Network will yield new best practices. Therefore, this Roadmap will be updated annually throughout the demonstration to ensure long-term sustaina bility of the improvements made possible by the DSRIP investment and that best practices and lessons learned can be incorporated into the state's overall vision of delivery system reform. Washington will submit quarterly progress updates to CMS, which wi ll include the progress made both in terms of total dollars included in VBP arrangements and quantitative and qualitative lessons learned. V. Process for Project Plan Modification Value -based Payment DSRIP Pool DY 1 DY 2 DY 3 DY 4 State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 100 No more than twice a year, ACHs may submit proposed modifications to an appro ved Project Plan for state review and approval/denial. In certain limited cases it may become evident that the methodology used to identify a performance goal and/or improvement target is no longer appropriate, or that unique circumstances/developments out side of an ACH's control require the ACH to modify its original plan. Examples of these circumstances could include a significant regulatory change that requires an ACH to cease a planned project intervention or initiate substantial changes to the way a st andard performance metric is measured, requiring an ACH to modify its planned approach. In order to request a Project Plan modification, an ACH must submit a formal request, with supporting documentation, for review by the state. The state will have 60 calendar days to review and respond to the request. Allowable Project Plan modifications are not anticipated to change the overall ACH project incentive valuation. However, modifications to decrease scope of a project may result in a decrease in the valuat ion of potential earnable funds. Unearned funds as a result of a decrease in the scope of a project will be directed to the Reinvestment pool and earned in accordance with the DSRIP Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment D). The state will not permit modifications that lower expectations for performance because of greater than expected difficulty in meeting a milestone. Removal of a planned project intervention may result in a forfeiture of funding for that project as determined by the state, VI. Health I nformation Technology . (The state will discuss how it plans to meet the Health IT goals/milestones outlined in the STCs.) In accordance with STC 39, the state will use Health Information Technology (\"Health IT\") and Health information exchange services to link core providers across the continuum of care to the greatest extent possible. To detail how the state will achieve its stated Health IT goals, the state will provide a Health IT strategy by April 1, 2017. That document provides detailed tactics and i nitiatives, technical gaps addressed, critical actions, policy levers and key metrics in place or planned for the following key business processes: 1. Addressing data needs and gaps 2. Acquiring Clinical Data 3. Leveraging Data Resources 4. Supporting clinical decisi ons with integrated patient information 5. Ensuring data integrity 6. Making large sets of clinical data available for program and business decisions Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 101 ATTACHMENT D DSRIP Program Funding & Mechanics Protocol I. Accountable Communities of Health a. Introduction This demonstration aims to transform the health care delivery system through regional, collaborative efforts led by ACHs. ACHs are self -governing organizations with multiple community representatives that are focused on improving health and transforming ca re delivery for the populations that live within the region. Providers within ACH regions will partner to implement evidence -based programs and emerging innovations, as defined in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C), that address the needs of Medica id beneficiaries. ACHs, through their governing bodies, are responsible for managing and coordinating the projects undertaken with partnering providers as well as state reporting. This protocol provides detail and criteria that ACHs and their partnering pr oviders must meet in order to receive DSRIP funding and the process that the state will follow to ensure that ACHs will meet these standards. b. ACH Service Regions There are nine ACHs that cover the entire state, with the boundaries of each aligned with the state's Medicaid Regional Service Areas (RSA). The RSAs were designated in 2014 through legislation that required the state to continue regionalizing its Medicaid purchasing approach. The RSA geographic boundaries were designated by assessing the degree to which they: Support naturally occurring health care delivery system and community service referral patterns across contiguous counties; Reflect active collaboration with community planning that prioritizes the health and well -being of residents; Include a minimum number of beneficiaries (at least 60,000 covered Medicaid lives) to ensure active and sustainable participation by health insurance companies that serve whole region; and Ensure access to adequate provider networks, consider typical utilization an d travel patterns, and consider the availability of specialty services and the continuity of care.

ACH Composition and Partnering Provider Guidelines Each ACH consists of partnering providers. The commitment to serving Medicaid beneficiaries, as well as the diversity and expertise of those providers and social service organizations, is important in evaluating Project Plan applications. d. The A CH serve s as the lead for the projects with partnering providers that are participating in Medicaid transformation projects. The ACH must submit a single Project Plan application on behalf of the partnering providers, and serve as the single point of perfo rmance accountability in the Independent Assessor's evaluation of projects and metrics. ACH Governance and Management Each ACH must describe its primary decision -making process, process for conflict resolution, and its structure (e.g., a Board or Steering Committee) that is subject to composition and participation guidelines as outlined in STC 23. Each ACH's primary decision -making body will be responsible for approving the selection of transformation projects. Each ACH will comply with STCs 22 and 23 in it s decision - making structure, which compliance the state will review and approve as part of ACH certification. . The overall organizational structure of the ACH must reflect the capability to make decisions and oversee regional efforts in alignment with th e following five domains, at a minimum: Financial Clinical Community Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 103 Data and Performance Monitoring Program management and strategy development The ACH's responsibilities include engaging stakeholders region -wide; supporting partnering providers in planning and implementing projects in accordance with requirements of the demonstration; developing budget plans for the distribution of DSRIP funds to partnering providers in accordance with the funding methodology provided in this protocol; collaborating with partnering providers in ACH leadership and oversight; and leading and complying with all state and CMS reporting requirements. II. Projects, Metrics and Metric Targets a. Overview of Projects ACHs must select and implement at least four Transformation proj ects from the Project Toolkit (described in the DSRIP Planning Protocol [Attachment C]). ACHs must provide project details in the Project Plan application and describe how selected projects are directly responsive to the needs and characteristics of the Me dicaid populations served in the region. Projects described in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C) are grouped into three domains: Health Systems and Community Capacity, Care Delivery Redesign, and Prevention and Health Promotion. The ACHs are respo nsible for demonstrating progress in relation to progress milestones and outcome metrics for each project. b. Project Metrics As part of their Project Plans, ACHs must develop timelines for implementation of projects, in alignment with state -specified proces s milestones included in Attachment C. Metrics that track progress in project planning, implementation, and efforts to scale and sustain project activities will be used to evaluate ACH milestone achievement. ACHs must report on these metrics in their semi -annual reports (described in Section V). For each reporting period, ACHs are eligible to receive incentive payments for progress milestones and improvement toward performance metric targets. For designated performance metrics, ACHs will be awarded Achieve ment Values (AV), based on the mechanism described in Section IV of this protocol. c. Outcome Metric Goals and Improvement Target ACHs will have a performance goal for each outcome metric. On an annual basis, the state will measure ACH improvement from a base line toward this goal to Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 104 evaluate whether or not the ACH has achieved the metric improvement target. Each ACH will have its own baseline starting point. Both existing and new measures' baselines will be set based on performance during Demonstration Year (D Y) 1. Annual improvement targets for ACH outcome metrics will be established using one of two methodologies: (1) Gap to Goal Closure: This methodology will be used for metrics that have available state or national Medicaid, or other comparable populatio ns, 90th percentile benchmarks. Outcome targets will be based on these state or national performance benchmarks, whenever available, but adjustments may be made to reflect the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the populations serviced by ACHs, where possible. The \"gap\" in this methodology is defined as the difference between the baseline (or end of prior DY) performance and the 90th percentile benchmark. Annual improvement targets will be an up to 10 percent closure of the gap year over year. An example to illustrate the gap to goal methodology: If the baseline data for a measure is 52 percent and the goal is 90 percent, the gap to the goal is 38. The target for the project's first year of performance would be a 3.8 percent increase in the result (target 55.8%). Each subsequent year would continue to be set with a target using the most recent year's data. For example, should an ACH meet or exceed the first year's target of 55.8 percent, the next annual target would be up to 10 percent of the new gap to the goal. This will account for smaller gains in subsequent years as performance improves toward the goal or measurement ceiling. In cases where ACH performance meets or exceeds the performance goal (i.e., the 90 percent performance in the example above), incentives are earned based on continued performance above the goal. If an ACH has already surpassed the goal in the baseline year, the measure w ill be dropped and value of the remaining measures rebased. (2) Improvement -Over -Self: For those metri cs without a state or national Medicaid benchmark available, including innovative metrics, the state will set a standard percent improvement relative to each ACH's previous DY performance. This percent improvement target will be determined on a metric -by-metric basis based on available evidence of a reasonable expectation for magnitude of change. Improvement targets for these metrics will be set to be consistent with the magnitude of change required to meet targets in the gap -to-goal methodology measures. T he improvement -over-self-target for each metric will be consistent across each ACH.

Incentive Funding Formula and Project Design Funds a. Demonstration Year 1 (DY1) i. Project Design Funds In accordance with STCs 35(i) and 45, during DY1, the state will pro vide project design funds to ACHs for completing the designated certification process. The design funds are a fixed component distributed equally across ACHs for completing the certification process described in Attachment C and can be used to develop spec ific and comprehensive Project Plans. This funding allows ACHs to begin to develop the technology, tools, and human resources to support the necessary capacity ACHs need to pursue demonstration goals in accordance with community - based priorities. Design f unds payments will total up to 25 percent of allowable expenditures in DY1 with payments distributed in two phases between June and September 2017. As described in the DSRIP Planning Protocol (Attachment C), ACHs are required to complete the two -phase certification process for receipt of design funds. In order to be eligible for incentive payments, beyond design funds, an ACH must submit and receive state approval of a Project Plan. ii. Project Funding The state will distribute the remaining DY1 DSRIP funding (excluding state administrative expenses) to certified ACHs upon approval of the Project Plan application. The amount of DSRIP funding available for each ACH will be scaled based on application scoring by the Independent Assessor as outlined in STC 36. b. Demonstration Years 2 through 5 Funding and Project Valuation In accordance with STC 35(h), the state has developed criteria and methodology for project valuation by which ACHs will continue to earn incentive payments in DY 2 through 5 by reporting on and achieving progress measures and performance -based outcome metrics. Project valuation is calculated during DY1 once each certified ACH submits a Project Plan application detailing project selection and implementation strategies. Based on this content, the state Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 106 determine s maximum incentive payments allotted to each ACH, by project, which will be available for distribution to partnering providers. As described in STC 35, the annual maximum project valuation is determined based on the attributed number of Med icaid beneficiaries residing in the ACH RSA(s) and on the Project Plan application scores. The maximum amount of ACH incentive funding is determined according to the methodology described in (c) below. Once each project is assigned a maximum valuation, th e project's corresponding, individual progress measures and outcome metrics are valued according to the methodology described in (d) below. Maximum ACH and project valuations are subject to monitoring by the state and CMS. In the event that an ACH does no t meet the expected targets for each project's reporting -based progress measures and performance -based outcome metrics, the ACH's project valuation may be commensurately reduced from the maximum available project valuation. In addition, ACHs may receive le ss than their maximum available project valuation if DSRIP funding is reduced based on performance of the statewide measure bundle described in Section VII. c. Calculating Maximum ACH Project Valuation Each DY, a maximum statewide amount of DSRIP project fu nding will be identified. For approved tribal specific projects, a percentage of annual DSRIP funding will be allocated to tribal -specific projects in a manner consistent with this Protocol and the Tribal Protocol, which describes tribal projects and funds flow. Remaining project funds will be available to ACHs based on the methodology outlined below. Step 1: Assigning Project Weighting The state has weighed the projects in the Transformation Project Toolkit (Attachment C) relative to one another as a perc entage of the total annual DSRIP project funding available, known as the project weight. ACHs must select at least four projects, including Project 2A ( Bi-Directional Integration of Physical and Behavioral Health through Care Transformation ), Project 3A (A ddressing the Opioid Use Public Health Crisis) and least two additional projects, one from Domain 2 and one from Domain 3. Each project has associated metrics that ACHs must achieve to earn funding tied to the project. An ACH's payment for project impleme ntation is based on pay -for- Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 107 reporting (P4R) in DY1 and DY2 and based on both P4R pay -for- performance (P4P) in DY3, DY4 and DY5. The maximum amount of incentive funding that an ACH can earn is determined based on the ACH's project selection, the value of the projects selected, the quality and score of Project Plan applications, and the number of Medicaid beneficiaries attributed to the ACH. Project weights outlined in Table 1 were assigned with consideration of the following factors: Alignment with stat ewide measures to better incentivize the achievement of statewide objectives. Number of Medicaid beneficiaries within scope and capacity of projects to address population need and improve population health. Potential cost -savings to ensure that the state' s Medicaid per -capita cost is below national trends. Existence of evidence -based strategies to ensure a reduction in avoidable use of intensive services. Focus on quality of services, rather than quantity, to accelerate transition to value -based payment. Table 1. Transformation Project Weighting Project Weighting Project Weight 2A: Bi -Directional Integration of Physical and Behavioral Health through Care Transformation 32% 2B: Community -Based Care Coordination 22% 2C: Transitional 2D: Diversions Interventions 13% the Opioid Use Public Health Crisis 4% 3B: Reproductive and Maternal and Child Health 5% 3C: Access to Oral Health Services 3% 3D: Chronic Disease Prevention and Control 8% Projects listed in order of Project Weighting Project 2A (Bi -Directional Integration of Care and Primary Care Transformation) represents the state's primary objective under Initiative 1 of the demonstration. Project 2A requires the highest level of integration of all oth er projects and, therefore, houses the largest corresponding set of P4P metrics. Furthermore, Project 2A has the potential to yield the greatest achievement of value for Medicaid Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 108 members through an evidence -based approach \u2014and is likely to result in signifi cant cost-savings for both the state and federal government. Regions that have implemented fully integrated managed care are be better positioned to scale project 2A and are eligible for an enhanced DY1 valuation based on project plan scoring methodology. Project 2B (Community -Based Care Coordination) has the potential to realize significant healthcare spending reductions while providing local services to many of the state's most vulnerable Medicaid beneficiaries. To earn payments for this project, an ACH must transition early in the demonstration to P4P. The project weights of Project 2C (Transitional Care) and Project 2D (Diversion Interventions) are each 13 percent. Both projects allow ACHs to select one or more evidence -based approaches to result in co st-savings for a smaller population of Medicaid beneficiaries compared to Projects 2A and 2B. In addition, these two projects have a smaller number of measures moving to P4P throughout the demonstration period compared to other Domain 2 projects. Project 3 D (Chronic Disease Prevention and Control) has the greatest project weighting in Domain 3s, at 8 percent. Project 3D has the potential to yield significant results for a large population of Medicaid beneficiaries by including multiple chronic diseases with in the project. By affecting a large population through an evidence - based model, Project 3D has the potential to result in significant cost savings. Project 3B (Reproductive and Maternal and Child Health) impacts a large subpopulation of Medicaid benefici aries. This project offers several optional evidence -based approaches to drive success and a suitable number of metrics to measure performance. Project 3A (Addressing the Opioid Use Public Health Crisis) will affect a subset of the state's substance use di sorder (SUD) population of Medicaid beneficiaries, anticipated to be proportionally smaller than most other Domain 3 projects, by aligning with Governor Inslee's Executive Order 16 -09.9 Based on public comments and feedback to the Project Toolkit (Attachm ent C), Project 3A has now been escalated as a required project for all ACHs. Project 3C (Access to Oral Health Services) is primarily targeted at the adult population, who will benefit from the evidence -based approach selected by the ACH, and there is a d efined number of P4R metrics that will be used to measure an ACH's performance. 9 Available at http://www.governor .wa.gov/sites/default/files/exe_order/eo_16 -09.pdf. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 109 Step 2: Calculating Maximum ACH Project Funding In accordance with STC 28 and STC 35(b), the state developed an allocation methodology for maximum ACH project funding based o n project selection, transformation impact of projects, and attribution based on residence. The state will use the defined RSA boun daries to determine beneficiary attribution for the funding methodology using the November 2017 client -by-month file . The relative level of Medicaid attribution determined at that time will determine maximum DSRIP fund s per ACH throughout the demonstration, as outlined below. Maximum funding by project is calculated by multiplying the total state ACH project funds available b y the respective project weight (see Table 1 for project weighting). Maximum Statewide Funding by Project = [Total Annual Statewide ACH Project Funds Available by DY] x [Project Weight] In order to determine the maximum annual ACH funding by project, the maximum annual statewide funding by project is multiplied by total Medicaid beneficiaries residing in the ACH RSA. Maximum ACH Funding by Project = [Maximum Annual Statewide Funding by Project] x [Percent of Total Attributed Medicaid Beneficiaries This formula will be repeated for all selected projects, and the sum of selected project valuations equals the maximum amount of financial incentive payments each ACH can earn for successful pr oject implementation over the course of the demonstration. Each ACH is required to select at least four projects, including Project 2A and Project 3A. If ACHs choose fewer than the total eight projects, project weights will be rebased proportionately for D Y2 through DY5. This maximum ACH valuation will be earned upon achieving defined reporting -based progress measures and performance -based outcome metrics and may be reduced based on application of the statewide penalty described in Section VII. For DY1, the maximum ACH Funding by Project will be adjusted based on Project Plan scores. Each ACH Project Plan will be scored by the Independent Assessor. The scoring criteria will be developed in conjunction with the Project Plan template (see DSRIP Planning Protoc ol). d. Earning Incentive Payments In DY2 through DY5, ACHs earn incentive payments for successful implementation and reporting of selected projects. Successful implementation is defined for each Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 110 project as meeting the associated reporting -based progress meas ures and performance -based outcome metrics. Within each payment period, ACHs are evaluated against these designated metrics and awarded Achievement Values (AV), which are point values assigned to each metric that is payment -driving. The maximum value of a n AV is one (1) in the instance in which an ACH meets the designated metric. The amount of incentive funding paid to an ACH will be based on the amount of progress made toward achieving its improvement target on each outcome metric. An ACH may achieve an AV based on meeting a minimum threshold of 25% of its gap- to-goal target in the year. If this performance threshold is not achieved, and ACH would forfeit the project incentive payment associated with that metric. Enhanced AV valuation can be achieved if the ACH realizes a higher percentage of the gap -to-goal performance target, beyond the 25% threshold: 100 percent achievement of performance goal (achievement value = 1) Less than 100 percent achievement of performance goal and at least 75 percent achieve ment of performance goal (achievement value = .75) Less than 75 percent achievement of performance goal and at least 50 percent achievement of performance goal (achievement value = .50) Less than 50 percent achievement of performance goal and at least 25 percent achievement of performance goal (achievement value = .25) Less than 25 percent threshold achievement (achievement value = 0) To determine Total Achievement Value (TAV) for each project in a given payment period, the AVs earned within the project are summed according to their relative weighting as illustrated in Table 2. From there, the Percentage Achievement Value (PAV) is calculated by dividing the TAV by the weighted total of possible AVs for the project in that payment period. The purpose of the PAV is to represent the proportion of metrics an ACH has achieved for each project in each payment period and will be used to determine the distribution of dollars earned out of the maximum annual ACH project funding as follows: Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 111 Table 2. Example Calculation of Achievement Values Measure/Metric Achievement Value Outcome Metric 1 0 Outcome Metric 2 1 Outcome Metric 3 0.5 TAV 1.5 PAV 50.0% To support the expected outcomes from successful project implementation, ACHs are solely responsible for P4R progress measures in DY1 and DY2. The state will transition a robust set of outcome metrics to be P4P, meaning a portion of project funds are dependent on ACH demonstrating improvement toward performance targets in the out years . Table 3 illustrates the timing and distribution of transition to P4P: Table 3. Transition to Pay -for-Performance, Percentage of Annual DSRIP Incentive Payment e. Managed Care Integration A primary goal of the demonstration is to support implementation of a fully integrated physical health and behavioral health managed care system. Although there are RSAs that have made progress toward integration, a majority of th e state requires significant investments to achieve statewide integration of physical and behavioral health services by January 2020. Regions that implement fully integrated managed care prior to 2020 are eligible to earn incentive payments above the max imum valuation for project 2A. To earn incentives above the maximum valuation for project 2A, regions must submit binding letters of intent to implement full integration. This will be reported in Project Plan submissions. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 112 The incentive payment is calculate d using a base rate of up to $2 million and a per member rate based on total attributed Medicaid beneficiaries, with payments distributed to the ACH in the calendar year of completion. Integration Incentive = [Base Rate] + [Member Adjustment x Total Attrib uted Medicaid Beneficiaries] x [Phase Weight] The incentives for fully integrated managed care will be distributed in two phases associated with reporting on progress measures: binding letter(s) of intent, and implementation. These phases represent two key activities towards integration. ACHs and partnering providers are eligible for an incentive payment for reporting on the completion of each phase. Table 4. Weighting of Integration Progress Measures by Phase Phase Weights Phase 1: Binding Letter(s) of Intent 40% Phase 2: Implementation 60% f. Value -based Payment Incentives In accordance with STCs 41 and 42 and the state's Value -based Roadmap (Attachment F), the state will set aside no more than 15 percent of annually available DSRIP funds to reward MCO and ACH partnering providers for provider -level attainment of VBP targets as well as progression from baseline as described in STCs 41 and 42. VBP targets reflect goal levels of adoption of Alternative Payment Models (APM) and Advanced APMs in managed ca re contracting. IV. ACH Reporting Requirements These activities are detailed below. a. Semi -Annual Reporting for ACH Project Achievement Two times per year, ACHs seeking payment under the demonstration shall submit reports that include the information and data necessary to evaluate ACH projects using a standardized reporting form developed by the state. ACHs must use the document to report on their progress against the milestones and metrics described in their approved Project Plans. Based on these reports, as well as data generated by the state on performance metrics, the state will calculate aggregate incentive payments in accordance with this protocol. The ACH reports will be reviewed by Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 113 state and the Independent Assessor. Upon request, ACHs will provide back -up documentation in support of their progress. These reports will be due as indicated below after the end of each reporting period: For the reporting period encompassing January 1 through June 30 of each year; the semi -annual report and the correspond ing request for payment must be submitted by the ACH to the state before July 31. For the reporting period encompassing July 1 through December 31 of each year; the semi -annual report and the corresponding request for payment must be submitted by the ACH t o the state before January 31. The state shall have 30 calendar days after these reporting deadlines to review and approve or request additional information regarding the data reported for each milestones/metric and measure. If additional information is re quested, the ACH shall respond to the request within 15 calendar days and the state shall have an additional 15 calendar days to review, approve, or deny the request for payment, based on the additional information provided. The state shall schedule the pa yment transaction for each ACH within 30 calendar days following state approval of the semi -annual report. Approved payments will be transferred to the Financial Executor until the ACH provides direction for payment distribution to partnering providers. The state must use this documentation in support of claims made on the MBES/CBES 64.9 Waiver form, and this documentation must be made available to CMS upon request. V. State Oversight Activities The state will provide oversight to ensure accountability for t he demonstration funds being invested in Washington State, as well as to promote learning with the state and across the country from the work being done under the MTP demonstration. Throughout the demonstration, the state and/or its designee will oversee t he activities of ACHs and submit regular reports to CMS pursuant to STC 37. Each ACH must enter into a contract with the Washington State Health Care Authority (HCA) to be eligible to receive project design funds, as well as other incentive funding under the demonstration. This contract set s forth the requirements and obligations of the ACHs as the leads for DSRIP and other partnering providers. The contract address es reporting requirements, data sharing agreements, performance standards, compliance with the STCs of the demonstration, and the ACH's agreement to participate in state oversight and audit activity to ensure program integrity of the demonstration. In the contract, HCA require s ACHs to participate in semi -annual Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 114 reporting outlined in this protoc ol as a condition for qualifying for demonstration funds. The state will support ACHs by providing guidance and support on the state's expectations and requirements. Additionally, state activities designed to ensure program integrity are detailed below: a. Quarterly Operational Reports The state will submit progress reports on a quarterly basis to CMS. The reports will present the state's analysis of the status of implementation; identify challenges and effective strategies for overcoming them; review any available data on progress toward meeting metrics; describe upcoming activities; and include a payment summary by ACH as available. The reports will provide sufficient information for CMS to maintain awareness regarding progress of the demonstration. b. Lear ning Collaboratives Annual learning collaboratives will be sponsored by the state to support an environment of learning and sharing among ACHs. Specifically, the collaboratives will promote the exchange of strategies for effectively implementing projects and addressing operational and administrative challenges. ACHs will be required to participate and contribute to learning collaboratives as specified in STCs 37(c) and 45(a)(v). c. Program Evaluation In accordance with STCs 35 and 107, the state will devel op an evaluation plan for the DSRIP component of the draft evaluation design. The state will contract with an independent evaluator to evaluate the demonstration. The evaluator will be selected after a formal bidding process that will include consideration of the applicant's qualifications, experience, neutrality, and proposed budget. Evaluation drafts and reports will be submitted in accordance with deadlines in section 7 of the STCs. VI. Statewide Performance and Unearned DSRIP Funding a. Accountability for St ate Performance Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 115 The state is accountable for demonstrating progress toward meeting the demonstration's objectives. Funding for ACHs and partnering providers may be reduced in DY3, DY4, and DY5 if the state fails to demonstrate quality and improvement on t he statewide measures listed below. STC 44 specifies the amount of annual DSRIP funding at risk based on statewide performance on these measures. The funding reductions will be applied proportionally to all ACHs based on their maximum Project Funding amoun t. A statewide performance goal will be established for the statewide metrics. The state will be accountable for achieving these goals by the end of the demonstration period. During DY3 and DY4, annual assessment of quality and improvement from a defined baseline toward these goals will be used to measure and evaluate whether or not the statewide metric improvement target has been achieved. Statewide Accountability Metrics 1. Mental Health Treatment Penetration 2. Substance Use Disorder Treatment Penetration 3. Outpatient Emergency Department Visits per 1000 Member Months 4. Plan All -Cause Readmission Rate (30 days) 5. Well -Child Visits in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Years of Life 6. Antidepressant Medication Management 7. Medication Management for People with Asthma (5 - 64 Years) 8. Controlling High Blood Pressure 9. Comprehensive Diabetes Care - Blood Pressure Control 10. Comprehensive Diabetes Care: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Poor Control The state will establish a baseline performance for each measure. The state will adapt the Qualit y Improvement Score (QIS) methodology, originally developed by HCA for measuring MCO performance, to determine statewide performance across the statewide accountability measures for the demonstration. Each measure is assessed for both achievement of qualit y and improvement on an annual basis beginning DY3. The weighted sum of all the individual measure quality improvement scores will yield the overall QIS. The overall QIS is then used to indicate whether a reduction of funding is warranted, and to calculat e the percentage of funding at risk that should be reduced for that demonstration year. Annual improvement will reflect closing of the relative gap between prior performance year and the goal by up to 10 percent each year, as described in Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 116 Attachment C, Se ction III(c). Quality will be assessed based on existing national benchmark standards where possible. For newer, innovative measures that do not have established national estimates, quality will be determined based on available evidence of reasonable expe ctation for magnitude of change. If the state fails to achieve its annual quality improvement score on a given statewide accountability metric, funding will be reduced by the amount tied to the QIS. The draw of the FFP match for all at -risk funds under statewide accountability metrics , or reporting of payments on the CMS -64 form, will not occur until the QIS have been approved by the s tate and CMS. The s tate will submit the QIS and supporting documentation to CMS for review and approval. CMS will have 90 calendar days to review and approve the QIS. Once the at -risk payments are approved, the s tate will disburse the portion of the withheld at -risk f unds that were earned, and the s tate will report such expenditures on the CMS 64 form and draw down FF P accordingly. The s tate may not claim FFP for any at -risk expenditures until CMS has issued formal approval. b. Reinvestment of Unearned DSRIP Funding DSRIP funding that is unearned because the ACH failed to achieve certain performance metrics for a given reporting period may be directed toward DSRIP High Performance incentives. Unearned project funds directed to high performers will be used to support t he scope of the statewide DSRIP program or to reward ACHs whose performance substantively and consistently exceeds their targets as measured according to a modified version of the QIS described above. The state does not plan to withhold any amounts to subs idize this reinvestment pool. VII. Demonstration Mid -point Assessment In accordance with STC 21, a mid -point assessment will be conducted by the Independent Assessor in DY3. Based on qualitative and quantitative information, and stakeholder and community inpu t, the mid -point assessment will be used to systematically identify recommendations for improving individual ACHs and implementation of their Project Plans. If the state decides to discontinue specific projects that do not merit continued funding, the proj ect funds may be made available for expanding successful project plans in DY 4 and DY5. ACHs will be required to participate in the mid -point assessment and adopt recommendations that emerge from the review. The state may withhold a percentage Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 117 or all futu re DSRIP incentive funds if the ACH fails to adopt recommended changes, even if all other requirements for DSRIP payment are met.

ACHs, through their governing bodies, are respo nsible for managing and coordinating with partnering providers. The ACHs must meet the qualifications set forth in STCs 21 - 23 and must meet the targets enumerated in Attachment C in order to earn incentive payments. In addition, ACHs will certify as to whether or not the partnering providers have met the milestones required for earning incentive payments within their region. The ACH will also certify to the independent assessor whether or not partnering providers have achieved the milestones (see STC 2 1). The independent assessor (IA) will review the ACH's certification and make recommendations to the state related to distribution of payment. Once the state affirms the recommendations from the IA, it will send the incentive payments to the FE for dist ribution to the partnering providers. The contracted FE will perform the work and complete the deliverables outlined below. 1. Establish a system for recording, processing, distributing and reporting on the payment of incentive funds and other financial tra nsactions between HCA, ACHs and partnering providers in accordance with Attachment D. 1.1. Establish a standardized process and forms to track payments to partnering providers and instruct partnering providers and ACHs in their use. 1.2.

Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 121 ATTACHMENT G Intergovernmental Transfer (IGT) Protocol I. Preface As part of this demonstration, the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program is to provide incentives for Medicaid providers to create and sustain an integrated, high performing health care delivery system that can effectively and efficiently meet the needs of Medicaid beneficiaries and low income uninsured individuals in their local communities by improving care, improving health and reducing costs. The non -federal share of these payments will come from intergovernmental transfers (IGT) from public hospitals, other local government or tribal funds, or funds that the state has earned by claiming federal match on expenditures for Designated State Health Programs (DSHP). In accordance with STC 87(d), the state may use IGTs to the extent that such funds are derived from state, tribal, or local monies and are tra nsferred by units of government, which can include a governmentally operated provider, within the state. The state provides assurance that the matching non -federal share of funds for the demonstration is state/local/tribal monies and that such funds shall not be used as the match for any other federal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. All sources of non -federal funding must be compliant with section 1903(w) of the Social Security Act, 42 CFR \u00a7433.51 and applicable regulations. The state assu res that all health care-related taxes comport with section 1903(w) of the Act and all other applicable federal statutory and regulatory provisions, as well as the approved Medicaid State Plan. The IGT protocol (this document, Attachment E) describes the methodology and guidelines by which the state may use IGT as a source of funding for the non -federal share of demonstration expenditures. II. IGT Process and the Role of the Accountable Communities of Health (ACH) Under this demonstration, the state will mak e performance -based funding available to regionally -based ACHs and their partnering providers with the goal of transforming the delivery system for Medicaid beneficiaries. The ACHs will be responsible for coordinating the efforts of partnering providers i n their community to create and implement regional project plans to transform the Medicaid delivery system. The project plans will be reviewed by a third -party Independent Assessor, who will make recommendations to the state as to whether the plans should be approved. Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 122 Approved project plans that meet the milestones outlined in the project will be eligible for incentive payments under the demonstration. A component of the non - federal share of these payments will come from IGTs. The responsibility of the Financial Executor includes distributing earned incentives in a timely manner to participating providers in accordance with each ACH's budget plan. DSRIP payments are made twice per year and are always paid using the same process. The incentive payment amounts are determined by two reporting periods per demonstration year, where ACHs report the metrics and milestones achieved by their transformation projects. The state, with support from the Independent Assessor, will review reports to calculate the ince ntive payments earned by the ACH. Once incentive amounts are calculated, the state will calculate the non -federal share amount to be transferred by an IGT contributor based on ACH budget plans in order to draw the federal funding for incentive payments rel ated to the achievement of milestones and metrics. Within 14 calendar days after notification by the state of the identified non-federal share amount, the IGT contributor will make an intergovernmental transfer of funds. The state will pay an amount equiva lent to the non -federal and federal shares of the incentive payment to the ACH and its partnering providers. The state will then draw the federal funding based on those disbursements. If the IGT is made within the appropriate and approximate 14 -day timefr ame, the incentive payment will be disbursed within approximately 30 calendar days. The total computable incentive payment must remain with the ACH partnering providers and will not be returned to or retained by the state. III. IGT Funding Conditions IGTs from governmentally operated providers must be in an amount not to exceed the non-federal share of title XIX payments. No pre -arranged agreements (contractual or otherwise) exist between health care providers and state and/or local government to return and/or redirect to the state any portion of the Medicaid payments. This confirmation of Medicaid payment retention is made with the understanding that payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business (such as payments related to taxes, inc luding health care provider -related taxes, fees, business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid and in which there is no connection to Medicaid payments) are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid payment. An agreeme nt will be executed between the Health Care Authority (HCA), Washington's Medicaid agency, and each IGT contributing entity. The agreement will identify the annual estimated commitments by each IGT contributor. Funds will Washington State Medicaid Transformation Project Section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS Approval period: January 9, 2017 through December 31, 2021 123 be transferred from each IGT con tributor and will be under the administrative control of HCA. The state will provide copies of the signed IGT agreements between the state and the public entity providing the IGT funds to the CMS regional office. IGT contributions for purposes of DSRIP a re eligible for a 50 percent federal match. The IGT contributor will, by signature, attest that the IGT contribution is not derived from Federal receipts and that they will maintain records to document the source of non-federal share and furnish those rec ords to HCA and CMS as necessary. Additionally, the IGT contributor must identify the allowable funding source, over the course of a given DSRIP Year, to support the IGT commitment for DSRIP. IGT funding as described under this demonstration does not have any interaction with existing provider assessment arrangements, with regard to the federal 6% cap. Incentive payments will also not impact upper payment limit (UPL) or state/hospital specific Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) caps. Additionally, IGTs will not interact with existing Certified Public Expenditure (CPE) arrangements or any upper payment limit requirements with governmental (public) hospitals as long as the IGTs are not considered an expenditure for the provision of a hospital service for hospitals that CPE. CPEs are expenditures made for the provision of a Medicaid service and certifying providers can receive no service payments above their certified costs. The IGTs are the expense of financing the non -federal share for other Medicaid pu rposes, and the public hospitals may not claim the transfer of funds to the Medicaid agency as a Medicaid uncompensated hospital service cost under the State Plan or the waiver since their service costs are fully satisfied.

The algorithm uses risk factor categories developed at University of California, San Diego known as the Chr onic Illness and Disability Payment System (CDPS) and MedicaidRx, which were deemed by the Society of Actuaries to be effective methods of risk adjustment. The PRISM risk score is updated on a monthly basis by the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services' Research and Data Analysis division using the past fifteen months of claims, encounter, and demographic data. A risk score of 1.5 means that an individual's expected future medical expenditures will be 50 percent greater than that of the a verage Medicaid disabled client. The PRISM risk score was approved by CMS for targeting clients for the Health Home Program and Financial Alignment Dual Demonstration.
