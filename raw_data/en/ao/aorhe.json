Research, along with our years of practicing Asian medicine, have shown that acupuncture and moxibustion helps stop the spread of infection, control pain, and also maintain balance in the body. Moxibustion (moxa) uses artemisia vulgaris, which is a species of chrysanthemum (moxa wool), that contains vitamins and minerals with strong healing properties. When used with a ceramic device, moxa wool produces Infra-Red rays that penetrate deep into the skin (about 40 mm) to activate and invigorate cells and thereby strengthens the immune system. Researchers have proven the effectiveness of moxa in helping cancer and many other chronic diseases. It has also been shown to fight against external pathogenic factors. Herbal Medicine.
