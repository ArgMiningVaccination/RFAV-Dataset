The Scientifically Backed Health Benefits of Ashwagandha Supplements Have you heard of the powerful healing properties of Ashwagandha, an ancient herb used in Ayurvedic medicine? Used to treat various physical and mental health conditions, this traditional plant may have much more to offer than we once thought. So what are the various health benefits of Ashwagandha supplements, and are these health benefits scientifically backed? Let's find out below: KSM-66 Ashwagandha Supplements Can Help Boost Testosterone Levels KSM-66 Ashwagandha is an extract derived from the root of the Withania somnifera plant, commonly known as Ashwagandha. It has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries to help promote overall health and well-being. Studies have shown that KSM-66 Ashwagandha can help boost testosterone levels in men. Testosterone is a hormone that plays a vital role in male development and health function. Low testosterone levels can lead to various symptoms, such as decreased libido, fatigue, and depression. Optimal levels of testosterone are essential for maintaining good health and well-being. KSM-66 Ashwagandha works to increase testosterone levels by stimulating the production of luteinizing hormone (LH). LH is a hormone released by the pituitary gland that signals the testes to produce more testosterone. Additionally, KSM-66 Ashwagandha has been found to reduce cortisol levels which can also lead to increased testosterone production. KSM-66 Ashwagandha Can Spike Up Energy Levels Ashwagandha is an ancient medicinal herb used for centuries to help improve energy levels. It is a powerful adaptogen that helps the body cope with stress and fatigue. It also helps to increase the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. This increases oxygen delivery to muscles and other organs, improving energy production and performance. Additionally, Ashwagandha helps reduce inflammation, leading to improved energy levels. [A study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3252722/) aimed to assess the impact of Ashwagandha on energy levels in rats. After being given an ashwagandha root extract for seven days, the rats showed significantly increased endurance and improved motor coordination compared to the control group. These effects were attributed to Ashwagandha's anti-stress and anti-fatigue properties, which enhanced overall vitality. Another study investigated the antioxidant activity of ashwagandha root extracts on muscle fatigue in mice. After administering an aqueous extract of ashwagandha root, researchers found that it was effective at lowering levels of oxidative stress markers and improving physical performance during antipyretic tests. This evidence suggests that ashwagandha root can reduce human fatigue by lowering oxidative stress-related issues such as free radical damage. Ashwagandha Can Help Boost Physical Performance Physical performance is an integral part of overall health and well-being. It can help to improve physical fitness, reduce the risk of injury, and increase energy levels. Physical performance is also linked to mental health, as it can help to reduce stress and anxiety. Ashwagandha stimulates the body's natural production of testosterone and other hormones essential for physical performance. It also helps to reduce inflammation in the body, which can lead to improved recovery time after exercise. [Research published in 2019 in Complementary Therapies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23439798/) in Clinical Practice looked specifically at strength athletes who took either a 600 mg Ashwagandha root extract or a placebo supplement for 8-12 weeks before completing tests to determine their muscle strength and power. The researchers reported that subjects taking Ashwagandha saw significantly more significant muscular strength improvements than those on the placebo supplement. Ashwagandha Supplements Can Offer Stress Relief Ashwagandha is an ancient herb used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to help reduce stress and anxiety. It is a powerful adaptogen that helps the body cope with physical and mental stress. Studies have shown that Ashwagandha can help reduce cortisol levels, hormones associated with stress. It can also help improve mood and cognitive function and reduce inflammation. Stress management is an essential part of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Stress can lead to physical and mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, headaches, fatigue, and insomnia. Ashwagandha can be an excellent tool for managing stress by helping to regulate cortisol levels in the body. Taking ashwagandha supplements regularly can help reduce feelings of stress and anxiety while improving overall well-being. Ashwagandha Supplements Can Help Boost Cognitive Health Ashwagandha is an ancient herb used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to promote physical and mental health. Studies have found that ashwagandha supplementation can improve cognitive performance in healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. [One study found that taking 100mg of Ashwagandha](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6827862/) extract daily for 14 weeks significantly improved working memory compared to a placebo group. Another study found that taking 500 mg of Ashwagandha extract daily for 12 weeks improved verbal learning and memory in adults with mild cognitive impairment. In another study published in the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine, participants took either 500mg or 1000mg per day of ashwagandha extract, revealing that both doses increased several measures of cognitive performance such as subjective mindful awareness and attention accuracy as determined by a Continuous Performance Test (CPT). This test measures certain aspects of cognitive functioning, including reaction time, impulsivity, and response accuracy. Ashwagandha Supplements Can Boost Sleep Quality and Regulate Circadian Rhythm Studies have found that Ashwagandha helps to increase levels of serotonin in the body which can be beneficial for improving sleep patterns. It has been shown to increase the production of melatonin - a hormone responsible for regulating our wake/sleep cycle - leading to a more restful sleep at night. Furthermore, Ashwagandha reduces cortisol levels associated with higher stress levels and poor sleep quality. [A clinical trial published in Phytotherapy Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7096075/) evaluated the effects of Ashwagandha on sleep quality among 90 adults over 60 days. The results showed that those who took 300 mg of ashwagandha root extract twice daily experienced significant improvements in subjective sleep quality compared to those taking placebo pills after eight weeks of the treatment period. KSM-66 Ashwagandha Can Also Boost health Performance Ashwagandha is a powerful herb, historically used in Indian and Chinese medicine as an aphrodisiac and general tonic for life enhancement. It works by increasing testosterone levels, reducing the stress hormone cortisol, improving blood flow, and increasing stamina and energy. All these factors serve to improve health function and performance. Ashwagandha can also help improve the physical strength and endurance needed for health activities by increasing your body's red blood cell count. Increased red blood cell count boosts circulation throughout the body, delivering more oxygen-rich blood and nutrients to your muscles during physical activity - giving you the stamina needed for increased pleasure during intercourse. [A 2010 study published in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6438434/) found that Ashwagandha may help increase testosterone levels in men with infertility. The study participants were administered 900-1200 mg daily for up to three months by mouth. In 2012, another study published in the same journal reported similar results - when given 600-800 mg per day for up to eight weeks orally, the researchers found that Ashwagandha helped significantly improve overall semen quality and sperm count in infertile men.
