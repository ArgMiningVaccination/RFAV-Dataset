The duration and investment required to bring new drugs to wide use are quite prohibitive, and the market price is often beyond the means of large sectors of society. With a track record of drug discovery and deployment that places it as the top of universities without a medical school, the University of Houston is positioned both intellectually and physically to make giant strides towards new, fast and affordable drugs to treat pervasive medical conditions especially in our Houston community and further afield. Our approach is multidisciplinary, bringing together chemistry, biology, biomedicine and pharmacy, and is cognizant of societal acceptance criteria for new medication sources and use.
