The ESP disseminates these reports throughout the VA, and some evidence syntheses inform the clinical guidelines of large professional organizations. QUERI p rovides funding for four ESP Centers and each Center has an active university affiliation. The ESP Centers generate evidence syntheses on important clinical practice topics, and these reports help: develop clinical policies informed by evidence; guide the implementation of effective services to improve patientoutcomes and to support VA clinical practice guidelines and performancemeasures; and set the direction for future research to address gaps in clinical knowledge. In 2009, the ESP Coordinating Center was created to expand the capacity of HSR&D Central Office and the four ESP sites by developing and maintaining program processes. In addition, the Center established a Steering Committee comprised of QUERI field -based investigators , VA Patient Care Services, Office of Quality and Performance, and Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) Clinical Management Officers. The Steering Committee provides program oversight, guides strategic planning, coordinates dissemination activities, and develops collaborat ions with VA leadership to identify new ESP topics of importance to Veterans and the VA healthcare system.

Summary of E vidence by K ey Question....................................................................... 54 iv Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program EXECUTIVE SUMMARY BACKGROUND Maximizing target tumor dose while minimizing healthy tissue damage continues to be a challenge in radiation therapy. Because of its appealing dosimetric characteristics , proton beam therapy (P BT) has held the clinical promise of allowing for higher doses of radiation to be delivered more safely, especially for ocular, skull base, and spinal tumors that require exceptional precision. But the role of protons is less clear for more common tumors, like prostate, where their dosimetric advantages may be diminished and for which intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can now safely deliver optimally high radiation doses. To help consider the increased number of offers from University Affiliates to provide contracted off-site proton irradiation therapy, the VA Radiation Oncology Program requested that the Evidence-based Synthesis Program Coordinating Center (ESP CC) synthesize the most recent literature on the comparative effectiveness of PBT in various cancers. This report of that synthesis focuses on the following questions: How does PBT compare with conventional X- ray-based external beam treatments and state-of- the-art therapies with regard to benefits and harms for both new patients and those who have locally recurrent tumors after irradiation? How do the comparative effects of proton and photon beam therapies differ according to variation in tumor motion? METHODS Our research librarian searched MEDLINE\u00ae (via PubMed\u00ae) , the Cochrane Clinical Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalT rials.gov using the terms \"proton beam\" and \"cancer\" to identify articles relevant to the key questions. We also hand -searched reference lists, consulted experts, requested information from proton therapy system ma nufacturers and centers , and searched ClinicalTrials.gov. We selected studies that compared benefits (survival, quality of life, functional capacity, local tumor control, delivery of planned chemotherapy and radiation regimens) and harms (toxicity and seco ndary malignancies) for PBT versus other modalities in adults with any cancer ty pe (except ocular). We used standardized methods to assess internal validity and the overall strength of evidence for each outcome. RESULTS We reviewed a total of 2,774 citations. From these, we included 25 relevant primary comparative studies and 6 systematic reviews. Requests to manufacturers and proton beam facilities did not identify any additional published or unpublished comparative studies, but only 6 manufacturers affirmed they weren't aware of any additional studies. Most existing systematic reviews are outdated , as their literature searches were conducted prior to the publication of most of the comparative studies. The 2014 review produced by the Institute 1 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER)1 for the Washington State Health Care Authority Health Technology Assessment Pro gram (HTA) included 22 of the 25 comparative studies. The ICER review was useful for its accurate data abstraction, but we couldn't rely on its conclusions. COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS O F PBT (KEY QUESTIONS 1, 2, & 4) Breast There is low -strength evidence of comparable 7 -year cumulative local recurrence for single field PBT versus photon- based 3D conformal accelerated partial -breast irradiation for patients with stage I breast cancer , but various 7-year skin toxicities were more common in the proton therapy group (range, increased from 15-28% to 54-90%). However, there was no difference in patients' ratings of good or excellent for 7- year overall cosmetic outcomes or in local failure rates . This evidence came from one fair -quality prospective trial of 98 patients with stage I breast cancer treated between October 200 3 and April 2006 at Massachusetts General Hospital.2 Esophageal There is low -strength evidence that , when used in trimodal therapy followed by surgical resection ), IMRT and proton an d proton beam have comparable risk of GI complications (OR: 2.31; CI: 0.69-7.74; 28.4% vs 18.1), CRT has a higher risk than proton there is lo w-strength evidence that proton therapy is associated with a higher risk of acute pneumonitis compared with IMRT/3D- CRT PBT GyE and photon therapy 52.9 Gy have comparable 2-year overall and progression-free survival, proportion of patients with treatment breaks, and locoregional failure, but some 1 -month toxicities were less common in the proton beam therapy group, including medical management of esophagitis (5% vs 57%; P<.001), > 5% 2 nausea/vomiting (26% vs 71%; P=.004). This evidence came from a fair -quality retrospective cohort study of 40 adults with medulloblastoma treated at the MD Anderson Cancer Center from 2003 to 2011. 3 Non-small cell lung cancer In patients with locally -advanced NSCLC, t here is low -strength evidence that, even at a higher dose (74 Gy), acute risk of severe esophagitis (grade 3) at 6 months for PBT is sim ilar to 3D - CRT 63 Gy, but lower than with IMRT 63 Gy (6% vs 28%; P<.0001).4 This evidence came from one cohort study of 652 patients with NSCLC, mostly clinical sta ge IIIA -B and mean age of 66 years, who were treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2000 and 2008. Evidence on survival and 15-17 month toxicity in a subgroup of those patients given concurrent chemotherapy was insufficient to draw conclusions. There is also insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about proton- based stereotactic ablative therapy for early -stage lung cancer compared with photon- based stereotactic ablative therapy. 2 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Prostate Table 1 summarizes the numbers and types of comparative studies and our conclusions for each different comparison of PBT to IMRT, 3D-CRT, brachytherapy, and conventional photon therapy, respectively. Table 1. Conclusions for Comparative S tudies in P rostate C ancer Comparator Benefits (Strength of Evidence Grade) Harms (Strength of Evidence Grade) PBT vs IMRT Similar Quality of Life (QOL) (low SOE): 2 historically -controlled cohorts (N=1695):5,6 Transiently lower GU toxicity at 0 - 6 months for PBT (low SOE),7 but similar GI and GU toxicity at 12 -24 months (low to moderate),7,8 and increased GI toxicity with PBT at 4 - 5 years (low SOE): 4 retrospective cohorts 8-10 N=34,185 PBT vs 3D -CRT Similar QOL (insufficient 3D -CRT remains unknown: 1 historically-controlled cohort5; N=218 Increased acute retrospective cohort9; N=NR PBT vs survival and (l ow SOE): 1 historically - controlled cohort11; N=282 No evidence PBT+photon vs photon alone Similar overall 5 -8 year survival and QOL (low SOE): (1 RCT, 2 cohort studies; N=567) 12-14 8 and (low SOE): 1 RCT14; N=202 Spinal cord glioma There is low -strength evidence that use of PBT may be disadvantageous for highly infiltrative tumors such as intermedullary spinal cord gliomas, as demonstrated by a reduced chance of 5- year overall survival (photon vs proton, aHR : 55.82; 95% CI: 1.34-2316.8).15 This conclusion is based on one retrospective cohort study of 32 patients treated for intramedullary gliom as at Massachusetts General Hospital with either PBT (N=10) or IMRT (N=22) at an average dose of 51 Gy in 1.8 median daily fractions over 29 treatments. Mixed cancer types - secondary malignancies There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about how PBT compares to other radiation modalities in the risk of secondary malignancy. While secondary cancer risk for PBT patients was half that of photon patients in a retrospective cohort of patients with a variety of non- metastatic cancer s, this study had numerous methodological limitations . 16 Other cancer t ypes Although we found comparative studies in giant cell tumors of the bone, head and neck cancer, uveal hemangiomas, and meningiomas, they provided insufficient evidence for drawing conclusions. 3 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program KEY QUESTION 3: PATIENTS WITH LOCAL RECURRENCES There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the comparative effects of PBT versus other radiation modalities among patients with recurrent tumors. We identified 2 comparative studies on recurrent tumors, one among patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors 17 and one among patients with recurrent liver cancer,18 but both studies were rated poor quality due to their failure to account for potentially important confounding. KEY QUESTION 4A: EFF ECTS OF TUMOR MOTION V ARIABILITY There is insufficient evidence to determine how the comparative effects of proton and photon beam therapies differ according to variation in tumor motion. Although dosimetric studies comparing methods of accounting for respiratory motion in treatment planning report that 4-dimensional computed tomography ( 4DCT ) imaging decreases doses to 19 free-breathing,20 or 3-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT ) imaging,21 how this translates to clinical outcomes is not clear. We did not identify any studies that evaluated clinical outcomes of interest based on variability in tumor motion, imaging and planning methods used to account for respiratory motion, or quality assurance standards. DISCUSSION For the cancer sites and types reviewed here, there are no reliable data from long- term randomized trials on survival, quality of life, or functional capacity of patients who underwent PBT compared with any other modality. We could not fully assess the overall net health benefit of proton beam therapy versus its comparators because comparative observational studies did not consistently report many outcomes of greatest interest. Comparative risk of secondary malignancies was only evaluated by one poor-quality retrospective cohort study of non-metastatic cancer patients treated with PBT or photon moda lities for a variety of cancers . 16 Ability to deliver planned treatments was only reported by one small retrospective cohort study.3 No studies r eported functional capacity outcomes or overall severe late toxicity. Table 2 summarizes the k ey findings on comparative benefits and harms that are supported by low- strength evidence. Although we found comparative studies in giant cell tumors , head and ne ck cancer, uveal hemangiomas, and meningiomas, they provided insufficient evidence for drawing conclusions. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the comparative effects of PBT versus other radiation modalities among patients with recurrent tumors or how the comparative effects of proton and photon beam therapies differ according to variation in tumor motion. 4 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Table 2.

The main limitations of the comparative studies were that they (1) were retrospective and some used historical control groups for the photon- based comparator groups, (2) potentially gave proton beam groups an unfair advantage by comparing them to photon- based groups with poorer prognostic profiles without accounting for the important differences, (3) lacked data on radiation dose and field size, (4) could not reliably differentiate toxicity grade, (5) did not measure many outcomes of greatest interest, inclu ding recurrence, ability to deliver planned chemotherapy and radiation regimens, functional capacity, overall severe late toxicity, and secondary malignancies , and (6) may have limited applicability to current practices and across all 14 available facilities , since they mainly came from only 3 proton facilities and involved patients treated between 1991 and 2003. The biggest gaps in evidence include the lack of assessment of many important outcomes including recurrence, ability to deliver planned chemotherapy and radiation regimens, functional capacity, overall severe late toxicity, and secondary malignancies. Also, although there are many studies that have compared the dosimetric impact between different methods of accounting for tumor motion in treatment p lanning, including 4DCT imaging, multiphase, free- breathing, or 3DCT imaging, we found no studies of how they compare in clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION Despite the common claim that the advantage of proton beam therapy is self -evident, comparative studies h ave not demonstrated any common clinical situations in which proton beam therapy has an important clinical advantage over photon radiotherapy modalities on meaningful long- term health outcomes, but have uncovered low- strength evidence of the potential for increased late toxicity compared with IMRT and 3D -CRT for breast, esophageal, prostate, and spinal cord glioma cancers. Existing comparative studies have numerous methodological deficiencies that limited our confidence in their findings, and their findings may h ave limited applicability across all US proton beam facilities. Although numerous randomized controlled trials are underway that carry the promise of improved toxicity measurement , it is unclear 6 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program whether they will fully address gaps in evidence on other important outcomes including recurrence, ability to deliver planned chemotherapy and radiation regimens, functional capacity, overall severe late toxicity, and secondary malignancies. Because this is still a rapidly evolving field, with ongoing efforts to improve techniques and reduce costs, this review may need frequent updating to keep up- to-date with emerging research. 7 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program ASTRO BCBS CER CI Androgen deprivation therapy Adjusted hazard ratio Agency for Health Research and Quality Accelerated partial breast irradiation Adjusted odds ratio A Measurement Tool to A ssess S ystematic R eviews The American Society for Radiation Oncology Blue Cross Blue Shield Comparative effectiveness research Confidence interval CGE Cobalt gray equivalent CNS Central nervous system Computed tomography CTAF ECRI California Technology Assessment Forum Emergency Care Research Institute EPIC Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite ESP CC Evidence -based Synthesis Program Coordinating Center FDA Food and Dru g Administration FDG Fluorodeoxyglucose GI GRADE Gastrointestinal Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation GU Genitourinary Gy Gray GyE HR HTA Gray equivalent Hazard ratio Health Technology Assessment Program ICER Institute for Clinical and Economic Review IMRT Intensity -modulated radiation therapy NICE NSD NR National Institute for Health and Care Excellence No significant difference Not reported NRC Nuclear Regulatory Commission NSCLC OR Non-small cell lung cancer Odds ratio PBT Proton Beam Therapy PCSI Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices 8 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program PET Positron emission tomography PROST -QA Prostate Cancer Outcomes and Satisfaction with Treatment Quality Assessment PSA Prostate -specific antigen QOL QUERI Quality of life Quality Enhancement Research Initiative RBE RCT RR Relative biological effectiveness Randomized control trial Relative risk SBRT Stereotactic body radiotherapy SEER Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SOE Strength of evidence TEC UA Technology Evaluatio n Center University Affiliates VA TAP Veterans Affairs Technology Assessment Program VHA Veterans Health Administration 9 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program EVIDENCE REPORT INTRODUCTION The Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) current policy on proton therapy is that it \"will not be deemed appropriate as routine therapy for organ -confined adenocarcinoma of the prostate.\" According to a May 2012 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Memorandum on the appropriate use of proton beam therapy for radiation therapy treatment, the reason for this is that although \"it has become clear that proton therapy improves the safety of radiation delivery to tumors requiring exceptionally precise treatment ,\" such as ocular melanomas, sacral and base of skull chordomas, and para-spinal primitive neuroectode rmal tumors, \"less certain are the advantages of proton therapy for tumors which can be treated successfully with photon therapy or other treatment modalities, such as by resection.\" However, the VHA continues to evaluate the possibility of contracting with University Affiliates (UA) to provide proton irradiation as part of off-site radiation therapy care. To help inform their decision to support or not support a proton therapy center for Veterans, the VHA is interested in whether any evidence has emerged that identifies any additional tumor sites and presentations as candidates for improved outcomes following proton irradiation. Therefore, the VHA National R adiation Oncology Program Office (10P4H) requested that the VA Evidence- based Synthesis Program Coordinating Center (ESP CC) conduct an evidence review to examine the benefits and harms of proton irradiation treatment compared to other available conventional and state-of-the- art radiation treatment modalities for a variety of cancer types. BACKGROUND Radi ation therapy harms both malignant and healthy tissues and higher absorbed radiation dose increases cellular damage. Administering sufficient radiation to the target tumor while sparing adjacent healthy tissue continues to be a challenge in radiation therapy. For external beam radiotherapy, maximizing the dose to the target tumor and minimizing healthy tissue damage is achieved by (1) delivering beams of radiation via paths that spare critical and vulnerable tissues, (2) using multiple beams that intersect at the tumor site, avoiding undue exposure in other tissue, and (3) delivering radiation in smaller doses over successive sessions allowing healthy tissue to recover between treatments. 22 The most common radiotherapy options use these methods to varying degrees. Several forms of radiotherapy modalities are available, which va ry in the type of beams used and their delivery methods. Brachytherapy is a form of internal radiation that involves implanting encapsulated radioactive sources within or adjacent to tumors. These sources deposit beta radiation or alpha particles in immediately neighboring tissue and so deliver very little radiation to healthy tissues. However, brachytherapy has very specific indications and is not used for many cancers. 23Among the many types of external radiotherapy modalities available, photon beams are still the most widely used, including 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D- CRT), intensity -modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and tomotherapy. Since the peak dose of radiation from a photon beam is deposited near the entrance to tissue, different methods of delivering photon beams have been developed to maximize the dose to the target tumor and minimize the dose to healthy tissues. IMRT is one of the most advanced methods of delivering 10 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program high-dose radiation with photons. IMRT reduces radiation to normal tissue by splitting the overall dose across multiple fields of small volumes coming from different directions that are custom tailored to each unique tumor shape. Other advances in IMRT include image-guided radiation therapy, which may improve the precision of dose delivery, and volumetric modulated arc therapy, which reduces the time needed to deliver each treatment. Less widely used are heavier particle beams, such as pro tons and carbon ions. Currently only proton beam therapy (PBT) has been cleared by t he US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the US. Compared to photons, protons have inherently different energy distribution patterns that can potentially spare more healthy tissue in front of and behind the tumor target. Tissue in the proton bea m's path to the target tumor receives a small radiation dose, tissue surrounding the target receives even less radiation, and the maximum dose of radiation can be directed to the tumor target. 24,25 Because of its theoretical dosimet ric advantages, proton therapy has held the clinical promise of allowing for higher doses of radiation to be delivered more safely. Howev er, protons' exit dose advantage has been shown to deteriorate with increased beam path distances. 26 Therefore, there may be less opportunity for proton beam therapy to improve clinical outcomes for deep- seated tumors, like prostate, for which IMRT can now safely deliver optimally high radiation doses. Further, compared to photon radiation, dose delivery in PBT is more sensitive to tissue density and heterogeneity. 25,26 Because of this sensitivity, organ motion can have a greater impact on PBT dose delivery compared with photon radiation.26 Published coverage policies consider PBT medically necessary only for cancers requiring exceptional precision in dose delivery (see Appendix A ). The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) supports the use of PBT for ocular tu mors, tumors that approach or are located at the base of the skull, certain tumors of the spine, primary hepatocellular cancer treated in a hypofractionated regimen, solid tumors in children treated with curative intent, and in patients with genetic syndromes for whom minimizing the total volume of radiation is crucial. 27 For prostate cancer, ASTRO recommends \"Proton beam therapy for primary treatment... should only be performed within the context of a prospective clinical trial or re gistry.\"27 With the exception of hepatocellular cancer, which is not explicitly covered by other organizations, other coverage policies generally agree with ASTRO's conclusions. PBT for ocular, skull- base, and pediatric tumors is usually considered medically necessary , while PBT for more common cancers, such as lung cancer and prostate cancer, is usually considered not medically necessary and therefore is not covered. Even so, treatment of common cancers with PBT is widespread. In a study of Medicare patients receiving proton beam therapy between 2006 and 2009, the most common diagnosis on Medicare claims was prostate cancer (69.9%), followed by lung (7.1%), eye (6.6%), and other or unknown conditions including leukemia, lymphoma, skin, and unspecified sites (6.5%). 28 In 1988, the FDA granted 510(k) marketing clearance to the PBT center and system at the Loma Linda University Proton Beam Therapy System (K872369). Currently, 6 manufacturers produce proton therapy systems that have received marketing clearance under the 510(k) process: Hitachi, Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Inc., IBA Inc., Varian Medical Systems Inc., Sumitomo Inc., and Mevion Medic al Systems, Inc. Proton therapy accelerators that are designed and built on -site are not subject to FDA premarket approval processes. 24 11 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program According to the National Association of Proton Therapy, there are 14 PBT centers in operation in the United States with 10 additional centers under construction (http://proton-therapy.org/map.htm). Facility components vary, but are typically customized, multi-room buildings that must include an accelerator and required shielding, treatment rooms (gantry- or fixed -beam), pati ent alignment and digital imaging equipment, and treatment-planning rooms with computerized control units. 24 Multi -room proton beam facilities can cost between 100 and 225 million dollars to construct and equip and between 15 and 25 million dollars annually to maintain. 24 Similarly, the treatment itself remains costly compared with other radiation therapy modalities. Among Medicare patients treated for prostate cancer in 2008 and 2009, the median amount reimbursed by Medicare for PBT was $32,428 while the median amount reimbursed for matched IMRT patients was $18,575. 7 As with other external beam radiation therapies, t reatment typically occurs once daily for 5 days, up to 8 weeks , and patients attend pretreatment planning sessions to confirm tumor location and plan for patient immobilization, including designing body casts, bite-molds, and masks.24 Additional expenses associated with PBT is the creation of individual brass aper tures for each beam, requiring special facilities and personnel. Two types of rooms are used in treatment: gantry -beam rooms rotate the beam around the patients, and fixed- beam rooms direct the beam horizontally. The patient is first positioned in the treatment room and then the proton beam is delivered to the target tumor. Each treatment session lasts a half -hour to a hour, with most of this time devoted to patient positioning. 24 Because of the limited number of proton beam centers and therefore reduced avai lability of PBT compared with other modalities, travel and treatment delay may be a burden for patients. Recently, manufacturers have started developing smaller proton beam radiation therapy systems in the hopes of reducing some of the initial costs of implementing PBT. 24,26 Some argue that more affordable PBT systems will deescalate the debate on the use of PBT for mor e common cancers and lead to more individualized treatment using a combination of treatment modalities.26 The development and utilization of more precise proton beam delivery methods, such as pencil-beam scann ing technology, may also lead to better clinical outcomes compared to photon modalities. 12 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program METHODS TOPIC DEVELOPMENT The following key questions guiding this systematic review were developed after a topic refinement process that included a review of published peer -reveiwed litera ture and consultation with the technical expert panel, operational partners, and experts in the field: KQ1: What is the effectiveness of proton beam irradiation compared to conventional X- ray- based external beam modalities? KQ2: What is the effectiveness of proton beam irradiation compared to state-of-the- art therapies? KQ3 : In patients with local recurrences after irradiation, what is the effectiveness of proton beam irradiation compared to conventional X- ray-based external beam modalities and state -of-the- art therapies? KQ4 : What are the short - and long-term harms of proton beam irradiation compared to conventional X- ray-based external beam modalities and state- of-the- art therapies? KQ4A: What are the harms of proton beam irradiation compared to photon- based therapies in treating mobile targets that may move during treatment? We selected studies that compared benefits (survival, quality of life, functional capacity, local tumor control, delivery of planned chemotherapy and radiation regimens) and harms (toxicity and secondary malignancies) for PBT versus other radiation modalities in adults with any cancer type, with the exception of ocular cancer. SEARCH S TRATEGY To identify articles relevant to the key questions, our research librarian searched MEDLINE\u00ae (via PubMed\u00ae), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalT rials.gov using the terms \"proton beam\" and \"cancer\" (see Appendix C for complete search strategies). Additional citations were identified from hand searc hing reference lists and consultation with content experts. We limited the search to published and indexed articles involving human subjects and available in the English language. To identify additional published, unpublished and ongoing studies, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov , and requested information from and searched the websites of manufacturers and proton therapy centers. Formal Requests for Scientific Information were sent to manufacturers of proton therapy systems (Hitachi, IBA, Mevion Medical Syste ms, Mitsubishi Electric, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, and Varian Medical Systems) and proton beam therapy centers located at Loma Linda University Medical Center, University of California San Francisco Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Indi ana University Health Center, University of Florida, ProCure Proton Therapy Centers (Oklahoma City, New Jersey, and Seattle), University of Pennsylvania, CDH Proton Center, Hampton University, Washington University School of Medicine, Scripps Proton Therapy Center, and ProTom International . All ciations were imported into an electornic database (EndNote X). 13 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program STUDY S ELECTION We selected studies that compared benefits (survival, quality of life, functional capacity, local tumor control, delivery of planned chemotherapy and radiation regimens) and harms (toxicity and secondary malignancies) for PBT versus other radiation modalities in a dults with any cancer type ( except ocular ). In studies with a comparison to brachytherapy, soreness, bruising and surgical complications were also considered. Titles, abstracts, and full -text articles were reviewed by one investigator then checked by another. All disagreements were resolved by consensus. We first reviewed titles and abstracts for potential inclusion, then reviewed relevant full-text articles. Articles meeting eligibility criteria were included for data abstraction. DATA A BSTRACTION We evaluated the following information from each study: study site, years of recruitment, sample size, patient demographic information, proton and photon treatment protocols, follow-up time, and outcomes assessed including benefits and harms. We checked the accuracy of data abstraction for these elements from the 2014 review produced by ICER for the Washington State Health Care Authority Health Technology Assessment Program (HTA) . 1 We found their abstraction to be reliable for these elements, so we only abstracted data from studies that were not alread y included in the ICER review. All data abstraction was first completed by one reviewer and then checked by another. QUALITY A SSESSMENT We used the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool29 to rate the internal validity of included RCTs based on adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, assessment of incomplete data, outcome reporting bias, and other sources of bias . We used the methods from the Drug Effectiveness Review Project to asses s the quality of observational studies. 30 Additionally, w e used AMSTAR to assess the quality of included systematic reviews .31 All internal validity ratings were first completed by one reviewer and then checked by another. All disagr eements were resolved by consensus. RATING THE BODY OF E VIDENCE We rated the overall strength of evidence about each outcome based on the guidance established for the Evidence-b ased Practice Center Program of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( AHRQ). 32 This method considers the internal validity, directness of comparison, consistency of effect, precision of estimate, and reporting bias across the studies relevant to that outcome. We assign ed the following evidence grades: High: We are very confident that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effect for this outcomes. Moderate: We are moderately confiden t that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effects for this outcome. Low: We have limited confidence that the estimate of effect lies close to the true effects for this outcome. 14 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Insufficient: We have no evidence, we are unable to estimate an effect, or we have no confidence in the estimate of effect for this outcome. DATA S YNTHESIS We qualitatively synthesized the body of literature for each key question after abstracting relevant data and producing strength of evidence tables. We did not conduct meta -analyses because few studies reported on outcomes of interest and the studies were methodological ly heterogen eous. PEER REVIEW Eight invited peer reviewers provided comments on the draft version of this systematic review. See Appendix I for the peer r eview disposition table. 15 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program RESULTS RESULTS OF SEARCH AND STUDY SELECTION Figure 1 provides the results of the study selection process. We identified 3,052 titles and abstracts from the database search and 352 additional references through manual searching, suggestions from content experts, or from requests for s cientific information. We reviewed 334 full-text articles and included 51 articl es in our synthesis. Scientific information requests to proton therapy system manufacturers and representatives of proton beam therapy centers resulted in submissions from IBA, Sumitomo, Varian, University of Pennsylvania, the Proton Therapy Consortium, and the Proton Collaborative Group. None identif ied any primary comparative studies that we did not also identify through our own searching , but they did provide extensive information on ongoing studies and identified a recent systematic review completed by ICER on proton beam therapy for various cancers. 1 Our searching of ClinicalT rials.gov did not identify any additional published or unpublished completed comparative studies, but our review of abstracts from the 2014 PTCOG- NA conference identified one unpublished comparative study of 25 patients with head and neck cancer treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center that we briefly discuss in the head and neck cancer section. Nine ongoing RCTs were identified via requests for scientific information and ClinicalTrials.gov (see Appendi x F). Comparators to lung (NSCLC), prostate cancer, meningioma, glioblastoma, esophageal cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer patients. These ongoing studies are being conducted at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital , and the University of Pennsylvania, as well as other centers in the US and abroad. 16 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Figure 1.

Table 1 shows which comparators were evaluated for different cancer sites. IMRT was the comparator in 12 studies4-10,15,33-36, including 6 observational studies in prostate cancer patients.5-10 Other comparators were 3D- and combination of proton plus photon radiation compared to either photon alone (5 studies)12-14,39,40 or to brachytherapy (1 studies).11 Table 1 provides a detailed listing of all 2 5 comparative studies. 0 articles addressing KQ4A 3,052 records identified through database searching 1,964 from PubMed\u00ae on 12/10/14 111 from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on 12/10/14 50 from ClinicalTrials.gov on 12/10/14 927 from journals specific to cancer and medical physics on 12/10/14 2,774 records screened for eligibility after removal of duplicates 17 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Most comparative studies were either retrospective cohorts (1 7 studies)3,7-10,12,15-18,33,35-40 or cohort studies including a historical control (3 studies).4,11,34 Additionally, we identified one randomized controlled trial,14 2 controlled before/after studies,5,6 one prospective cohort study,13 and one prospective phase 1 nonrandomized trial.2 We rated the majority of studies as poor quality (14 studies)3,5,6,12,15-18,34,35,37-40 and the remainder as fair quality (1 1 studies).2,4,7-11,13,14,33,36 The mai n quality concerns were failing to adequately adjust for potential confounders and potentially biasing selection by comparing outcomes from PBT patients with historical results (see Appendix E for complete quality ass essments of included comparative studies). 18 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Table 1.

We identified numerous reviews conducted on proton beam therapy in the past 5 years.1,24,41-54 Table 2 briefly summarizes their s cope and relevant conclusions. However, m any existing reviews had limited usefulness because they (1) were outdated as their literature searches were conducted prior to the publication of most of the comparative studies ,45,46,48,52 (2) were noncompara tive,41,42,47 or (3) did not review full- text articles of primary studies.24,43,44 The 2014 review by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER)1 is the most comprehensive, including 22 of the 25 comparative studies we identified. Although we had hoped to rely on the ICER review findings, we undertook our own analysis of the primary data because our conclusions differed from ICER's as discussed below. For the other systematic reviews identified , we assessed their internal validity (Appendix G) and included findings from those that included a majority of comparative studies 1,53,54 or conducted indirect meta -analyses.49-51 20 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Table 2.

The ICER review proved useful for its accurate data abstraction, but we couldn't rely on it for quality assessment or conclusions. Our conclusions often differed from ICER's (Table 3) and ICER provided insufficient details to verify how they reached their conclusions. There is no clear pattern to the discrepancies between our conclusions and ICER's . For CNS, lung, and prostate cancers, we drew separate conclusions for each comparison of PBT to IMRT, 3D- CRT, conventional photon, etc etera, respectively, whereas ICER's conclusions merged data from various comparisons despite dissimilar findings. Our strength of evidence ratings were higher than ICER's for esophageal cancer and lower for both liver cancer and uveal hemangiomas. 24 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Cancer t ype Comparison Comparative studies Findings of comparative studies ICER conclusions ESP comments on ICER's Conclusions Breast APBI: Single - field PB T vs 3D CRT 1 fair -quality prospective phase 1 nonrandomized trial (N=98): Galland- Girodet et al 2014 Benef 7 -yr mod dyspigmentation and patchy/marked atrophy, but similar fat necrosis, fibrosis, breast pain, rib fracture N/A - not included because published after ICER's search end date N/A CNS: Medulloblast oma PBT vs conventional photon 1 poor retrospective cohort (N=40): Brown et al 2013 Benefits: NSD in 2 -yr overall and progress- free survival and locoregional failure Harms: Lower medical management of esophagitis Overall incremental net benefit wi th PBT: equal benefits (low SOE), lower harms (low SOE) Overgeneralization, conclusion applies to medulloblastoma, but not spinal cord glioma CNS: Spinal cord glioma PBT vs IMRT 1 poor cohort (N=32): Kahn et al 2011 Benefits: Incre or 3D- CRT 2 fair -quality retrospective cohorts (N=519): McCurdy et al 2013, Wang et al 2013 Benefits: Not analyzed Harms: Pneumonitis: Worse for mplications: PBT less than 3D-CRT and similar to IMRT Evidence is inadequate to draw conclusions Disagree that evidence is inadequate Liver PBT vs conventional photon 1 poor -quality retrospectiv e cohort (N=8): Otsuka et al 2003 Benefits: similar survival Harms: Not reported Equal benefits (low SOE), equal harms (low SOE) Disagree : evidence is insufficient because serious imprecision (N=8), poor quality, unknown consistency Table 3 .

What is the effectiveness of p roton beam irradiation compared to state-of -the-art t herapies? What are the s hort- and long-term harms of p roton beam i rradiation compared to conventional x-ray-based externa l beam modalities and state-of -the-art therapies? OVERALL We could not fully assess the overall net health benefit of proton beam therapy versus its comparators because comparative observational studies did not consistently report many outcomes of greatest interest. No studies reported functional capacity outcomes or overall severe late toxicity. No prospective comparative studies reported secondary malignancies. Ability to deliver planned treatments was only reported by one small retrospective cohort study. 3 BREAST C ANCER One small , nonrandomized trial of PBT versus photon- 3 -dimensional conformal accelerated partial -breast irradiation provided low-strength evidence of comparable 7 -year cumulative local recurrence rates, and higher rates of some 7 -year skin toxicities, including moderate/severe dyspigmentation and patchy/marked atrophy.2 This trial was fracture. and 7- year self -reported cosmetic outcomes did not differ (Table 4). Treatment was administered twice daily over 4 consecutive days at a dose of 32 Gy in 8 fractions. In the proton beam group, only one field was treated per fraction using the passive double scattering system. Patients' median age was 61 years. The type of breast cancer was invasive ductal carcinoma (92%), tubular (5%), or mucinous (3%), and median tumor size was 0.9 cm. The tumor grade was 1 in 47% of patients, 2 in 42%, and 3 in 10%. Breast cancer cells tested negative for estrogen receptors in 11% of patients, progesterone receptors in 20%, and were triple -negative in 10%. Authors suggested that their inferior cosmetic results of PBT may have been due to their use of only a single field per fraction, which may have resulted in a greater entry/skin dose. They recommend that use of multiple beam scattering or a scanning -beam technique may better minimize skin toxicity. In fact, there were no cases of grade 3 or higher skin toxicity at 5 years in a series of 100 patients at Loma Linda when proton beam therapy at was delivered at 40 Gy in 10 fractions, once daily over 2 weeks, using multiple fields. 55 With the advent of intensity -modulated proton therapy (IMPT) , it ma y now be more feasible to expand the role of PBT beyond partial breast irradiation. However, we found no studies of IMPT for whole breast or nodal irradiation. It will be important to consider whether IMPT can improve on the 7.4%-per-gray rate for major coronary events within the first 5 years observed in a population- based case-control study of 2168 women who underwent external radiotherapy for breast cancer between 1958 and 2001 in Sweden and Denmark. 56 28 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Table 4 .

One is a retrospective cohort study that compared PBT to conventional photon therapy in 40 adults with medulloblastoma from the MD A nderson Cancer Center in Texas.3 The other is a retrospective cohort study that compared PBT to intensity -modulat ed radiation therapy ( IMRT ) in 32 patients treated for intramedullary gliomas at Massachusetts General Hospital.15 Based on these 2 studies, the ICER review conclud ed that there is low -strength evidence that proton beam therapy has an incremental net benefit in the form of decreased harms. We agree with ICER's conclusion as specifically related to medulloblastoma and only for acute toxicity, but not for intramedullar y gliomas. Medull oblastoma: Proton v ersu s conventional photon One poor-quality retrospective cohort study of 40 adults with medulloblastoma provided low-strength evidence that PBT 54.6 GyE and photon therapy 52.9 Gy have comparable benefits, but proton bea m therapy was associated with reduced acute toxicity (Table 5 ). 3 Long -term toxicity was not reported. 29 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Table 5 .

The main limitation of this study is that patients in the proton beam group had more favorable prognostic factors, such as lower age (14 years compared with 44 years) a nd a higher rate of partial resection (70% compared with 55%). However, after adjustment for age and pathology, proton beam- treated patients were more likely to die within 5 years (adjusted hazard ratio, 55.82; 95% CI: 1.34-2316.8). Local recurrence occurred in 20% of beam-treated patients and 23% in those treated with IMRT, but interpretation of this result is limited by the lack of multivariate analysis. Table 6 .

But evidence on benefits and long- term toxicity is still needed to adequately assess net health benefit of proton beam. Detailed analysis Radiation modality (50.4 Gy of PBT, IMRT, or 3D-CRT) was associated with variation in 30- day post-operative complications when it was a component of trimodal therapy comprised of neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgical resection . There is low- strength evidence that IMRT and proton beam have comparable risk of postoperative pulmonary complications (OR 2.23; 95% 3D-CRT and proton beam complications (OR 2.31; 95% CI: 0.69-7.74; 28.4% vs 18.1), but that 3D-CRT has a higher risk than proton beam of pulmonary complications (OR : 9.13; 95% CI: 1.83-45.42; 30.3% vs 13.9% ). 36 The second study evaluated the role of lung lobes in radiation pneumonitis in 75 patients who received restaging [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging 1 to 3 months after chemoradiation involving 50.4 Gy of either PB T, IMRT or 3D -CRT. 33 This study provides low-strength evidence that proton therapy is associated with a hi gher risk of acute pneumonitis compared with and 3D- CRT in E sophageal C ancer 31 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Strength of evidence : Low for all outcomes Findings Acute Pneumonitis No. Studies (N): 1 retrospective cohort (N=75) Study Directness: Unknown T UMOR OF THE BONE Combined PBT+photons versus photons alone We identified one poor- quality retrospective comparative cohort that evaluated the clinical effectiveness of combination proton and photon treatment versus photon- only treatment in g iant cell tumor of bone. ICER was the only systematic review to include this study and they determined that there was insufficient evidence to make a conclusion regarding PBT for giant cell tumor of bone. We agree with their conclusion. In this study, patients were treated with PBT+photons (N=6; mean: 59 GyE) or photons alone (N=14; mean: 52 Gy) with a median duration of follow up of 9.3 y ears.39 Thirteen patients also rec eived partial tumor resection. In this study, the 10-year lack of progression rate was 17% for the PBT+photons patients and 14% amon g the photons only patients (P=.88). No harms were reported in this study. This study did not control for differences between groups including age (median: 23.5 years for PBT+photons patients; 52.5 years for photons only patients). Further, it is unclear how patients were selected for the PBT+photons group or the photons alone group (see Appendix E for c omplete quality assessment). Table 8 .

The indirect meta -analyses of non-comparative studies also provide insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about proton beam in head and neck cancers due to unacceptably high methodological limitations. Detailed analysis PBT v ersus evidence One small (N=6) poor- quality retrosp ective cohort 35 provided insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about PBT and IMRT for cancers of the head and neck. In the cohort study, when radiation therapy was given following endoscopic resection of malignant clival tumors, overall survival was 100% in the proton group after 8 months and 67% in the IMRT group after 16-24 months. 35 However, we have no confidence in these findings because the study was extremely small with many limitations (such as no baseline demographic information on patients by treatment group) , and while the comparison was direct, consistency was unknown and the survival estimates were imprecise. We also identified a PTCOG -NA 2014 conference proceeding of a new comparative study including 25 patients with major salivary gland cancer or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastases. These patients were treated at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the results suggest the potential for reduced acute toxicity with PBT v ersus IMRT, but we could not assess the strength of the evidence beacause the abstract did not provide sufficient detai l to adequately address internal validity . 57 Indirect evidence The meta- analyses of non -comparative studies also provide insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about proton beam in head and neck cancers due to unacceptably high methodological limitations. Both meta -analyses used similar statistical methods, but the more recent one is more comprehensive since it includes more studies. 51 Patel et al made indirect comparisons between pooled event rates from uncontrolled studies of PBT (including 1-8 cohorts) and uncontrolled studies of IMRT (including 2-8 cohorts) for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity malignancies. 51 They found no difference in overall survival at longest follow-up, 5-year overall survival, disease-free survival at longest follow-up, and 5- year locoregional control, but found improved disease -free survival at 5 years (RR: 1.44; 1.05-1.51) in the proton therapy group. Harms were pooled across all charged particle therapy cohorts, so PBT-specific harms could not be compared with those after photon modalities. However, we have serious concerns about the methods t hat Patel et al used for indirect comparison. Because there are no common control groups in the uncontrolled studies, it is impossible to verify the 33 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program underlying prognostic comparability between the PBT and IMRT populations. But, at minimum, there does appea r to be the potential for temporal and location confounding. For example, the analysis of 5 -year disease-free survival included one study of 36 patients from Mass achusetts General Hospital treated between 1991 and 2001 for proton therapy and 3 studies of 187 total patients, mostly from Belgium treated between 1998 and 2009 for IMRT. Table 9 . SOE for Comparative B enefits of Malignancies UVEAL HEMANGIOMA One poor- quality retrospective cohort provides comparative evidence on the benefits and harms of radiation treatment with protons or photons in uveal hemangiomas. Based on this study, the ICER review concluded that there was low -strength evidence suggesting that PBT has comparable benefits and harms compared with other treatment modali ties for uveal hemangiomas. We disagree, and conclude that this study provides insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about PBT compared with photons fo r the treatment of uveal hemangioma. In this study, patients were treated 20-22.5 CGE) or photons (N=19; 16-30 Gy) between 1993 and 2002 at the Charite Campus Benjamin Franklin center in Berlin and followed up for a median of 27.7 months. There was no statistically significant difference between radiation modality on sta bilization of v or retinopathy (P=.098). 38 There were no significant differences in treatment side effects between treatment groups. Grade 3 side effects occurred in 2 patients in each treatment group (P=.7718) and G rade 4 side effects occurred in one patient in the PBT group (P= .3789). While baseline uveal hemangioma thickness was different between the 2 groups, it is not clear that this would affect prognosis.

LUNG CANCER Summary Compar ative evidence on the use of PBT versus IMRT,4,34 3D-CRT,4,34 SBRT,50 or conventional radiotherapy50 in non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients comes from 2 historically - controlled cohort studies4,34 and one meta- analysis that compared pooled event rates from case series of CRT, SBRT and PBT.50 Base d on the historically controlled cohort studies,4,34 the ICER review concluded that \"Moderate evidence suggests that rates of treatment- related toxicities with PBT are comparable to those seen with other radiation modalities in patients with lung cancer.\" We disagree, and conclude that for locally advanced NSCLC these studies provide low- strength evidence that, even at a higher dose, PBT's risk of 6-month severe esophagitis is lower than IMRT and similar to 3D -CRT. However, there is insufficient evidence on survival and 15- to 17- month toxicity when given with concurrent chemotherapy . Comparability of late toxicity is unknown. For early stage NSCLC, due to unacceptable methodological limitations, the indirect meta -analysis provides insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the comparison of PBT with SBRT or conventional radiotherapy. 50 Detailed analysis Proton- based abla tive RT versus photon- based ablative RT early stage NSCLC The indirect meta -analysis by Grutters et al provides insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the comparison of proton beam versus stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or conventional radiotherapy (CRT) for to methodological limitations which are described below.50 Grutters et al made indirect comparisons between adjusted pooled event rates for 2 - and 5- year disease-specific and overall survival outcomes from 11 uncontrolled cohorts of CRT, 11 of SBRT, and 5 of PBT, and found that 5-year overall survival was significantly higher among PBT patients compared with CRT patients (P= .014) and s imilar to SBRT patients (Table 11). 50 A strength of this analysis is that it included adjustment for some sources of potential confounding. The percentage of medically inoperable patients significantly influenced model 35 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program coefficients , so it was used to correct the pooled outcome estimates. Age, percentage of small tumors (<3 cm), percentage of medically inoperable patients, and median follow- up time were ruled out as effect modifiers. However, there is a remaining risk of potential confounding by variation in study setting and temporal trends. For example, in the outcome of 5- year disease - specific survival, most CRT cohorts were from the Netherlands or the US and were followed as early as 1976 to usually the mid-1990s. In contrast, most SBRT cohorts were from Japan and followed as early as 1994 to usually the mid -2000s. Finally, only 2 PBT cohorts, from the US and Japan, were included in this outcome and recruitment dates were unknown for one cohort. Table 11. Findings and SOE for PB T versu s SBRT and CRT in Early-stage NSCLC Strength of evidence : Insufficient for all outcomes Findings No. Studies (N): Indirect meta - analysis of 27 uncontrolled cohorts (N=2,401) limitations: Dir ectness: for locally advanced NSCLC Benefits There is insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion about survival after higher-dose proton beam (74 Gy) IMRT (63 Gy ) with in with primarily stage IIIA -B unresectable NSCLC.34 One poor- quality historically controlled cohort study included 202 patients who were treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas with either proton beam between 2006 and 2008, IMRT between 2003 and 2005, or with 3D-CRT between 2001 and 2003. Follow-up time was 17.9 months 2.3-76.1) 17.4 months (range: 3.3-27.4) PBT patients ( P<.001). Median survival times 17.7, 17.6, and 24.4 months for 3D- CRT, IMRT, and PBT, respectively, but not statistically significa ntly different between groups (P=.1061). This study is limited by lack of adjustment for important baseline characteristics such as: older mean age, higher proportion of nonwhite, lower proportion of clinical disease stage 3B and above, lower tumor volume, lower proportion with adjuvant chemotherapy, and more recent treatment in the proton beam group. This lack of adjustment confounded the effect of PBT on survival. Also, differences between radiation modalities in methods used to account for tumor motion may have confounded their effects on survival. The authors indicated that 4-dimensional CT scanning had been used to account for tumor motion since 2004, but that would only apply to the proton group and the last year of the IMRT group, but not the 3D-CRT group. Finally, the study is potentially limited by differences in lung cancer care in the time periods studied. 36 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Harms There is low -strength evidence that, even at a higher dose (74 Gy), acute risk of severe esophagitis (grade 3) at 6 months for proton beam therapy (6%) is similar to 3D-CRT 63 than One cohort study involving 652 patients with NSCLC, mostly clinical stage IIIA -B and mean age of 66 years, followed patients who were treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2000 and 2008 and evaluated harms among those treated with PBT versus 3D- CRT or IMRT. 4 Across the whole cohort, predictors of severe esophagitis were concurrent chemotherapy and treatment with over 30 fractions, but not age, gender, smoking status, stage, or histology. Risk of Grade 3 esophagitis at 15-17 months was lower with proton beam therapy Gy than Gy (39%; P<.0001) in of 202 patients with primarily stage IIIA -B NSCLC treated with concurrent chemotherapy during that same time period. 34 In the subgroup with concurrent chemotherapy, risk of Grade 3 pneumonitis for PBT (2%) was similar CRT (30%, P<.0001). However, higher dose PBT was associated with a higher risk of Grade 3 dermatitis (24%) than 3D-CRT (5%, P=.005) and similar to IMRT (17%, P=.30). There wer e no statistically significant differences in Grade 3 fatigue, with rates of 19% for proton beam, compared with 15% for IMRT (P=.54) and 29% for 3D-CRT (P=.09). Limitations of these toxicity findings are the same as described above for benefits. Although in the study of the subgroup undergoing concurrent chemotherapy the authors found tumor size to be independent of Grade 2 or greater toxicities and disease stage to be independent of pneumonitis overall, we don't know how applicable these findings are to Grade 3 toxicity and still cannot rule out potential confounding by the other unbalanced factors. Also, we cannot account for the discrepancy in magnitude of the rates of Grade 3 esophagitis (5 -6%) and pneumonitis (2%) for proton therapy between the historic ally-controlled cohort studies 4,34 and those from a case series from the same facility (MD Anderson Cancer Center, 2006-2009)58,59 and other proton facilities between 2001 and 2010 for esophagitis (11%) and pneumonitis (2-6%). 60-64 37 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Table 12.

We agree with their conclusion since this small study did not p rovide any data or statistical tests on benefits or harms by treatment group. Based on the additional retrospective cohort we identified, we concluded that there is insufficient evidence to make a conclusion about the benefits and harms of combined PBT and photon therapy for meningioma. 40 38 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Strength of evidence : Insufficient for all outcomes Findings No. Studies (N): 1 ( 25) Study limitations: High Directness: Direct known Precision: Imprecise Reporting bias: Undetected Other issues: None Benefits and toxicity \"There was no significant difference at most recent follow -up between proton and photon irradiation with regard to tumor control, visual outcome, or treatment side effects.\" Detailed analysis PBT versu s conventional photon One poor-quality retrospective cohort provides insufficient evidence on the use of PBT for meningioma.37 All patients with optic nerve sheath meningioma treated at Massachusetts General Hospital between 1999 and 2006 were included in the stud y (N= 25), with 13 patients receiving photon irradiation, 9 receiving proton irradiation, and 3 patients receiving combination PBT and photon treatment (average dose: 51.4, 51.1, and 57 GyE, respectively). The authors state, \"There was no significant differ ence at most recent follow -up between proton and photon irradiation with regard to tumor control, visual outcome, or treatment side effects.\" Unfortunately, no data or statistical tests were reported by treatment group. Another limitation of this study is that they did not account for the potential confounding effects of the larger average tumor size in the proton group (4.15 mL vs 2.25 and 3.63 mL), which could have a worse prognosis, or its shorter duration of follow-up (12.5 months vs 42 and 78 months). Table 13. SOE for Comparative Benefits of PBT or C onventional Photon T herapy for eningioma PBT+photon v ersus photon alone Evidence on the benefits and harms of combined PBT and photon therapy (59.5-72.0 CGE) compared with photon therapy alone (40.5- 76 Gy) is limited to one small, poor -quality retrospective cohort study and is insufficient to draw conclusions about combined PBT and photon therapy for meningioma. 40 In this study, 5-year local control was significantly higher in the combined therapy group (80% vs 17%; P=.008), but was not different at 8 years (40% vs 17%, estimated from figure 2). Among patients with malignant meningioma ( N=13), 5- and 8- year overall survival was again significantly higher in the combined therapy group (100% vs 44%; P=.025). Late toxicity outcomes were reported in 3 patients (2 cas es of symptomatic necrosis and one case of extensive visual deficits), but the study did not state which treatment these patients received. Because baseline characteristics were not r eported by treatment group, it is unclear whether the 2 groups were balanced at baseline on prognostic factors. 39 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Strength of evidence : Insuffi cient for all outcomes Findings No. Studies (N): 1 (31) Study limitations: High Directness: Direct Consistency: Unknown Imprecise vs 17% (photon) 5- 8- malignant patients:100% (PBT+photon) vs 44% (photon); P=.025 Comparative B enefits of C ombined PB T and P hoton T herapy or Photon Therapy Alon e for Meningioma PROSTATE C ANCER Summary Previous reviews have reached divergent conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of proton beam in prostate cancer.1,53,54 The ICER review concluded that there is low- strength evidence of comparable benefits and moderate-strength evidence of comparable major harms for proton beam without distinguishing bet ween IMRT, of proton beam to IMRT or 3D-CRT, the December 2014 AHRQ Comparative Effectiveness Review 53 on therapies for clinically localized prostate cancer concluded that evidence is inadequate to make a conclusion on the effectiveness of PB T versus IMRT 9,10 or 3D- CRT.9 For the comparisons of proton beam to brachytherapy and conventional photon therapy, the 2012 California Technology Assessment Forum ( CTAF ) review concluded that PBT has not been shown to be as beneficial as any established alternatives and, \"Thus the role of proton beam therapy for localized prostate cancer within the current list of treatment options remains unclear.\" Table 15 summarizes the numbers and types of comparative studies and our conclusions for each different comparison of PBT to IMRT, 3D- CRT, brachytherapy, and conventional photon therapy, respectively.

In both studies, the IMRT groups were drawn from the same population of patients from the Prostate Cancer Outcomes and Satisfaction with Treatment Quality Assessment (PROST -QA) Consortium who were treated between March 2003 and Ma rch 2006 at dose ranges of 75.6-79.2 Gy. The PBT groups w ere 95 patients treated with 74 -82 Gy(RBE) at Massachusetts General Hospital between August 2004 and December 2008 and 1,243 patients who had been treated with 78- 82 Gy(RBE) at the University of Florida between 2006 and 2010. P atients were in their mid -60s and most had clinical T1 disease. Both studies had between -group differences at baseline, including that P BT patients were more likely to be older, white, have smaller prostate volumes, and to be less likely to receive androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ). Results from the Hoppe 2014 study (Table 16) are likely more valid, though, as they used statistical techniques to control for the clinical diversity, whereas the Gray 2013 study did not. An additional major limitation of the Gray 2013 study is that they used different instruments to assess quality of life in each group: the Prostate Cancer Symptom Indices (PCSI) scale for the PBT group and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) for the IMRT group. Harms Some d ose-escalation studies have found increased GI complication risks with increased dose of photons, 65 but not with protons.66 But when compared head- to-head in prostate cancer , proton beam has only transiently reduced risk of 6-month acute GU toxicity versus IMRT , but may increase risk of late GI toxicity after 4 -5 years. GI and GU toxicity at 6 months. One fair-quality retrospective cohort stud y provides low- strength evidence of transiently lower GU toxicity for PBT versus IMRT at 0 -6 months, but no significant difference in GI toxicity (Table 16).7 This study by Yu and colleagues was a population-based study of Medicare claims data from the Chronic Condition Warehouse database that matched 314 patients with early -stage prostate cancer treated with proton beam 41 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program database that matched 314 patients with early -stage prostate cancer treated with proton beam during 2008-2009 at an unknown dose with 628 treated with IMRT.7 Moderate to severe GI and GU toxicity at 12 months was assessed based on diagnosis or procedure codes. GI and GU toxicity at 12 to 24 months. Two f air-quality retrospective cohort studies provide moderate-strength consistent evidence of no significant difference betwee n proton beam therapy and IMRT in early GI or GU toxicity (Table 16).7,8 The first w as the study by Yu and colleagues described above .7 The second study was a matched comparison of prospectively -collected clinician- reporte d grade 2 or greater GI and GU toxicity for 94 pairs of patients with localized low-intermediate risk prostate cancer who received 79.2 Gy delivere d with either proton beam therapy or IMRT between 2010 to 2012 at University of Pennsylvania's proton center.8 Despite methodological differ ences (ie, claims vs primary source data), the 2 studies were consistent in finding no significant differences in GI or GU toxicity at 12 months. The 2014 retrospective cohort study from the University of Pennsylvania proton center also provides low-strength evidence of no significant differences in GI or GU toxicity at 24 months .8 G I toxicity at 4 -5 years. Two fair -quality, population-based retrospective cohort studies of Medicare claims data linked to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database provide low- strength evidence of an increased risk of late GI toxicity at 4 -5 years (Table 16).9,10 The first of the SEER -database studies, by Kim et al, included patients diagnosed with early- stage localized prostate cancer between 1992 and 2005 and used ICD-9 or CPT procedure codes to assess grade 3 to 4 bleeding, ulceration, fistula, stricture, and colostomy that developed at least 6 months after diagnosis and required intervention. 9 The second of the SEER- database studies, by Sheets et al, assessed risk of unspecified GI morbidity-related procedures (including colonoscopy) and diagnoses that occurred at least 12 months after diagnosis in patients diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007. 10 The main limitations of both studies include their high potential for exposure and outcome misclassification biases.67-69 Regarding exposure ascertainment, risk of bias was high because dos e and field size specifics were unknown; therefore, the increased risk of late GI toxicity with PBT may have been entirely due to higher doses. Regarding outcome ascertainment, risk of bias was high because of the questionable reliability of using surrogate procedure (including colonoscopy) and diagnosis code- based measures to detect the actual clinical events of interest. Also, both studies may suffer from potential confounding by study site since likely a high majority of proton patients were treated at the single Loma Linda study site, whereas IMRT patients were likely treated at a variety of sites. 42 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Strength of evidence Findings 2-year quality of life : Low No. Studi es (N): 2 historically - controlled cohort studies (N=1 Study High Directness: Reporting bias: Undetected Other issues: None Patients with differences in EPIC summary scores > 50% SD fro m Hoppe GU toxicity: Low No. Studies (N ): 1 retrospective cohort stud ies (N=1263) Study limitations: Medium vs IMRT: 0.84 PBT=5.9% vs OR, PBT vs IMRT: 0.60 (0.38 to 0.96) 12-month GI and GU toxicity : Moderate No. Studies (N): 2 retrospective cohort stud ies (N=1130) Precision: Imprecise Reporting bias: Undetected GI months) Claims database analysis: 9.9% (PBT) vs (PBT) vs and GU toxicity : Low No. Studies (N): 1 retrospective cohort study (N= 188) Study limitations: Medium Directness: Direct Consistency: Unknown Precision: Late 0.22-1.41) Table 16.

QOL was assessed in bo th cohorts using the PCSI. After 24 months, both the 3D- CRT ( PBT ntly improved mean bowel/rectal QOL scores compared with baseline. Neither group reported significantly different urinary irritation/obstruction or urinary incontinence QOL scores compared with baseline. Differences were not assessed between treatment grou ps. This study has a number of limitations, including using a historical cohort from a different site and not controlling for temporal or site differences and uncontrolled baseline differences between the treatment groups. The PBT group was younger, had lower baseline prostate- specific antigen (PSA) values, and included more patients with clinical T1 disease than the 3D-CRT group, potentially improving overall outcomes relative to the 3D -CRT group. Harms One fair -quality retrospective cohort provides low- strength evidence that PBT results in more frequent acute GI toxicities compared with 3D -CRT for prostate cancer. 9 Patients included in this study were residents of SEE R regi ons that were diagnosed with T1- T2 clinically localized prostate cancer between 1992 and 2005. A total of 19,063 patients between 66 and 85 years of age that underwent 3D-CRT, IMRT, or PBT were included, but the study did not report how many patients were treated with each modality, or the average dose of each treatment. The overall rate of any GI toxicity was 20.1 events per 1,000 patients treated with PBT followed for one year and 9.2 events per 1,000 patients treated with 3D-CRT followed for one ye ar. After controlling for year of cancer diagnosis, comorbidity, age group, clinical stage at diagnosis, SEER region, race, marital status, poverty status, and cancer grade, the risk of GI toxicity was higher among patients that underwent PBT compared with patients that underwent 3D- CRT Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Strength of evidence : Insufficient for bowel/rectal, urinary irritation/obstruction, and urinary incontinence, low urinary irritation/obstruction, and urinary incontinence torical Study Directness: (P>.05 (3D- CRT and PBT)) Risk of acute GI toxicity No. Studies (N): 1 cohort (N=19,063) Study limitations: Medium Directness: Precision: Other None 2.13 CRT in Prostate Cancer PBT versu s brachytherapy A 2012 study by Coen et al provided low- strength evidence of similar 8 -year overall survival and freedom from distant metastasis after combined proton and photon radiation (79.2 GyE) (125I to doses of 145 Gy or 115 Gy, respectively), but no c omparative evidence on toxicity. Coen et al included 141 patients that were treated with a combination of conformal photon radiation and PBT (79.2 GyE) at either the Loma Linda University Medical Center or at Massachusetts General Hospital between 1996 and 1999. 11,70 These patients were matched on T stage, Gleason score, PSA level, and age to 141 patients treated with permanent prostate brachytherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital between 1997 and 2002. Eight- year overall survival was 93% among combination therapy patients and 96% among brachytherapy patients (P=.45). Eight- year freedom from distant metastasis was 99% among combination therapy patients and 96% among brachytherapy patients (P=.42). Subgroup analyse s by risk group, T stage, initial PSA level, and Gleason score did not reveal any significant differences between the two treatment groups. Alternatively, a 2012 meta- analysis by Grimm et el that was based on single -arm brachytherapy studies and two PBT st udies 71,72 utilizing from the PROG/ACR 95 -09 RCT70 concluded that brachytherapy had higher average progression -free survival. However, because the Grimm et al 45 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Strength of evidence : Low for all outcomes Findings No. Studies (N): 1 (282) Study limitations: Medium Directness: Direct Consistency: Unknown Imprecise limitations, we used the higher strength evidence fro m Coen 2012 to form the basis of our conclusion about how PBT compares to brachytherapy. The Grimm 2012 meta- analysis indirectly compared the proportion of patients with PSA progression-free survival in uncontrolled studies of radical prostatectomy, brachy therapy, EBRT, androgen deprivation therapy, high intensity focused ultrasound, and high dose radiotherapy for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer.49 The au thors of this study concluded that for low risk prostate cancer, higher average progression- free survival was reported for brachytherapy compared with all other treatment modalities. But since there were no common control groups among the included studies, comparability of the study populations cannot be verified. The authors also did not control for potential confounders such as the date or location of treatment in each study. For example, patients receiving PBT were treated at Loma Linda University and Massachusetts General Hospital between 1996 and 1999, 70 while one brachytherapy study included patients treated at a hospital in Michigan and a hospital in German y from 1991-2002 and 1986-1999, respectively. 73 Table 18. SOE for Comparative B enefits of Conformal Photon Radiation ancer PBT+photon v ersus photon alone Benefits For overall survival, there was low-strength evidence that photon therapy with a proton \"boost\" and conventional photon thera py had comparative benefits at 8 and 5 years. The 8- year data comes from the fair -quality RCT of 202 patients with advanced stage T3 and T4 treated between 1982 and 1992, which found survival rates of 55% for photon therapy with a proton \"boost\" and 51% for photon therapy alone. 14 At 5 years, survival rates reported in the RCT were 75% and 80% for photon therapy with \"boost\" and only photon therapy, respectively14 and 62% (estimated from figure 3E in Duttenhaver et al) in both groups in a poor- quality retrospective cohort with a broader population of patients with stage T1 -T4 who were treated in the decade earlier (1973 -1979).12 The retrospective cohort study was rated poor quality for this outcome since the potentially confounding effects of tumor differentiation were not controlled for and could lead to better survival outcomes. For other 8-year outcomes, there was no difference in Kaplan- Meier estimates of disease- free survival (72% vs 62%), or local control (77% vs 60%) overall, but local control was significantly improved in the subgroup of patients with poorly differentiated (Gleason score: 4 -5) tumors (85% vs 40%; P=.0014). 14 46 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Neither health -related QOL nor health status differed overall between treatment groups at 18 months in the fair-quality prospective cohort study that followed patients in 5 different treatment groups (surgery, conventional radiation, PBT, a combination of conventional external- beam radiation and PBT, and watchful waiting).13 It is important to note that in all 3 studies, the total dose was greater in t he combined treatment group compared with the group that just received conventional photon therapy: 75.6 74-75 v ersus 65-70 Gy in the prospective cohort study.13 Further, the radiotherapy techniques used in the RCT14 and the retrospective cohort12 are outdated and so these outcomes may not be applicable to current radiotherapy methods. Harms For 8 -year harms, there was low -strength evidence that rectal bleeding was higher among the combined therapy group (32% vs 12%; P=.002) while urethral stricture and gross not signific antly different between the 2 groups.14 For earlier time points, there was no difference in toxicity.12,13 As reported in the retrospective cohort study, urinary and rectal symptom incidence up to 5 years were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups, but the median follow-up time was not reported. 12 Finally, there was low -strength evidence of no difference in sexual, GI, and urinary treatment symptoms between combined PBT and photon therapy groups after 18 months.13 As discussed above, in all 3 studies, the total dose was greater in the combined PBT and photon therapy compared with the photon- only group. 47 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Strength of Evidence Grade Study Design: No. Studies (N) Study Limitations Direct - ness Consistency Precision Reporting Bias Other Issues Findings Outcome: 8 -year overall survival Low RCT: 1 (202) Medium Direct Unknown Imprecise Undetected None No difference: 55% (PBT+photon) vs 51% (photon) Outcome: 5 -year overall survival Low RCT: 1 (202) Retrospective cohort: 1 (180) Medium High Direct Incons istent (photon) Outcome: quality of life and health status Low Prospective cohort: 1 (185) Medium Direct Unknown Imprecise Undetected None No difference Outcome: 8 -year rectal bleeding Low RCT: 1 (202) Medium Direct Unknown Precise Undetected None 32% (PBT+photon) vs 12% Low (202) Unknown 19% (PBT+photon) vs 8% 8 -year hematuria Low RCT: 1 (202) Medium Direct Unknown Imprecise 14% and urinary Prospective cohort: 1 (185) Medium Direct Unknown Impr ecise Undetected None No difference Table 19.

We identified one retrospective cohort study that provided comparative evidence on secondary malignancies in non- metastatic cancer patients treated with PBT or photon modalities for a variety of cancers, but it has numerous methodological limitations which are described below. 16 A total of 558 patients treated with PBT at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Cyclotron between 1973 and 2001 were matched to 558 patients treated with external beam photon radiation included in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program cancer registry based on cancer site, histology, age at treatment (\u00b110 years), year of treatment (\u00b15 years), and sex. Most patients in the PBT group received 20% of their total dose from photon radiation and the SEER cohort likely contained very few patients that received IMRT. The most common tumor sites in both groups were CNS (32%), head and neck (24%), genitourinary (33%), lung (0.4%), and lymphoma (0.2%) cancers. After a median follow -up time of 6.7 years for PBT patients and 6.0 years for photon radiation patients, second ary malignancies developed in 5.2% and 7.5% of the PBT and photon patients, respectively. Among PBT patients, secondary malignancies included 26 solid tumors, 2 lymphomas, and one leukemia. Among photon patients, secondary malignancies included 38 solid tumors and 4 lymphomas. The incidence rate of secondary malignancies was 6.9 and 10.3 cancers per 1,000 person-years among PBT and photon patients, respectively (P=.085) while 10-year cumulative incidence rates were 5.4% and 8.6%, respectively (P=.085). After controlling for age at treatment, sex, tumor site, and year of diagnosis, the risk for developing secondary cancer among PBT patients was half that of photon patients (HR=0.52; 95% CI: 0.32-0.85; P<.01). The main limitations of this study are its potential for unmeasured confounding due to (1) missing data, (2) unknown radiation field size or dose, and (3) variation in ascertainment methods across groups. First, no information on secondary malignancies was obtained in 27% of patients in the proton therapy group who had no follow-up appointments or could not be reached by mail or phone. As it is plausible that the loss to follow -up is associated with secondary malignancy events, exclusion of those patients could have either over- or under- estimated the effects of proton therapy. Second, although pati ents were matched by treatment site and histology in an attempt to control for irradiation volume, we still cannot rule out the potential for unmeasured confounding based on this factor because the comparability of the radiation dose and field size are unk nown. Thirdly, we cannot rule out the risk of differential misclassification due to variation of ascertainment methods across groups. Data for the proton group are likely more reliable because they were \"...abstracted from pathology reports, radiology report s, operative notes and clinic visit notes in accordance with a standardized protocol. Patients were also contacted by mail and scripted telephone calls to obtain data. The second cancer incidence was verified b y review of pathology reports.\" Ascertainment of s econd cancers in the photon group was based on diagnosis codes from the SEER database, which are known to be prone to misclassification. Also, these findings may not be widely generalizable. PBT patients that were not matched with SEER patients were si gnificantly different than matched PBT patients, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings to all PBT patients. Unmatched PBT patients were younger, more likely to be female, followed for a shorter amount of time, and were more likely to ha ve rare 49 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Strength of evidence : Insufficient for all outcomes Findings No. Studies (N):1 retrospective cohort (N=1,116) Study limitations: High Di rectness: Unknown Precision: Imprecise Reporting Undetected Other issues: None Secondary malignancy incidence rate:6.9 (PBT) vs 10.3 (p hoton) per 1,000 person- CI: 0.32-0.85) malignancies. Further, it is not clear that the majority of secondary malignancies are a result of treatment because they mostly occurred within the first 5 years of treatment when solid cancers are not plausibly attributed to radiation therapy. 74 Bekelman and colleagues estimated that in the first 5 years after treatment, the incidence rate of secondary malignancies was 11.4 and 25.1 cancers per 1,000 person-years among PBT and photon patients, respectively, while after 5 years, the incidence rate of second ary malignancies was 5.7 and 5.8 cancers per 1,000 person- years among PBT and photon patients, respectively.

There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the comparative effects of PBT versus other radiation modalities among patients with recurrent tumors. We identified 2 comparative studies on recurrent tumors, one among patients with recurrent malignant brain tumors 17 and one among patients with recurrent liver cancer,18 but both studies were rated poor quality due to their failure to account for potentially important confounding. Proton v ersu s SRT or conventional photon in recurrent malignant brain tumors One retrospective cohort17 provides insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about PBT compared with SRT or conventional photon therapy for recurrent malignant brain tumor. Patients with recurrent malignant brain tumor after radiotherapy were reirradiated with conventional photons (N=8), stereotactic radiotherapy (N=10), or PBT (N=8) between 2005 and 2010. Patients received an average reirradiation dose of 43.7 (conventional photon), 41.7 (SRT), or 39.5 (PBT). The median follow-up period for survivors was 19.4 months. After a median of 11.6 months, 5 patients (62.5%) in the conventional photon group had died, 5 patients (50%) in the SRT group had died, and 5 patients (62.5%) in the PBT group had died (P>.99). Local recurrence occurred in 2 patients (25%) in the conventional photon group, 3 patients (30%) in the SR T group, and 2 patients (25%) in the PBT group (P>.99). Two patients, both in the SRT treatment group, experienced radiation necrosis. This study was rated poor quality because it did not 50 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Strength of evidence : Insufficient for all outcomes Findings account for the potentially confounding effects of younger age (51 vs 64.5 years (SRT)), lower reirradiation dose and larger average tumor size (70.4 vs 11.5 cc (SRT)).

This study included 8 patients with recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma, 5 treated with protons (68.8-84.5 Gy) and 3 treated with x -rays (60 or 70 Gy). Similar numbers of patients died in the proton and x- ray treatment groups after a median of 18 and 15.5 months, respectively (80% vs 100%; P=. 62). This study was rated poor quality mainly because it did not account for the potentially better prognosis in the proton group due the lower median age (56 vs 60 years) and smaller average tumor size (2.7 vs 3.6 cm ).

Compared with results from single -arm studies of proton beam in pa tients with primary tumors, there is lower survival and higher recurrences in single-arm studies of proton beam in patients with recurrent tumors. In a cohort of chordoma patients with primary (N=36) or locally recurrent (N=14) malignancies, 8 -year local r ecurrence after treatment with a combination of 51 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program photons and protons (median dose: 76.6 CGE) was greater among patients with recurrent compared with primary tumors (53% vs 15%; P=.002).75 Similarly, single -arm studies of recurrent carcinoma,76 hepatocellular carcinoma,77 and non- small cell lung cancer78 report lower rates of overall survival compared with single- arm st udies of patients with primary tumors of the same type.58,79,80 However, we have limited confidence that the reduced benefits of proton therapy were primarily due to recurrent tumors, as the difference may have been confounded by clinical and methodological variability between the groups of single- arm studies, including that some of the recurrent tumor studies used a lower dose of radiation, 76,78 were published earlier,76 and included younger patients76,77 compared with primary tumor studies. KEY QUESTION 4A: What are t he harms of p roton beam irradiation compared to photon-b ased therapies in treating m obile targets that may move during treatment? Tumors of the lungs, esophagus, liver, pancreas, breast, prostate, and kidneys are subject to respiratory motion and the magnitude and trajectory of this motion can vary across patients. Respiratory motion can cause problems during imaging, planning, and delivery of radiation therapy, potentially leading to reduced dose calculation accuracy, difficulty quantifying the magnitude of margins, and differences between planned and delivered doses. Methods used to account for respiration motion include respiratory gating (radiation is delivered during a specific point in the breathing cycle), breath-hold, forced shallow-breathing involving a stereotactic body frame, and real -time tumor tracking. To determine the harms of proton beam irradiation compared to photon- based therapies in treating mobile targets that may move during treatment, we looked for studies that reported on (1) comparability of tumor motion between treatment groups and whether tumor motion affected clinical outcomes of interest, (2) existence or comparability of imaging and planning methods used to account for respiratory motion, and (3) existence or comparability of quality assurance standards used to monitor respiratory motion control methods. Although dosimetric studies comparing methods of accounting for respiratory motion in treatment planning report that 4DCT imaging decreases doses to normal structures compared with other multiphase, 19 free-breathing,20 or 3DCT imaging,21 how this translates to clinical outcomes is not clear. We did not ide ntify any studies that evaluated clinical outcomes of interest based on variability in tumor motion, imaging and planning methods used to account for respiratory motion, or quality assurance standards. Only 4 comparative studies explicitly describe imaging and planning methods used to account for respiratory motion, but none evaluated the effects of variability in methods. 11,18,33,34 One retrospective cohort study of lung cancer patients34 treated with 3D -CRT (2001-2003), IMRT (2003-2005), and PBT (2006-2008) noted that methods of managing tumor motion were used with IMRT and PBT, but not 3D- CRT. Respiration -induced 3D motion of lung tumors was assessed using 4DCT imaging,81 but the authors did not discuss management of this movement. Survival times did not differ by treatment group. In one retrospective cohort study of esophageal c ancer patients, 33 radiation dose was calculated with a free- breathing treatment planning CT or with an average CT calculated from a 4DCT image set , and around 66% of images were attenuation corrected with mid-inspiratory breath -hold from the PET/CT scanner. Clinical outcomes were not discussed by method of radiation dose calculation. In one retrospective cohort study of recurrent hepatocellular 52 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program carcinoma,18 a respiration -gated irradiation system was used on all patients. Finally, in one cohort study of PBT prostate cancer patients case -matched with brachyth erapy patients,11 PBT patients were immobilized for daily treatment using body casts.70 53 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Key Questions 1, 2, and 4 Population Comparator Findings Breast Single field PBT vs photon-based 3D conformal accelerated partial - breast irradiation We found low -strength evidence of comparable 7 -year cumulative local recurrence, but higher rates of some 7 - year skin toxicities with PBT, including moderate/severe dyspigmentation, patchy/marked CNS: Medulloblastoma Proton CSI -strength evidence that PBT 54.6 GyE and photon therapy 52.9 Gy have comparable benefits, but proton beam therapy was associated with reduced acute toxicity .

Esophageal IMRT vs PBT and vs PBT low evidence that trimodal therapy with neoadjuvant chemoradiation, either proton beam, IMRT or 3D- CRT have comparable risk of 30-day postoperative GI complications, but that 30- day postoperative pulmonary complications for trimodal therapy with proton beam are lower than with 3D- CRT and similar to IMRT. There is also low- strength evidence that proton therapy is associated with a higher risk of 3-month pneumonitis compared with IMRT/3D- CRT.

Summary of E vidence by Key Question 54 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Key Questions 1, 2, and 4 Population Comparator Findings Menin gioma PBT vs conventional photon PBT+ photon vs photon alone We identified insufficient evidence on the use of PBT or combined PBT and photon therapy for meningioma. Prostate PBT vs IMRT We identified low -strength evidence of no significant differenc es between PBT and IMRT in bowel, urinary, and sexual quality of life at 2 years. Transiently lower GU toxicity at 0 -6 mont hs for PBT (low SOE), but similar GI and GU toxicity at 12-24 months (low to moderate), and increased GI toxicity with PBT at 4-5 years (low SOE ).

Secondary malignancies - various cancers PBT vs photon There is insuff icient evidence to draw conclusions about how proton beam therapy compares to other radiation modalities in risk of secondary malignancy. Key Question 3 There is insufficient evidence to make conclusions about the use of PBT among patients with recurrent cancers. Key Question 4A We did not identify any studies that evaluated clinical outcomes of interest based on variability in tumor motion, imaging and planning methods used to account for respiratory motion, or quality assurance standards . 55 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program DISCUSSION For all cancer sites and types, except for ocular and pediatric cancers which were not reviewed here, there are no reliable data from long-term randomized trials on survival, quality of life, or functional capacity of patients who underwent PBT compared with any other modality. We could not fully assess the overall net health benefit of proton beam therapy versus its comparators because comparative observational studies did not consistently report many outcomes of greatest interest. No studies reported functional capacity outcomes or overall severe late toxicity. No prospective comparative studies reported secondary malignancies. Ability to deliver planned treatments was reported by only one small retrospective cohort study. Despite the common claim that the advantage of proton beam therapy is self -evident in all circumstances, comparative studies have not demonstrated any common clinical situations in which proton beam therapy has a measurable advantage over photon radiotherapy modalities on meaningful long-term health outcomes, but have uncovered the potential for increased harm. The only advantages we found were for early toxicities: (1) for medulloblastoma, proton beam may reduce risk of 1-month medical management of esophagitis (5% vs 2 nausea/vomiting (26% vs 71%; P=.004) ; (2) for esophageal cancer, compared to 3D-CRT, proton beam may lead to a substantial risk reduction in post-operative pulmonary complications (aOR 9.13 for 3D- CRT vs PBT when chemoradiation resection; 28.4% vs 18.1%); (3) for NSCLC, proton beam may risk of severe esophagitis compared to IMRT (6% vs 28%; P<.0001); and (4) for prostate cancer, compared with IMRT, proton be am may transiently reduce risk of 6-month GU diagnosis or procedure codes (OR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.96; 5.9% vs 9.5%) . Increased harms include (1) for partial breast irradiation , various skin toxicities are more common with PBT than with 3D- CRT when PBT is delivered in single- fields (range, 54 -90% vs 15- 28%), (2) for esophageal cancer, acute pneumonitis was more common with PBT than IMRT and 3D- CRT (33% versus 15%; P=.04), (3) for prostate cancer, there is variable increased risk for GI toxicity compared wit h IMRT and 3D- CRT and for late rectal bleeding for a high-dose combination of protons plus photons compared with photons alone, and (4) for spinal cord gliomas, there is an 18% increased risk of 5-year mortality. We only found one clinical scenario in which there was at least low -strength evidence that proton beam is comparable to other treatment modalities across outcomes and that was for prostate cancer, in which combined proton and photon radiation had similar 8-year overall survival and freedom from dis tant metastasis compared with brachytherapy. Although we found comparative studies in giant cell tumors of the bone , head and neck cancer, uveal hemangiomas, and meningiomas, they provided insufficient evidence for drawing conclusions. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the comparative effects of PBT versus other radiation modalities among patients with recurrent tumors or how the comparative effects of proton and photon beam therapies differ according to variation in tumor motion. Strength of evidence Overall, however, we have low confidence that these findings reflect the true overall effects of proton beam therapy because the body of comparative studies for proton beam therapy has numerous deficiencies. Typical circumstances that can increase our confidence in the certainty of the findings are when multiple individual studies within an evidence base have a high degree of similarity in the direction or magnitude of effect (consistency) and when the potential for random 56 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program error is reduced through the use of sufficient sample sizes (precision). But in most cases among the comparative studies for proton beam therapy, consistency was unknown because there was typically only a single study for each outcome within each cancer type and the effect estimates were imprecise because of small sample sizes. The main limitations in study design and conduct include that most studies (1) were retrospective and some used historical control groups for the photon-based comparator groups, (2) potentially gave proton beam groups an unfair advantage by comparing them to photon-based groups with poorer prognostic profiles without accounting for the important differences, (3) lacked data on radiation dose and field size, (4) could not reliably differentiate toxicity grade, and (4) did not measure many outcomes of greatest interest, including recurrence, ability to deliver planned chemotherapy and radiation regimens, functional capacity, overall severe late toxicity, and secondary malignancies. Applicability There are 2 characteristics of the studies worth mentioning that may restrict the applicability of their findings. First, the majority of the proton beam treatment groups came from one of 3 proton facilities that are among the oldest in operation (Loma Linda, MD Anderson, or Massachusetts General ). It is unclear whether the patient outcomes of these centers would generalize to other facilities with less experience treating patients and that may have difference standards of care. Second, the majority of the studies include patients that were treated as far back as 1991 to 2003, and it is unclear whether their findings would generalize to current standards of care, which may reflect improvements in proton beam administration skill levels and other advances. Compari son to previous systematic reviews It is difficult to directly compare our conclusions to those of many previous reviews as most included many fewer of the more recently published comparative studies. The 2014 review produced by ICER for the Washington State Health Care Authority Health Technology Assessment Program (HTA) had the largest overlap with our scope, but our conclusions differed greatly from theirs. There is no clear pattern to the discrepancies between our conclusions. We did not detect a clear conflict of interest for ICER as their funding statement indicated support from various sources, including government grants, non-profit organizations, health plans/ provider contributions, manufacturer grants, contracts, contributions, but that it was \"not accepted from manufacturers or private insurers to perform reviews of specific technologies.\" The differences in conclusions could also not clearly be attributed to differences in eligibility criteria, study inclusion, or methods of assessing internal va lidity or rating strength of evidence. General limitations of our systematic review As with other types of research, the limitations of this systematic review are important to recognize. The generalizability of the results are limited by the scope of the key questions and inclusion criteria and by the generalizability of the studies included. The main methodological limitation of this review within the defined scope is the exclusion of studies published in languages other than English. But it is likely tha t findings from studies published in non-English language journals may have limited applicability to the VA populations. 57 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Gaps in evidence and future research recommendations Gaps in evidence include the lack of studies on the newer PBT delivery systems and methods ( ie, pencil beam scanning), assessment of many important outcomes including recurrence, ability to deliver planned chemotherapy and radiation regimens, functional capacity, overall severe late toxicity, and secondary malignancies. Also, although there are many studies that have compared the dosimetric impact between different methods of accounting for tumor motion in treatment planning, including 4DCT imaging, multiphase, free-breathing, or 3DCT imaging, we found no studies of how they compare in clinical outcomes. It is clear that further comparative studies are needed to address the these gaps in evidence. We will discuss the ideal characteristics of future studies using the PICOS framework. For population and intervention, to further minimize th e risk of confounding, we recommend use of greater standardization in measurement of and greater reporting of important patient characteristics by treatment group and proton beam dose and delivery parameters and better accounting for baseline differences. For outcomes, at minimum, future studies should start with using reliable and standardized methods for measuring overall early and late toxicity that account for severity grade, rather than focusing an entire study on just one specific toxicity reflecting a wide range of severity. Ideally, future studies should measure many outcomes of greatest interest, including recurrence, ability to deliver planned chemotherapy and radiation regimens, functional capacity, overall severe late toxicity, and secondary mali gnancies. For setting, to improve the generalizability and precision, we recommend using a multi-site design. The Proton Therapy Consortium offers an opportunity for its 14 participating proton beam facilities to collectively conduct a cooperative study th at would combine data across multiple study sites, which would increase the overall generalizability of their findings. For study design, it is not clear that RCTs are necessary or possible, and well -designed prospective cohort studies may be acceptable. S ome practitioners of and advocates for PBT have argued that conducting studies that randomize patients to PBT or photon- based treatment is unethical. 82 Due to the superior dose distribution achieved by PBT, they argue, protons can provide therapy superior to photons in almost every circumstance and so randomizing patients to receive proton or non-proton therapy would preclude the requirement of equipoise needed to ethically conduct a RCT. 82 Other clinicians and experts in radiation oncology question whether PBT's dosimetric characteristics translate into measurable clinical benefits or increased survival for patients.83 The lack of obvious clinical benefit in some observational studies84 lead some to question whether conducting RCTs would in fact be unethical.83 We identified 9 ongoing RCTs that are comparing proton beam therapy to conventional SBRT (N=1), and and include cancer types of non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), prostate cancer, meningioma, glioblastoma, esophageal cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer patients (see Appendix F ). Four of these ongoing studies are multi- site and are being conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Universit y of Pennsylvania as well as other centers in the US and abroad. Many have estimated completion dates in the next 2 years. A review of their protocols suggests the potential for some improvement in toxicity measurement. For example, NCT01512589, a Phase II I randomized trial of proton beam therapy versus IMRT for esophageal cancer, has a planned outcome of total toxicity burden. However, it is not clear they will fully address all missing outcomes. 58 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program CONCLUSION Despite the common claim that the advantage of proton beam therapy is self -evident, comparative studies have not demonstrated any common clinical situations in which proton beam therapy has a measurable advantage over photon radiotherapy modalities on meaningful long-term health outcomes, but have uncovered low-strength evidence of the potential for increased late toxicity compared with IMRT and 3D-CRT for breast, esophageal, prostate, and spinal cord glioma cancers. Existing comparative studies have numerous methodological deficiencies that limited our confidence in their findings and their findings may have limited applicability across all US proton beam facilities. Although numerous randomized controlled trials are underway that carry the promise of improved toxicity measurement , it is unclear whether t hey will fully address gaps in evidence on other important outcomes including recurrence, ability to deliver planned chemotherapy and radiation regimens, functional capacity, overall severe late toxicity, and secondary malignancies. Because this is still a rapidly evolving field, with ongoing efforts to improve techniques and reduce costs, this review may need more frequent updating to keep up-to-date with emerging research. 59 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program REFERENCES 1.

Pr oton beam radiation therapy is considered not medically necessary for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization secondary to age- related macular degeneration (AMD). Proton beam radiation therapy is considered investigational and not medically necessary for all other indications not meeting the criteria above. Localized Prostate Cancer Proton beam radiation therapy is considered medically necessary for the initial monotherapy radiation treatment of localized prostate cancer. The use of proton beam radiation as dose escalation therapy, in conjunction with stereotactic radiosurgery, IMRT, three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D CRT), or brachytherapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer is considered investigational and not med ically necessary. Proton beam radiation therapy is considered investigational and not medically necessary for the treatment of prostate cancer for all other indications not meeting the criteria above. 68 Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program Organization Title Last Review Policy BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina Corporate Medical Policy Charged Particle Radiotherapy (Proton or Helium Ion) 6/2014 Charged particle irradiation with proton or helium ion beams may be considered medically necessary for the following clinical indications: (1) primary therapy for melanoma of the uveal tract (iris, choroid or ciliary body), with no evidence of metastasis or extrascleral extension, and with tumors up to 24 millimeters in largest diameter and 14 millimeters in height; (2) post- operative therapy (with or without conventional high energy X-rays) in patients who have undergone biopsy or a partial resection of chordoma or low grade (I or II) chondrosarcoma of the basisphenoid region (skull -base chordoma or chondrosarcoma) or cervical spine. Patients eligible for this treatment have residual localized tumor without evidence of metastasis; (3) In the treatment of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Cha rged particle irradiation with proton beams using standard treatment doses is considered not medically necessary and therefore non - covered in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, because the clinical outcomes with this treatment have not been shown to be superior to other approaches including intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or conformal radiation therapy. Charged particle irradiation is considered investigational for all other indications not addressed above under, When Charged Particle Radiotherapy is covered BlueCross BlueShield of California Charged - Particles (Proton or Helium) Radiation Therapy Medical Policy 10/28/2013 Charged -particle irradiation with proton or helium ion beams may be considered medically necessary and a covered benefit in any of the following clinical situations: (1) Primary therapy for melanoma of the uveal tract (iris, choroid, or ciliary body) and both of the following: a. No evidence of metastasis or extrascleral extension, b. Tumor size up to 24 millimeters in largest diameter and 14 millimeters in height; (2) Postoperative therapy (with or without conventional high-energy x -rays) for residual localized tumor without metastasis in patients who have undergone biopsy or partial resection of one of the following: a. Chordoma, b. Low- grade (I or II) chondrosarcoma of the basisphenoid region ( eg, skull -base chordoma or chondrosarcoma) or cervical spine; (3) Treatment of pediatric central nervous system tumors. Ch arged -particle irradiation with proton or helium beams is generally not a covered service for prostate cancer (clinically localized prostate cancer) because it is not cost -effective.

CIGNA Proton Beam Therapy for Ocular Melanoma, Ocular Hemangiomas and Macular Degeneration Unknown CIGNA HealthCare covers proton beam therapy as medically necessary for the treatment of melanoma of the uveal tract (ie , iris, ciliary body and choroid). CIGN A HealthCare does not cover proton beam therapy for choroidal hemangiomas or macular degeneration, because it is considered experimental, investigational or unproven. CIGNA Proton Beam Therapy for Prostate Cancer Unknown CIGNA HealthCare considers proton beam therapy to be clinically equivalent to conventional external beam radiation therapy for the treatment of localized prost ate cancer (ie , cancer that is confined to the prostate), but does not consider it to be clinically superior to conventional external beam radiation therapy. Coverage for proton beam therapy for the t re atment of localized prostate cancer may depend upon the applicable health benefit plan definition of medical necessity. Many health benefit plans administered by CIGNA HealthCare contain definitions of medical necessity which include a cost comparison component. Because proton beam therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer is significantly more expensive than conventional external beam radiation therapy but is not clinically superior, it is considered not medically necessary under those plans. For health benefit plans which contain definitions of medical necessity that do not include a cost comparison component, proton beam therapy may be covered as medically necessary for the treatment of localized prostate cancer ( ie, cancer that is confined to the pr ostate).

While there have been studies reported with possibly worse than expected toxicities, these are entirely related to technique vs proton beam itself. For example, the partial breast proton beam series toxicity was related to the use of a single- beam, not protons itself. The more contemporary series from Loma Linda We changed the title of our review to \"Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment\" Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 105 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE published earlier this year (D. Bush, IJROBP 2014) showed this quite nicely and was supported by the accompanying editorial from E. Strom. This theme continues wit h prostate, where the series from Shipley, published in the 1990's, used single perineal fields, an outdated technique. I think re -titling this, \"Proton Beam Therapy: An Updated Review\" would be more appropriate and less inflammatory. 3. Are there any published or unpublished studies that we may have overlooked? 1 1 No (no comments ) 2 2 No (no comments ) 3 3 Yes: Systematic reviews of the past 5 years were included. Although it will not add value to the data and will not influence the overall conclusion, below three more reviews to add: van de Water TA, Bijl HP, Schilstra C, Pijls -Johannesma M, Langendijk J A.

We excluded the 2011 van de Water et al. publication because, as a review of in silico planning studies, it did not in clude any outcomes of interest for our review. We excluded the 2010 Pijls -Johannesma et al. publication because none of the included PBT studies included comparison groups. We excluded the 2013 Combs et al. publication because this systematic review included non- comparative studies and did not perform any pooling of studies or meta- analysis. 4 4 Yes - Grimm et al., 2012, mentioned in my review Thank you for bringing this study to our attention.

Additional suggestions or comments can be provided below. If applicable, please indicate the page and line numbers from the d raft report. 1 4 Pg. 1 line 10 \"Dosimetric advantages ar e not theoretical. I would rephrase: \"because of the physical properties of the proton beam, which can translate into dosimetric advantages for certain clinical situation...\" Changed to \"appealing dosimetric characteristics\" 2 4 Pg. 2 line 14 \"It is critical to note that this trial was only for the partial -breast irradiation, which means only patients with Stage I cancer were eligible, and the partial breast concept is to elimina te the dose to lungs and heart. Therefore there is not much advantage for protons in the partia l breast RT. HOWEVER, proton beam is a very interesting concept for patients with LEFT breast locally advanced cancer (Stages II and III), where the entire left che st wall needs to be irradiates. A regular 3D photon treatment exposes too much heart, with a 7.5% risk of coronary events for each Gray of RT to the heart. Protons can significantly spare the dose to the heart in these clinical scenarios. For patients with Left locally advanced breast cancer, proton beam therapy should be considered, if a regular 3D plan cannot achieve a heart mean dose of less than 5 Gy.\" We clarified that the patients in this trial were being treated for stage I breast cancer. 3 4 Pg. 2 line 38 \"This dose (54.6 vs 52.9) is to the primary disease in the brain.

The main question of this randomized trial at MGH was to determine whether increasing the dose beyond 70 Gy, what was considered standard back then with 3D -CRT would improve the outcomes, not the protons. But since the trail was done at MGH where protons are available, the study used protons for the last five fractions. So this study is really about 79.2 Gy vs 70 Gy of radiation therapy, not about photons alone vs photons + protons.\" We altered our discussion of both Shipley e t al. 1995 and Duttenhaver et al 1983 to emphasize that these studies used a \"boost\" of protons in addition to photon therapy and that this combined group received a larger overall dose compared with the group that received photon treatment only. 22 4 Pg. 44 line 32 \"p<0.01\" Added. 23 4 Pg. 44 line 41 \"These patients were treated for non -metastatic disease, using standard treatments doses, therefore we can be sure that the doses were comparable, if not exactly the same, diagnosis for diagnosis.\" We disagr ee.

Similar to open vs laparoscopic surgery - surgeon decides at the time of surg ery which technique is necessary for best visualization/access, etc, and that in theory should be left to the physician to decide and will never be analyzed in literature.\" It is precisely because this is a particularly difficult to treat population that t his is a worthwhile question to ask. Knowing whether patients with recurrences are more or less likely to benefit from proton therapy compared with other alternatives could be particularly useful when, in general, recurrent tumors may be less sensitive to all treatments. And, in fact, there are already studies that have evaluated the comparative effectiveness of proton therapy in recurrent tumors. 26 4 Pg. 46 line 53 \"It is incorrect to say that proton therapy is less beneficial in p atients with recurrent tumors. The correct statement is: 'Any treatment form is less effective in the setting of disease recurrence.' This is pr imarily driven by two factors: often patients have metastatic disease at the time of recurrence, and if the tumor comes back, it is more likely to be less sensitive to treatment effect. Therefore physicians always tell patients that the effectiveness of treatment is lower in the setting of disease recu rrence. Don't state that this is specific to proton beam therapy.\" Thank you for this information.

For IMRT on lines 23 -27, it appears proton beam is compared to IMRT (in that order, so PB is the reference) and proton beam has higher GI toxicity with HR = 3.32. However, in lines 29- 35, the order appears to be reversed (IMRT vs PB) with IMRT now the reference and with RR of less than 1, so proton beam is again more toxicity.

I have no additional comments. 37 5 Overall, this is an outstanding article and demonstrates that the authors have an impressive insight into radiation treatment and outcomes. Thank you. 38 5 Please see two suggested articles (Talcott, Fang), which add to the literature (and perhaps level of overall evidence) on comparative patien t-reported outcomes of proton vs photon for prostate cancer. We excluded the 2010 Talcott et al publication because we could not isolate the effect of PBT since it compared two different doses of combined proton beam and photon therapies. Added Fang 2014 39 5 In the lung sections, it may be worthwhile for the authors to examine whether IMRT is deemed \"standard of care\" for this disease. I think many insurers do not cover IMRT routinely for lung ca ncer radiation treatment. This consideration provides important practical insight to the reader of this re view, in terms of the proton vs 3DCRT (standard) and proton vs IMRT (not standard) comparisons. Defining the standard of care is outside of the scope of this review as it may vary across health systems and over time and may inc orporate other information ( eg, clinical expert input, cost, adherence) 40 5 For prostate cancer, it is important to note that the randomized trial of PBT+photon vs photon alone used different doses in the 2 arms. This is an important detail that was left out of the review. Some would interpret the data from this trial to suggest that proton can be used to safely increase dose of prostate cancer radiation without increasing toxic ity. It is also important to note that the photon used in this trial was not IMRT. So this trial does not directly provide evidence on the toxicity outcomes of PBT vs IMRT for prostate cancer. We amended the discussion of PBT+photon versus photon alone in the prostate cancer section to include information on the delivered dose in each treatment group of the three included studies. 41 5 Table 4 and other tables: it would be helpful to label the outcomes. For example \"7 -year cumu lative local recurrence: Thank you for the suggestion. We labeled all outcomes by treatment group in tables throughout the report. Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 115 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE 11% vs 4%\" - which is PBT and which is photon? I can give a good guess based on the data, but labeling this in the Tables would be even better. 42 5 Page 38, the significant space used for criticisms of the Sheets et al study seems way out of proportion with the rest of the document, and suggests bias by the authors. As the authors note, all of the literature comparing PBT to photons have significant flaws - but the criticisms of this one study took up almost an entire page of space and seems unusual. The language of \"widely criticized\" to describe this study seems especially harsh, especially given the context that the 3 cited letters- to-the editor all cam e from physicians from proton centers, who may have inherent bias and financial conflicts of interest. To provide full disclosure, I am one of the authors of that study and am able to provide further insight on the limitations of the study. The reason tha t critiques were not all fully answered was because of the significant JAMA word count limitations for author responses. The criticism of using surrogate measures and data from few proton institutions - apply to all SEER -Medicare studies (include Kim et a l, and Yu et al), not just the Sheets study. Frankly, until 2006, there were only 2- 3 proton centers treating prostate cancer in total. I believe it is inappropriate to directly translate results from the Sheets study to institutional series. The instituti onal series reported % of patients with toxicity attributed to radiation treatment. The Sheets (and Yu and Kim) studies examined % of patients who had a diagnosed GI or GU morbidity, or had GI or GU procedures after radiation treatment. These are very different outcomes, and one cannot be calculated to compare to the other. Patients can have GI or GU diagnosed morbidity or procedures not related to radiation treatment, which are counted We streamlined our discussion of the Kim 2011 and Sheets 2012 weaknesses to focus on the similar and well-accepted problems in both with exposure and outcome assessment methods: \"GI toxicity at 4 -5 years. Two fair -quality, population- based retrospective cohort studies of Medicare claims data linked to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database provide low -strength evidence of an increased risk of late GI toxicit y at 4 -5 years (Table 16).9,10 The first of the SEER -database studies, by Kim et al, included patients diagnosed with early -stage localized prostate cancer between 1992 and 2005 and used ICD -9 or CPT procedure codes to assess grade 3 to 4 bleeding, ulceration, fistula, stricture, and colostomy that developed at least 6 months after diagnosis and required intervention.9 The second of the SEER -database studies, by Sheets et al, assessed risk of unspecified GI morbidity -related procedures (including colonoscopy) and diagnoses that occurred at least 12 months after diagnosis in patients diagnosed with early - stage prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007. 10 The main limitations of both studies include their high potential for exposure and outcome misclassification biases.67-69 Regarding exposure ascertainment, risk of bias was high because dose and field size specifics were unknown; therefore, the increased risk of late GI toxicity with PBT may have been entirely due to higher doses. Regarding outcome ascertainment, risk of bias was high because of the questionable reliability of using surrogate procedure (including colonoscopy) and Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 116 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE as events in the SEER/Medicare studies - with unclear attribution to ra diation treatment, but with the assumption that underlying events unrelated to treatment should be similar between PBT and IMRT patients. There is an underlying \"baseline\" event rate in these elderly patients (many elderly patients have GI or GU problems anyway). But differences found in event rates between PBT and IMRT patients are possibly due to treatment outcome differences. If there is bias, the bias should favor PBT patients who are usually younger, healthier, and can travel longer distances to receiv e treatment - and therefore may have lower baseline event rates than photon patients. The criticism about photon with lower dose than PBT: this applies to all 3 SEER/Medicare studies. Further, the Sheets study directly addresses the common claim by proton center physicians that proton treatment can deliver a higher dose to the prostate safely, therefore increase cure rate compared to IMRT. In fact, if indeed PBT patients received a modestly higher dose than IMRT in the Sheets study, the results do not supp ort these claims - there was no higher cure rate, and morbidity was higher. diagnosis code -based measures to detect the actual clinical events of interest. Also, both studies may suffer from potential confounding by study site since likely a high majority of proton patients were treated at the single Loma Linda study site, whereas IMRT patients were likely treated at a variety of sites.\" 43 5 Applicability section, page 52: \"more or less experience.\" It is unlikely that newer proton facilities would have \"more\" experience compared to the facil ities that have been treating patients for many years/decades. We changed this sentence to read: \"First, the majority of the proton beam treatment groups came from one of 3 proton facilities that are among the oldest in operation (Loma Linda, MD Anderson, or Massachusetts General). It is unclear whether the patient outcomes of these centers would generalize to other facilities with less experience treating patients and that may have difference standards of care.\" 44 5 Page 53: It is worth noting that some dosimetric comparison studies show that PBT can have worse dose distribution compared to IMRT.

I would replace \"hemangiomas\" throughout the whole review with \"uveal hemangiomas.\" We made this change throughout the report. 48 6 Page 5: Table 2: Prostate row \" -vs IMRT\": the Yu et al. study found a transiently lower GU toxicity for 0- 6 months after treatment but no long term differences. This is a potential advantage. For the dis advantage row \"- PBT + photon vs photon alone:\" the comparison is a little difficult to make as the \"PBT+photon\" was a higher dose than the photon alone. The study cited (Shipley et al) was testing PBT as a boost therapy. This would be clearer if the ro w reads \" -PBT Boost + Photon vs photon alone\". Furthermore, the Shipley et al study used much older radiotherapy techniques, and so should not be indicative of current outcomes and is of limited relevance. The same can be said for Duttenhaver et al. Added evidence on transient GU advantage at 6 months We altered our discussion of both Shipley et al. 1995 and Duttenhaver et al 1983 to emphasize that these studies used a \"boost\" of protons in addition to photon therapy and that this combined group received a larger overall dose compared with the group that recei ved photon treatment only. 49 6 Page 9 - line 60: \"with 9 additional centers under construction.\" I believe 10 centers are under construction (Mayo is constructing 2 centers in different locations).

Though there were higher rectal bleeding with PBT boost, it was a higher dose of radiation (75.6 CGE vs 67.2 Gy). Duttenhaver et al also used a higher dose for the proton arm. This is also noted above in comment 3. We a ltered our discussion of both Shipley et al. 1995 and Duttenhaver et al 1983 to emphasize that these studies used a \"boost\" of protons in addition to photon therapy and that this combined group received a larger overall dose compared with the group that re ceived photon treatment only. 53 6 Page 26: General comment re: CNS cancers.

Thank you. 60 7 As key examples of this rapid obsolence, while the repo rt was being commissioned, several new pieces of data were presented at the PTCOG -NA meeting in October 2014, and most of these have not made it into the current report. We thank the reviewer for this information. We reviewed the abstract book from the Oct ober 2014 PTCOG- NA meeting and identified one comparative study on head and neck cancer which we now include in that section of the report (Abstract #33, P.B. Romesser, O. Cahlon, E. Scher, Y. Zhou, T. Leven, R. Wong, N. Riaz, S. McBride, N.Y. Lee). 61 7 A second important example of the rapidly shifting field, is the update to the NCCN guidelines; for example, the 2015 Prostate Cancer NCCN guidelines now include the following phrase: \"conventionally fractionated prostate proton therapy can be considered a reasonable alternative to x- ray based regimens at clinics with appropriate technology, physics, and clinical expertise.\" (The 2014 version provided as follows: \"proton therapy is not recommended for routine use at this time. Research hasn't shown proton beams to be the same or better for treating prostate cancer than conventional external beams.\") This is a very clear example of how within 1 year, there is a dramatic change even in NCCN coverage language relative to protons. Further examples of this signif icant and rapid change in recommendations will be highlighted in disease -specific categories. Thank you for this information. We added the most recent guidelines issues by the NCCN regarding PBT for prostate cancer: \" An ongoing prospective randomized trial is accruing patients and comparing prostate proton therapy to prostate IMRT. The NCCN panel believes there is no clear evidence supporting a benefit or decrement to proton therapy over IMRT for either treatment efficacy or long -term toxicity. Conventional ly fractionated prostate proton therapy can be considered a reasonable alternative to X -ray based regimens at clinics with appropriate technology, physics, and clinical expertise.\" 62 7 Pencil Beam Scanning (PBS) Intensity Modulated Proton We discuss PBS in the Introduction, but added a Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 120 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE Therapy (IMPT): In the last 3+ years, a dramatic technological change has occurred in this field, ie the rapid and almost immediate adaptation of PBS IMPT over the historic spread -out Bragg peak (SOBP) approach; this is widely, and almost universally recognized as having multiple advantages such as superior dosimetry, and more importantly the robust ability to expand the reach of proton therapy into various organ sites and disease categories, not histori cally treated with SOBP because of technical limitations; this major technological advance potentially has huge clinical implications and the development and consequences of this aspect have largely been ignored in this report; going forward, significant d ata are expected to emerge for PBS, and therefore, a focus on this technology is crucial for any such report. mention of the lack of studies on the newer PBT delivery systems and methods ( ie, pencil beam scanning) to the 'Gaps in Evidence' section of the Discussion 63 7 Breast Cancer: This disease has historically not been the focus of proton therapy, primarily because prior to approximately 3+ years ago, the technology did not permit easy delivery of whole breast and regional nodal irradiation, a scenario that has changed dramaticall y with the advent of PBS IMPT. Therefore, it is now technically feasible to expand the role of proton therapy to much beyond partial breast irradiation, which is what was p rimari ly discussed in the VA report. Two key clinical facts have also created a \"perfect storm\". There are now 2 randomized clinical trials that underscore the fact that in several subcategories, regional nodal irradiation, especially internal mammary (IM) irradiation improves overall survival, making this an integral component of future therapeutic approaches (Budach, 2013). An unfortunate consequence of this is the guaranteed increase in cardiac dose, relative to treatment planning that avoids the interna l mammary nodal chain. A seminal long- term cohort study published in the NEJM in 2013 by Darby et al, very convincingly established that the adverse cardiac outcome risk level is directly proportional to the mean heart radiation dose, and therefore, althou gh IM irradiation is Added: \"With the advent of intensity -modulated proton therapy (IMPT), it may now be more feasible to expand the role of PBT beyond partial breast irradiation. However, we found no IMPT for whole breast or nodal irradiation. It will be important to consider whether IMPT can improve on the 7.4% -per-gray rate for major coronary events within the first 5 years observed in a population- based case- control study of 2168 women who underwent external radiotherapy for breast cancer between 1958 and 2001 in Sweden and Denmark. 56\" Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 121 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE now the new standard, women receiving this will be expected to have a categorical increase in late adverse cardiac events, some delayed by 10+ years, as a consequenc e of increased mean heart dose. Numerous dosimetric studies in the literature have demonstrated the categorical, and unquestioned superiority of proton beam therapy over photon therapy (something that is analogous to an in- silico randomized trial) in ter ms of decreasing cardiac dose. Further, as more and more cardiotoxic systemic therapies, such as Adriamycin, and anti -her2 agents are combined in the management of non- metastatic breast cancer, the risk to these women of developing late cardiac toxicities should not be underestimated; in this context, relying on the low level evidence regarding the MGH partial breast irradiation papers is not an appropriate approach to making a determination regarding the development of VA recommendations for whole breast and nodal irradiation, especially because a short -sighted approach could result in subjecting a large number of women with breast cancer to late cardiotoxicity which may not become apparent for a decade or more, and in addition to the negative clinical consequences of this approach, the global cost of managing these cardiac toxicities would most likely exceed the up -front investment in treating s uch women with proton therapy. The VA should therefore seriously consider either launching its own trial, or whole -heartedly supporting the randomized and non- randomized efforts currentl y in development to test proton vs photon therapy for breast cancer, at least for women who need whole breast and/or chest wall irradiation, especially in the event that they also need IM irradiation, and also for those women who have other un derlying card iac risk factors. This is an absolutely key healthcare consideration, and a major focus of the future VA effort, in cognizance of the dramatic increase of women as a proportion of our veterans. 64 7 Prostate Cancer: The biochemical progression free survival Yes, we agree that dose cons iderations are key and we Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 122 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE improves as function of dose, and modern conventionally fractionated approaches requires doses in the order of 78+ Gy. are hopeful they are being better addressed in ongoing studies. The dose in the new Fang 2014 study, for example, was 79.2 Gy. 7 Prostate Cancer: Retrospective comparisons of databases, most notably the SEER database suggests that the disease- related clinical outcomes are comparable for photon versus proton treated patients, and some toxicities might in fact be higher in frequency i n the proton cohort. These retrospective comparisons, in fact, are seriously flawed; radiation toxicities are a function, among other things, of total dose. In the comparative studies that have been referenced, no dose - correction was applied; in fact most proton patients were treated to higher doses. Further, most of the proton patients received a combination of photons and protons, and the reported toxicitie s are largely artefactual because of the fact that the photon treated patients were not on any trials, whereas several of the proton treated patients were, with the trial requiring a more intense level of scrutiny, including the use of endoscopies, one of the endpoints repo rted on by the Shelby study. Yes we fully agree with this reviewer's criticism and have discussed in detail their high potential for exposure and outcome misclassification biases 65 7 Prostate Cancer: The very large University of Florida experience with protons which reports (in a non -randomized context, and therefore subject to bias) some of the best clinical outcomes for prostate cancer following radiotherapy, ever reported (Hoppe et al, IJROBP, 2014). We clarified with the reviewer tha t he is referencing: Mendenhall NP, Hoppe BS, Romaine NC, et al. Five - year outcomes from 3 prospective trials of image - guided proton therapy for prostate cancer. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys . 2014;88(3):596- 602. This is a noncomparative study in which all patients received proton beam therapy. We had already been aware of this study, but did not discuss its findings because it did not compare outcomes with any other radiation modality. Although its results are promising, as the study authors themselves admi t, it does not address remaining concerns about comparative effectiveness. 66 7 Prostate Cancer: The elegant very recently reported case - matched study of protons versus photons for prostate cancer Thank you for this information. We added Fang 2014 to our analysis. Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 123 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE from the University of Pennsylvania, which does not show the increase in rectal/GI toxicities and colonoscopies attributed to the SEER study (Fang 2014). 67 7 Prostate Cancer: The very significant comparative effectiveness study of patient -reported outcomes after proton therapy or intensity -modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer (Hoppe et al, cancer 2014) which compared patient -reported quality- of- life (QOL) outcomes after proton therapy (PT) and intensity - modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer, performed on prospectively collected QOL data using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire. PT was delivered to 1243 men at doses from 76 to 82 Gy. IMRT was delivered to 204 men who were included in the Prostate Cancer Outcomes and Satisfaction with Treatment Quality Assessment (PROSTQA) study in doses from 75.6 Gy to 79.4 Gy. No differences were observed in summary score chan ges for bowel, urinary incontinence, urinary irritative/obstructive, and sexual domains between the 2 cohorts. However, more men who received IMRT reported moderate/big problems with rectal urgency (P = 0.02) and frequent bowel movements (P = 0.05) than me n who received PT. These outcomes highlight the need for further comparative studies of PT and IMRT. We agree that the Hoppe et al study published in Cancer in 2014 provides important information on QOL outcomes for prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT or PBT. This study has already been included in our discussion of IMRT vs PBT for prostate cancer. 68 7 Prostate Cancer: Proton therapy has become widely accepted as a key standard of care by thousands of men with prostate cancer, especially when it co mes to assessing patient satisfaction, and reporting patient -based outcomes; in fact the quality of data for proton therapy far exceeds anything that is available for photon therapy in this context, especially when one reco gnizes the \"power of numbers\". As an example, at the National proton Conference in April 2014, the National Association of Proton Therapy (NAPT) released a patient - centered report on the outcomes following proton therapy for Thank you for this information. Since we did not include patient satisfaction as an outcome and the report that you reference did not compare prostate cancer patients that re ceived photon modalities, this study does not meet our inclusion criteria. Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 124 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE prostate cancer in almost 4000 men treated at 12 different proto n centers, with the following key observations: 1. 96% have recommended proton therapy to others 2. 98% rated their proton therapy experience as \"excellent\" or \"good\" 3. 98% believed they made the best treatment decision for themselves 4. 96% were \"satisf ied\" or \"extremely satisfied\" with their proton therapy treatment 5. 85% reported that their quality of life was \"better than\" or \"the same as\" before their treatment. Collectively, these data very strongly suggest that modern proton therapy, especially P BS, deserves to be seriously incorporated and evaluated as an option for men with prostate cancer, either in the context of a prospective longitudinal multi - institutional cohort study, or a randomized trial, with the VA being a key player in either or both efforts, given the extremely high patient satisfaction ratings for this therapy. 69 7 Lung Cancer: For NSCLC, the factual elements in play are a categorical dose- response relationship favoring higher dose radiotherapy in terms of improved loco- regional control, but the review also categorically demonstrates that the major US trial seeking a survival benefit from this dose- escalation strategy failed; however, there are several important observations that are missed in this top -line conclusion: a. There is already a previous, randomized phase III trial from China that shows a categorical survival improvement with higher doses (Chen et al., 2013). b. More detailed analysis of the RTOG trial demonstrates that the likely cause of \"endpoint failure\" was excess toxiciti es associated with higher doses, especially higher cardiac and pulmonary doses (Cox et al., 2012). c. An analysis of technique in the RTOG trial shows that when \"tissue -sparing\" IMRT techniques were employed (in We agree that these studies do not provide conclusive evidence on the comparative effectiveness of PBT and look forward to evidence from additional ongoing RCTs Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 125 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE comparison to 3 -D techniques), patient repor ted QOL (using the FACT -L TOI tool) was superior, and translated to a survival benefit, underscoring the enormous significance of decreasing cardiac and lung dose, something that PBS has been shown in several dosimetric studies to achieve readily. At this point, several randomized trials are evaluating the photon versus proton question in various stages and clinical presentation of NSCLC, and the VA would be ideally positioned to contribute to this in a major way. 70 7 Esophageal Cancer: The review appropriately summarizes the data, in particular highlighting the key observation of decreased mortali ty in the context of trimodality therapy, in favor of proton therapy, underscoring the need and value in supporting such an approach, ideally in a prospective multi -institutional registry trial, or perhaps even through a prospective randomized trial. Thank you for confirming our findings. 71 7 Medulloblastoma : This is an uncommon disease in the adult context; however, the data that exist show a very dramatic reduction in several toxicities, and given the very dramatic toxicities from photon therapy for large field irradiation, especially craniospinal, this sho uld be considered as a default indication in favor of proton therapy. Thank you for confirming our findings. 72 7 Head and Neck Cancer: Emerging data from the ongoing randomized MDACC trial very strongly favor consideration of PBS IMPT in several forms o f H/N cancer. The extent of reduction in radiation dose to several H/N substructures is very dramatic, and emerging data regarding acute toxicities and cost effectiveness lean toward IMPT. Given the relatively high incidence of this diagnosis in the VA pat ient population, a major opportunity exists to support the ongoing trials and categorically establish the value in this disease. We look forward to the final results of the MDACC trial. 73 7 Ocular Tumors: Although not reviewed, PBT is an obvious choice for these tumors. Agreed. It was not reviewed because the VA already covers PBT for ocular melanomas. Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 126 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE 74 7 Skull base and Brain Tumors: For several tumors in this category, such as chordoma, chondrosarcoma, and possibly craniopharyngioma , low grade glioma, meningioma, etc., PBS IMPT is the logical therapy; for example, the high radiation doses necessary to control chordoma simply cannot be delivered with photon therapy; meningiomas represented a logical target for PBS IMPT, given that rad iation the the meningeal surface is one of the few known causes of this condition, and photons would irradiate a dramatically larger volume of meninges, etc. Agreed. At least some of these tumors are already covered by the VA. 75 7 Combination therapy ap proaches: Increasingly, in several malignancies, combination chemoradiotherapy is becoming the defacto standard. This combination is frequently associated with profound myelotoxicity and two pieces of data have recently become very clear: a. Proton therapy decrease myelotoxicity in comparison to photon therapy. b. Treatment -induced lymphopenia is associated with inferior survival in several disease types, and inadvertent irradiation of the circulating lymphocyte compartment is a major causative factor in t his. PBT would very likely diminish this. The additional recognition in the last 2+ years that up- regulation of effector T cells can dramatically improve cancer outcomes in several malignancies underscores the major need to use therapies with the lowest lik elihood of treatment -associated lymphopenia, and PBS would be much better suited for this purpose, compared to IMRT. We confirmed with the reviewer that the data sources supporting his statement (a) about decreased myelotoxicity with proton vs photon are: Komaki R. Reduction of bone marrow suppression for patients with stage III NSCLC treated by protons and chemotherapy compared with IMRT and chemotherapy. The Particle Therapy Cooperative Group (PTCOG) 47 Conference; May 19- 24 2008; Jacksonville, FL and Kra use M, Baumann M. [Reduced acute toxicity for adults with proton beam craniospinal irradiation]. Strahlenther Onkol. 2014;190(1):111- 112. As a conference abstract, Komaki 2008 lacks adequate detail about methodology to fully as sess its internal validity (eg, patient selection and outcome ascertainment methods, baseline characteristics, statistical methods, N analyzed). Krause 2014 is in German and our methods do not include translation of non -English articles. 76 7 Conclusion: The purpose of this report is to synthesize the evidence supporting the role/value of proton therapy, specifically in terms of assisting the VA in making further recommendations as to how to approach this modality. My summary comments should provide strong rationale for Thank you. Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 127 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE pursuing this in a logical, organized, and structured manner, and if done smartly, without a dramatic escalation in cost -of-care. 77 8 Overall, I think there is confusion in what is toxici ty due to proton beam itself vs proton beam techniques. Proton beam is a relatively young technology. Although centers have been using this technology for 2+ decades, the overall number is low (just 2 - Loma Linda and MGH). Of the 14 currently operating proton centers, 12 have been trea ting for less than 10 years. As a result, techiques are still evolving. In contrast, there are probably ~3000 RT centers in operation today. If you look at the metric of \"proton years\" vs \"IMRT years\", it's probably 150 years vs 30,000 years. This is not m eant to be a soapbox defense of proton beam, but rather an explanation of what should be considered by the reviewers. Added to conclusion: \"Because this is still a rapidly evolving field, with ongoing efforts to improve techniques and reduce costs, this r eview may need more frequent updating to keep up- to-date with emerging research\" 78 8 I think in lung cancer, the Sejpal MDA manuscript, along with other manuscripts from MDA, indicate that much higher doses of RT can b e delivered with proton beam vs either 3D conformal RT or IMRT and result in much lower complication rates. Yes, we agree that Sejpal found lower Grade 3 esophagitis for PBT vs 3D -CRT and IMRT in a subgroup of 202 patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy. 79 8 For prostate cancer, there are now 6 dose escalation studies. All 6 showed that higher doses lead to higher biochemical control rates. But 5 of 6 studies showed increased GI complication risks with dose escalation. The 6th study used proton beam for the final RT boost (PROG 9509, Zietman JCO 2010) and showed the same complication rates in the low and high dose arms. In looking at these 6 studies together, it is very reasonable to conclude that the only method in which dose escalation in prostate cancer has been shown to feasible WITHOUT an increase in GI toxicity is with the use of proton beam. Yes, this is a reasonable inference to make based on comparing findings from high vs low dose comparisons of proton beam to high vs low dose comparisons of non-proton beam modalities; yet, that didn't translate into an actual GI toxicity advantage based on direct evidence from a head -to-head comparison of proton beam vs IMRT in the newest Fang 2014 study. Added dose escalation studies to the report. 80 8 If the She ets article is to be used, then the comparison of the 6 dose-escalation studies should also be used. The Sheets article has multiple flaws, not the least of which was the use of a Yes, we agree that the Sheets article has multiple flaws which we have described in detail and have cited the JAMA letters to the editor. Comparative Effectiveness of Proton Irradiation Treatment Evidence- based Synthesis Program 128 Comment # Reviewer # REVIEWER COMMENT RESPONSE surrogate marker (colonoscopcies) to quantify GI morbidity. No one knows the indications for ordering the colonoscopies. The letter to the editor from Mendenhall, Shields, and Slater in JAMA outlined the flaws in the Sheets article. Also added comparison of dose escalation studies: \"Some dose -escalation studies have found increased GI complication risks with increased dose of photons,65 but not with protons.66 But when compared he ad-to- head in prostate cancer, proton beam has only transiently reduced risk of 6 -month acute GU toxicity versus IMRT, but may incr ease risk of late GI toxicity after 4 -5 years .\" 81 8 Finally, secondary malignancies may well be lower with the use of proton beam RT. The article from Chung et al only examined one side, if protons had a higher rate of radiation induced malignanices than X -rays. They found a lower rate of second cancers in the matched populations. Yes, Chung's finding can seem promising, but it provided insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions at this time due to its high potential for unmeasured confounding due to higher missing data but superior outcome ascertainment methods in the proton group and unknown radiation dose.
