Fo and Tv have immunomodulatory properties which may increase antibody titers in response to vaccination more than vaccination alone. However, because they are also immunomodulatory - not purely immune-stimulating - they may have the added benefit of simultaneously decreasing vaccine-related side effects following COVID-19 vaccination. The study aims to establish the safety and feasibility of the use of FoTv vs placebo; evaluate the effect on post-vaccination clinical symptoms, neutralizing antibody, and immune response in 45 total subjects |Study groups and multiple measurements across study time-points| |Masking:||Triple Primary Date :||May FoTv The dosage of FoTv is 8 capsules three times a day for 4 consecutive days. It does not need to be consumed with food. It is best taken at least 30 minutes before OR at least 60 minutes after meals, in the morning, noon and evening. Accidentally missed doses will not need to be taken at a later time but will be recorded in a daily diary. Should swallowing capsules be an issue, they can be opened and dispensed into water or juice for easy ingestion. | Dietary Supplement: FoTv | Fomitopsis Officinalis and Trametes Versicolor | Placebo Comparator: Placebo | Placebo: organic brown rice The dosage of Placebo is 8 capsules three times a day for 4 consecutive days. It does not need to be consumed with food. It is best taken at least 30 minutes before OR at least 60 minutes after meals, in the morning, noon and evening. Accidentally missed doses will not need to be taken at a later time but will be recorded in a daily diary. Should swallowing capsules be an issue, they can be opened and dispensed into water or juice for easy ingestion. | Dietary Supplement: FoTv | Fomitopsis Officinalis and Trametes [ Time Frame: 15 days ]The safety of the study medication will be assessed by a comparison of the serum creatinine level of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs - Aspartate transaminase concentration [ Time Frame: 15 days ]The safety of the study medication will be assessed by a comparison of the serum AST level of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs - Alanine transaminase concentration [ Time Frame: 15 days ]The safety of the study medication will be assessed by a comparison of the serum ALT level of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs - Albumine concentration [ Time Frame: 15 days ]The safety of the study medication will be assessed by a comparison of the serum albumine level of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs - Bilirubin concentration [ Time Frame: 15 days ]The safety of the study medication will be assessed by a comparison of the serum bilirubin level of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs - Electrolyte balance [ Time Frame: 15 days ]The safety of the study medication will be assessed by a comparison of the serum electrolyte levels of baseline laboratory data with end-of-treatment labs - SARS-CoV-2 Antibody titer [ Time Frame: 180 days ]The effect of study medication will be assessed by a comparison of the plasma antibody titer among subjects in active arm compared with placebo - Duration (number of days) of post-vaccination symptoms [ Time Frame: 4 days ]Objective will be to evaluate post-vaccination symptoms duration (number of days) among subjects in the active arm compared with placebo - Severity scores of post-vaccination symptoms [ Time Frame: 4 days ]Objective will be to evaluate post-vaccination symptoms severity total score among subjects in the active arm compared with placebo - Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC) immune profiling [ Time Frame: 180 days ]Exploratory objective will be to evaluate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination in the presence of FoTv compared to placebo arm Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
