TIM CROSSADMINISTRATION 23We are pleased to present the 2016 annual report for the Center of Excellence in Livestock Diseases and Human Health. Within this report, you will see highlights of 17 faculty research projects funded by the center in scal year 2016. These faculty members have made signicant advancements in cancer biology, molecular pathophysiology, host defense, regenerative medicine, and disease transmission. Center faculty also made signicant advancements in the prevention and treatment of infections and non-infectious livestock diseases that affect agricultural productivity. The 2016 return on investment, as the ratio of research expenditures to the state appropriation for the center, was 5.1:1. Benchmark data can be found on page 4 and include scal years 2012-2016. Center faculty continue to garner national and international recognition for their research and scholarship. During the 2015 calendar year, center faculty published 47 peer-reviewed articles and gave 66 presentations at regional, national, and international meetings. Despite increased scal challenges faced by our center faculty, we are incredibly proud of their efforts and continued successes. We hope you enjoy this summary presentation of center activities and accomplishments. DR.

Programs focus predominately on approaches to infectious diseases, tissue regeneration, host defense, molecular genetics, and carcinogenesis through cellular and in vivo research. Since its inception, the center has developed investigative areas in Animal Models and Comparative Medicine and Mechanisms of Disease, Pathogenesis, and Immunity. Innovative, sophisticated, and contemporary, developments have played critical and unique roles within the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine (UTCVM) as well as the Institute of Agriculture (UTIA). These areas of research often overlap to address problems in animals, people and the environment and embody the \"One Health\" concept.7Investigator Federal IndustryFoundation / Private University International Total 571,239 $ 571,239 $ Anderson, David 142,368 for grants.Research Funded* Externally - FY 2016 Investigator Federal IndustryFoundation / Private University International Total Almeida, Ra\u00fal 430,030$ 308,957$ 738,987 $ Anderson, David 108,552 Caldwell, Marc 28,565 $ Wang, Robert $ 389 $ 135,420 $ Totals 1,972,613 501,929 $ 3,688 $ 54,659 $ 2,536,980$ Research Expenditures - FY 20168CRITERIA FOR FUNDING SCIENTIFIC MERIT POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO EXTERNAL FUNDING RELEVANCE TO THE CENTER'S OBJECTIVES FUNDING ALLOCATION TKe Center of ([cellence in tKe c Xrrent tiPeV d Xe to a national trend intra-articular allograft \u0007\u0014\u0013\u000f\u0013\u0013\u0013 AMY HODSHON Investigating the role of infection in chronic intervertebral disc herniations in dogs \u0007\u0018\u000f\u0013\u0013\u0013 CASSIE LUX MRI characteristics of splenic tumors, advanced training in interventional radiology, and new laparoscopic surgery equipment \u0007\u0014\u0013\u000f\u0013\u0013\u0013 CHIKA OKAFOR Epidemiology of the use of antimicrobials in animals \u0007\u0018\u000f\u0013\u0013\u0013 DEANNA SCHAEFER Hematology and biochemical reference interval calculation for alpacas using two hematology systems, including evaluation for optimal settings in automated hematologic assessment \u0007\u0018\u000f\u0013\u0013\u0013 9MEE-JA SULA Diagnostic investigation of clinical cases that characterize reproductive disease in non-domestic felids \u0007\u0014\u0018\u000f\u0013\u0013\u0013 JOHN SCHAEFER Diagnostic techniques for toxoplasmosis, a zoonotic protozoal disease of particular risk to pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals \u0007\u0015\u000f\u0018\u0013\u0013 INFRASTRUCTURE & SUPPLIES TKe center SroPoteV tKe reVearcK infraVtrXctXre tKe reVearcK enter in \u0015\u0013\u0014\u0019\u000f tKe center f digital i Paging of Srotein and '1$ VaPSleV V and \u000f & EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH SYMPOSIUM TKe center KaV Eeen a PaMor VSonVor of XVing tKiV year on One Well-Being \u0011 7Ke VyPSoV to gain e [Serience VKoZcaVing t Keir Pedicine at t 8niYerVity of Calgary DR.
