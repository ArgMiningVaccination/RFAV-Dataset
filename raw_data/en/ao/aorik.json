{"title": "Ancillary Services in Pediatric Departments of USA", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2020-09-03", "cleaned_text": "Recently, there has been a rapid expansion of ancillary services and complimentary medicine in healthcare in pediatric settings world-wide. It is estimated that >50% of children in North America who have chronic diseases use some form of complementary therapy every year. Another study conducted in 20 European countries involving 68% of the European population, showed that complementary medicine (example acupuncture) was offered in private practices in all the countries [4]. Recently a large national survey with an 84% response rate, conducted in the USA reported that 74% employed a massage therapist, 53% a music therapist and 22% an art therapist [5]. A systematic review on the prevalence of use of complementary/alternative medicine varied from 9 to 65% [6]. In 2020, a survey on music therapists working in pediatric medical settings in the United States found that such services have become a standard of care in many pediatric hospitals across the United States [7]. Currently all children's hospitals and community hospitals with medium and large pediatric units in the United States provide various services like - Child life specialist, art and music therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, medical clowning and many more. Further, many pediatric units have school teachers to help children catch up with missed homework and earn credits with the work done during hospitalization. In the following sections we will discuss each of the ancillary services in detail to appreciate their roles in a hospitalized child. 1. Still, GF.
