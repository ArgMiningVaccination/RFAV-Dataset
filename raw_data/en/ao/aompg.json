It makes my inner Mermaid very happy. And while I cleanse energetically before and after each healing session with different frequencies and sacred smoke, there is something about the deep cleanse that the ocean has to offer. Cleansing body, mind and spirit in an effortless, soothing, gentle way. During the recent intensity of the Eclipse energy I felt really supported by the energy of the ocean. As the emotions that I was feeling intensified and were coming to the surface to be released the energy of the ocean brought me back into balance and supported the releasing process. I would like to share how I approach this form of cleansing in the hope that it will serve you. For sure, just getting in the ocean is sufficient but if we approach this with more intention and focus the cleanse that is offered is much deeper. Our intentions open a portal so that spirit can assist and this assistance will flow in from different directions. Shamanism teaches us that everything is alive. And I feel as humans we know this on a deep and fundamental level. We feel invigorated and alive after spending time in nature as nature is energy and we are energy. The earth supports us by offering us the energy that we need for healing and allowing us to 'unload' anything energetically that is not for our highest good. And the ocean is the ultimate cleanser. Before I get in the ocean. I call in spirit and set my intention. My intention is to let go of anything that I have accumulated at any level of by being (physical, mental, emotional and spiritual) across all dimensions that is not for my highest good. I call in my higher self and all of the beings of light that love humanity unconditionally that would like to assist. I then hold a cup of the ocean water in my hand and ask the spirit of the water - the Water Elementals - to assist. I give thanks and hold gratitude in my heart for all that is about to occur. I also set the intention that everything that is about to be released will be transmuted into unconditional love and sent back to source. I feel that our oceans are used as a dumping ground by humans we need to learn to treat the ocean with more respect and this also extends to how we work with the ocean for cleansing. We work with the ocean rather than using it as a dumping ground. I then intend that my field is being cleared and then each of the chakras. I allow my higher mind to be open to any information that spirit would like to share about what is being cleared and any lessons or learnings that there are for me. When I finish, I sit quietly in gratitude or sometimes I just float in the ocean in gratitude. I hope this serves you well. Enjoy!!
