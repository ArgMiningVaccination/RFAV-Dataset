It describes sequence of [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) procedures, method and duration of oleation, sudation, preparatory measures for cleansing processes, signs of proper, improper and excessive administration of therapies. Mode of Action of all the [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) (five purification procedures) has been elaborated with examples. Therapeutic applicability and [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) diminishing properties of [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) therapy makes it the half of whole Ayurvedic therapeutics. Yoga, kala and karma basti are the schedules developed by acharya that can be easily employed for better results depending upon severity of the disease. Excess sitting, standing, speaking, riding, day sleep, sexual intercourse, suppression of natural urges, cooling regimens, exposure to hot sunlight, grief, anger, untimely and unwholesome food are the factors that needs to be avoided in all [Kalpana Siddhi] can be described as a guideline index for all cleansing processes described in various chapters. [Kalpa Sthana](/index.php?title=Kalpa_Sthana) deals with the formulations useful especially for [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana) (therapeutic emesis) and [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana) (therapeutic purgation). Thus, after meticulous knowledge of drugs useful for cleansing processes the clinical applicability is described. Hence Charaka named the chapter as [Kalpana Siddhi] meaning the excellence or successful application of the formulations described earlier. The chapter is formulated in a manner of answers given to the queries asked by Agnivesha which are actually meant for a brief and sequential description of the subject. Sanskrit text, Transliteration and English expound the chapter Kalpana Siddhi (Standard administration of purification procedures). Thus said Lord Atreya. [1-2] Queries of Punarvasu Atreya put forward some queries regarding [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) therapies as follows: - What are the procedures of [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma)therapies? - What is the order of their administration? - What are the signs of proper, improper and excess administration of these therapies? - What is the number of [basti](/index.php?title=Basti)(medicated enemas) to be given? - What are the properties of [basti](/index.php?title=Basti)? - Which [basti](/index.php?title=Basti)is to be given and in whom? - What are the restrictions during the course of treatment? - What should be the interval between the administrations of different therapies? - Why during [basti](/index.php?title=Basti)administration it does not enter rectum? - Why administered [basti](/index.php?title=Basti)comes out earlier than the scheduled time? - What is the cause of delay in evacuation of the administered [basti](/index.php?title=Basti)? - Why some diseases though curable do not get cured with its proper medication? Thus, in the view of welfare of society, Punarvasu who is the foremost among the physicians and who is knowledgeable in his subject replied as follows. [3-5\u00bd] Duration of days and maximum for seven days the oleation therapy can be employed as after seven days sneha becomes [satmya](/index.php?title=Satmya) i.e. undergone oleation therapy, fomentation liquefies the adhered morbid material in the fine channels of his body. [7\u00bd] Measures to be adopted before who is about to undergo [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana) should take milk and meat as well as meat-soup of domesticated aquatic and wet-land inhabiting animals as food for the excitation of [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha). Those who are about to undergo [virechana]] should be given the soup of meat of animals inhabiting in arid area and vegetables-soup added with fat which do not cause aggravation of [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha). [8-8\u00bd] Reasons for [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana) and [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) vomits without any difficulty and the person having less aggravated [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) purges well. If there is less [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha), then emetic drug causes purgation and in aggravation of [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) purgative drug leads to emesis. [9-9\u00bd] emesis as per given protocol and after emesis systematic dietary regimen with peya (thin gruel) etc. has to be followed. Thereafter, the person who has undergone oleation and fomentation therapies should be administered the best suited purgation therapy body is cleansed of the morbidities, the patient should be given as food peya (thin gruel), vilepi (thick gruel), akrita as well as krita yusha (plain and seasoned with fat vegetable juice) and akrita as well as krita rasa (plain meat soup seasoned with fat). Each of these dietary items should be given for three, two or one meal times to the persons whose body is cleansed in accordance with either pradhana (maximum), madhya (moderate) a small spark of fire gets kindled into a big and stable flame when gradually provided with dry grass, cow dung etc. similarly agni i.e. digestive strength in a purified person becomes strong and stable, capable of digesting all types of food by sequential administration of peya (thin gruel) etc.[12-12\u00bd] Characteristics of [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana), as per type of cleansing person gets vomiting or purgation as follows (while counting number of purges initial 2-3 purges having feces should a person that gets [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha), [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) and [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) in succession, who experiences clarity in epigastrium side of chest, head, sense organs and lightness in the body is considered to have undergone proper emesis. [15-15\u00bd] to sphotaka (Vescicular eruptions), kotha (urticaria), kandu (itching), discomfort in epigastrium as well as in sense organs and heaviness of the body. [16] Features of excess emesis || trmhamrcchnilakpanidrbaldihnirvaman'ti ca syt|17| tRuNmohamUrcchAnilakopanidrAbalAdihAnirvamane~ati ca syAt|17| If excess emesis is administered then it gives rise to thirst, unconsciousness, fainting, aggravation of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata), insomnia, debility proper purgation, a person experiences clarity in all channels of body, freshness in sense organs, lightness in the body, improvement in digestive strength and attains disease free status. Feces, [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta), [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) and [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) are expelled in is given improperly and inadequate then it causes vitiation of [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha), [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta), [vata](/index.php?title=Vata), suppression of digestive strength, heaviness in the body, coryza, drowsiness, vomiting, anorexia and absence of vatanulomana (reverse movement due to diminution of [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) and [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) that causes, numbness, body aches mental fatigue, tremor, insomnia, debility, black outs, insanity and hiccup. [19-19\u00bd] Follow up diet regulations on ninth day (of emesis) the person should be given ghee (if subsequently purgation is intended). Similarly, on ninth day of purgation therapy unctuous enema should be given (if medicated enema is intended to be given subsequently). For three days thereafter, the body should be massaged with medicated oil and then niruha i.e. medicated decoction enema should be given when person is not much hungry. After evacuation of enema person should be given meat soup of animals inhabiting arid forest zone or any other appropriate diet depending upon the nature of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) and the strength of digestion. Then the person should be given unctuous enema if he has not taken heavy meal, the night before and if he is fit for the same. [20-21\u00bd] Time of winter and spring seasons, unctuous enema should be given during the day time. In autumn, summer and rainy seasons, it should be administered during the night time. Care should be taken to avoid mistakes as described earlier [Cha.Sa. [Sutra Sthana](/index.php?title=Sutra_Sthana) 13/19-21] in respect evacuation of unctuous enema, the person should not take any food in the night. On the next day, food should be given to him during the day time and in the evening. Thereafter, on the second, third or fifth day unctuous enema should be given followed by niruha. Thus on every third or fifth day unctuous enema should be given while giving niruha type of medicated enema. [23-24] Number of in set of numbers in following manner: |Type of Disorder||No. of undergone purgation should avoid niruha type of medicated enema for seven days and person who has taken niruha type of medicated enema should avoid purgation therapy for seven days because it will have deleterious effects on body which is evacuated (of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) and nourishing material) by earlier cleansing process. [26] Beneficial effects of following benefits: - Prevents ageing - Promotes happiness, longevity, strength, power of digestion, intellect, voice and complexion - It accomplishes all objects. - It is harmless for children, old persons and youth. - Cures all diseases - Evacuates feces, [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha), [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta), [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)and urine - Promotes sturdiness of the body - Enriches semen and promotes strength - It cures all the diseases by removing accumulated [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha)from entire body. [27-28] Benefits of by its unctuousness, heaviness and warm properties counteracts the dryness, lightness and coldness properties of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)respectively. Administration of oil instantaneously improves complexion and digestive strength. Just as a tree irrigated with water at the root changes old blue leaves into beautiful with tender leaves and during the course of time grows to produce flowers and fruits, similarly a person changes by the administration of unctuous type of medicated enema. [29-31] Specific indications and benefits of enema ast Medicated enema in general is indicated in following cases, - Whose limbs have become stiff with contractures - Who suffer from lameness - Who are afflicted with fractures and dislocations - Whole limbs are afflicted by the movement of different types of aggravated [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) - It is also effective in distension of abdomen by [vata](/index.php?title=Vata), hard stool, colic in abdomen, other such ailments affecting pelvic region. [Basti](/index.php?title=Basti)is an excellent therapy for women who are affected with complications of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)and who are unable to conceive despite their mating with male partner. - It is also extremely useful for men having seminal debility and emaciation of the body. [32-34] Selection suffering from diseases caused due to hotness, the cooling type of enema (i.e. prepared with drugs of cold nature and not much warm) should be given and in those affected with diseases caused due to increased coldness the warm enema (i.e. prepared with drugs of hot nature and slightly warm temperature) should be given. In all cases, different types of enema containing ingredients having attributes opposite to that of etiological factors of the disease should be administered. [35] are indicated for purification, kushtha (obstinate skin diseases), prameha (obstinate urinary diseases), sthaulya (obesity) etc. nourishing type of enema should not be given. [36] Contra-indications of decoction type enema i nibaddhamAyuH||37|| Evacuating type of enema should not be given to the patients suffering from weakness, severely wounded, emaciation, extreme debility, fainting, to those who have already undergone the process of purification, and to those whose life is dependent upon the holding up of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) (morbid matter). [37] Importance all diseases origination in shakha (peripheral tissues), koshtha (visceral organs), marma (vital points of the body), urdhva (upper part of body), sarvavaya (covering entire body) and anga (individual parts of the body). [Vata](/index.php?title=Vata) is responsible for separation and combination of stool, urine, [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) etc. including other excreta and tissue elements. When it gets highly aggravated there is no remedy other than [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) for its alleviation. Therefore, [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) is considered by physicians to be the half of entire therapeutics. Some physicians even consider it as whole of the therapeutics. [38-39\u00bd] Mode The therapy that while moving in umbilical region, lumbar region, sides of the chest and pelvic regions churns up stool including all the other morbid matter located there and appropriately eliminates them with ease after oleating the body is called [basti](/index.php?title=Basti). [40-40\u00bd] niruha i.e. evacuating type of enema is administered properly then it causes proper elimination of stool, urine and flatus; promotes appetite and power of digestion; gives lightness to the ashaya; attenuates disease and restores natural health and strength. [41-41\u00bd] Signs of inadequately i.e. evacuating type of enema is not administered properly then it causes pain in head, cardiac region, anal region, urinary bladder and genital organs; edema, coryza, griping and nausea; retention of flatus of evacuative enema are similar to the symptoms to that of excessive administration of purgation therapy (as mentioned earlier). [43] Signs of proper i.e. enema gives following symptoms, - Return of administered enema with fecal matter without any obstruction. - Purifies body elements such as blood etc. - Clarifies intellect and senses - Imparts sound sleep - Causes lightness and strength in the body - Proper manifestation of natural urges without any obstruction. [44] Signs of inadequate administration of unctuous unctuous enema causes pain in lower part of the body, abdomen, arms, back and sides of the chest; gives rise to dryness and roughness of the body and obstruction in the passage of stool, urine and flatus.[45] Signs of unconsciousness, mental fatigue, exhaustion, fainting and retained for three yama (nine hours) then the body of the person gets cleansed of morbid matter. If it comes out quickly then another unctuous enema should be administered as the previous one did not produce unctuous effect in the body. [46-46\u00bd] Duration and schedule of In kala [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) the number of enema should be half of the former. In the yoga [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) the number of enema should be half [basti](/index.php?title=Basti). karma [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) twelve unctuous enemas and twelve evacuating enemas should be given alternately. Before this one unctuous enema in the beginning and at the end five unctuous enemas should be administered. In kala [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) six unctuous enemas and six evacuating enemas should be given alternately. Before this one unctuous enema in the beginning and at the end three unctuous enemas should be administered. In yoga [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) three evacuating enemas should be given. In the beginning, in the middle and at the end, total of five unctuous enemas should five, four or six unctuous enemas in patients suffering from disorders caused by [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) ( [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha)) etc. and then for the cleansing of micro channels should administer evacuating type of enema. [49-49\u00bd] Proper, inadequate and excess administration of proper body cleansing/purification his head should be consecutively anointed and fomented with the help of the palm. After ascertaining the strength of the three types of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) he should be given shirovirechana (errhine) therapy, once, twice or thrice. Appropriately administered shirovirechana gives rise to lightening of the chest and head, clarity of the senses and cleansing of the micro channels of the body. Inappropriate administration leads to adhesion of sticky material in the throat, heaviness of the head and ptyalism. Excessive administration of shirovirechana causes cutting and aching pain in head, eyes, temples, ears and leads to fainting. Excessive administration hazards should be treated with demulcent drinks and medications which are soft and liquid in nature. For the management of conditions arising out of inappropriate administration of shirovirechana the patient should be given oleation therapy and thereafter strong shirovirechana the [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) therapies are described to ensure happiness in both patient and healthy persons by promoting their strength and longevity and also curing the two courses of any [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) etc. (cleansing therapy) should be double the period required for administration of that therapy. [53\u00bd] Factors to be avoided cleansing therapies one should avoid excessive sitting, standing, speaking and riding, sleep during day time, sexual intercourse, suppression of natural urges, cooling regimens, exposure to sun, grief, anger and intake of untimely and unwholesome enema to enter smoothly: - If nozzle is clogged or inserted obliquely - If rectal passage is blocked by piles, mucus or hard stool Factors responsible for inappropriate evacuation enema: - If the path is obstructed by [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) - If enema is administered in less amount - If the enema is of for immediate evacuation of enema: - If there is sudden urge for voiding feces, flatus or urine - If there is excessive aggravation of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) - If there is lack of strength in anal muscles to retain the enema - If the enema contains ingredients which are excessively hot and strong - If the person has laxed bowel. [56-56\u00bd] Reason for failure of [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) meda (fats) and [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) then it gives rise to colic pain, numbness of the body and edema. When an ignorant physician administers sneha then they actually get aggravated. Similarly, other [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) overlap each other in their pathway and get afflicted with tissue elements of different nature. If not differentially diagnosed, these ailments do not get alleviated even though specific remedies are administered. When correct treatment is given but in low or excess doses, in inappropriate time or in wrong manner then it fails to cure diseases. [59-59\u00bd] Lord Atreya the foremost among the sages described the successful administration of [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) for the well being of the people in the form of answer to the twelve queries. [60-61\u00bd] Tattva Vimarsha (Fundamental Principles) [Siddhi Sthana](/index.php?title=Siddhi_Sthana)implies the concept of reproducibility in therapeutic administration as sidhhi is achieved not by chance, but by the characteristics of repeatability. [Snehana](/index.php?title=Snehana)(oleation) is necessary for pacification of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata), internal unctuousness for smooth passage, and reducing obstruction. [Swedana](/index.php?title=Swedana)(fomentation) leads to liquification of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha)in micro-circulation. - Duration for oleation therapy depends upon the sensitivity of gastro-intestinal tract of an individual also termed as koshtha. - Oleation and fomentation cleanse vitiated [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha)adhered to cells of microchannels causing obstruction and normal functioning of the micro-functional units of the body. [Vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana)can give best results when [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha)is aggravated. [Virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana)can produce best results when [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta)is aggravated and [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha)is less. If [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha)is not aggravated then the key mechanism of distension of stomach, excess salivary secretions and nausea fails to initiate vomiting thus drug passes to the intestine and causes purgation. On contrary if [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha)is highly aggravated then drug for purgation may lead to vomiting due to above said mechanism. This is the probable reason for specific diet before cleansing processes. - Significance of samsarjana krama: Till regeneration of new flora and proper mucosal barrier, the diet needs to be light to digest and solid food is gradually increased. - Pittanta (when [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta)is expelled at the end) and kaphanta (when [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha)is expelled at the end) are the end points of [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana)and [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana)karma respectively. - Signs and symptoms of improper cleansing should be carefully observed for appropriate timely management. - A gap of eight days is very much necessary to regain the normal functioning of digestive tract after cleaning therapy before giving anuvasana (unctuous enema) or oleation. - The status of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha)shall be examined properly to decide suitable purification process and duration between two consequent purifications. [Basti](/index.php?title=Basti)is best treatment for [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)disorders. Niruha (evacuative enema with decoction) is generally given for purification purpose in case of diseases with obstructive [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)pathology. Anuvasana (unctuous enema) is generally given for nourishment purpose in case of diseases with degenerative [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)pathology. - Samsarjana karma ( post-purification therapeutic measures) in terms of specific diet and lifestyle are important to attain maximum effect of administered purification. Vidhi Vimarsha (Applied Inferences ) Charaka has described formulations useful for [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) procedures, methods of their preparation, their applications and successful management of any complications if arise. Thus the name [Siddhi Sthana](/index.php?title=Siddhi_Sthana) implies to the knowledge that gives excellence in [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) therapies. It also ensures the concept of reproducibility in therapeutic administration as sidhhi is achieved not by chance, but by the characteristics of repeatability. Queries asked by Agnivesha The word kalpana refers to the application of [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) which is considered as main treatment among Ayurvedic therapeutics. Thus the whole [Siddhi Sthana](/index.php?title=Siddhi_Sthana) is devoted by Charaka to elaborate these measures. The queries asked by Agnivesha can be considered as an abstract of [Siddhi Sthana](/index.php?title=Siddhi_Sthana) because the whole section deals with the topics related to these questions.(verse 3-6) Duration of oleation therapy Those with mridu (mild) koshtha become easily oleated as [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) is less compared to other [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) thus oleation is not hampered or attenuated at any point, giving early results. In addition [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) is said to be responsible for mridu koshtha which itself has snigdha property which assists the oleation. On contrary krura koshtha individuals have [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) dominance in the digestive system that hampers the oleation to some extent by virtue of dry nature of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) hence it takes maximum i.e. seven days duration to complete oleation. Also as per the dhatu-parinaman (way how [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu) are produced) concept, minimum seven days duration is must for taking any nutritional property to the deepest i.e. [shukra dhatu](/index.php?title=Shukra_dhatu). Madhyama koshtha individuals may get oleated in 5 days which is midpoint of limits. This is because madhyama koshtha individuals have dominance of [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) or sama [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) status. [Kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) also has snigdha property but has stagnant and slow nature due to which sneha may take some extra time as compared to that of mridu koshtha. Thus seven days seems to be the maximum possible limit for oleation therapy after which it is said that sneha becomes habituated that indicates the fact that body's capacity to digest fats increases, as more and more fats are consumed. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, high-fat feeding is associated with increased production of bile acid required for fat metabolism [[1]](#cite_note-1). Consequently, a high-fat diet elevates the fecal concentration of bile acids that is responsible for increased intestinal permeability [[2]](#cite_note-2). [Snehapana](/index.php?title=Snehapana&action=edit&redlink=1) (internal oleation) is intended for creating asathmyata (non-acceptability). It is neither absorbed or assimilated upto 7 days in shodhananga (purification purpose). If exceeds 7 days, body will assimilate the sneha which is not intended in shodhananga sneghapana. However, if patient is not oleated in 7 days then it can be continued a little more or after break of few days whole procedure can be repeated.(verse 7) Effect of oleation and fomentation therapy Vitiated [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) as explained by Charaka can be considered to be the morbid matter adhering at cellular levels thus obstructing normal functioning of the micro-functional units of the body. Sneha consumption causes oleation of all body parts including cell membrane and other microcellular components. Cell membrane is basically made up of phospholipid bilayer [[3]](#cite_note-3) . Thus due to oleation sneha goes inside easily clearing the channels and dissolving impurities into it. These impurities along with fats are removed out of cell and other organic systems of the body by fomentation that increases the body temperature, opens up all channels and facilitate the transfer of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) towards bowel. (verse 7-8) Diet before [shodhana](/index.php?title=Shodhana) and reasons for [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana) and [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana) working in opposite ways In [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana), [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) utklesha(excited) is expected which is evident by excess salivation, nausea etc. These factors plays an important role in induction of vomiting. The vagal and enteric nervous system inputs transmit information regarding the state of the gastrointestinal system. Irritation of the GI mucosa by any drug or distension activates the 5-HT3 receptors of these inputs [[4]](#cite_note-4). Thus if [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) is not aggravated then the key mechanism of distension of stomach, excess salivary secretions and nausea fails to initiate vomiting thus drug passes to the intestine and causes purgation. On contrary if [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) is highly aggravated then drug for purgation may lead to vomiting due to above said mechanism. This is the probable reason for specific diet before cleansing processes. (verse 8-10) Post therapeutic measures (samsarjana krama) Duration of post therapeutic measures varies with type/quality of cleansing. This is directly related to the extent of changes brought by cleansing the digestive system and duration required to regain its normal functioning. Mucosal layer in the digestive tract plays important functions like barrier to protect from acids, maintaining optimal immune function, proper digestion and assimilation of food and nutrients, etc [[5]](#cite_note-5) [[6]](#cite_note-6). Also the bacterial flora residing in intestine is also responsible for some functions like fermentation of undigested carbohydrates and the subsequent absorption of short-chain fatty acids, plays a role in synthesizing vitamin B and vitamin K as well as metabolising bile acids, sterols and xenobiotics [[7]](#cite_note-7). Vomiting and purgation leads to cleansing of entire tract that causes removal of unhealthy bacterial flora and also inflammation and damage to the mucosal barrier. Thus till regeneration of new flora and proper mucosal barrier, the diet needs to be light and gradually increasing in thickness. Fats and some spices are given at later phases as they require proper mucosal functioning for absorption. Moreover this regimen facilitates the gradual induction of carbohydrate, vegetable protein, fat and meat protein as digestion improves gradually.(verse 11-12) Characteristics of three types of emesis and purgation Yellowish-greenish vomiting along with bitter taste in mouth indicates that the pyloric valve is open and bile is flowing into the stomach from the duodenum [[8]](#cite_note-8). This is considered as end point of emesis and called pittanta vamana. In case of virechana, mucosal layer gets removed partially at the end point that can be considered as kaphanta virechana. Continuing cleansing beyond these endpoints may cause deleterious effects on the health.(verse 13-15) Symptomatic evaluation of cleansing processes [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana)and [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana)clear digestive tract that is filled of morbid matter and bulky food, fluid etc. Hence causes feeling of lightness. Sense organs respond to the stimuli either internal or external thus any adherence of morbid matter in these organs is responsible for ill functioning. Especially in [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana)cleansing of nasal cavity, oral cavity is directly evident whereas skin is affected during oleation and fomentation. Removal of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha)causes blood purification which is responsible for health and proper functioning of skin. Improper administration of emesis causes itching, urticaria etc. which can be considered as allergic reaction in response to the allergen in the form of emetic drug. The protein in the food is the most common allergic component. Some proteins or fragments of proteins are resistant to digestion and those that are not broken down in the digestive process are tagged by the Immunoglobulin E (IgE) causing allergic reaction [[9]](#cite_note-9). Possibility cannot be ruled out that the drug administered for emesis may irritate gastric mucosa, increases intracellular space due to transient inflammation thereby escaping into circulation directly without digestion and acts as a trigger for allergy. Similarly in case of purgation if drug fails to give proper effect of evacuation then it remains inside the body and gives an allergic reaction which is evident in the form of coryza. In Ayurvedic parlance, the probable reason for these symptoms is that when drug fails to attain desired cleansing and it is not removed from the body it act as a trigger for aggravation or excitement of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) but is unable to throw them outside the body; thus either the disease gets aggravated or symptoms of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) vitiation are evident.(verse 15-20) Time after cleansing process Anuvasana or snehapana therapy is indicated on ninth day after cleansing processes. This duration of gap includes seven days of post therapeutic measures and one day of rest. Immediately after cleansing, the digestive power is reduced and it improves gradually in seven days. This gap of total eight days is very much necessary to regain the normal functioning of digestive components in the gastrointestinal tract. Mucosal membrane is one such component of digestive tract that establishes a barrier between external environments and the internal milieu. Normal well formed healthy mucosa is responsible for nutrient absorption and waste secretion, which require a selectively permeable barrier. These functions place the mucosal epithelium at the centre of interactions between the mucosal immune system and luminal contents, including dietary antigens and microbial products [[10]](#cite_note-10). Thus in view of regeneration of new healthy mucosal barrier this duration of gap may play a prime role. After niruha, type of medicated enema the unctuous enema is indicated on the same day in the evening for the pacification [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) that is remained in the gut even after removal by niruha or to pacify [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) that is produced due to possible overdose of niruha. Also as per modern perspectives it is possible that due to niruha type of medicated enema the colon gets cleared providing minimal barrier for absorption and due to increased permeability on virtue of transient inflammation, the transmucosal entry of fats of unctuous enema is facilitated [[11]](#cite_note-11).(verse 20-22) Number and enema After niruha, unctuous enema is indicated. Also the minimum unctuous enema required for a patient also depends upon aggravated [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha). Thus, - If [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)aggravation is there then alternate niruha and unctuous enema are indicated or in case of excess [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)vitiation, physician can administer continuous two unctuous enema. 9 to 11 unctuous enema are indicated to combat [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)disorder in general along with niruha in between. - If [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha)is aggravated then 1-3 and if [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta)is 5-7 unctuous enema are indicated along with niruha in between. In such condition continuous three niruha type of medicated enema can be given so as to remove the vitiated [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha)- [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta)and then unctuous enema can be administered to 23-25) Benefits of niruha type of medicated enema Ageing is a process that causes aggravation of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) due to loss of body's vital elements gradually and aggravated [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) also fastens the ageing. Thus being best treatment for [vata](/index.php?title=Vata), basti proves to be an anti-ageing therapy. Moreover, it has a cleansing spectrum in the lower part of gut. This portion is surrounded by vital organs like liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys. Thus, the effect of cleansing is more marked for these organs. Liver and kidney plays an important role of detoxification thus maintaining body homeostasis that is helpful to avoid ageing. [Basti](/index.php?title=Basti) is considered as a harmless treatment mainly because in this treatment unlike that of purgation the fluid is supplied from outside for cleansing process and the amount of evacuation is also very less as compared to purgation. It acts in the colon and rectum which has a dominant function of excretion rather than absorption of nutrients. Thus, enema hardly alters the process of digestion; on the contrary it supports body's natural process of excretion. Whereas in case of emesis the treatment goes in opposite direction of peristalsis and it mainly affects process of digestion. This is the reason for which no post therapeutic measures (samsarjana krama) are indicated in medicated enema. [Vata](/index.php?title=Vata) is responsible for movement of [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) and [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha). Hence it plays main role in the production of all diseases. Thus, being remedy for [vata](/index.php?title=Vata), [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) is said to cure all diseases. Body strength and all [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) dominant body elements like semen are inversely related with [vata](/index.php?title=Vata). Thus, if vitiated [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) is evacuated, the strength, sturdiness are enhanced bringing a new essence to body elements.(verse 27-28) Benefits of unctuous type of medicated enema Evacuating type of enema cleanses the gut thus facilitating the absorption of fats. Oil is considered to be the best for [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) on virtue of its properties. The example given by acharya points towards the colonic and rectal absorption of fats given through unctuous enema and also it specifies the superiority of rectal route over oral consumption of fats. This may be because of the fact that [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) is nothing but increase in some properties like dryness, lightness, cold, movement etc. in the body and these properties are introduced in human gut in the last part of digestion that occurs in colon. Unctuous enema directly oleates the colon and after absorption affects whole body by properties like unctuousness, heaviness and warmth. As site of production of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) is treated, no new [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) formation occurs in the body bringing about the phenomena of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)-nigraha that is responsible for movement of all [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) from shakha (extremities) to koshtha (gut). Even proper function of agni (digestive strength) is dependent upon normal activity of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) as it has a vital function of igniting the digestive fire. Other functions like mental harmony, strength, vitality, complexion etc. are taken care of by unctuous enema as pacification of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) affects positively on mind, improves production of new body elements and gives health to the skin as it is also a site of residence for [vata](/index.php?title=Vata).(verse 29-31) Effects of unctuous and evacuating type of medicated enema in general All the disease quoted by acharya are exclusively [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) disorders and thus [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) seems to be the best remedy for them. Especially in females not conceiving despite their mating with male partner and in men's having seminal debility [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) acts potentially because both the abnormalities are related to apana vata. Apana is well regulated to the downward direction and its site of production is cleansed by [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) bringing about the optimum therapeutic effect.(verse 32-34) Selection of type of enema Disease specific medicine is to be given through the enema because when medicated enema is given it brings about multiple actions at a time that includes evacuation which is a local action, affects certain receptors which need a specific molecule that acts as a stimulant over gut receptors for secretion of particular chemical messenger for disease attenuation besides cleansing. [Dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) pacification is also evident due to action of absorbed active principles from drug specific to disease. Acharya has quoted a condition where life depends upon the morbid matter. This particular condition can be seen in the patient who is bed ridden, not consuming food and highly emaciated. Generally nutrition comes from the food that we consume and if food is not available then energy is produced from optional processes of metabolism like gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, etc [[12]](#cite_note-12). This can be termed in Ayurvedic parlance as use of [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu) (body elements) for nutrition. But if patient is so emaciated that gluconeogenesis is also not possible then the life supports comes from absorption of nutrients from fecal matter. Precursor of fecal matter i.e. chyme in the colon contains some electrolytes like sodium, magnesium, and chloride which are left as well as indigestible parts of ingested food (e.g., a large part of ingested amylose, starch which has been shielded from digestion, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). The bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own nourishment and create acetate, propionate, and butyrate as waste products, which in turn are used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment [[13]](#cite_note-13). Perhaps 10% of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes available, through this last but an important part of digestion [[14]](#cite_note-14). Hence in such patients giving enema may prove fatal as no nutrition will be available if colon is cleansed. Since it is explained that [mala](/index.php?title=Mala) is responsible for bala in the context of rajayakshnma.(verse 35-37) Importance of basti therapy [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda) states only two of therapies i.e. samshamana ( [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) pacifying) and samshodhana (cleansing). [Vata](/index.php?title=Vata) is responsible for all diseases as beside its own hazards it moves other vitiated [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) also. [Basti](/index.php?title=Basti) has duel nature of action i.e. cleansing with [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) pacification. It acts mainly on [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) hence [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) can be considered as a single remedy for all the diseases; however, its formulation needs to vary as per disease.(verse 38-40) Mode of action of [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) Here, Charaka details the mode of action of medicated enema , pointing towards various sites for proper evacuation. Medicated enema, when given properly, passes through the rectum and reaches the colon, where the maximum possible limit is up to cecum since the ileocecal valve prevents further movement [[15]](#cite_note-15). Proper evacuation of enema is also an important phenomenon as enema retaining for longer duration may cause abdominal discomfort, loss of osmotic balance, etc. and early removal of enema may not produce desired clinical effect.(verse 41) Sign and symptoms of proper, improper and excess use of evacuating type of medicated enema Properly administered enema causes cleansing of colon and rectum but in proportionate manner causing less harm to the mucosal membrane and nourishing the bacterial flora of colon. This may improve the process of proper formation of feces and gives sense of lightness in lower abdomen. Agni i.e. digestion is improved due to regularisation of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) that ignites digestive fire. Improper enema or retention of enema gives symptoms that mimic bowel obstruction and hypervolemia. Especially symptoms like edema and dyspnea are produced as a result of excess fluid load, primarily salt and water, that builds up in various locations in the body and leads to an increase in weight, swelling in the legs and arms (peripheral edema), and/or fluid in the abdomen (ascites). Eventually, the fluid enters the air spaces in the lungs (pulmonary edema) reduces the amount of oxygen that can enter the blood, and causes shortness of breath (dyspnea). Excess enema is nothing but purgation produced by overdose of evacuating enema thus the symptoms are same as that of excessive purgation. (verse 41-43) Sign and symptoms of proper, improper and excess use of unctuous type of medicated enema Unctuous enema though considered as a [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) pacifying enema it acts as a cleansing therapy because it cleanses the colon and rectum to remove adhered fecal matter. Moreover, the unctuousness makes colonic and rectal lining more slippery so that no feces remains and quantity of defecation increases. It brings about proper sleep as [[[vata]] is responsible for insomnia and it takes care of [vata](/index.php?title=Vata). Improper administration of unctuous enema cannot meet the extent of oleation needed in colon, rectum and whole body thus causes dryness. Vitiated [vata](/index.php?title=Vata) thus leads to the symptoms stated as in verse. Excess unctuous enema gives symptoms somewhat similar to that of excess oleation. However local symptom like griping pain may be due to excess motions is more prominent.(verse 44-47) Karma, kala and yoga and yoga [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) denotes the use of [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) therapy as per the severity of the disease. Generally diseases of vital organs like brain, heart, kidney etc. are considered more serious in nature and [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) vitiation is so severe that repeated medicated enema for long duration is a must hence karma [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) is used in such instances. Another view suggests that 18 unctuous enema cause oleation of semen. [[16]](#cite_note-16) Thus karma [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) is meant for body elements which are far apart for the unctuousness to reach like [shukra](/index.php?title=Shukra) (semen), [majja dhatu](/index.php?title=Majja_dhatu) (bone marrow) etc. Yoga [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) is the smallest duration or schedule that is required generally for healthy individuals doing cleansing according to particular season or in patients having disease newly diagnosed or of less severe nature. Kala [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) is used in conditions which are in between the highly severe, chronic and less severe, newly diagnosed category. (verse 47-49) Shirovirechana Shirovirechana comes in sequence of [shodhana](/index.php?title=Shodhana) after [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana)- [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana) etc. It has direct cleansing effect on the part above the clavicle hence termed shirovirechana. As head is a vital part and eyes are to be avoided during any fomentation, only fomentation with the help of the palm is an ideal procedure before shirovirechana. Inappropriate administration may cause only irritation and not the removal of morbid matter that leads to increase in secretions as result of allergic reaction causing adhesion of sticky material in the throat, heaviness of the head etc. Excessive administration of shirovirechana may cause rupture of certain capillaries in the Little's area, lying in antero-inferior part of the nasal septum having rich vascularisation [[17]](#cite_note-17). This may results in cutting type of pain. Due to sudden entry of foreign bodies in the nasal cavity fainting occurs rarely which may be due to vagal shock.(verse 50-53) Do's and don'ts in [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) procedures All the procedures involved in cleansing therapies act on the common principles, as follows: - Stimulation of certain receptors - Establishing body homeostasis by exchange between nutritive and morbid matters across the various membranes including gastric, intestinal or cell membrane. - Rearrangement of gastrointestinal bacterial flora Thus, during any cleansing procedure body should be protected from any type of exertion as it may adversely affect the mechanism involved in trans-membrane movement of matter or inhibit the receptor stimulation activity. Intake of untimely and unwholesome food leads to indigestion that may alter the digestion of sneha during oleation or even can suppress digestive power so that therapy like [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) may not affect with proper potency and problems like fever or cold due to ama (i.e. indigested food) may arise hampering the treatments. Sleep during day time in itself causes [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta)- [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) vitiation; anger, sun exposure etc. causes [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta) vitiation. As in [shodhana](/index.php?title=Shodhana), utklesha i.e. exciting the [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) is always a first step in cleansing, hence excess [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) vitiation along with already excited [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) may cause diseases symptoms aggravation. (verse 54-55) Reason for failure of [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) to cure curable diseases and importance of dose in cleansing therapies Acharya has attracted the attention to an important concept of avarana i.e. occlusion of one dosha by other causing its vitiation. In such instances treatment of the [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) or [dhatu](/index.php?title=Dhatu) that is the reason for occlusion must be treated first then the one which is occluded [Cha.Sa. [Chikitsa Sthana](/index.php?title=Chikitsa_Sthana) 28/239]. Otherwise the symptoms get aggravated as occlusion is potentiated. Similarly, though one cannot measure the exact quantity of [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha), still on basis of symptoms, koshtha, agni etc. one need to decide the dose of drug to be given for cleansing. If dose calculation or the treatment is administered is wrong, then even if the drug is proper then also results may be adverse.(verse 57-60) Practical guidelines for [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana) and [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana) procedures - After proper [deepana](/index.php?title=Deepana)and [pachana](/index.php?title=Pachana), 30-40 ml of the fat is given empty stomach in the morning around 6.00 to 7.00 a. m. This dose is considered as test dose. - Depending upon time taken for complete digestion of this dose, the dose required as per disease severity is calculated. Generally the dose which can be digested in 12 hours is considered as moderate. - The quantity of fat to be administered is increased gradually till required dose is administered. Hence the dose for oleation decided on the basis of test dose is the actual quantity of fat to be administered on last day of oleation. - Maximum duration for oleation is seven days which is for krura koshtha (literally, hard guts) and least duration is three days which is for mridu koshtha (soft guts). - Proper oleation is decided on basis of symptoms like fats in feces, oiliness in skin etc. - Fomentation with whole body massage is practised in certain areas twice in one day for [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana)and twice for three days in case of [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana)after completion of oleation. - During this period of fomentation the diet as specified above in verse 8-9 is given for better results. - On the day of [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana), in the morning again whole body massage with fomentation is given. Milk or any other material like sugarcane juice that helps initiating emesis is given to fill the stomach especially if the patient is weak. The quantity administered ranges from 500 ml to 1200ml depending upon patient's gastric capacity. After that [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana)drug is administered at around 7.00 a.m. (commonly 1-2 gm+ honey Q.S.) and wait and watch strategy is used for 45 minutes till emesis starts. Then yashtimadhu fanta (prepared by adding coarse yashtimadhu powder in hot water) is given continuously to induce and to facilitate the emesis till [pitta](/index.php?title=Pitta)is observed in bouts of vomitus. At the end of the procedure luke warm salt water is given to cleans the stomach. Medicated smoke inhalation is preferred in order to clear the [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha)in upper upper respiratory tract. - On day of purgation, in the morning again whole body massage with fomentation is given. Then [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana)drug as per the koshtha and disease is administered at around 10.00-10.30 a.m. in the morning. This time specification is not always suitable, varies according to season, desha (place), appetite of patient etc. better to detail the concept of shleshmakale gate - Purgation is continued till mucus is visible in the feces. If proper purgation is not occurring with given dose then strong purgative like icchabhedi rasa or abhayadi modaka may be given to boost up the process. - Post therapeutic measures are followed in both [virechana](/index.php?title=Virechana)and [vamana](/index.php?title=Vamana). Practical guideline for therapeutic enema procedure - Evacuating type of medicated enema is given at around 10.00-10.30 a.m. in the morning when the food taken on earlier day is digested and patient is not too hungry. Unctuous type of enema is given immediately after meal. - Initially local massage with suitable oil is done at stomach, abdomen and buttocks and fomentation is given on the same part. - The in left lateral position either evacuating or unctuous enema is administered. Then person is asked to lie supine. In case of evacuating type of enema he is advised to immediately pass the stool to evacuate enema completely. However in case of unctuous enema his buttocks are clapped, palms and sole are massaged, patients bed is lifted thrice from his feet so that the enema can retain for longer duration. - After evacuating type of enema classics advise to give unctuous enema in the evening but practically unctuous enema is given on next day after having food. This alternate use of evacuating and unctuous enema avoids any possible [vata](/index.php?title=Vata)vitiation. Practical guideline for shirovirechana procedure - Before administering shirovirechana local massage with suitable oil and mild fomentation is given on parts above the clavicles. - Then patient is made to lie supine with neck slightly lifted and head tilted down. This position allows easy entry of drug to the intracranial organs. [Nasya](/index.php?title=Nasya)drug is administered in one nasal aperture at a time closing the other. - After instillation of drug patient is made to lie in supine position for 3-5 minutes. During this time palms and soles of the patient are massaged which stimulates the absorption of nasal drug. Advanced researches There are many research works carried out in field of [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) therapies, some published researches on procedural standardisation are as follows: - Bharti Gupta, Physiological and biochemical (therapeutic emesis in spring season) - A preventive measure for diseases of Kapha origin, 2011, 32( clinical study on standardization of Vamana Vidhi by classical and traditional methods, 2012, 33 (4) : 517-522 - Somsri Wiwanitkit, Viroj Wiwanitkit, Adil Rais, Santoshkumar Bhatted, Clinical study to evaluate the effect of Virechanakarma on serum electrolytes, AYU, 2013,34(4):379-382 - Anand RM, Gurjar GK, Virechana Karma in Indian literature, Bulletin of Indian Institute of History of Medicine, 1976;6(1):37-41. - Yashwant M Juneja, Anup B Thakar, Clinical Basti administered by Basti Putak (Pressure method), Enema pot method (Gravity fed method), and syringe method in Kshinashukra (Oligozoospermia), 2011 , 32 (2) : 234-240 - SS Savrikar, CE Lagad, Study of preparation and standardization of Maadhutailika Basti' with special reference to emulsion stability, of Research in [Ayurveda](/index.php?title=Ayurveda)& Pharmacy, 2011; 2(1):24-26. Scope for further research Beside yoga, karma and kala [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) schedule the modified regimen can be prepared as per disease. For e.g. in case of [kapha](/index.php?title=Kapha) dominant disorders continuous three evacuating enema followed by one unctuous enema can be given. Summary Lord Atreya have described the successful administration of [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) in the form of answer to the twelve queries. Oleation and fomentation are the pre-treatment measure in cleansing processes that follows emesis and purgation. After cleansing post therapeutic measures (samsarjana krama) are necessary to bring digestion to its original state. Unctuous enema or oleation therapy can be started from ninth day. Unctuous enema should be followed by evacuating type of enema. Medicated enema cures all the diseases by removing accumulated [dosha](/index.php?title=Dosha) from entire body. Acharya have advised an ideal treatment schedule in the form of yoga, kala and karma [basti](/index.php?title=Basti) as per disease severity. Shirovirechana (errhine) therapy acts over the things that need to be avoided during [Panchakarma](/index.php?title=Panchakarma) includes excessive sitting, standing, speaking and riding, sleep during day time, sexual intercourse, suppression of natural urges, cooling regimens, exposure to sun, grief, anger and intake of untimely and unwholesome food. However after following all measure correct treatment is given but in low or excess doses, in inappropriate time or in wrong manner then it fails to cure diseases.
