When the body is dealing with chronic disease or low-level systemic inflammation, the immune system becomes dysregulated. It becomes imbalanced, and clogged with old white blood cells that aren't functioning well. In this situation, boosting the immune system\u2014a very popular trend these days- may not be the best strategy for restoring health. The use of \"immune boosting\" supplements to amplify certain aspects of an immune system that is already imbalanced and over-extended will only perpetuate the dysfunction. Rather than \"boosting\" the system, a better goal is to reset and rejuvenate it, and to replace worn-out immune cells with new ones to improve immune resilience. Fasting & Autophagy Fasting is a well-known method for stimulating the removal of old immune cells, producing new ones, and resetting the immune system. Fasting triggers the process called autophagy\u2014a break down and removal of damaged or dysfunctional white blood cells, including those misdirected against the body's own tissue (autoimmunity). Autophagy is particularly effective in destroying immunosenescent cells which are responsible for the alteration of immune functions due to aging. Intermittent fasting\u2014a meal schedule that alternates between normal eating patterns and brief but frequent full fasts (or restricted caloric intake)\u2014is an effective method for increasing the rate of autophagy. There are several different approaches to this, including alternate-day fasting and daily time-restricted eating. Regardless of the method chosen, the principle is similar: during periods of calorie restriction, the body removes senescent leukocytes and replace them with newly generated cells, which in turn reduces the overall amount of inflammation in the body. Eating again following a brief fast will stimulate stem cells to generate new leukocytes, a discovery for which Japanese cell biologist, Yoshinori Ohsumi, won the 2016 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. Within cells, a similar process of removal and replacement occurs with the mitochondria. At that level, fasting triggers a different type of autophagy called mitophagy, where old, damaged, dysfunctional mitochondria are broken down and removed, allowing the remaining mitochondria to function better. At the same time, mitophagy helps reduce the production of undesirable inflammatory cytokines from the cell. Intermittent fasting can take several forms, and it is a matter of personal preference which one works best for a given. Some people follow alternate-day fasting, a cycle of fasting on one day, and eating normally on the next. Others prefer the \"5:2 Diet,\" with five days per week of unrestricted eating and two non-consecutive days in which one eats only one meal, restricted to 500 to 700 calories. Still others prefer variations on time-restricted eating, where one limits one's eating to a relatively short daytime window, after fasting for at least 12 hours overnight. The fasting-mimicking diet, pioneered by Valter Longo, Ph.D., is a periodic, multi-day diet that restricts calories but is high in unsaturated fats. For many people, intermittent fasting is most easily accomplished by avoiding caloric consumption for at least 12 hours (preferably for 14 to 16 hours) after the evening meal. In my experience, aiming for a 14:10 eating pattern works well for many people. This means fasting for 14 hours between the evening meal and the first meal the next day. It's OK to drink unsweetened clear liquids such as water, tea, herbal tea, and coffee while fasting. During the 10-hour eating windows, I advise my patients to follow a health-oriented, plant-forward diet. Daily intermittent fasting like this enhances mitophagy and improves mitochondrial function. The mechanisms behind this are still being explored. We know, however, that the process involves several transcription factors that promote mitochondrial biogenesis. One example is nuclear factor 2 (NRF2), which regulates mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species. Fasting may enhance the production of NRF2 and improve the expression of antioxidant regulatory genes. A Role for Spermidine The value of intermittent fasting for immune rejuvenation through autophagy may be enhanced by supplementing with spermidine-a polyamine that induces autophagy through the TOR kinase pathway. Spermidine mimics the action of caloric restriction on the body. While not a substitute for intermittent fasting, spermidine supplements are particularly valuable for maintaining the rejuvenation effect during times when fasting periods must be shorter than usual. Improving Metabolism The benefits of intermittent fasting for rejuvenating the immune system and improving mitochondrial function are clear. In addition, it also reduces inflammation and improves insulin sensitivity. Many people find that intermittent fasting helps them lose weight by losing body fat, not muscle. The reality is, most Americans eat half or more of their daily calories by snacking on low-nutrient processed foods (aka junk food) after dinner. I strongly advise patients to avoid this damaging eating pattern by fasting for 14 hours or longer. In refraining from adding to their blood sugar during the fasting period, people can activate their bodies' ability to use existing blood sugar for energy, so there's little left over to be stored as fat. In some cases, the body will dip into its hepatic glycogen reserve overnight. Being overweight or obese strains the immune system by causing inflammation. Intermittent fasting helps with weight loss, which in turn helps relieve the stress on the immune system and makes rejuvenation even more effective. It's a virtuous circle that can greatly improve immune health. Critical Nutrients for Immunity A well-balanced diet that emphasizes plants, high-quality protein, and good fats, will lay the macronutrient foundation for strong immunity. But even with a good basic diet, many people run low on some essential minerals, particularly if they're battling a chronic illness or long-term inflammation. High levels of critical nutrients are essential for maintaining a healthy immune system and rejuvenating it through fasting. Good nutrition is also essential for efficiently producing ATP within the mitochondria. B vitamins, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc are all crucial for peak immunity. B Vitamins: The B vitamins thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin are essential, as is the closely related alpha-lipoic acid, along with amino acids such as carnitine, cysteine, and coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone or CoQ10). Iron is crucial for an effective immune system. Low serum iron is a common response to infection. It's the body's way of slowing the progress of the infection by keeping microbes from accessing the iron they need to reproduce and spread. But immune system cells need iron to support their metabolism. When iron is scarce, the mitochondria in immune cells can't generate enough energy. They become less effective at fighting infection and generating immune memory to fight future infections. Iron deficiency is one of the most common micronutrient deficiencies worldwide, particularly among pregnant women, the elderly, and hospitalized patients. Iron supplements can raise low serum iron levels and help maintain a healthy balance between enough iron to support immune system cells while also limiting the iron supply to pathogens. Magnesium is essential for hundreds of enzymatic processes in the body. In the immune system, it is vital for forming many coenzymes and cofactors needed for the complex signaling within and among white blood cells, and for developing antibodies. Most Americans are magnesium-deficient. Low magnesium can contribute to development of a cytokine storm, a severe immune reaction to an infection in which the body releases too many cytokines into the blood too quickly, and may also contribute to autoimmunity. Magnesium is also needed to produce the enzymes that metabolize vitamin D. Consequently, magnesium deficiency will reduce the effectiveness of the vitamin D supplements someone may be taking. Selenium is an essential micronutrient that has a crucial role in optimal immune responsiveness. It is a potent antioxidant that helps lower oxidative stress and reduce inflammation, ultimately enhancing immunity. Selenium deficiency leads to less robust immune responses to viruses and bacteria. Zinc: Although zinc is considered a trace mineral for dietary purposes, large quantities are essential for the immune system. Some researchers even call it the gatekeeper of immune function, given its importance in cytokine signaling and for mobilizing the cells of the adaptive immune system. Low zinc levels are known to increase susceptibility to viral infection. Zinc is necessary for maintaining the integrity of the pulmonary and intestinal mucosal barriers. It's also essential for proper function of the pathways that trigger T cell and B cell proliferation in response to infection. As a co-factor for many enzymes involved in immune cell function, zinc also plays a role in balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory immune processes. END Robert G.

What is the common theme underlying nearly all of the diseases associated with aging? Mitochondrial dysfunction. It is a simple biological fact that mitochondrial function tends to decline with age. This affects every organ and every tissue in the body. But clinicians often fail to consider \"mitochondriopathy\" as they treat the various diseases that their aging patients present. \"Support the mitochondrial pathways and you support healthy aging,\" said Chris Meletis, ND, in a recent webinar sponsored by TruNiagen. \"How many cells in the body have to be 'tired' before we feel tired and fatigued?\" Dr. Meletis asked. By age 40, most people produce half as much NAD+ as they did in their 20s. By age 60, NAD+ levels decline even further. Tired cells mean tired muscles, tired organs, tired glands, and tired brains. Many common disorders\u2014depression, brain fog, neurodegenerative diseases, dyslipidemia, gonadal failure and infertility, thyroid dysfunction, obesity\u2014are at least partly the result of a general decline in mitochondrial function. NAD+ is the Key At the crux of mitochondriopathy is the age-related decline in production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD+, an essential coenzyme for redox reactions and cellular energy metabolism. NAD+ is also a vital cofactor for non-redox enzymes, including sirtuins, PARPs, and CD38. It plays a role in multiple metabolic pathways, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, and immune cell function. \"The idea behind bioidentical hormone therapy is to make the body more 'normal.' But if you're not addressing the mitochondrial deficits, it is not going to work,\" Chris Meletis, ND The reality is that by age 40, most people produce half as much NAD+ as they did in their 20s. By age 60, NAD+ levels decline even further. \"A smartphone that has run out of battery power is nothing but a thousand-dollar paperweight. It is only as good as its charge,\" said Dr. Meletis. In many ways, the human body is similar. Beyond aging, many exogenous factors deplete NAD+, including oxidative stress, Inflammation, insulin resistance, viral illnesses, and exposure to many different drugs. Drugs that deplete NAD+ include: statins; minor pain relievers like aspirin, acetaminophen, diclofenac, and naproxen may adversely affect NAD+. Hormones & Mitochondrial Function Defective or deficient mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation can lead to structural and functional changes in the thyroid causing a progressive, chronic autoimmune failure of the gland. Downstream, that leads to a host of metabolic dysregulations. But the problems cannot be fixed simply by giving exogenous hormones. Thyroid hormone treatment affects mitochondria in two ways: an initial rapid stimulation of respiration shortly after dosing, followed several days later by an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis and a change in mitochondrial mass. That's good as far as it goes, but without adequate NAD+, the hormone treatments alone will not give optimal outcomes. \"The idea behind bioidentical hormone therapy is to make the body more 'normal.' But if you're not addressing the mitochondrial deficits, it is not going to work,\" Dr. Meletis explained. Likewise, changing someone's diet to mitigate a chronic systemic disease without optimizing mitochondrial metabolic pathways is likely to fail, even if the dietary changes are very healthy. One needs well-functioning mitochondria to digest, absorb, and assimilate nutrients, minerals, phytochemicals and the like. So, what helps? Exercise definitely helps. Regular exercise increases NAD+, and also increases insulin sensitivity, and improves mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration in muscle. Caloric restriction also helps. Raising NAD+ Several nutritional supplement ingredients that can potentially raise NAD+ levels. They include: tryptophan, nicotinaminde (NAM), nicotinic acid, riboside (NR). All are in the vitamin B3 family, and are considered NAD+ precursors. Changing someone's diet to mitigate a chronic systemic disease without optimizing mitochondrial metabolic pathways is likely to fail, even if the dietary changes are very healthy. One needs well-functioning mitochondria to digest, absorb, and assimilate nutrients, minerals, and phytochemicals. Tryptophan, whether from food (legumes, meat) or supplements is preferentially shunted into protein synthesis. Once protein needs have been met, only then is the excess tryptophan available for conversion to niacin. This is not an efficient pathway. It takes roughly 60 mg of tryptophan for the body to make 1 mg of niacin. Nicotinic acid is effective, but it is problematic on a practical level because it causes uncomfortable flushing in most people. NAM inhibits sirtuins, which will blunt the desired metabolic effects. According to Dr. Meletis, NR is the most efficient precursor for raising NAD+ levels. It does not cause flushing, does not inhibit sirtuins, and has a high conversion rate. An 8-week randomized trial involving 140 overweight but otherwise healthy adults showed that daily supplementation with 100 mg, 300 mg, or 1000 mg of the TruNiagen brand of NR resulted in consistent and dose-dependent increases in whole blood NAD+ within 2 weeks. Subjects taking 300 mg per day had a 51% NAD+ increase; those on 1,000 mg per day had a 142% rise in NAD+. Meletis says TruNiagen has become a go-to supplement in his practice, with potential to help people struggling with a wide range of metabolic and autoimmune conditions. He generally recommends patients take 500 mg. If money is tight they can still derive benefit from a 300 mg dose. When patients are dealing with viral infections, or otherwise feeling ill, he advises them to up their intake to 1,000 mg per day. Supplementation with NAD precursors is a key factor in the mitochondrial support equation, but it is not the only one. Meletis says he encourages patients to as NR. But supplements by themselves will not overcome the ill effects of bad diet, inactivity, and poor sleep. Lifestyle shifts are always essential. Every day, nearly 10,000 Americans reach their 65th birthdays-that's roughly 3.7 million people per year. At the farther end of the age spectrum, octogenarians are now the fastest growing age bracket. The need for effective strategies to mitigate senescence and promote optimal metabolic function into advanced age has never been greater. NAD+ plays a fundamental role in cellular energy production, healthy mitochondrial function, and DNA repair. Many researchers consider it to be the master regulator of cellular metabolism. NAD+ also helps in coping with the effects of metabolic stressors and increased allostatic load associated with poor diet, chronic stress, and an unhealthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, NAD+ levels decline drastically as we age. Nutritional strategies that bolster NAD+ and reinvigorate mitochondrial energy production are the key to averting many illnesses associated with aging. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is an NAD precursor that, when given as a supplement, is clinically proven to boost NAD levels safely and efficiently in humans.

Co-enzyme Q10 is among the most widely purchased dietary supplements worldwide. Yet many people who take it don't get the optimal benefits they seek from this important metabolic cofactor. New research suggests that Geranylgeraniol (GG), a naturally-occurring substance in the seeds of the Annatto plant (Bixa Orellana), can increase the body's natural production of CoQ10, improve its absorption by cells, and optimize the effects of CoQ10 supplementation. Clinically, the combination of GG and Ubiquinol can reverse skeletal muscle damage, restore muscle function, ameliorate the adverse impact of statin drugs, and improve energy production in the heart and other organs with high metabolic rates. In this webinar, Barrie Tan, PhD, one of the world's experts on annatto-derived compounds, explores new insights into the biochemistry of Ubiquinol, Geranylgeraniol, and the ways in which the combination of these two compounds represent paradigm shift in the way we view CoQ10 and cellular energetics. Dr. Barrie Tan earned his PhD in Chemistry/Biochemistry from the University of Otago, New Zealand and spent several years as a professor at UMass. Credited with discovering a form of vitamin E called tocotrienol in three major sources - Palm, Rice, and Annatto, Dr. Tan was dubbed the \"Tocotrienol King\" by cardiologist Stephen Sinatra, MD. Dr. Tan is currently the President of American River Nutrition, a natural health R&D company he started with his wife, Elizabeth, in 1998. His research focuses on lipid-soluble nutrients that reduce and slow chronic conditions. In recent years, researchers and medical practitioners alike have taken interest in a particular molecule known to be the master regulator of cellular metabolism \u2014 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). NAD+ is a of metabolic processes, including: mitochondrial energy production, glycolysis, and DNA synthesis and repair. It also plays a vital role in supporting key elements of the innate immune response. Join Dr. Chris Meletis, a naturopathic physician, educator, international author and lecturer, to review the latest peer-review literature demonstrating how bolstering the NAD metabolome with dietary precursors has great potential to help us stay resilient to metabolic stress, and over time, add health to years. By the end of this session, attendees will be more adept at: Discussing factors that contribute to metabolic stress and dysregulation of important metabolic processes. Explaining how increasing NAD+ can help maintain resilience against metabolic stressors. Describing the role of NAD+ in the innate immune response.

Though our celebrations may look a little different this year, many people will still uphold the holiday habits of over-consuming alcoholic drinks and comfort foods, and becoming more sedentary and less active. Though enjoyable, these lifestyle shifts-along with the return of the cold weather- can raise metabolic stress, perturb metabolic balance, add to allostatic load, and take the 'mighty' out of our mitochondria. Unaddressed, these changes can have profound effects on our health and how we age. In recent years, researchers and medical practitioners alike, have taken interest in a particular molecule known to be the master regulator of cellular metabolism \u2014 nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).
