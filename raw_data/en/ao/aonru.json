[Methods]. Seropositive (COVID-19 vaccinated >= 8 weeks prior) participants (N=642) [aged]50-70 years were randomized equally, to receive two intramuscular doses, 56 days apart, to 1 of 14 different [dose]/formulations of CIC using a design of experiments approach ( [dose]range rS 2.5-22.5ug, HA5-60ug;and 50ug Matrix-M), or to 1 of 2 reference formulations of either standalone rS with Matrix-M [2 doses] [vaccination](Days 0, [IgG]and [influenza]HAI [antibodies]to following each [dose], and [safety]outcomes assessed through Day 70. Multiple regression was used to create predictive models to assess [antibody response]surfaces and for [dose] [optimization]. Results. All CIC formulations were well tolerated, with a reactogenicity and [safety]profile generally comparable to standalone rS or qNIV. Regression modelling of post-first [dose]responses revealed that both rS and HA [antigens]in a CIC formulation modestly interfered with each other, however, interference was overcome with [dose] [adjustment]across a range of rS/HA doses. Specifically, higher rS [dose]( >20ug), in a [dose]dependent fashion, overcame HA interference, closely matching standalone rS [IgG]reference responses (GMEU 16,818), whereas lower, intermediate HA [dose]overcame rS interference, closely matching standalone HA reference HAI responses for H3N2 (GMT 145), H1N1 (GMT 134), and B- [Victoria](GMT 66);while modestly (at least 34%) lower than the reference B-Yamagata response (GMT 101). Conclusion. CIC formulations were well tolerated and immunogenic, with various [dose]combinations achieving response comparable to standalone "}
