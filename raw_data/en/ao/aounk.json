This survey was launched in February 2021 and ran for 11 days. Recipients of a first COVID-19 vaccine dose 7 days prior to survey completion were eligible. The incidence and severity of vaccination side effects were assessed. The survey was completed by 2002 respondents of whom 26.6% had a prior COVID-19 infection. A prior COVID-19 infection was associated with an increased risk of any side effect (risk ratio 1.08, 95% confidence intervals (1.05-1.11)), fever (2.24 (1.86-2.70)), breathlessness (2.05 (1.28-3.29)), flu-like illness (1.78 (1.51-2.10)), fatigue (1.34 (1.20-1.49)) and local reactions (1.10 (1.06-1.15)). It was also associated with an increased risk of severe side effects leading to hospital care (1.56 (1.14-2.12)). While mRNA vaccines were associated with a higher incidence of any side effect (1.06 (1.01-1.11)) compared with viral vector-based vaccines, these were generally milder (p < 0.001), mostly local reactions. Importantly, mRNA vaccine recipients reported a considerably lower incidence of systemic reactions (RR < 0.6) including anaphylaxis, swelling, flu-like illness, breathlessness and fatigue and of side effects requiring hospital care (0.42 (0.31-0.58)). Our study confirms the findings of recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating that COVID-19 vaccines are generally safe with limited severe side effects. For the first time, our study links prior COVID-19 illness with an increased incidence of vaccination side effects and demonstrates that mRNA vaccines cause milder, less frequent systemic side effects but more local reactions.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-03-17", "cleaned_text": "A Vaccine Recipient Survey [https://doi.org/10.3390/life11030249](https://doi.org/10.3390/life11030249) [Ecology, Evolution and Coronaviruses]( /journal/life/special_issues/ecology_evolution_epidemiology_coronaviruses )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-life-11-00249), [2](#B2-life-11-00249)], posing an unprecedented burden to healthcare systems with worldwide economic consequences and prolonged lockdowns [ [3](#B3-life-11-00249)]. Vaccines currently being rolled out are anticipated to significantly modify these trends. While their effectiveness and safety have been proven in recent studies [ [4](#B4-life-11-00249), [5](#B5-life-11-00249), [6](#B6-life-11-00249)], data in specific groups remain lacking. Generally, people with a previous history of COVID-19 in whom vaccination is currently advised [ [7](#B7-life-11-00249)] were excluded from the clinical trials [ [4](#B4-life-11-00249), [5](#B5-life-11-00249), [6](#B6-life-11-00249)]. Whilst it is accepted that prior infection with COVID-19 induces a natural immunity potentially lasting for at least six months [ [8](#B8-life-11-00249)], it is unknown if previous infection may be associated with a greater number of vaccination side effects. Moreover, the safety and reactogenicity of the different types of vaccines (mRNA or viral vector-based) have not been compared head-to-head. This anonymized online survey was conducted to compare the safety profiles of available COVID-19 vaccines and evaluate their side effects in different groups of vaccine recipients. 2. Materials and Methods [Appendix A](#app1-life-11-00249): [Table A1](#life-11-00249-t0A1)). More specifically, we enquired about the following symptoms: localized reactions (pain, swelling, tenderness, redness, itching or other), fever, skin rash, shortness of breath, tingling in the mouth, face, body/extremities, swelling in the face or mouth, generalized swelling, anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction with face swelling and breathlessness), tiredness or fatigue, flu-like illness or any other side effects. It was launched via Google Forms on 3 February 2021 for 11 days and was shared within the institutions of the investigators through professional contacts and social media. The only inclusion criterion was the receipt of the first dose of any COVID-19 vaccine at least seven days prior to survey completion. 3. Results [Table A2](#life-11-00249-t0A2), [Figure A1](#life-11-00249-f0A1)), mostly health professionals of a working age (median: 45, interquartile range [IQR]: 35-50 years). A total of 532 (26.6%) had a history of a previous COVID-19 infection of whom 366 (68.8%) were confirmed by PCR (n = 273) and/or antigen testing (n = 162). A COVID-19 infection preceded the first vaccination dose by a median of 87 (IQR: 47-223) days. The majority of respondents were Caucasians (88.3%) mostly from the UK (78.6%) and Greece (16.6%). As anticipated, a prior history of a COVID-19 infection was more prevalent among frontline workers, health professionals and people from the UK where a very high incidence of COVID-19 was documented [ [9](#B9-life-11-00249)]. Moreover, recipients of a viral vector-based vaccine (mainly the AstraZeneca vaccine) were relatively older ( [Figure A2](#life-11-00249-f0A2), p < 0.001) and were mostly based in the UK (89.7% compared with 76.4% of those that received viral mRNA vaccines, p < 0.001). Finally, doctors were more likely to have received an mRNA-based vaccine compared with the other groups (p < 0.001). [Table 1](#life-11-00249-t001), [Figure 1](#life-11-00249-f001)). We also observed self-reported fever (2.24 (1.86-2.70)), breathlessness (2.05 (1.28-3.29)), flu-like (1.2-1.49)), local reactions (1.10 (1.06-1.15)) and \"other\" side effects (1.46 (1.16-1.82)). Among those experiencing side effects, a prior COVID-19 infection was associated with an increased severity of any side effect, local side effects or fatigue (p < 0.001). More importantly, a prior COVID-19 infection was associated with the risk of experiencing a severe side effect requiring hospital care (1.56 (1.14-2.12)). These observations remained significant in multivariate analyses and our sensitivity analysis ( [Table A3](#life-11-00249-t0A3)). A similar increase in the risk of any side effects following the second dose in those with a prior COVID-19 infection was also noted (1.08 (1.05-1.11)), although the lack of significant associations with specific side effects may have resulted from the limited sample included in this analysis. [Table 2](#life-11-00249-t002), [Figure 2](#life-11-00249-f002)). Overall, the recipients of mRNA vaccines reported a higher incidence of any self-reported side effects (1.06 (1.01-1.11)), which were, however, of significantly milder severity compared with those who received viral vector vaccines. While mRNA vaccines were associated with an increased incidence of reported local reactions (1.29 (1.19-1.40)), they were associated with a considerably lower incidence of self-reported systemic side effects including anaphylaxis (0.19 (0.04-0.62)), fever (0.28 (0.24-0.34)), swelling in the face or mouth (0.29 (0.10-0.80)) other effects (0.67 (0.52-0.86)). These observations were corroborated by multivariate analyses. Most importantly, mRNA vaccines were associated with a significantly lower incidence of severe side effects (requiring hospital care, RR 0.42 (0.31-0.58)). [Table 3](#life-11-00249-t003)). More specifically, respondents reported experiencing more frequently any side effects (1.04 (1.01-1.07)), skin rash (2.25 (1.4-3.62)), fever (1.72 (1.46-2.02)), flu-like illness (1.45-1.91)) and fatigue (1.40 (1.28-1.53)). In addition, a multivariate regression demonstrated that participants who had side effects after the first vaccine dose were at a significantly higher risk of having the same side effects after the second dose. Among those experiencing side effects, the severity did not significantly differ between the two doses. However, the likelihood of having a severe side effect requiring hospital care was significantly decreased (0.58 (0.38-0.88)). [Table A4](#life-11-00249-t0A4)). Finally, those reporting a pre-vaccination concern about the safety of the vaccine reported more often tingling (2.23 (1.45-3.42)), [4](#B4-life-11-00249), [5](#B5-life-11-00249), [6](#B6-life-11-00249)] and, as a result, the safety and reactogenicity of the vaccines in this population have not been previously fully evaluated. For the first time, this study demonstrated a significant association between a prior COVID-19 infection and a significantly higher incidence and severity of self-reported side effects after a vaccination for COVID-19. Consistently, compared with the first dose of the vaccine, we found an increased incidence and severity of self-reported side effects after the second dose when recipients had been previously exposed to viral antigen, probably because they had already developed an immunity against the antigens. This was supported by recent studies demonstrating that seropositive individuals developed rapid immune responses with higher antibody titres after the first vaccination dose compared with those without a previous COVID-19 infection [ [10](#B10-life-11-00249), [11](#B11-life-11-00249)]. In view of the rapidly accumulating data demonstrating that COVID-19 survivors generally have an adequate natural immunity for at least six months, it may be appropriate to re-evaluate the recommendation for the immediate vaccination of this group. In the meantime, taking into account our findings as well as studies demonstrating higher antibody titres among individuals with a prior COVID-19 infection, it might be appropriate for a note to be included in the vaccine information sheets highlighting that these people are more likely to experience non-serious side effects.
