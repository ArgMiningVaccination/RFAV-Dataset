She says the teams administering the vaccinations at the drive-through clinic have received overwhelming gratitude from recipients, especially during the time when vaccines were not yet readily available in the community. Honey says the staff enjoys helping the community and even keeps doggy treats on hand at the drive-through clinics for those who have their dogs in the car. Health experts explain that although the vaccine does provide individual protection against infection, it is just one part of risk mitigation. Health leaders remind the public to keep taking action steps like masking, distancing and hand washing to prevent contracting the virus and other illnesses. For updates and appointment information "}
