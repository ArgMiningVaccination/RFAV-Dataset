We have learned to improve our quality of life through hope and solidarity, sharing what we have and organizing to get what we need. Our programs aim to improve the quality of life of our members and families by responding to our needs for survival and also by addressing the root causes of those needs. We know from our own experience that isolation and access to medical supplies and equipment and quality health care are the main barriers we have to overcome in order to have a good quality of life.
