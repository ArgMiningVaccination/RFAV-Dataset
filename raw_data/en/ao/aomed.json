Registered dietitian nutritionists (RdNs) can enhance their professional work by offering to help patients with diabetes mellitus (dM) incorporate simple mindful practices into daily routines. \"Just tell me what to eat. \" the love-hate relationship many people have with food, can make the RDN's job challenging. Food insecurity, fad diets, contradictory research (\"go Paleo, \" \"go vegan, \" \"eat carbs, \" avoid carbs\"), and the degree of the patient's readiness to change are just some of the obstacles the RdN must face. i f only one of an RdN's tools was a magic fork that could be waved to make the disease disappear or at least make those 'oh-so-delicious' chocolate chip cookies taste great without the calories, carbohydrates, or fat! Although there is no magic fork, mindfulness meditation is an age-old modality that is garnering new attention as an adjunctive therapy for chronic disease, including dM. the purpose of this article is to define mindfulness; examine research supporting its utility as a dM self-management technique and, therefore, useful skill for RdNs and their clients; and introduce several simple mindfulness meditation practices. What is Mindfulness? Mindfulness is intentionally paying attention, moment to moment, without judging what is happening internally in the body, mind, and heart and externally in the environment. Mindfulness and meditation are teachable techniques that can help develop the critical skills of pausing, listening, slowing down, and self-regulating. Although not part of formal RdN training, RdNs can introduce simple mindfulness exercises as part of their medical nutrition therapy session. they also can work collegially with therapists, licensed counselors, social workers, and behaviorists by securing training for themselves and/or referring patients for more in-depth instruction. Referring patients to a mindfulness-based program such as Mindfulness based s tress Reduction (MbsR) can support the RdN's individual work. MbsR is a structured, evidence-based, 8-week program that provides instruction in mindfulness and meditation. Participants learn to relate differently to pain and illness, self-regulate fears about the future and regrets about the past, and become more skillful in staying present and nonjudgmental of themselves and others. Mindfulness and diabetes: Working in tandem char Wilkins, MsW, lcsW Mindful Path llchartford, c onnecticut it is well recognized that stress negatively affects the entire human system. i n addition, individuals who are stressed are less likely to engage in behaviors that support health. For the person with dM, a disease requiring daily self-management, this could have dire consequences. lack of self-care is magnified by the fact that stress itself raises serum glucose levels. i ntroducing mindfulness practices is a small step down the path leading to improved self-care. is there Proof t hat Mindfulness helps? Emotional distress is believed to affect 20% to 40% of patients with dM (1). data from recent trials suggest that mindfulness practices empower patients with DM just as it does with other illnesses and disorders. i n one study, researchers examined the effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (Mbct ) in reducing emotional distress among outpatients with dM, depression, and anxiety (2). the authors concluded that, \" compared with usual care, Mbct resulted in a reduction of emotional distress and an increase in health-related quality of life in diabetic patients who initially had lower levels of emotional well-being\" (2). beyond improving psychosocial parameters of health, mindfulness- based interventions, including MbsR 5and Mbct , have been shown to improve glycemia in persons with dM. Researchers in a small pilot study examining the effects of MbsR on glycated hemoglobin (A1c), blood pressure, body weight, and psychological symptoms noted a reduction in depression, anxiety, and general psychological distress among patients who completed the 8-week program (3). they also documented 0.5% reduction in A1c and a 6-mm hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Analysis suggested that lifestyle changes did not account for the A1c reduction because participants' mean body weights did not change nor were there reported changes in medication, diet, or exercise that could account for the improved glycemic control (3). A 2013 pilot study compared the effectiveness of a self-management intervention and a mindful eating intervention based on the Mindfulness-based Eating Awareness training program (4). the participants practicing meditation and mindful eating reported a significant decrease in energy intake immediately following the intervention and at a 3-month follow-up as well as a significant decrease in glycemic load at the end of the study (4). Although these studies suggest improvement in blood pressure and glucose control, more investigations are needed to fully understand the impact of mindfulness and meditation on the physiologic parameters and psychosocial stresses associated with dM. such stressors not only interfere with adaptation to dM, which is clearly a key factor in long-term self-management, but they also affect metabolic outcomes through the neuroendocrine system (5). currently, a 5-year randomized, controlled trial is examining the efficacy of MbsR as an intervention for reducing psychosocial distress, depression, and the progression of nephropathy and for improving the subjective health status of adults with t2dM (6). At 1-year follow-up, patients in the MbsR group achieved a prolonged reduction in levels of depression and improved health status compared with the control group. (6) \"i notice i actually chew my food and taste it when i 'm being mindful. \" Mindful Eating- conscious living is a training program for professionals that i teach with Jan chozen bays, author of the book Mindful Eating: A Guide to Rediscovering a Healthy and Joyful Relationship with Food (7). We teach clinicians and professionals on the front line of the obesity epidemic approaches for working in small 'bites' to establish skills that can be life-changing for their patients. two of those skills are the Eight hungers and pausing. the Eight hungers are: mind, eye, nose, ear, mouth, heart, stomach, and cellular. We invite participants to experiment with all 8 and determine which ones are most demanding on a day-to-day basis. one of the most useful skills to cultivate is pausing or 'slowing down, ' which is not necessarily a popular idea in our fast-paced life. i encourage practicing this in small steps: Pausing to take three deep breaths in and out before approaching a buffet, perusing a menu, or while standing at the kitchen counter can momentarily interrupt our automatic pilot. those three breaths can provide enough space to recognize that there are choices other than to proceed as usual. Always set a place and sit down at a table when you eat. try eating without the usual distractions of newspaper, phone, or tV. When our attention is elsewhere, our eating goes on automatic pilot. When we eat without being fully present to the taste, textures, smells, sounds, and appearance of our food, we are more likely to eat more than our body needs without feeling satisfied. Our fork, spoon, and knife seem to be in perpetual motion. Most of us don't realize that we never actually set down the fork and remove our hand from it. A simple mindful practice can break that cycle. i f your fork is in your hand scooping food or heading toward your mouth: eat, don't talk. i f your fork is resting on the plate and separated from your hand: talk. Fork up, eat. Fork down, talk. up, eat. d own, talk. you're welcome to listen on either the up or down! Mindfulness in Practice Many patients who are learning to be mindful worry that they aren't 'doing it right. ' they believe that they can either be mindful or they can follow their prescribed eating schedule without a middle ground. their words reflect the extreme belief system that determines how they approach everything in life: right or wrong, too much or not enough, success or failure, never or always. the following case illustrates this approach: i introduced clara, a young woman with t2dM on oral medication, to the Eight hungers. i asked her to check in with her body when she was about to eat by asking, \"Who's hungry in there?\" and see if she could tell which of the Eight hungers were hungry. she didn't think it was possible to always be mindful and preemptive of 6her hunger so as to keep her blood glucose from decreasing. b ecause her habituated thinking was either/ or and right way/wrong way, she believed she had to ignore her nutrition prescription if she was going to do mindfulness 'right. ' We explored how preemptive eating and following her schedule actually was mindful of her body. then we talked about expanding this mindful awareness to include a kindly attention to physical sensations in the body, such as stomach hunger and fullness, cellular hunger (i.e., the brain's need for glucose), and thirst and to consider how these signals might be included in tandem with rather than in opposition to her daily regimen. the idea that mindfulness is only one part of the larger picture, not the be-all-and-end-all, can be both a surprise and a relief. checking in with the Eight hungers helps us to better understand our body's natural signals and whether we are reacting or responding to impulses to eat or drink. None of the hungers we experience are all bad or all good. For example, sometimes mind hunger is about \" you shouldn't eat that because it's bad for you\" (e.g., eating ooey-gooey chocolate chip cookies for the second time in one day), but it can also be our skillful partner reminding us that 3 hours have passed and we need to stop and eat. two Practices b etter Are t han one in this age of instant access to opinions, materials, and evidence of varying degrees of accuracy, it's easy for our clients to suffer from information overload, which often confuses and distracts them from what is happening right now in their lives. diabetes self-care and mindfulness require commitment and practice and each 'feeds' the other. Mindfulness is a practical application of nonjudgmental awareness of how, what, where, and why we do or don't do what is best for us. \"i t is deliberately paying attention, being fully aware of what is happening both inside and outside yourself \u2014 in your body, heart and mind \u2014 and outside yourself, in your environment. \" (7). the good news is you don't need a guru, have to live in a cave, or even close your eyes to do that.

Mindful Eating: A Guide to Rediscovering a Healthy and Joyful Relationship with Food. boston, MA: shambhala Publications, i nc; 2009.7Abstract Many registered dietitian nutritionists (RdNs) encounter patients who want to follow healthy lifestyles but struggle to sustain such changes. yoga, a system of practice originating in ancient i ndia, may provide the modern practitioner with accessible tools to facilitate and sustain behavior change. trials to date investigating yoga and related comorbidities in individuals with type 2 diabetes (t2dM) suggest significant benefit. New understanding of neurobiology and the emotional nervous system as well as advances in genomics provide insight into mechanisms underlying observed benefits in early trials. introduction the etiology of t2dM is complex and multifactorial. however, certain lifestyle issues, including lack of physical activity and poor nutrition, are modifiable risk factors for t2dM onset and progression. A variety of strategies, including yoga, may be of interest to individuals who want to improve their lifestyles to prevent t2dM, address modifiable risk factors, and sustain improvements in behaviors. literature Review Research investigating yoga for management of chronic conditions and their risk factors is proliferating. Randomized clinical trials (R cts) have explored yoga as an adjunct therapy for the management of arthritis (1), lower back pain (2,3), high blood pressure (4,5), c Vd (6,7), respiratory disease (8,9), and stroke (10). The majority of RCTs on yoga for T2DM in peer-reviewed journals suggest improvements in outcomes or risk indices with practice (11). Results have included significant improvements in blood glucose (12,13), lipid profiles (14,15), blood pressure (16), body weight or bMi (17,18), and markers of oxidative yoga for type 2 diabetes and Related c omorbidities Annie b . Kay, Ms, Rd , Ryt lead Nutritionist Kripalu c enter for yoga & health stockbridge, MA stress (15). trials to date are heterogeneous for key study factors, including design (yoga alone vs. with other education or diet), population (demographics and those with well vs. poorly controlled t2dM), dose (style of yoga, intensity, and duration), and outcome measures. Possible Mechanisms yoga supports positive behavior change through a variety of complex, multifactorial, interacting and dynamic pathways. the emotional Defining the Terms what is Y oga? yoga is an i ndian philosophical system and a mind-body practice. i ts beginnings may be traced as far back as 5000 bcE. the word yoga comes from the s anskrit root yuj, which means \"to bind, join, and yoke\" or \"to use and apply. \" the defining elements of yoga practice include coordination of physical movement with attention to breathing and simultaneous mental focus within one's body. While yoga in America today often focuses only on the physical postures (asana), the full practice may encompass every aspect of life, including diet, mental attitude, choices about lifestyle, and philosophical study. yoga practice commonly includes the following: - A warm-up period of gentle stretches while focusing attention to breathing. - yoga postures (asana) performed sequentially with specific goals. they may be modified for the physical needs of the participant. - yoga breathing exercises (pranayama), deep relaxation, and meditation. yoga practice is generally considered safe in healthy individuals when practiced appropriately. s ome postures are contraindicated in individuals with high blood pressure, glaucoma, or sciatica and for women who are pregnant. these individuals will benefit from the guidance of a skilled teacher.8nervous system's management of stress and cognitive processing likely interplay with in vivo biochemistry (19). s tress also induces a biochemistry that favors poor food choices and obesity by triggering secretion of glucocorticoids that increase motivation for food and insulin, which promotes food intake and obesity. Eating refined food may produce a feedback signal that reduces perceived stress and, thus, reinforces eating in response to stress (19). yoga, meditation, and mindfulness practices appear to alleviate activation and reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathoadrenal system, fostering recovery from stress and downstream effects, perhaps including modulation of stress-related eating (20). stress also biases cognition toward lessened executive function and increased emotional activity in the amygdala of the brain (20,21).Meditation, yoga, and mindfulness have been suggested to increase activity of the prefrontal cortex of the brain and with practice, may support the adoption of healthful lifestyle choices (22,23). the vagus nerve runs from the cerebellum and brainstem to the viscera of the lower abdomen, coming into contact during its course with the heart, lungs, and sexual organs. s timulating the vagus nerve with deep diaphragmatic breathing that includes a lengthened exhale is believed to improve vagal tone and (by slightly elevating heart rate on an inhale and decreasing heart rate on an exhale) increase heart rate variability (hRV), a marker of cardiovascular health. yoga practice stimulates the vagus nerve and hRV, which shifts the autonomic nervous system from sympathetic (fight or flight) toward parasympathetic (rest and recovery) activation directly, providing a mind-body feedback loop for recovery from physiologic stress (20,21). clinical Application the yoga research community has not reached consensus on standard protocols and effective doses of yoga practice for various biomarkers. however, a threshold of benefit for yoga as adjunctive support to improve lifestyle behaviors appears to have been achieved. RdNs may choose to provide resources to those who are interested in yoga, provide referral to an appropriate qualified teacher, or become a credentialed provider by receiving professional yoga training. Yoga Styles and Teachers A variety of cd and dVd practices in various styles for specific aims are available from leading yoga teachers to enable at-home practice. For beginning students of yoga, however, a skilled teacher provides greater safety and effectiveness. Awareness of the variety of yoga styles currently practiced can enable RdNs to make informed referrals. More vigorous and demanding styles of yoga include Ashtanga, Vinyasa, or Power yoga. bikrim yoga and hot yoga are also more vigorous, in part because they take place in a heated room and may be contraindicated for those with c Vd and heat-sensitive health conditions. Moderate i yengar yoga emphasizes proper alignment and has been used in a number of clinical trials. Kripalu yoga has also been used in trials and is offered in gentle, moderate, and vigorous levels. Viniyoga, y in yoga, and Kundalini yoga are gentle as well. the experience and the training of the teacher determine the therapeutic value of the practice. Minimum qualifications generally recognized for a yoga teacher include the Registered yoga teacher (R yt) credential. A teacher with an R yt has completed a course of study approved by the national yoga Alliance (www.y A.org). summary yoga is safe and inexpensive when practiced appropriately and can be adapted for individuals of all ages and physical abilities. New evidence investigating potential benefits of this ancient practice holds promise in the management of complex lifestyle-derived chronic diseases, including t2dM and c Vd. Psychophysiology and genetics, two Defining the Terms Diaphragmatic breathing 1. Assume a comfortable seated position with a straight spine. 2. Place one hand on each side of the ribcage. Feel your ribcage expand outward as you inhale, thinking about the downward engagement of the diaphragm that fills your lungs. 3. Exhale slowly, feeling the ribcage coming back together as the diaphragm slowly relaxes and the lungs empty. Notice this for several breaths. 4. b egin practicing for 2 minutes and work your way up to 10 minutes or longer. Notice how you feel after this breathing practice. 9areas of rapidly emerging science, may offer new insight into how yoga practice could provide benefits. RdNs may find yoga and other experiential mind-body practices useful tools for supporting and maintaining behavior change in those they serve.

This article describes the microbiota, how it is formed, and the proposed mechanisms it plays in metabolic dysfunction. Prebiotics assist weight loss by decreasing energy intake and increasing energy expenditure. Potential use of probiotics as well as other healthy lifestyle habits may also help ensure a healthy gut microbiota. introduction in the last few decades, obesity and type 2 diabetes ( t2dM) have dramatically increased. s cientific evidence suggests that the microbes living in the gut, combined with energy intake/expenditure and the environment, may contribute to obesity and t2dM. those who are obese tend to have lower bacterial counts (gene diversity) than lean individuals (1). s ome suggest that alterations in intestinal microbiota are implicated in conditions such as food allergies, irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular diseases (2). the latter two are well-established comorbidities and/or complications of t2dM. dysbiosis (altered microbiota) leads to increased intestinal permeability and mucosal immune response, which can contribute to the development of obesity and diabetes (1,3,4). An altered microbiota has been implicated in increased energy extraction from the diet, production of low-grade inflammation, and altered fatty acid metabolism (1,3,4). Approximately 80% to 90% of the bacteria phylotypes comprise about 10% (4). obesity is associated with a higher proportion of Firmicutes, a diminished count of bacteroidetes, and an increase in Actinobacteria (5). individuals with diabetes have lower counts of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which possess anti-inflammatory properties (4). bacterial counts can be reversed within a few days of increasing dietary fiber and decreasing fat intake (1). importance of Microbiota the typical human hosts trillions of tiny microbial cells in the gut, belonging to about 1,000 species and, outnumbering human cells by 10 to 1. the genome of the microbiota, known as the microbiome, outnumbers the human genome by two orders of magnitude and provides important metabolic, neurologic, and immunologic functions for the human host (3). the the Role of the Microbiota in obesity and diabetes Meghan Jardine, Ms, MbA, RdN, cdE Associate director of diabetes Nutrition Educationdepartment of Nutrition Physicians c ommittee for Responsible Medicine Washington, dc microbiota releases enzymes that help digest and absorb nutrients as well as produce vitamin K, some b vitamins, and essential amino acids (6). A healthy microbiota protects the host against pathogens by competitive exclusion, making it harder for pathogens to proliferate, and assists in the development of the intestinal immune system (7). Factors t hat shape the Microbiota the skin of vaginally delivered babies soaks up healthy microbes from the mother's vagina and feces, while babies born by cesarean section acquire bacteria from the skin of the mother and delivery staff but end up with less microbial diversity (1). the microbiota of breastfed infants is dominated by Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcus, with significantly lower counts of Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, Bacteriodes fragilis, and Lactobacillus than seen in those fed exclusively by formula (4). the composition of the microbiota stabilizes by 3 years of age and is influenced throughout the lifecycle by diet, genetics, the environment, and antibiotics (1). literature Review in a study of gut microbiota in African and European children, (8), the African children's microbiota was significantly richer in bacteroidetes and lower in Firmicutes, with a 11unique abundance of bacteria from the genus Prevotella and Xylanibacter, which were absent in the European children's guts. Additionally, the African children had significantly more short-chain fatty acids (scFA). the authors postulated that diet played a role in the diversity and richness of the African children's microbiota and is associated with health benefits such as decreased inflammation, protection from noninfectious colonic diseases, and a reduction in obesity. Kalliom\u00e4ki and colleagues (9) noted that babies with a greater number of Bifidobacterium and lower count of Staphyloccocus aureus were leaner at the age of 7 years than those who became overweight. they concluded that dysbiosis precedes obesity. they also proposed that S aureus may trigger low-grade inflammation associated with obesity. Antibiotic overuse may alter human intestinal microbial populations. A 5-day course of antibiotics can modify the human gut microbiota for up to 4 weeks, with some microbial communities failing to recover even after 6 months (3). Exposure to antibiotics during the first postnatal months has been associated with a higher body mass index later in life (10). similarly, weight gain has been observed in individuals with long-term antibiotic use (4). Widespread exposure to low-dose antibiotics present in food and the environment (waste-related pollution) may lead to a chronic dysbiosis associated with obesity (7). i n the early 1990s, increased antibiotic use in livestock helped promote growth, and some propose that antibiotic overuse and environmental exposure could contribute to obesity in humans (7). Microbiota, obesity, and diabetes: Potential Mechanisms dysbiosis may contribute to obesity and diabetes by increasing energy harvest from the diet, altering gut permeability leading to endotoxemia, and prompting changes in energy expenditure and storage (1,3,4). scientific data consistently implicate a high-fat diet with an \"obesogenic\" microbiota that include higher counts of Firmicutes and lower counts of bacteroidetes (11). this dysbiosis is accompanied by increased extraction of energy from non-digestible oligosaccharides, resulting in increased de novo lipogenesis and accumulation of hepatic and adipose tissue triglycerides (11,12). such increased uptake in scFA is associated with an increased absorption of 140 to 180 kcal/day, potentially leading to weight gain (4). of note, butyrate, a scFA, has a bidirectional role by providing anti-inflammatory properties and improving gut barrier function (4). it is well established that insulin resistance is related to chronic low- grade inflammation. Metabolic endotoxemia is two times higher in individuals with t2dM and may be related to dysbiosis (12). Evidence suggests that a high-fat diet increases systemic lipopolysaccharide (lPs), which activates toll-like receptor-4 promoting the release of proinflammatory cytokines (1). Activated tlR-4 can compromise insulin action in the liver and muscle cells through the release of cytokines (3). d ysbiosis plays a further role in the absorption of lPs, a component of gram-negative bacteria, and possibly other antigens via disruptions in intestinal permeability. these findings are associated with a decrease in Bifidobacterium (4). lastly, a high-fat diet contributes to microbiota alterations that increase intestinal permeability and weaken the gut by decreasing mucus production (2). gut microbiota also appears to decrease fasting-induced adipose factor production, which inhibits the action of lipoprotein lipase, thus increasing storage of liver-derived triglycerides (1). Enzymes responsible for mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism are also down regulated by microbiota, further increasing adipose tissue hypertrophy (13). dietary Factors Prebiotics Prebiotics are \"a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in composition and/ or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well-being and health\" (13,14). A prebiotic resists gastric activity in the upper gastrointestinal tract, is Table 1. Natural Prebiotic Sources (17,19) Breast milk Jerusalem artichoke Chicory root Raw dandelion greens Leeks Onions Garlic Asparagus Whole grains Beans Banana Psyllium husk (Metamucil\u00ae) Wheat Oats Soybeans benefits of Prebiotics: Improved gut barrier function Improved host immunity Decreased pathogenic bacteria Increased SCFA productionProbiotics have been reported to suppress diarrhea, treat ibs and ibd , enhance immunity, prevent and delay certain cancers, lower cholesterol, exclude the growth of pathogens, and restore microbiota community after antibiotic use (16,18,19). 12Table 2. Sources of Probiotics and Reported Strains Plant-based Probiotics Reported s trains vary, depending on processing technique benefits of Probiotics: Secretion of antimicrobial substances Strengthening of gut epithelial barrier Competitive adherence to gut mucosa Modulation of immune system fermented by the microbiota, and stimulates the growth and/or activity of intestinal bacteria improving health and well-being (15). Prebiotics feed and enhance the proliferation and growth of probiotics, specifically health-promoting Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus (12,15,16). table 1 lists sources of prebiotics. Prebiotics also enhance the release of scFA: acetate, propionate, and butyrate. they restore health by decreasing inflammation and increasing insulin sensitivity through improving gut barrier integrity and reducing lPs levels. scFA also increase mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by increasing Amp-activated protein kinase (13). o ther benefits include: strengthening and feeding the colonocytes, decreasing hepatic cholesterol synthesis, and lowering the ph of the colon, thereby inhibiting the growth of pathogenic organisms. scFA enhance the absorption of minerals, including calcium, magnesium, and possibly iron (15). Prebiotics contribute to increased satiety, weight loss, and decreased postprandial plasma glucose (4,15). Probiotics Probiotics are \"live micro-organisms, which administered in adequate amount confer a health benefit on the host\"(15,16). For a probiotic to be effective, it must be able to (17): Resist gastric, bile, and pancreatic digestion Adhere and colonize the enterocytes Remain metabolically active once it reaches the gi tract Nullify the effect of disease-causing (pathogenic) bacteria Balance pH levels in the colon Exhibit favorable immunomodulation properties Have the ability to influence metabolic activities13For individuals with t2dM, probiotics appear to reduce inflammation- induced insulin resistance. this may be due to decreased intestinal permeability as well as immune system modulation. Moroti and associates (20) reported that individuals with t2dM who received Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and fructooligosaccharides had a significant reduction in fasting glucose in 45 days. table 2 lists common plant- and dairy-based probiotics along with their reported bacterial strains. table 3 lists microorganisms available as probiotics. supplemental probiotics are generally recognized as safe, but bloating, flatulence, and in rare circumstances, infections may occur (22). clinical Application Registered dietitian nutritionists should be aware of how alterations in microbiota can contribute to obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes and suggest pre- and probiotics for persons with t2dM. More human trials are required to delineate specific strains and dosing in general and for specific age groups and health conditions. summary the human gut microbiota may contribute to obesity and diabetes by increasing energy extraction from the diet, increasing inflammation associated with insulin resistance, and altering metabolism contributing to hypertrophy of adipocytes. the bacterial population of the human microbiome may evolve with diet changes, the environment, and overuse of antibiotics. Further research should examine the following: d oes an unhealthy microbiota lead to obesity and its related sequelae (diabetes/metabolic syndrome) or does obesity precipitate dysbiosis? What is the ideal microbiota? What pre/probiotic combinations will improve metabolic function for people with t2dM? References 1.

Vegetarians are about half as likely to have diabetes as non-vegetarians (1). Plant-based diets have been found to be protective against other conditions related to poor diet, such as cardiovascular disease ( cVd) and cancer, both of which disproportionately affect individuals with diabetes. this article reviews the research on plant-based nutrition as a therapeutic approach to prevent and treat diabetes and provides registered dietitian nutritionists (RdNs) with strategies to counsel their patients on adopting this eating pattern. introduction Plant-based nutrition is gaining popularity for health, environmental, and ethical reasons. c urrent dietary strategies for diabetes management include limiting or controlling carbohydrate intake, reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intake, and if needed, reducing caloric intake (2). d espite an increase in the carbohydrate load of many plant-based eating patterns, such diets can significantly improve insulin resistance, while lowering blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol, and body weight. the American diabetes Association (AdA) reports that a variety of eating patterns, including a plant-based one (vegan or vegetarian), have been shown to be effective in managing diabetes (3). Adopting a plant-based eating pattern requires commitment, knowledge, and support. RdNs are in the perfect position to encourage adoption of this cost-effective dietary approach for patients with diabetes while ensuring nutrition adequacy. literature Review Observational Studies seventh day Adventists (sd As) is a health-conscious christian denomination that encourages its members to abstain from alcohol and tobacco and engage in regular physical activity. Vegetarian eating Plant-based Nutrition: A therapeutic option for diabetes Meghan Jardine, Ms, MbA, RdN, cdE Associate director of diabetes Nutrition Educationdepartment of Nutrition Physicians c ommittee for Responsible Medicine Washington dc is also recommended. About 50% of sdAs are reported to be vegetarian, making them an ideal control group to study the health effects of various eating patterns. table 1 defines various plant-based eating patterns inclusive of those described in the Adventist health s tudies (Ahs). in longitudinal cohorts, dating as far back as 1960, Ahs has demonstrated the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes as 1.6 to 2 times higher in non-vegetarians compared to vegetarians (2,4). Even a small amount of meat increases diabetes risk by an estimated 29% (2). the Adventist health s tudy-2 (Ahs -2) of 60,000 subjects demonstrated a dose-response relationship between Table 1. Classification of Plant-based Eating Patterns and Eating Patterns Described in the Adventist Health Studies as Reported by Subjects (3) Vegan consuming no animal products (red meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, and dairy products < 1 time/month) lacto-ovo-vegetarian c onsuming dairy products and/or eggs 1 month but no fish or meat (red meat, poultry, and fish < 1 time/month) Pesco-vegetarian c onsuming fish 1 time/month and dairy products and/or eggs but no red meat or poultry (red meat and poultry <1 time/month) semi-vegetarian c onsuming dairy products and/or eggs and meat (red meat and poultry 1 time/month and <1 time/week) Non-vegetarian c onsuming animal products (red meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk, and dairy products >1 time/week)16animal product consumption and increased body mass index (bMi) and prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2dM)(1) (Fig. 1). the vegan group (8%) had the lowest rate of t2dM and was the only group with an ideal body weight (1). Protection against diabetes for the vegetarian and vegan group was significant even after adjusting for BMI, age, gender, ethnicity, and physical activity. the Ahs have also provided clear evidence that vegetarians have lower rates of coronary heart disease ( chd ), which may be explained by lower ldl cholesterol, blood pressure, and obesity. A combined analysis of the Adventist Mortality s tudy (AMs), Ahs -1, and cohorts of british and german vegetarians revealed a 32% higher chd mortality rate in non-vegetarians (5). Regular nut and whole grain consumption was also associated with lower risk of chd and lower rates of total cancer (5). table 2 lists evidence-based benefits for plant-based eating.A meta-analysis of non-vegetarian populations in the united s tates and Europe reported that meat consumption significantly increased the risk of diabetes (6). i n the European Prospective i nvestigation into c ancer and Nutrition (EPic )-Nl study, animal protein from any source was associated with a significantly higher risk of diabetes (7). h igh animal protein intake was associated with a fivefold increase in diabetes mortality across all ages in a study population of more than 6,000 adults followed for 18 years (8). An increase in meat consumption of just one half of a serving per day was associated with a 48% increased risk of t2dM in a 4-year period (9). Interventional Studies A 22-week National i nstitutes of health study compared a low-fat (10% to 15% of calories) vegan diet to a more conventional eating pattern in individuals with t2dM (10). both groups experienced improved glycemic and lipid control. however, among medication-stable patients, the vegan group had greater weight loss (14.3 lb vs. 6.8 lb P<0.001), greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (A1c ) (1.23 vs. 0.38, P=0.01), and greater reductions in ldl cholesterol (21.2% vs. 10%, P=0.02) (Fig. 2) (10). the authors postulated that these improvements were due to the higher fiber content of the vegan eating pattern, which improved satiety and reduced glucose absorption, providing a significant advantage in weight loss and glycemic control. b ecause the vegan eating pattern was also low in both total and saturated fat and contained no cholesterol, insulin sensitivity was further improved by decreasing intramyocellular lipids. this eating Figure 1. Adventist health s tudy-2 included 60,903 men and women. body mass index increases with increased consumption of animal products. the incidence of type 2 diabetes also increases, with the highest incidence in the non-vegetarian group. u sed with permission from Neal barnard, Md .

Potential Mechanisms for Meat and diabetes Risk Mechanisms for increased risk of t2dM with meat consumption include higher body weight, insulin resistance, fatty acid metabolism, heme-iron intake, oxidative stress, and an increased intake of advanced glycation end products (A gEs) (6,12,13). c onsuming meat displaces potentially protective foods such as legumes, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts. insulin resistance is associated with a higher intake of saturated fat, which may be mediated by the accumulation of intracellular lipids within the liver and muscle cells. A higher fat intake may also downregulate genes responsible for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in muscle tissues. Research demonstrated that individuals who avoided animal products had significantly lower concentrations of intracellular lipid (14). heme-iron, which is found in red meats, is readily absorbed, and promotes higher iron stores, has been positively correlated with insulin resistance and diabetes (2). similarly, high levels of iron can result in oxidative stress and cellular damage, leading to chronic inflammation, c Vd, and t2dM (2). highly oxidant compounds with pathogenic significance, A gEs have been found to contribute to diabetes risk and exacerbate complications. Analysis based on standard serving sizes showed that meats have the highest content of exogenous AgEs (6). in addition to meat, animal protein from other sources, including eggs and dairy, can increase inflammation, leading to higher rates of c Vd. carnitine and choline, which are abundant in animal products, are metabolized by gut microbes to trimethylamine, which is absorbed into the bloodstream and metabolized to trimethylamine-N-oxide ( tMA o) by the liver, increasing the risk of c Vd (14). i n one study, individuals consuming more meat, eggs, and diary had higher levels of plasma tMA o as well as increased risk of c Vd and adverse cardiac events (15). Nutrition Adequacy According to the Academy of Nutrition and dietetics, appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain Figure 2. A1c levels at baseline and at 11 and 22 weeks (P=0.01) in individuals with t2dM following a low-fat, vegan diet or control group with no medication changes. Adapted from barnard et al. (14) Figure 3. the Power Plate the Power Plate is a visual tool that can be used to educate patients on plant-based nutrition. it was created by the Physicians committee for Responsible Medicine. Additional information is available at www.t hePowerPlate.org. 18diseases (16). table 3 lists additional information on nutrients of concern. of special significance is vitamin b-12, which is produced by bacteria in the gastrointestinal tracts of mammals and is found only in animal products. Megaloblastic anemia, dementia, neuropathy, and irreversible nerve damage can be caused by vitamin b -12 deficiency. thirty percent of patients on long- term chronic metformin therapy are deficient in vitamin b -12 (17). the condition is often misdiagnosed as neuropathy, further exacerbating the deficiency. As individuals age, their ability to produce intrinsic factor decreases, reducing the ability to absorb vitamin b -12. the institute of Medicine (ioM) recommends that all individuals older than age 50 years take a vitamin b -12 supplement (18). the ioM recommends 2,000 \u00b5g of oral vitamin b -12 daily, followed by a decreased daily dose of 1,000 \u00b5g and then 1,000 \u00b5g weekly, and finally, monthly dosing to correct deficiencies (19). the Recommended dietary Allowance (Rd A) for vitamin b-12 is 2.4 \u00b5g/day. supplemental doses must be individualized for people with diabetes and following a vegan diet because the Rd A is not likely to be adequate for ongoing maintenance. clinical Application Patients who want to follow a plant-based eating pattern may include fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains, and a small amount of nuts and seeds in their diets. unlimited portions have been tested using the 'four food groups, ' with positive outcomes for glycemic control and reductions in ldl cholesterol, triglycerides, and weight (10,20). table 4 provides more guiding principles of plant-based eating as well as reliable, evidence-based resources. Table 3. Nutrients of Concern for Plant-based (Vegan) Eating Patterns Vitamin b -12 Plant products contain no vitamin b -12, so it is important to consume a supplement each day and/or fortified cereals, non-dairy milks, or nutritional yeast. Note: All individuals >50 years of age should consume a supplement (27) calcium 1 cup of cow's milk has 96 mg absorbable calcium. so do the following foods: \u00bd cup Chinese cabbage 1 cup bok choy 11/3 cups calcium-fortified soymilk/almond milk 1\u00bd cups kale 5.4 oz. calcium-added set tofu 2 cups white beans (28) other sources of calcium: collards, broccoli, almonds, sesame seeds, fortified foods (18) In the EPIC Oxford trial, vegans (adjusted for age, sex, non-dietary factors) who consumed at least 525 mg/day of calcium had the same risk ratio for fractures as meat eaters (29). Vegetarians consume higher amounts of nutrients important in bone health: magnesium, potassium, vitamins c and K, and polyphenols. daily consumption of legumes significantly decreases risk of fracture in vegetarian and non-vegetarian women (30). oxalates in spinach and s wiss chard greatly reduce calcium absorption (23). Protein Plant protein can meet protein requirements as long as a variety of plant foods are consumed and energy needs are met (18). s ources of plant protein include legumes, whole grains, tofu, tempeh, seitan, and whole grains. iron green leafy vegetables and legumes provide iron. the incidence of iron deficiency anemia is similar among vegetarians and non-vegetarians (31). Essential Fatty Acids Plant sources of essential fatty acids include ground flaxseeds, walnuts, cauliflower, soybeans, tofu, and brussels sprouts. these non-animal-based sources are free of saturated fat and cholesterol (32). Vitamin d s ources of vitamin d: sun exposure and fortified foods. Vitamin d deficiency is common in the general population and depends on sun exposure. sun exposure need varies, depending on skin pigmentation, sunscreen use, and geographic latitude. supplements may be needed if sun exposure and fortified foods are not sufficient to meet needs. Recommended dietary Allowance for vitamin d: 600 iu/day for adults and 800 iu/day for adults >70 years of age (33).19Patients with diabetes adopting a whole-foods, plant-based eating pattern need to be aware of potential significant decreases in blood glucose that require alterations in insulin or oral medications. changes in glycemia can be dramatic or gradual over several weeks or months (20). less frequently, patients may see an increase in postprandial blood glucose and may need to count carbohydrates either temporarily or on an ongoing basis. Advising these patients to select unrefined, low gi carbohydrates such as vegetables and legumes and to control portions of whole grains and fruits may improve postprandial glucose. initially, all patients should check their blood glucose levels more frequently and receive instruction on treating highs and lows. Patients with T1DM and T2DM who adjust meal time insulin must continue to count carbohydrates, but over time they may need to recalculate their insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios. Reductions in blood pressure and lipids also may require medication adjustments. Patients should be told that symptoms of low blood glucose or low blood pressure may be a good sign, and in some cases, they may be able to eliminate medications completely. summary A whole-foods, plant-based eating pattern is highly effective for the prevention, treatment, and management of diabetes. observational and interventional studies have demonstrated a reduction in insulin resistance, improvement in glycemic control, promotion of weight loss, and attenuation of macrovascular (cVd) and possibly microvascular comorbidities/complications. RdNs are in a unique position to provide education and support, thereby improving the health of their patients with diabetes. Table 4. Principles of a Low-fat, Plant-based Eating Pattern and Resources for Registered Dietitian Nutritionists Counseling Tips for Plant-based Nutrition for Diabetes: Consume generous portions from four food groups: whole grains, legumes (beans, peas, and lentils; also known as pulses), vegetables, and fruits. Individuals who adjust insulin based on carbohydrate intake should continue to count carbohydrates; insulin requirements may need adjustments. Choose whole foods or minimally processed foods. Avoid added vegetable oils and other high-fat foods to aid in weight loss and increases in insulin sensitivity. Include 1 oz of nuts or seeds per day and limit because of the high fat and calorie content. Choose carbohydrates with a low glycemic index, such as steel-cut or old-fashioned oatmeal, sweet potatoes with skin, beans, whole grains, and most fruits and vegetables. this should improve glycemia and avoid an increase in triglycerides. Consume at least 25-40 g/day of fiber. Gradual increases may be necessary to avoid gastrointestinal distress. Avoid all sources of animal products to eliminate cholesterol and saturated fat. A vitamin B-12 supplement is recommended for those avoiding animal products and all individuals >50 years of age. typical dosage is 25-100 \u00b5g/ day or 1,000 \u00b5g twice a week. A macronutrient profile of 75% to 80% energy from carbohydrate, 10% to 15% from protein, and 10% from fat is recommended.

A21Abstract diabetes mellitus (dM) requires patient self-management to prevent acute complications and reduce the risk of long-term comorbidities. i n view of their specific health benefits and potential to influence glycemic control, reduce cardiovascular disease risk, and modulate inflammation, functional foods (FFs) could be an important part of such management. introduction the role of FFs in chronic disease risk reduction and management has received increasing attention over the past several years. Although numerous foods have demonstrated hypoglycemic, hypocholesterolemic, antiatherogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects, this article focuses on medical culinary use of select herbs and spices. Functional Foods the international Food information council defines an FF or medicinal food as \"Foods or dietary components that may provide a health benefit beyond basic nutrition and may play a role in reducing or minimizing the risk of certain diseases and other health conditions\" (1,2). the Academy of Nutrition and dietetics defines the term FFs as \"whole foods along with fortified, enriched, or enhanced foods that have a potentially beneficial effect on health when consumed as part of a varied diet on a regular basis at effective levels based on significant standards of evidence\" (1). there is evidence that some food components in plant foods that are not considered nutrients in the traditional sense, such as phytochemicals, phytoestrogens, flavonoids, lignins, isoflavones, and phenolic compounds, may provide positive health benefits, and these foods are known as FFs (1). FFs include the healthful components in plant foods, fermented foods, and fortified/enhanced foods. Functional attributes of many traditional foods are being discovered, while new food products are being developed with beneficial components (1,2). Foods marketed as FFs fall into three general categories (1): Conventional foods containing natural bioactive food compounds that provide benefits beyond basic nutrition. Examples are the antioxidant vitamins in orange juice, prebiotics in bananas, and probiotics in yogurt. Modified foods containing bioactive food compounds through enrichment or fortification, such as n-3 fatty acids in margarine spreads and eggs. Food ingredients that are synthesized, which provide prebiotic benefits, such as oligosaccharides or resistant starch. Resistant starches are starches that escape digestion in the small spice it up: Functional Foods, herbs & spices in diabetes Management gita Patel, Ms, RdN/ld , cdE, clt Nutrition c onsultant for Feedinghealth Etna, Nh intestine. they provide some of the health benefits of both soluble and insoluble fiber. Natural resistant starch is found in whole grains, seeds, beans, legumes, and under-ripe fruit (e.g., green bananas) and is especially prevalent in cooked starches that have been cooled (e.g., beans, lentils, legumes, pasta salad, potato salad, and sushi rice). s oluble fiber feeds the intestinal bacteria, while insoluble fiber aids in digestion by trapping water in the colon and inactivates many intestinal toxins (3). the benefit of resistant starches for diabetes is a smaller contribution of carbohydrate energy and the benefit of delayed digestion that, in turn, helps reduce postprandial blood glucose spikes. herbs and spices herbs and spices, in use since approximately 5000 bcE, are among the richest sources of antioxidants and can play a central role in cooking. herbs are from the leaf, while spices are created from any other part of the plant, such as buds (e.g., cloves), bark (e.g., cinnamon), roots (e.g., ginger, turmeric), berries (e.g., peppercorns), and aromatic seeds (e.g., cumin) (3,4). bitter Melon (Momordica charantia; Family: Cucurbitaceae) this plant resembles a light green, pointed cucumber. i t is cooked with potato, onion, and/or tomato; 22pickled; or occasionally dried. s oaking the cut bitter melon in water, squeezing out the water, and cooking it with onions and tomatoes or tomato sauce can reduce the bitter taste. bitter melon fruit and seeds may help to improve glucose tolerance and reduce blood glucose concentrations in individuals with t2dM (5). the hypoglycemic effect is dependent on viable beta-cell function. bitter melon contains a mixed sterol, charantin, that lowers blood glucose as well as polypeptide-p, an insulin-like polypeptide (6). Possible mechanisms of action include increased insulin secretion, tissue glucose uptake, liver muscle glycogen synthesis, glucose oxidation, and decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis (7). Additive hypoglycemic effects have been reported when large quantities of bitter melon curry were consumed while taking chlorpropamide (8). Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum; Family: Fabaceae/Leguminoseae) dietary fiber (32% insoluble and 13.4% soluble) and are associated with reduced glycemia and cholesterolemia. Fenugreek's hypoglycemic effect has been documented in humans and animals with both t1dM and t2dM (9). When taken with food, fenugreek delays gastric emptying, slows carbohydrate absorption, and inhibits glucose transport. i ts constituent, 4-isoleucine, appears to stimulate insulin secretion. Fenugreek may reduce blood glucose levels and might have additive effects when used with medications to lower blood glucose (9). Accordingly, glucose levels should be closely monitored (9). Fenugreek seeds or powder (ground seeds) may be used in pickles, vegetables, rice dishes, and curries. the powder may be added to flour in baked foods or pancake batter. the seeds can be sprouted for adding to salads or cooked with rice, beans, or vegetables. Fenugreek leaves are eaten in i ndia as a fresh green vegetable or added to rice, dried bean dishes, potatoes, or flour to make a variety of breads. Cinnamomum cassia are believed to be responsible for potentiating insulin action, thereby lowering glucose levels. these polyphenolic compounds increase phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, which increases insulin sensitivity. increased insulin sensitivity improves blood glucose control and serum lipid levels. c innamon extracts also may activate glycogen synthetase and increase glucose uptake (8). Although cinnamon consumption is associated with statistically significant decreases in fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels as well as an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, no significant effect on glycated hemoglobin (h bA1c) was Amomum zingiber; Family: Zingiberaceae) in laboratory models of diabetes, ginger seems to increase the release of insulin and lower cholesterol levels. Preliminary in vivo research suggests that ginger might increase insulin and/or decrease blood glucose levels (8) Fresh ginger can be pickled with garlic and enjoyed with food. similarly, fresh, crystalized, or powdered ginger can be added to a variety of foods during cooking. grated ginger can be added to hot water or green or black tea for a ginger tea. An especially enjoyable and tasty combination is fresh or powdered ginger and antioxidant effects. A 9-month curcumin intervention (1,500 mg daily) in a prediabetic population significantly decreased the number of individuals who eventually developed t2dM compared to placebo (11). i n addition, the curcumin treatment appeared to improve overall beta-cell function with very minor adverse effects (11). in Asian i ndian cooking, turmeric is added to all vegetables, beans, legumes, grains, flours, and yogurt along with a source of fat such as oil or ghee and spices. Fresh grated turmeric mixed with lime juice, salt, and herbs is eaten as a condiment during the winter months in synonym Cuminum odorum; Family: Apiaceae/Umbelliferae) this spice, used regularly in Asian, indian, and Mexican cooking, may have hypoglycemic effects. Along with ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, and green tea, cumin has been shown to prevent and/or inhibit protein glycation. Protein glycation has been implicated in several pathophysiologies associated with 23aging and diabetes. i nhibition of the formation of protein glycation is believed to play a role in the prevention of diabetes-related complications (12). cumin is added to stir-fry vegetables, grains, yogurt beverages, and legume and beans dishes such as chili. garlic (Allium sativum; Family: Alliaceae or allicin and allyl propyl disulphide, have hypoglycemic effects and have been shown to improve blood glucose control. Researchers have noted the association of garlic use with increased serum insulin levels and improved insulin sensitivity (13). garlic can be used to flavor a variety of foods during cooking or in salad dressings are a significant source of naturally occurring flavanoids, which are anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, and antithrombotic. i n addition, flavanoids increase insulin sensitivity and increase postprandial insulin secretion, thus potentially improving glycemic control (14,15). conclusion bitter melon, fenugreek seeds, cinnamon, ginger, turmeric, cumin, garlic, onion, coriander, cloves, and cocoa can be used frequently in cooking. these FFs have a beneficial effect on health. Research is showing potential impact on blood glucose, coagulation status, lipid levels, and blood pressure. i ndividuals with diabetes who use herbs and spices to improve their diabetes management must monitor blood glucose closely and discuss the use of any herbs with a qualified health care professional.

When examining tcM, theoretical concepts of disease and health must be understood before evaluating the efficacy of its components or modalities (1). i n this article we provide an elementary overview of tcM theory, then discuss dM through the lens of tcM and evaluate the available research on acupuncture pertaining to the treatment and management of dM, its related comorbidities and complications. tcM: t heory and terms (2,3) yin and y ang yin and yang represent two oppositional but complementary forces between and within the physical body, environment, and metaphysical worlds. this concept is best understood pictorially: night and day, cold and hot, winter and summer, moist and dry, pallor and erythema. yin is associated with cooling or darkness (i.e., cold, winter) whereas heat and warmth are descriptive qualities of yang. Qi is made from the interaction of yin and yang. Qi Qi or chi (pronounced \"chee\") is 'vital energy or (life) force. ' i t is best described by the phrase \"No Qi, no life!\" According to tcM, Qi performs multiple functions in creating, maintaining, and supporting health. spirit spirit or 'shen' in tcM represents one's 'state of mind. ' shen resides in the heart, receiving nourishment by blood. blood in tcM, blood represents the nutritive aspect of the body. blood supports and nourishes shen. Qi, blood, and shen circulate throughout the body \u2014 they are the yin and yang aspects of one another. the Five Elements the Five Elements, a tcM subsystem, is used by many practitioners to differentiate symptomatology and categorize illness. t he t able illustrates the interrelationship between the diabetes and traditional chinese Medicine: Managing a Modern Epidemic With Ancient Medicine Elizabeth trattner, A.P .l.A.c., dipl RdN, cdE, R yt200 Ancient Wisdom for Modern Women the Washington health s ystem, diabetes Education & sunny isles b each & bay harbor islands, Florida Management Program/o utpatient Nutrition s ervices Washington, PA Five Elements of the material world \u2014 wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, the human body, and the metaphysical. Meridian Pathways and Acupoints According to tcM, meridians or energetic pathways form an intricate system by which blood and Qi travel throughout the body and, thus, explain how the body communicates internally with itself. Acupoints (acupuncture points) are points of energy confluence along meridians and related channels. Visualize an interstate highway and ancillary road system: major interstates are meridians, exits are acupuncture points, and county roads and city streets are extraordinary vessels and divergent channels (2,3,4). like police officers who direct traffic flow, acupuncture reinforces, reduces, or harmonizes Qi in the body (2,3,4). simplistically, there are 12 primary meridians corresponding to bodily organ systems. they are located between the epidermis and muscles and run a mapped course along anatomic structures, body organs, and bony landmarks. only 360 of the 2,000 acupuncture points are commonly used clinically.(4). Acupuncture is performed by manually inserting very fine, sterile, disposable needles in the skin at specific energetic (acupuncture) points (1). the needles can be 25manipulated manually, or electrically via electrical stimulation, called electroacupuncture (1,2,3). because of the possible placebo effect, numerous studies have attempted to distinguish sham (needles inserted at non-acupoints) from verum (needles inserted at acupoints) acupuncture. one study (5) inserted acupuncture needles into sham and verum points corresponding to ocular points on both feet. u sing magnetic resonance imaging, the researchers noted ocular activity when the corresponding eye acupuncture points on the feet were stimulated, but no ocular activity on the sham-stimulated points. diabetes from a tcM Perspective the word diabetes is not used in tcM. Rather, its constellation of symptoms (polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria with emaciation) is called disorder\" or \"diabetic exhaustion\" (2,3,6). Xiaoke is a constitutional yin deficiency characterized by fatigue, weakness, lethargy, and pale complexion (2,3,6). When persons with dM experience too much heat, they become thirsty, with corresponding bodily depletion (i.e., muscle atrophy/weight loss) or wasting (2,3,6). dM in tcM is divided into three categorical regions: upper, middle, and lower Xiaoke (2,3,6). these correspond respectively to the lungs (and in tcM, mouth/throat), which have \"excess thirst\" (polydipsia); the stomach, which has excess hunger (polyphagia); and the kidneys, which have excess urination (polyuria). Finally, liver Qi stagnation is related to and reflected in emotional factors that often trigger and coexist with Xiaoke. the lungs, stomach, liver, and kidneys are the organs commonly associated with a yin deficiency (2,3,6). this ancient definition resembles the classic allopathic presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus ( t1dM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2dM). t2dM is generally associated with greater body mass index as a consequence of excess caloric intake. similarly, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia are associated with inflammation (heat), and if hyperglycemia is persistent, polydipsia, polyphagia, and polyuria often occur, with consequent weakness and weight loss (7,8). diagnosis and t reatment in the tcM Model similar to the nutrition-focused physical assessment, diagnosis in tcM is made by taking the pulse and looking at the tongue, skin, eyes, hair, and body habitus in tandem with a detailed patient history and intake assessment. the tongue reflects the interior bodily landscape, in particular digestion, and different areas of the tongue correspond to geographic areas in the body. the tongue of the person presenting clinically like t1dM is dry. A pale and swollen tongue with or without accompanying teeth marks is a hallmark of Xioake resembling t2dM. tongue characteristics change with disease progression or comorbidities. the goal of tcM nutritional therapy for Xiaoke is to nourish, moisten, and cool the yin deficiency. Recommended foods include vegetables, berries, and soy (2). Notably, these foods are generally lower in glycemic index and/or glycemic load, lower in total fat, and higher in fiber and antioxidants (9). tcM from an Evidenced- based Platform Experimental and clinical case study data suggest benefits of acupuncture. it may positively affect glycemia and glucose metabolism in impaired glucose tolerance (igt ) and t2dM (10-13), favorably alter neuroendocrine metabolic with obesity (14,15), improve systolic blood pressure (16,17), modulate pain and symptomatology associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (dPN) (18,19), improve gastric motility in diabetic gastroparesis (20), and improve mood (12). Meng and colleagues (10) demonstrated that electroacupuncture reduced h bA1c and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose levels in individuals with igt . likewise, in a study published in abstract form, Mingming and Qianqian (11) demonstrated that meridian-acupuncture treatment reduced postprandial hyperglycemia in individuals with igt . in a randomized, controlled trial (R ct), shen and Kong (12) compared metformin hydrochloride (control group) and metformin hydrochloride plus acupuncture (experimental group) on glycemia. the results suggested that acupuncture and metformin hydrochloride were superior (P<0.05) in improving fasting blood glucose, 2-hour postprandial glycemia, and several meta-analyses (htN) (16,17), a common comorbidity in persons with t2dM; obesity (14,15), a common precursor to t2dM; and dPN (18,19) and gastroparesis (20), common microvascular complications of dM. the reviews on essential htN suggested that acupuncture is an effective therapeutic intervention, 26especially when combined with a pharmacologic agent;(16,17). t he authors contended that acupuncture and pharmacotherapy are superior to either pharmacotherapy or acupuncture alone. Furthermore, some proposed that acupuncture is advantageous as an adjunctive management modality because it is associated with a relatively low incidence of adverse effects. Admittedly, these positive preliminary findings must be interpreted cautiously because of methodologic flaws, including heterogeneity, unclear/questionable sequence generation and/or blinding, small sample size, and lack of intent-to-treat analyses in many of the studies. As with htN, the methodological quality of trials on acupuncture and dPN is poor for similar reasons as earlier noted. d espite this, however, chen and associates (18) in their systematic review of R cts on acupuncture and dPN indicated that acupuncture alone and/or in combination with b -vitamin supplementation modulated pain perception and symptomatology, with improved nerve conduction velocity. As with the htN reviews, no serious adverse events were reported; however, the authors admitted that Rcts are not the ideal template for identifying rare but serious harm. limited research suggests acupuncture may also improve mood (12) and gastric motility in those with diabetic gastroparesis (20). More carefully conducted research on acupuncture and the aforementioned dM comorbidities and complications is requisite. belivani and colleagues (15) published a comprehensive narrative review of acupuncture as a management modality for obesity. the article expanded upon a previous review by cho et al. and coworkers (15), which demonstrated that acupuncture concurrent with diet and exercise was superior to lifestyle advice, sham acupuncture, and conventional medicine alone for weight management. current scientific thinking suggests that the neurophysiologic effect of acupuncture is likely exerted by central nervous system activation, which is essential for autonomic nervous system modulation and consequently neuroimmunologic and hormonal regulation (21). the belivani group (14) further elucidated the postulated mechanisms by which acupuncture modulates anorexigenic and orexigenic peptides, glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism as well as inflammatory markers. succinctly, stimulation of specific acupoints along the vagal alters circulating neuropeptides ghrelin, leptin, B-endorphin. conclusion Acupuncture, a component of tcM, shows promise as an integrative and complementary modality for dM and its comorbidities and complications. Working together with tcM practitioners, integrative registered dietitian nutritionists can bridge the 'east-west' gap and optimize health Table.
