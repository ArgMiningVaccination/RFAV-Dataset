Your immune system protects you from illnesses by attacking and destroying viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other foreign invaders. It also helps you fight off cancer cells and aids your body's natural defenses against allergies. You can help protect yourself from illness by boosting your immunity through diet or with supplements made from natural ingredients. Read on to learn more about how to boost your immunity naturally! What is immunity, and why does it matter to my health? Your immune system protects you from illnesses by attacking and destroying viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other foreign invaders that invade the body. It also helps you fight off cancer cells and aids your body's natural defenses against allergies. For example, when an infection causes the membranes in your nose to swell up so much they temporarily close off access to your nasal passages, you don't want food particles or dust to sneak through and irritate your lungs. The immune system is one of the most important factors in maintaining good health since a healthy body can work to fight off illness before it even becomes noticeable. A weak immune system allows viruses and other harmful microorganisms to infect the body with much greater ease. How to boost your immune system with natural remedies? Add certain foods to your diet that have been used for centuries to boost the body's immunity. These natural remedies have been used for many generations, and there is a lot of scientific evidence to support their effectiveness. As with any dietary supplement, it is important to speak with a health professional before taking anything new. Also remember that even though these remedies are natural, they should not be substituted for traditional treatments or medications. Supplements may interfere with other medication you are taking or have negative interactions with any health problems you have. Herbs for boosting the immune system Echinacea: This herb is commonly used to treat colds and flu. It contains several constituents that can potentially help boost immune function, including echinacoside and caffeic acid. A 2009 study found that taking echinacea supplements reduced the duration of a cold by an average of four days, although the difference may not be very meaningful. Echinacea also appears to enhance the activity of certain white blood cells that attack and destroy bacteria and other foreign invaders. It seems to work best in people who have taken it for at least a year, but the effectiveness varies greatly from person to person. Garlic: For centuries, garlic has been used to treat a variety of health problems. More recently, studies have found that it contains compounds that can enhance the activity of natural killer cells, which attack and destroy harmful foreign molecules or bacteria. Some evidence suggests that taking garlic supplements can reduce the incidence of colds and flu. Studies by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health found that taking garlic supplements significantly reduced the number of colds in people who had taken two capsules daily for four months. Ginger: Ginger is a very versatile herb that has been used in cooking and medicine for centuries. Research shows that ginger can enhance the activity of white blood cells, boost antioxidant levels, and reduce inflammation. Green Tea Extract: Green tea is rich in various plant compounds, including polyphenols and caffeine. It has traditionally been used to treat many different health problems. A 2010 study tested the effects of green tea extract on people with chronic hepatitis B virus infections. After 16 weeks, the subjects had significantly lower levels of liver enzymes, which are commonly elevated in people with hepatitis. There was also a reduction in the number of inflammatory cytokines, which play an important role in the progression of chronic liver disease and other conditions. Foods that help boost the immune system Blueberries: Blueberries have been found to enhance the activity of a white blood cell called a neutrophil. They also contain compounds that may help reduce oxidative damage and inflammation. In a study by the University of Florida in Gainesville, 20 people consumed two cups of frozen blueberries daily for six weeks. During the study period, they had fewer colds and flu symptoms, including a decrease in mucus secretion, compared to the beginning of the trial. Broccoli sprouts: Several studies have found that extracts from broccoli sprouts can boost levels of antioxidant enzymes in cells throughout the body while reducing inflammation in the brain. A recent study showed that supplementing with broccoli sprout extracts could increase the activity of natural killer cells. Celery Juice: Celery juice has long been used to treat many different conditions, including arthritis and digestive problems. Nutritionists recommend drinking 1 ounce of celery juice mixed with 1 ounce of carrot juice and 1 ounce of orange juice daily. High levels of potassium, magnesium, and sodium may help reduce inflammation and swelling throughout the body. Cherries: Several studies have found that tart cherry extracts can inhibit the activity of certain enzymes that break down cartilage and other connective tissue in joints. This means that it could prevent or slow the progression of arthritis. Celery juice has long been used to treat many different conditions, including arthritis and digestive problems. Nutritionists recommend drinking 1 ounce of celery juice mixed with 1 ounce of carrot juice and 1 ounce of orange juice daily. High levels of potassium, magnesium, and sodium may help reduce inflammation and swelling throughout the body. Radishes: In a study, people who ate about three ounces of radishes daily for two weeks experienced a significant reduction in symptoms of osteoarthritis, including reduced pain and improved mobility. Radish extract has also been found to inhibit enzymes that break down cartilage. Salmon: Salmon is a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are necessary for normal immune function. One study found that people who ate three ounces of salmon daily for five weeks experienced fewer colds and flu symptoms than at the beginning of the trial. Tuna: Another good source of omega-3 fatty acids, tuna has been shown to help reduce inflammation throughout the body and dampen allergic responses. Walnuts: Walnuts contain many nutrients and plant compounds that support the immune system and heart health, including omega-3 fatty acids, copper, manganese, vitamin E, magnesium, and antioxidants. A study published in the \"Journal of Medicinal Food\" found that eating 1/2 cup of walnuts daily for six weeks helped reduce the incidence of cold and flu symptoms. Foods that have an immunosuppressive effect Sugar: Some research suggests that excess sugar may suppress immune function, which could make you more susceptible to disease. Foods like white sugar and corn syrup contain no nutrients but instead provide calories as \"empty\" carbohydrates. This can lead to a surge in blood sugar level, which in turn triggers an insulin response that can result in low blood sugar. A lack of nutrients and an overabundance of simple carbohydrates may suppress the immune system by reducing the body's ability to produce infection-fighting antibodies. Artificial sweeteners: Some studies have found that artificial sweeteners like aspartame can reduce healthy gut bacteria and impair the body's ability to fight off infectious disease. Conclusion: A healthy immune system is one of the most important factors in maintaining good health. Your immune system protects you from illnesses by attacking and destroying viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other foreign invaders. It also helps you fight off cancer cells and aids your body's natural defenses against allergies. You can help protect yourself from illness by boosting your immunity through diet. Healthy eating tips include adding more fresh fruits to your diet to provide ample vitamin C for improved immunity as well as following a Mediterranean Diet which reduces inflammation levels that are linked to chronic diseases.
