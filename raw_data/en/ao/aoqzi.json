Nazmul Huda, PhD,a,b,cShaikh PhDa,b abstract BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiome in early infancy affects immunologic development and thus may affect vaccine memory, though few prospective studies have examined such associations. We examined the association of Bidobacterium levels in early infancy with memory responses to early vaccination measured at 2 years of age. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we examined the association of Bidobacterium abundance in the stool of healthy infants at 6 to 15 weeks of age, near the time of vaccination, with T-cell and antibody responses measured at 6 weeks, 15 weeks, and 2 years of age. Infants were vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) (at birth), oral polio virus (at birth and at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), tetanus toxoid (TT) (at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), and hepatitis B virus (at 6, 10, and 14 weeks). Fecal Bidobacterium was measured at 6, 11, and 15 weeks. Bidobacterium species and subspecies were measured at 6 weeks. RESULTS: Mean Bidobacterium abundance in early infancy was positively associated with the CD4 T-cell responses to BCG, TT, and hepatitis B virus at 15 weeks, with CD4 responses to BCG and TT at 2 years, and with plasma TT-speci c immunoglobulin G and stool polio-speci c immunoglobulin A at 2 years. Similar associations were seen for the predominant subspecies, Bidobacterium longum subspecies infantis . CONCLUSIONS: Bidobacterium abundance in early infancy may increase protective ef cacy of vaccines by enhancing immunologic memory. This hypothesis could be tested in clinical trials of interventions to optimize Bidobacterium abundance in appropriate populations. WHAT 'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The composition of the gut microbiome affects many aspects of immune function and is known to affect response to vaccination over the short-term. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: We demonstrate that a high abundance of Bidobacterium in early infancy when infants receive several vaccines is associated with better vaccine memory, as indicated by higher responses to Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, polio, and tetanus vaccines measured at 2 years of age.

The absence of bacteriain germ-free mice affects both local systemic lymphoid compartments,9,10whereas colonization with speci c commensal bacteria12-14affects both innate and adaptive immunity.15Disruption of normal development of the intestinalmicrobiome may have adverseimmunologic consequences. Quantitative or qualitative \"deciencies \"in microbial exposure during infancy increases subsequentrisk of atopic includingasthma, 16whereas the early administration of bacteria isassociated with a decreased risk ofatopic eczema. 17Researchers have examined in only a few human studies the relationship of naturallyoccurring gut bacteria with immunefunction, although members of theBidobacterium genus have been associated with higher levels ofimmunoglobulin cells, 18memory B-cells,19and salivary IgA,20suggesting a bene relationship for the infant. Establishment of the intestinal microbiome begins early in infancyand follows a typical pattern. 21 Facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Staphylococcus ,Streptococcus , Lactobacillus , and Escherichia initiallycolonize the colon, followed by strict anaerobes that come to predominateduring the rst few months of life. In breastfed infants Bidobacterium longum subspecies infantis often dominates the microbiome because it is speci cally adapted to both use human milk oligosaccharides as a carbon source and to restrict human milk oligosaccharides availability toother bacteria. 22Bacteroides and clostridia are also important commensal anaerobes in the infant gut.21The abundance of Bidobacterium species (relative to total bacteria) can exceed 60% in breastfed infants in countries like Bangladesh where breastfeeding is widespread.23,24The abundance of B longum subspecies infantis is lower in the United States and other Western countries and appears to have decreased over recent decades,25 concurrent with the rise inautoimmune and allergic diseases. In the current study, we evaluate the hypothesis that greater exposure to Bidobacterium (and to B longum subspecies infantis in particular) early in infancy when vaccines are administered will result in bettermemory responses to these vaccines. We previously reported that a high abundance of Bidobacterium , and of B longum subspecies infantis ,a t 15 weeks was associated with highervaccine responses measured at the same time. 24In that study, we examined a subset ( n= 48) of infants in a birth cohort of 306 infants. In the current study, we measure thevaccine responses of all available infants at 2 years of age to test the hypothesis that Bidobacterium abundance at 6, 11, and 15 weeks of age is predictive of vaccine responsesmeasured at 2 years. We examine responses to 4 vaccines: tetanus toxoid (TT) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) given at 6, 10, and 14 weeks; Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), given within 48 hours of birth; and oral polio virus (OPV), given within 48 hours of birth and at 6, 10, and 14weeks. We also examine vaccine responses measured at 6 and15 weeks to increase the sample sizeof our previous report. 24 METHODS Study Design In this study, we re-recruited all available participants froma randomized and responses at2 years in the same infants (NCT02027610) (Supplemental Table 4). The study was approved bythe Research Review Committee andthe Ethical Review Committee of theInternational Centre for DiarrhoealDisease Research, Bangladesh. Theinclusion-exclusion criteria, studydesign, laboratory methodology, clinical procedures, and baseline characteristics of the participantshave been described. 26 Vaccine Responses Assay Vaccine-speci c CD4 T-cell stimulation index (SI), antibody (ALS)responses and the puri ed protein derivative delayed-typehypersensitivity (DTH) skin testresponse were measured as described in our earlier report. 26,27 All of the vaccines are T-cell -dependent in that a robust T-cell response is needed forprotection. Thus, we view the SI asa proxy for the magnitude of memoryresponse (ie, the number of memoryT cells). Stool extracts were prepared as described 28to measure polio- speci c IgA by using immunosorbent assay(ELISA) described in theSupplemental Information. plasma poliospeci c immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA, HBV-speci c IgG, and TT-speci c IgG at 2 years was determined by ELISA by using a chaotropic agent as 2 HUDA et aldescribed in the Supplemental Information. Microbiota Assay Overall stool microbial composition was determined by using 16s V4 sequencing method24modi ed as described in the SupplementalInformation. Abundance at the genuslevel refers to the abundance ofBidobacterium genomes relative to all bacterial genomes. A terminalrestriction-fragment length- polymorphism assay was used to identify bi dobacteria at the species level by comparing fragment lengthsto published data. 29Details are provided in the SupplementalInformation and previouspublications. 24,30 Statistical Analysis The associations betweenbidobacteria and vaccine-speci c immune responses were determinedby multiple regression analysis byusing the mean Bidobacterium abundance during early infancy (6,11, and 15 weeks) and at 6 weeks only, and the abundance of Bidobacterium species and subspecies measured at 6 weeks, asindependent variables. The analysiswas adjusted for possible covariates,including sex, vitamin A or placebotreatment, birth weight (above orbelow median), and type of delivery (cesarean delivery or vaginal). Breastfeeding status (exclusive ornonexclusive) during early infancyaffects Bidobacterium abundance and could independently affectvaccine responses and was thusevaluated as a covariate in our model.It was statistically signi cant in only 2 cases and was thus not included in thenal model. However, examination of stool IgA responses toOPV at 2 years could be affected ifbreastmilk contained OPV-speci c IgA. Thus, we included breastfeedingstatus (yes or no) in the regressionanalysis at 2 years. A Pvalue of ,.05 was considered statistically signicant for all analyses. Data arepresented as means 6SD unless otherwise indicated. Statisticalanalysis was performed by using Rversion 3.4.2. 31 RESULTS Characteristics of Study Infants Microbiota data were available from 291 infants at 6, 11, and 15 weeks,and from 249 of these same infants at2 years. Half of the participants were boys, and half received a high-dose vitamin A supplement within48 hours of birth as prescribed by theparent study (Table 1). The majorityof infants were born by electivecesarean delivery, as is typical forhospital deliveries in Bangladesh. 26 At 6 weeks, all infants were exclusively or predominantly breastfed, and at 2 years, 55%received supplemental breastfeeding.Infants were healthy on the days ofsample collection but a smallpercentage had elevated C-reactiveprotein (CRP), indicating an ongoingacute phase response (Table 1). Bidobacteria Were the Most Abundant Taxa All infants had detectable Bidobacterium at 6 weeks and the mean abundance for 6, 11, and15 weeks was 0.637 with a range0.020 to 0.921 (SupplementalTable 5). Species and subspecies of Bidobacterium were measured at 6 weeks, and B longum was by far the most abundant species, at 0.581,followed distantly by Bidobacterium breve and Bidobacterium bi dum at 0.032 and 0.014, respectively. Wefurther analyzed the 2 subspecies of B longum and found that B longum subspecies infantis (abundance, 0.568) was predominant, being 10- fold more abundant than B longum subspecies longum (abundance, 0.058), as expected. Bidobacteria Abundance Was Positively Associated With theCD4 T-Cell Response to the BCG Vaccine The BCG vaccine was given once within 48 hours of birth. Although intestinal bacterial communities were not established at that time, wehypothesized that such communitiesestablished between 6 and 15 weekswould affect maintenance of the BCGmemory response. We tested thishypothesis using multivariateregression analysis to adjust for other factors that could also affect vaccine responses and found that meanBidobacterium abundance in early infancy (measured at 6, 11, and 15weeks; Table 2) and Bidobacterium abundance measured at 6 weeks only(the closest time to vaccination;Supplemental Table 6) were both TABLE 1 Characteristics of the Participants Characteristics 6 wk ( n= 280) 2 ya(n= 249) Sex, boy 137 (48.9%) 122 (48.8%) Vitamin A supplement 139 (49.6%) 121 (48.8%) Mode of delivery, cesarean delivery 170 (60.7%) (62.7%) Gestational age, wk Wasting, WHZ ,2 2 13 (4.66%) 24 Stunting, HAZ ,2 48 median age (25th, 75th percentile) = 28.0 (24.8, 30.1) m, range = 18.4 m. bCRP value was not available for 24 subjects at 6 wk and 6 subjects at 2 y. PEDIATRICS Volume 143, number 2, February 2019 3positively associated with the CD4 memory T-cell responses (measured as the SI) at 15 weeks and 2 years butnot at 6 weeks (Fig 1). For infantswith high mean Bidobacterium abundance (90th percentile of studypopulation, abundance = 0.814), theestimated SI at 15 weeks was 85%higher than for infants with lowBidobacterium abundance (10th percentile abundance = 0.396),whereas the difference at 2 years was64% (Table 3). No signi cant associations were seen betweenBidobacterium abundance and the DTH skin-test response for BCG(Fig 1). In addition to Bidobacterium abundance at the genus level, Bidobacterium species and subspecies were measured at 6weeks, and we examined theseassociations as well, primarily todetermine if the predominant species(B and subspecies ( B longum subspecies infantis ) were also associated with these vaccineresponses. In brief, we found thatboth B longum (Supplemental Table 7) and B longum subspecies infantis (Supplemental Table 8) were signicantly associated with the SI response at 15 weeks but not 2 years(Fig 1). We also examinedassociations for the less abundantBidobacterium subspecies ( B longum subspecies longum Supplemental Table 9) and 2 minor Bidobacterium species ( B breve and Bb idum; Supplemental Tables 10 and 11,respectively), and no signi cant associations were seen (Fig 1). Because bi dobacteria might affect T-cell proliferation in general (which could affect development of vaccinememory responses), we examined theassociation of bi dobacteria with the SI for Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), a polyclonal stimulator ofT-cell proliferation. As forthe SI Bidobacterium ,B longum , and B longum subspecies infantis abundance were allTABLE 2 The Association Between Bidobacterium Abundance During Early Infancy (Mean of 6, 11, and 15 Weeks of Age) and Vaccine-Speci c CD4 T-Cell SI, DTH Skin Test Response, and Antibody Responses Regression Model Average Bidobacterium Abundance R2P b(SE) P BCG CD4+T-cell SI 0.0590 .021 .668 (0.214) ,.01 Skin (0.362) .24 .111 polio IgG AI 0.0317 .088 Association between infant 'sBibacterium abundance and 6 wk vaccine response was analyzed by using genus Bi- bacterium abundance at 6 wk of age.

The regression models were adjusted with sex, treatment group, birth weight, and type of delivery. Stool antibody models were additionally adjusted for breastfeed status at 2 y of age. aVaccine response was signi cantly different between boys and girls. bVaccine response was signi cantly different between treatment groups. cVaccine response was signi cantly different between normal and cesarean delivery. dVaccine response was signi cantly different between below and above birth weight median. 4 HUDA et alsignicantly associated with the SI for SEB at 15 weeks (Fig 1). Bidobacteria Abundance Was Positively Associated With Responses to TT and HBV Vaccines TT and HBV vaccines were administrated at 6, 10, and 14 weeks,within the period when bi dobacteria abundance was assessed, and we thushypothesized that bi dobacterial abundance would be positively associated with the SI and IgGresponses to both vaccines when theywere measured at 15 weeks and2 years. In partial con rmation of thishypothesis, Bidobacterium ,Bl o n g u m , and Bl o n g u m subspecies infantis abundance were all positively associated with the SI responses to both TT and HBV when they weremeasured at 15 weeks and with theTT SI response at 2 years, but theywere not positively associated with theHBV response at 2 years (Fig 2). At 15weeks, the predicted SI values forinfants with high Bidobacterium abundance were 76% and 45% higher than for those with low abundance forTT and HBV responses, respectively,whereas the corresponding differenceat 2 years for TT was 57% (Table 3).Bidobacterium abundance at the genus level was positively associatedwith the IgG responses to the TTvaccine when measured both at15 weeks and at 2 years, whereasa similar association was seen at15 weeks for B longum abundance (Fig 2). The predicted TT-speci c IgG concentration at 2 years was 42%higher in infants with high versus lowBidobacterium abundance (Table 3). Bidobacterium at the genus level was not associated with the HBV IgGresponse at either 15 weeks or2 years, although HBV-speci c IgG at 15 weeks and plasma IgG maturation index at 2 years were negativelyassociated with B breve and B longum subspecies longum , respectively (Fig 2). All infants had protective IgGtitres TT ( $0.1 IU/mL) and HBV ( $10 mIU/mL) at generally positive associations of Bidobacterium ,B longum , and B longum subspecies infantis abundance with TT vaccine responsesfound in regression analysis can beseen graphically (without adjustmentfor covariates) in scatterplots of theraw data at 15 weeks (SupplementalFig 5) and 2 years (Fig 3). Bidobacteria Abundance Was Positively Associated With IgG andIgA Responses to OPV Vaccine OPV vaccine was administered within 48 hours of birth and again at 6, 10, and 14 weeks. We hypothesized thatbidobacterial abundance would be positively associated with OPVvaccine responses, which includedthe total IgG response at 15 weeksand strain-speci c responses (3 strains are found in the OPV vaccine) at 2 years (plasma IgG and IgA, and stool IgA). In partial agreement withour hypothesis, the abundance ofBidobacterium was positively associated with polio-speci c stool IgA at 2 years (Fig 4), with thepredicted response being 107%higher in infants with high versus low Bidobacterium abundance (Table 3). This association can also be seen FIGURE 1 Heat map showing associations (and statistical signi cance) between early life bi dobacteria abundance and BCG vaccine responses measured at 6 weeks, 15 weeks and 2 years of age de-termined with multiple regression analysis as described in Methods. BCG vaccine responses includethe CD4 T-cell SI and the DTH skin test response. Associations with the SI for the positive control forCD4 T-cell stimulation (SEB) are also shown. Bi dobacteria abundance measures were as follows: (1) mean abundance of the genus Bidobacterium measured at 6, 11, and 15 weeks and single measures made at 6 weeks for (2) the genus Bidobacterium ; (3) the most abundant species, B longum ; (4) the most abundant of 2 subspecies, B longum subspecies infantis ; (5) the second subspecies, B longum subspecies longum ; and 2 minor species, (6) B breve and (7) Bb idum .

Plasma IgA at 2 years alsorevealed some positive bi dobacterial associations (Fig 4), includingpositive associations of bothBidobacterium and of B longum with the poliovirus strain 3 IgA response, whereas a negative association wasseen between B breve and the strain 1 response (Fig 4). Bb idum abundance was positively associatedwith plasma IgG concentration at2 years, whereas meanBidobacterium abundance was positively associated with the IgG AI (Fig 4). Two negative associationswere also seen: B longum subspecies longum with 15 weeks IgG and B breve with 2 years plasma polio- speci c IgA. DISCUSSION Higher bi dobacteria abundance in early infancy is associated with bettermemory responses to vaccines givenat this time, as judged by themagnitude of the vaccine responsesmeasured at 2 years. MeanBidobacterium abundance measured at 6, 11, and 15 weeks, and Bidobacterium abundance measuredat 6 weeks only, performed similarly in predicting later vaccine responses.These ndings are novel and support current thinking about how gutmicrobiota may shape developmentof the infant immune system. 7,32For example, higher Th1 responses are associated with bi dobacterial a with low Bidobacterium , Akkermansia Faecalibacterium in early infancy is associated with atopicCD4 T-cell responses at 2 years andasthma development at 4 years. 34In addition, vaccinia virus both in fluenced by gut microbial composition. These studies also suggest a cause-effect relationshipbetween gut microbiota and vaccineresponses. Our results suggesta general effect of bi dobacteria on T-cell proliferation or survival, asindicated by the association ofbidobacteria levels with both vaccine-speci c and SEB-stimulated T-cell proliferation, whereas the lackof an association with SEB-stimulated proliferation at 2 years suggests anindependent association withmaintenance of vaccine memory. Gut bacteria affect development of T cells, particularly Treg and Th17cells. 12,37Bidobacterial effects on T-cells could be direct or might involve effects on dendritic cells which then affect T cells, and theseeffects may be mediated byproduction of small-moleculebacterial commensal bacteriamay act as natural vaccineadjuvants. 44Indirect mechanisms may also be relevant. For example,Bidobacterium protects against enteropathogenic infection 45and reduces the relative abundance ofEnterobacteriaceae 46and thus may improve vaccine responses byreducing the risk of symptomaticinfections or subclinical dysbiosis. Many studies report associations of gut microbiota with vaccine-speci c antibody responses. 7In the current study, we report positive associationsof early life bi dobacteria with TT- speci c IgG responses both in early infancy and at 2 years, and with polio- speci c IgA at 2 years, suggesting a sustained effect on vaccine memory.A study examining rotavirus vaccineresponse among infants in Ghana 47 found no associations withActinobacteria (the phylumcontaining bi dobacteria), but reported that serum IgA negatively associated withBacteroidetes and positivelyassociated with Streptococcus bovis . The same group performed a in Pakistani infants and foundno association withBidobacterium . 48The infants in the current study did not receive rotavirus vaccine. A previous study FIGURE 2 Heat map showing associations (and statistical signi cance) between early life bi dobacteria abundance and TT and HBV responses measured at 15 weeks and 2 years of age determined withmultiple regression analysis as described in Methods. Responses include the CD4 T-cell SI, the ALSassay for IgG at 15 weeks, plasma IgG at 2 years, and the IgG AI at 2 years. Bi dobacteria abundance measures were as follows: (1) mean abundance of the genus Bidobacterium measured at 6, 11, and 15 weeks and single measures made at 6 weeks for (2) the genus Bidobacterium ; (3) the most abundant species, B longum ; (4) the most abundant of 2 subspecies, B longum subspecies infantis ; (5) the second subspecies, B longum subspecies longum ; and 2 minor species, (6) B breve and (7) B bidum . 6 HUDA et alfound that abundance of B breve and B longum49were both positively correlated with polio-speci c stool IgA measured shortly aftervaccination. In the current study, wealso report a nonsigni cant ( P= .088) positive association betweenBidobacterium and HBV-speci c IgG at 2 years. A previous human study 50 using B longum and Lactobacillus rhamnosus supplementation in infants also showed a trend towardan increased HBV-speci c IgG response. In another geniculate in nasal microbiota positively andnegatively associated with IgA responses, respectively, to intranasal influenza vaccination. 51We alsoreport that the B breve was negatively associated with polio-speci c plasma IgA, a nding that is consistent with another study52revealing that B breve supplementation lowers the serum IgA response to choleravaccination. In our study, we also found a negative association between B longum subspecies longum and polio-speci c ALS IgG at 15 weeks. Such results emphasize the need to identify the mechanisms by which speci cb idobacteria affect immunity. Strengths of our study include the examination of short- and long-term memory responses, the relativelylarge sample size, the use of speci c assays for bi dobacteria at thespecies and subspecies level, the use of multiple vaccines and of multiple vaccine end points, and the prospective study design. Our study islimited in that it is observational, thuswe cannot infer causality from theassociations described here, andparticipants were all breastfed, limitingthe diversity in intestinal microbiotaseen in study infants. Additionally, although BCG and the OPV are not used in developed countries, thesimilarity in associations seen in thiss t u d yt ot h a ts e e ni nas m a l ls t u d yo finactivated polio virus, 49as well as the associations to the more widelyadministered HBV and TT vaccines,s u g g e s tt h a tt h e s er e s u l t sa r er e l e v a n t for many populations of infants around the world.

PEDIATRICS Volume 143, number 2, February 2019 7CONCLUSIONS Colonization with Bidobacterium at the time of vaccination is associatedwith sustainable systemic andmucosal vaccine-speci c memory T-cell and antibody responses. Developing strategies to enhanceimmunologic memory is a highpriority for vaccine research. 53 A recent intervention trialdemonstrated that administration ofprobiotic B longum subspecies infantis to healthy infants between 7 and 28 days signi cantly increased the abundance of this organismthrough at least 60 days, 46demonstrating prolongedcolonization with this organism inbreastfed infants. An adequatelypowered randomized controlled trialof a similar strategy to increase earlycolonization with B longum subspecies infantis to enhance responses to early vaccination is indicated by our ndings.
