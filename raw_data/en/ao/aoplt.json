We also offer food sensitivity IgG/IgA testing, and other measures of immune function, such as immunoglobulins (IgE/IgA/IgG), histamine levels, a complete blood count, autoimmune screening, and specific tests for PANS and PANDAS. Autism Testing: We believe autism is a complex multi-system based disorder that requires a comprehensive individualized workup! Based on the intake, we will select laboratory tests to further assess gut function, metabolic function, mitochondrial function, immune function, copper/zinc balance, methylation status, environmental toxicity, and [folate-receptor antibodies](http://iliadneuro.com/information-on-frat.html). Environmental Toxicity Testing: Our environment is more polluted with toxins than ever before. Environmental toxins have been implicated in many chronic illnesses, including cancer, heart disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, chemical sensitivity, autism spectrum disorders, ADHD, autoimmune disorders, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. We use urine samples to assess over 175 different environmental pollutants. Fertility Testing Infertility rates are on the rise, and often couples are sent away with no explanation for their current struggles. We believe there is ALWAYS AN ANSWER and work with couples to get to the root of their infertility. Our workup is individualized for each couple, but may include female and male thyroid and hormone panels, a male sperm panel, female and male inflammatory and autoimmune markers, female and male environmental toxicity panels, genetic markers and other markers of markers of methylation, micronutrient testing, and gut microbiome testing. Gut/Microbiome Stool Testing: We offer the top stool tests on the market, including the Gut Zoomer 3.0 (Vibrant America), GI Effects (Genova Diagnostics), GI Maps (Diagnostic Solutions), and Comprehensive Stool Analysis (Doctors Data). These tests help us understand and assess your microbiome composition, digestion and absorption capacity, inflammatory activity, immune function, and levels of candida, pathogenic bacteria, and parasites. Heavy Metal Toxicity Testing: Heavy metal testing is used to assess the body's level of many metals in our environment that are known to cause physiological harm, including mercury, lead, cadmium, arsenic, gadolinium, and more! Hormone Testing: We offer three ways of assessing hormones: saliva, urine, and blood. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor will help you determine which form of testing and what time of the month will yield the greatest understanding of your current health status. Lyme & Coinfection Testing: Lyme disease and co-infections are more common than most know. Testing for Borellia Burgdoferi and coinfections, such as Bartonella, Anaplasma, Mycoplasma, Babesia, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and Ehrlichia have historically had low sensitivity. We use the top labs on the market to increase specificity and sensitivity of Lyme and coinfections. Micronutrient Testing: We use [Micronutrient testing](https://www.spectracell.com/micronutrient-test-panel/) to measure vitamins, minerals, amino/fatty acids, antioxidants, and metabolites - and how they affect cellular function in a person. We especially value this testing in the perinatal time period, as nutrient status plays a major role in neurodevelopment and other aspects of health in the offspring. Mold/Mycotoxin Testing & Shoemaker Testing: Mold and mycotoxin exposure is becoming an increasingly well known cause of chronic illness. There are two main ways of testing for mold exposure. [Mycotoxin testing ](https://www.greatplainslaboratory.com/gplmycotox)tests the urine for the excretion of the toxins released by various species of molds. Mycotoxins levels reflect the severity of mold exposure, the body's detox capabilities, and the type of mold exposure. While the Shoemaker protocol tests for various inflammatory markers and hormones that can be altered when exposed to toxic levels of mold. Organic Acid Testing: This test is an efficient initial screening test to assess a patient's overall health. [Organic acids](https://www.greatplainslaboratory.com/organic-acids-test) are various markers found in the urine that give insight to state of gut microbiome, vitamin and mineral levels, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter levels, etc which are often out of balance in long-term illnesses. It is one of our favorite tests to use to gauge overall health status. Thyroid Testing: Comprehensive thyroid markers tested, including: TSH, free and total T3 and T4, reverse [Walsh testing](https://www.walshinstitute.org/) assesses the status of key micronutrients involved in the production and metabolism of neurotransmitters. Deficiencies or excess in these vitamins and minerals can lead to mood disorders via disruption of neurotransmitter balance. We use this test to guide advanced nutrient therapies for a range of mental health disorders, including: anxiety, depression, OCD, addiction, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism "}
