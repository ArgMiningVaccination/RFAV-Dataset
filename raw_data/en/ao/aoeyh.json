Due to its generally fraudulent or occult nature, the entire realm of New Age medicine, with few exceptions, is biblically prohibited. Spiritual healing can either be legitimate or illegitimate - that is, either divine or demonic. In the Bible, God does heal supernaturally according to His will (Matt. 4:23-24; 8:16) & God can give this gift to some of His people (1 Cor. 12:9; 28, 30). But there are also occult (demonic) miracles and healing. Many new age therapies claim to balance, unblock, restore or otherwise manipulate invisible \"energies\" which allegedly exist or circulate within the body. These invisible energies are often associated with psychic anatomies in the body, such as the Chinese meridians or the Hindu chakra system. This mystical \"energy\" is found in Taoism, it's called chi. In Japan, it's called ki. In Hawaiian shamanism, it's called mana. In yoga theory, it is called kundalini energy. In Hinduism, it is prana. Occult magicians define it as elemental energy. Others call it psychic energy or vital force. This energy can act independently, display intelligence, cause to develop psychic powers, and possess a person. This energy is indistinguishable from the occult power that occultists claim is given by demons in magic ritual, and even indistinguishable from demons themselves. This \"energy\" are really familiar (demonic) spirits masquerading. Many founders & leaders of New Age medicine have had spiritistic contacts or involved with the occult, which raises red flags. New Age medicine is spiritually dangerous because healing occurs through demonic power. No genuine, complete healing occurs, but rather merely a transference of a condition to another. Nothing good comes from satan. New Age medicine can compromise the purity of a person's spiritual life. Moreover, it doesn't glorify the Lord and GOD Jesus Christ.\" It's pretty telling that many of the founders and leaders in modern new-age medicine had occult involvement. The founder of anthroposophical medicine was the occultist Rudolph Steiner, who practiced and encouraged necromancy (contacting the dead). Attitudinal healing was influenced by the demonic-written texts, A Course in Miracles, and medium Jane Roberts' The Nature of Personal Reality; A Seth Book. Once leaders in the field of biofeedback, such as Elmer and Alyce Green, were promoters of occultic phenomena; Elmer Green had a spirit-guide (really a demon) he called \"the Teacher\". The Edgar Cayce methods of healing were developed by medium Edgar Cayce. Naturopath Bernard Jensen, the modern founder of iridology, is or was a member of an occult sect encouraging spiritistic contact, called the Rosicrucians. George Goodheart, who founded applied kinesiology (muscle testing), was a psychic. Wilhelm Reich, the founder of orgonomy, was involved in the occult and the spirit world. Samuel Hahnemann, the founder of homeopathy, was apparently a spiritist. Once leaders in the field of radionics, such as George De la Warr and its founder Albert Abras, have been involved in spiritism or the occult. Randolph Stone, founder of polarity therapy, was an occultist and a member of the spiritistic Hindu sect Radhasoami. The founder of psychosynthesis, Robert Assagoili, was an occultist and a leader in Alice Bailey's Lucis Trust/Arcana workshops in Italy. Dolores Krieger and Dora Kunz, the founders of Therapeutic Touch, were both psychics; Dora Kunz was a spiritist and the president of the spiritistic Theosophical Society. Mike Samuels, M.D., who promoted modern visualization, was a confessed spiritist and author of the text Spirit Guides. The Bible warned us \"9 \"When you come into the land which the Lord your God is giving you, you shall not learn to follow the abominations of those nations. 10 There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, or one who practices witchcraft, or a soothsayer, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, 11 or one who conjures spells, or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead.12 For all who do these things are an abomination to the Lord, and because of these abominations the Lord your God drives them out from before you. 13 You shall be blameless before the Lord your God. 14 For these nations which you will dispossess listened to soothsayers and diviners; but as for you, the Lord your God has not appointed such for you.\" - Deut. 18:9-14 New Age medicine can be spiritually dangerous because it may lead one into spiritistic entanglements. The following is from the book Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs, which gives an illustration of a woman who was healed when she confessed and forsook New Age medicine: A nurse and missionary among Nduga people of Mapnduma in Irian Jaya, Indonesia, had won numerous awards for her medical work in training nationals and in setting up health clinics. Two years ago she suffered an attack of dengue fever, an infectious tropical disease, which forced her to come home on furlough. After a year of medical treatment, she returned to the mission field, still weak, with a \"heaviness\" over her, but supposedly recovered because medical tests revealed nothing wrong. Six months later she had a relapse and came home again. Chronic fatigue and other problems proved intractable. The best efforts of a tropical disease specialist and several other physicians proved fruitless. She was prayed over many times, but also to no avail. Finally, a pastor she happened to meet suspected a heretofore unaddressed spiritual cause of her problems. During counseling he asked her whether she had ever used alternate medicine. She explained that as a health-conscious nurse, when normal medical means did not help, it was her custom to turn to alternate health care: naturopathy, homeopathy, acupuncture, reflexology, and other New Age techniques. After counseling concerning the nature and implications of these methods, the missionary forsook them and before the Lord confessed her involvement in such practices as sin. As a result of confession and forsaking these activities, the oppression, chronic fatigue, and other medical problems vanished, and she returned to the mission field in good health. New age medicine is physically dangerous in two ways: (1) New age medicine practices are ineffective medically, can easily misdiagnose a serious ailment, and may prevent a serious ailment from being treated such that the condition progresses toward permanent injury or death; (2) New age medical practices are also physically dangerous because to the extent they involve someone in the world of the occult, they bring the same kinds of physical dangers associated with occultic involvement.\" New age medical practices are spiritually dangerous in two ways: (1) They may bring people into the realm of spiritism so that the spirits gain some degree of physical or moral influence or control over their lives, whether this is perceived or not; (2) New age philosophy is strongly anti-Christian and therefore may permanently insulate one against salvation in Christ, thereby insuring the loss of eternal salvation. Being involved with New Age medicine can be seen as a form of idolatry because its practices reflect an underlying religious philosophy that promotes a false god. New Age practices consistently underscore variations on New Age pantheism, which is unbiblical. The Bible warns to stay away from idols (1 John 5:21).

If you are sincere you can say this simple prayer to the Father (it doesn't have to be word for word): \"God, I recognize that I have not lived my life for You up until now. I have been living for myself and that is wrong. Please forgive me of all of my sins just as I forgive others. I need You in my life; I want You in my life. I acknowledge the completed work of Your only begotten Son Jesus Christ in giving His life for me on the cross, I believe in my heart Jesus is Lord and was raised from the dead and I long to receive the forgiveness you have made freely available to me through this sacrifice. Come into my life now, Lord. Take up residence in my heart and be my king, my Lord, and my Savior. From this day forward, I will no longer be controlled by sin, or the desire to please myself, but I will follow You all the days of my life. Those days are in Your hands. I ask this in the Lord and GOD Jesus' precious and "}
