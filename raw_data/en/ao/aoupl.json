Ayurveda is considered to be the oldest system of health care, with literature going back 5000 years. Ayurveda helps a healthy person to maintain health, and a person with illnesses to regain health. An Ayurvedic treatment is not just a massage with ayurvedic oil. A massage provided with improper medicated oils based on different individual factors can cause problems at a later stage. Therefore, Ayurvedic treatment requires the expertise of a doctor to decide on treatments, the combination of oils and medicines, delivered by trained therapists. Homeopathy originated in 1796 in Germany, and was discovered by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a German scientist. Homeopathy is popular today as a non-intrusive, holistic system of medicine. Instead of different medicines for different parts of the body, one single constitutional remedy is prescribed. As a system of medicine, Homeopathy is highly scientific, safe, logical and an extremely effective method of healing. For over 200 years people have used Homeopathy to maintain their good health, and also to treat and cure a wide range of illnesses like allergies, metabolic disorders, atopic dermatitis, Rheumatoid arthritis, Auto-immune disorders. Naturopathy is a healing technique that uses the healing powers of nature. Naturopathy works on the principle that, 'the accumulation of toxins is the root cause of all diseases. Hence prevention of such accumulation, and elimination of existing toxins is the definitive route to sustained health and wellbeing. This multi-disciplinary approach uses the healing power of natural resources like foods, herbs, earth, water, air, sun and even magnets, to allow the body heal itself. Most treatments are based on the 5 great elements of nature that have immense healing properties. Yoga attempts to being about a union of the mind, body and spirit. It also embodies a union of one's self with the Universal Self, the Supreme Spirit. As a holistic science, Yoga emphasizes that such a union is necessary for good health and well-being. Yoga is particularly relevant in today's fast-paced and stressful life; is helpful both to prevent and cure many psychosomatic diseases - the causes of which stem mainly from the mind. The parts of Yoga that are mainly used in therapeutics are the Asanas, Pranayamas, Kriyas as well as Meditation and Relaxation techniques. Other therapies like 'Yoga Nidra' are also equally effective. "}
