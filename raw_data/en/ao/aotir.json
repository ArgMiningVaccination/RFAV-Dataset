Methods Inf Med ; 62(1-02): 49-59, 2023 May. ABSTRACT [time]frame the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [pandemic]declaration and the [vaccines]authorization led to concerns among public regarding the [safety]and [efficacy]of the [vaccines]. The [Food and Drug [Reporting]System (VAERS) where general [population]can [report]their [vaccine]side effects in the text box. This information could be utilized to determine [self]-reported [vaccine]side effects. OBJECTIVE:To develop a supervised and unsupervised [natural processing](NLP) pipeline to extract [self]-reported COVID-19 [vaccination]side effects, [location]of the side effects, medications, and possibly false/ [misinformation]seeking further investigation in a structured format for METHODS:We utilized the VAERS [dataset]of 2020 to August 2022 individuals. We first developed a [gold]-standard (GS) [dataset]of randomly selected 1,500 [records]. Second, the GS was split into [training], testing, and validation sets. The [training] [dataset]was used to develop the NLP applications (supervised and unsupervised) and testing and validation datasets were used to test the performances of the NLP application. RESULTS:The NLP application automatically extracted [vaccine]side effects, body locations of the side effects, medication, and possibly [misinformation]with moderate to high accuracy (84% [sensitivity], [cold]/flue-like symptoms. Most of the [complications]occurred in the locations such as [self]-reported medications. [Death]due changes in the [DNA], and [infertility]were possible false/ [misinformation]reported by people. as [arthralgia], and [blood clotting]need further clinical investigations. Our NLP application may help in extracting information from big free-text "}
