Detox (short for detoxification) is the body's natural ability to rid toxins from the system. Toxins may include environmental toxins like pesticides and fertilizers, synthetic body care products, processed foods, building materials, and your own cellular waste. Detoxification is the art and science of increasing cell metabolism (aka taking out the trash) and liver functioning. The liver is a key player in the detox process. While we can depend on the liver to take on the burden of filtering out our toxic load and keep our body running well, there are many things that inhibit the liver's function, or that help the liver's function. A healthy detox can support the liver and limit the stress of the process when the body is exposed to increased toxins. Detox Benefits: - Feeling lighter, brighter, more energized - Better digestion - Less colds and flus - Balanced hormones - Improved mood - Glowing skin At Spring Integrative Health our Naturopathic doctors and Nutrition specialists can give you a personalized detoxification program. We will break down the science of what happens in your body during a detox, and help you walk through it with peace of mind. Here are our top 5 tips to overall liver support and detox: - Elimination: A huge part of your health is based on your bodies ability to eliminate efficiently. If you experience constipation or diarrhea, or both, that is a sign that your body needs support with detoxification. - Hydration: Your body is 70% water, so just simply staying hydrated can be a game-changer. Water helps to flush toxins and supports the livers overall detox process. - Exercise: Movement is essential each day to keep your body detoxing. Movement helps circulate the lymphatic fluid through your body and cleans the lymph system more efficiently. - Eat green food: The darker in green color, the better for your liver. Bitter leafy greens are known to be key in liver detox. Sneaking greens into your smoothies, or having a green drink a few times each week has great benefits for your liver. - Remove toxic foods from your diet If you are eating processed foods, or foods with long ingredient lists it's likely that you are being exposed to chemicals, additives, and toxins. Ingredients to watch out for include hydrogenated oils, refined sugar, convenience foods and lunch meats filled with nitrates and nitrites. Most convenience foods, fast foods, and lunch meats have these problematic ingredients. "}
