The paper reviews the state of current knowledge regarding immunization costs and converts data from nine different studies into a common set of price equivalents. The principal determinants of total immunization costs are threefold: national wage levels, the particular delivery strategy used and the level of output of the program or individual immunizing clinic. The average cost per fully immunized child for administration of a single antigen was found to range from $2-$6.70 for measles when at least partially mobile services were used, to $4.60-$14 when static delivery points were employed. The composition of typical immunization program costs is assessed and estimates are made of the likely effects introduction of new vaccines will have on existing program costs. Compatibility between existing immunization program activity and the administration schedule of the new vaccine is likely to be a major determinant of increments in cost per fully immunized child. A single-shot immunization, given in an economically efficient program within existing immunization program schedules might cost only $0.13; a triple-shot vaccine given in an expensive program outside the normal schedule of immunizations could cost over $20. Finally, the paper brings together the cost information with estimates of the likely impact of measles, rotavirus and new cholera vaccines on mortality and morbidity from diarrhoea. For case prevention at any given level of cost per fully immunized child, rotavirus and measles immunization are found to be comparably cost-effective interventions; case prevention by cholera immunization is a much less cost-effective mode of resource use. The cost per death prevented by cholera immunization is much higher than that for measles and rotavirus. Prepared by: Andrew L. Creese, Consultant to the World Bank University College of Swansea, Wales, Great Britain January 1986 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I should like to acknowledge comments on earlier drafts of this paper from Dr. Richard Feachem and Dr. Isabelle de Zoysa, London Schoo; of Hygiene, Dr. David de Ferranti of the World Bank, Dr. Robert Hogan of the Diarrhoeal Disease Control Programme of the World Health Organisation, Dr. Rafe Henderson of the Exp ided Programme on Immunization of the World Health Organisation and, in particular, comments from Margaret Phillips and Anne Mills, Evaluation and Planning Centre, London School of Hygiene, while absolving all from any responsibility for errors or ambiguities that may remain. The development of new vaccines is one of the most rapid areas of technological innovation in the field of tropical medicine. Several different inactivated or live attenuated vaccines are currently being developed against acute respiratory diseases, herpes viruses and various enteric diseases, as well as against major parasitic diseases. The potential attractiveness of a new vaccine for incorporation into routinely provided health care depends on a number of factors,including cost, compatibility with existing activities in the preventive health care field and upon the epidemiological importance of the disease in question. Cost effectiveness analysis offers a framework for incorporating all of these considerations in comparing the relative priority of new immunization techniques and, indeed, innov- ations of most kinds in health care. This paper considers the specific cases of three types of vaccine intervention against diarrhoeal disease. Existing evidence on both the costs of immunization activity on the one hand and the epidemiological impact of new vaccines on the other, are considered together to produce a rank ordering of the likely cost-effectiveness of immunization against certain types of diarrhoea. The vaccines considered are: measles (assessed for its impact on meales-related diarrhoea), rotavirus and new cholera vaccine. Because existing immunization programmes are targeted in most countries at the age group in which most mortality and morbidity from diarrhoeal disease is concentrated, the context of introducing new vaccines into a pre-existing national Expanded Programme on Immunization is given specific consideration. The paper is in three sections. Section 1 assembles a selection of evidence regarding the costs of infant immunization programmes and, making appropriate allowances, Section 2 employs these data to provide an indication of the likely costs for measles, rotavirus and cholera immunizations. The third section of the paper illustrates how costs per case prevented and costs per averted death from diarrhoea, compare -2- for the three vaccines under review. In order formally to recognise the several elements of uncertainty surrounding the age-specific incidence of different types of diarrhoeal disease, the effectiveness of immunization interventions, the compatibility between the administrative requirements for new vaccines and existing immunization programme schedules and the incremental costs of new vaccines, the cost-effectiveness results in Section 3 are presented as ranges rather than single values, so that the effect of present uncertainties on these estimates may be clearly seen. 1. Costs of infant immunization: an assessment of existing evidence Nine studies were used for comparative purposes (1-15). Whilst not an exhaustive catalogue of cost analysis in immunization activities, these do employ a common approach to the specification and measurement of programme costs, are relatively recent (i.e. post 1977) and are all concerned with low or middle income country conditions. The cost appraisal methods used are either based upon, or similar to, the method suggested in the current EPI/WHO costing Guidelines (16), though six different principal investigators were responsible for conducting these 9 studies. Whilst the cost appraisal methods may have been similar, the actual immunization programmes differed considerably. The vaccines provided differed from a single antigen -measles, in the Ivory Coast study -to the full range of immunizations managed by the EPI of the World Health Organisation, as in Cameroon or Kenya. The schedules on which the vaccines were provided (infants' first vaccination age, interval before next vaccination and maximum age for vaccination) differed widely and the immunization strategy employed varied from fully mobile, special purpose immunization teams, to on-demand immun- izations provided from static health care centres; with several variants in between. These studies therefore comprise \"snapshot\" pictures of immunization programmes of varying types in different countries at different times: only -3- the general subject matter (infant immunizations) and the recording approach were common. 'A large series of such snapshots is, of course, a common way of accumulating evidence about functional relationships in economic cost analysis but the smaller the number of observations, the more factors have to be held constant before general deductions about the relationship may be drawn. In immunization programmes, short-run costs depend upon four sets of factors: -the size of the fixed cost element, including shared overheads; -the level of output, which may be defined in several ways, such as the total number of immunizations given; immunized infants; -prices of the relevant health system inputs (wages, vaccine costs, transportation costs etc); and -the particular technology employed to combine inputs into a working immunization service (number and type of health workers, degree of mobility etc). A very large number of alternatives exists here, both in principle and in the services studied in the 9 investigations under review. The 9 studies were not undertaken as'co-ordinated components of an analysis of immunization production functions and, therefore, constitute a rather limited basis on which to generalise about determinants of cost. These studies, then, serve as preliminary descriptive profiles of resource-use in immunization programmes and further work must be undertaken before the quantitative importance of the above factors is apparent. The use of a standard approach has allowed some common economic issues within immunization programmes to be identified with greater clarity than was previously possible, however: the importance of fixed costs as a percentage of total short-run costs; the pre-eminence of the wage and salary component (which, as a shared overhead or a pre-committed block of time, may be treated as fixed); and a suggestion that mobile or partially mobile services may achieve immunizations at lower average cost than a comparable number of immunizations provided from static health facilities (Ghana, Ivory Coast and Brazil studies). Ranges have been established within -4- programmes for capital, vaccine, transport, supervision and salary components in the total programme cost profile. These are summarised in Table 1 and Figure 1 (Table 1 and Figure 1 here). The approach employed in each of the studies selected is to focus on costs to the formal health care delivery system. This omits certain costs, such as diversions of parents' time, transport costs born by families in bring- ing children to be immunized and the costs of collaborating agencies such as village committees, women's organisations and so on. 'Furthermore, none of the studies under review attempts to incorporate 'efficiency prices' into the appraisal of immunization costs, to correct for common economic distortions resulting from over-valuation of domestic currencies and the consequent under- pricing, at official exchange rates, of inputs using foreign exchange. These components of the social opportunity cost of immunization activity are therefore omitted in a set of studies which concentrate on estimating the financial costs to the principal providing agency -in each case the Ministry of Health. In order to use the available evidence to inform estimates of the likely cost of new immunization interventions, it is necessary to make the original data from the 9 studies, which were recorded in domestic currency units, directly comparable. Such comparisons are fraught with problems, the extent of which are most thoroughly documented in the comparative studies by Kravis et al (17). Two elements have to be considered in comparing national currency costs of immunization: a) the relative value of the currencies at a given point in time; b) the time interval between the dates of the studies, during which formal relative purchasing power may have changed, most likely as a result of domestic inflation. 1982 was taken as the most recent year to which all of the 9 countries' -5- data could be adjusted and an inflation index for each country from the date of the study to mid-1982 was taken. The only price series available for the period for all of the 9 countries was an overall consumer price index (18), which yives the domestic price inflation rates from the study date to 1982 given in column C, Table 2. (Table 2 here). To provide a numeraire for comparison, domestic current 1982 equivalents were then converted by the average 1982 official exchange rate into US dollars. Whilst this practice overstates the 'true' cost of immunization in some countries (note, in particular the effect of a highly over-valued cedi on Ghana's costs), it has the virtue of illustrating what it would have cost if immunization programmes were to be funded entirely from external assist- ance. Because of the difficulties of international comparison previously alluded to, the data in Table 3 should be seen as giving broad indications only of costs in differing national circumstances. Interpretation of these data requires a brief profile of these circumstances. (Table 3 here) The Ivory Coast measles study differed from others in allocating all common overheads -supervision, salaries, mobility etc -to measles immun- izatio.n and not attempting an average cost apportionment by individual EPI vaccine, as in several other studies. It was estimated that 75% of total immunization costs in Ivory Coast were attributable to the basic cost of establishing the programme and offering measles vaccine; the remainder being the cost of other vaccines (BCG, DPT and OPV). These estimates are useful in that they indicate the likely total costs of inaugurating a single- antigen programme in the particular circumstances of the Ivory Coast demonstration zones and may be taken as indicators of the upper limits of anti-measles vaccination costs. But this also means that the figures in colume (d) of Table 3 cannot be compared directly, since measles immunization costs in Brazil, for example, were calculated on an apportioned average basis. -6- Given the per capita income differences between the two countries and, therefore, the likely order of public sector wages costs, this change of accounting perspectives must go some way to explain the relative costliness of the Ivory Coast programme. The data suggest potential economies of scale in the fixed centres strategy, an impression supported by evidence from all of the other studies; they also suggest that, at least on a financial analysis of Ministry of Health expenditures, that mobile services may be a relatively cost-effective option in appropriate circumstances, as in Ghana and Brazil. The data for Brazil, from a preliminary analysis of one year's immun- ization activity in two different states, are apportioned average costs. Total resource use for immunization was estimated for each tier of the health system and this total was apportioned among sub-components of the programme on a weighted average basis, the weights reflecting a) the number of immunizations given by type and b) the relative speed of OPV (non-needle) administration, taken to be one quarter of the total time taken for a needle vaccination. For measles vaccinations, the lower cos*s of outreach or 'intensification' of routine services result from scheduling smaller amounts Qof staff time to immunize larger numbers of infants, by pre-publicising limited 'outreach' facilities for measles vaccination. The high fixed costs of underutilised 'well-baby' clinics are thus minimised. The oral polio- myelitis strategies differed radically in Brazil. The fixed centres offer an 'on-demand' service targeted at infants under one, wi,-h high dropout rates between first and third doses; whereas the mass campaigns, at six-monthly intervals, are very large scale 'special events' mobilisations, including many participants from all parts of the public and private sectors and targeted at children up to 5. Record keeping from the campaigns does not allow a ready identification of the numbers of children completing immunization schedules, so the figure of $2.04 is simply three times the average OPV -7- contact cost via the mass campaign and certainly an under-estimate of the costs of a fully immunized child. If 30% dropout between first and second and second and third immunizations was observed, this would raise the costs per fully immunized infant for OPV to $4.16. Studies in the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand were concerned with two-dose immunizations for infants under one; and confirmed the pattern of average costs falling as numbers of immunizations given increased. Where target populations were biggest -in urban areas of Indonesia and where out-reach services were not motorised, costs per fully immunized infant reached a low of US $1.4. The remaining studies assessed the costs of a full course of EPI immun- izations: BCG, three doses of DPT and OPV and measles. In Cameroon, immunizations were provided from clinics by a mobile team working to a pre- arranged travel rota: the study reported relatively low coverage (32%) as the reason for high costs, though these do not seem notably out of line with the recorded costs per fully immunized infant elsewhere. The Gambia study shows wide variations within the sample of health units assessed and confirms the negative relationship between numbers immunized and costs per immunization over the entire range of immunization units seen. There is very little evidence as to what yet constitutes an optimum size catchment population for immunization purposes: the prospects for reorganising delivery strategies as target population increase shows, in most cases, continuous falls in average costs. Ghana's EPI pilot study involved two distinct strategies in two regions of the country: in both areas the single fully mobile unit was more cost effective than the alternative strategy of fixed centre + outreach work. The dollar equivalents of the costs per fully immunized child are exceptionally high for Ghana, highlighting both that country's rapid recent inflation and the sustained over-valuation of the cedi. A shadow foreign -8- exchange rate might suggest dollar figures in the region of one seventh to one tenth of those recorded. It is certain that these figures reflect structural problems in the Ghanaian economy rather than factors specific to the immunization programme; their effect nevertheless is to limit the possibility of comparison. The study in Kenya was of an EPI demonstration- area and incorporated the full costs of the programme's management unit. Since this unit will become the national management unit for immunization, the proportion of its costs attributable to individual Districts will obviously decline as the programme expands. As in the Ivory Coast study, then, this is strictly an overhead item, the inclusion of all of which leads to inflated levels of average cost. This is particularly conspicuous in the Kenya study, since this component of total cost accounts for over 40% of total costs of immunization, a figure expected to decline to 2% when the programme is nationally operational. The effect of this accounting practice is to almost double the likely future costs per fully immunized child. Again, the Kenyan data should be interpreted in the knowledge that the full costs of some national activities which will not vary as the programme expands, have been imputed to t e demonstration area. The principal determinants of total immunization costs would thus seem to be threefold: national wage levels (the principal input being staff time); the particular delivery strategy; and, finally, the level of output of the programme or individual immunizing clinics. The particular type of immun- ization being given does not appear to make a major identifiable difference in cost, with the possible exception of OPV, where the nature of the vaccine allows for much faster administration and the use of minimally-trained vaccinators. Actual vaccine costs for the current EPI vaccines (see Annex 1) are fairly standard worldwide and in most cases account for a small proportion of total programme costs (Table 1, Figure 1). These three variables, together with minor differences in the applic- -9- ation of the standard costing approach detailed above, mean that total and average infant immunization costs are most realistically expressed by a range rather thar a single figure. For the administration of a single anti- gen, when at least partially mobile services are employed, average costs per fully immunized child range, on current data, from a low of $2 (Brazil, measles) to a maximum of $6.7 (Ivory Coast, measles;though costs actually attributable to other antigens are included in this estimate). For single antigen programmes and static delivery points, the average cost range is from $4.6 (Brazil, measles) to a maximum of $14 (Ivory Coast, measles) with the same qualification applying to the latter figure. Data from a differently organised cost analysis by Ponnighaus (18) fall generally within this range. For multiple antigens, the costs are generally higher, the difference reflecting the fact that these entail several contacts with the immunization service before full immunization is reached: for the full range of current EPI vaccines these figures range from $9.5 (Cameroon) to a maximum of $16.6 (Kenya), where the joint cost problem is again encountered. Data from Ghana are usable only in indicating the relative costs of mobile vs static services in that country. t The \"fully immunized child\" from the data in Table 3 is not a standard index, as the information in column (a) shows. For comparative purposes, therefore, it is convenient to convert the data in Table 3, column (d) into a 'cost per contact' with the immunization services, as in Table 4. (Table 4 here). This provides a rough method for standardising differences in the scope of the national programmes under comparison. For subsequent analysis three sub-groups of these costs per contact are defined: \"best practice\" circumstances, where costs per immunization contact are below two dollars; \"intermediate\", with costs between two and fourcbllars and \"expensive\"; with costs per immunizetion contact in excess of four dollars. Since these costs are derived from the costs per fully immunized child, they incorporate the costs of immunizing children who drop out without completing their full -10 - schedule. They therefore constitute an intermediate index of cost in relation to programme performance, between the low of cost per immunization and the high of cost per fully immunized child. 2. Cost estimates per fully immunized child for measles, rotavirus and new cholera vaccinations There is to date no empirical evidence on the costs of adding new vaccinations into existing health care programmes. The Ivory Coast study (1) made a rough a priori estimate that the cost of incorporating other EPI vaccines into the mealses programme would add one third to the 'base' vaccination cost: It was estimated that up to 75% of all EPI costs in the Ivory Coast were attributable to the basic cost of setting up a programme and offering measles vaccine. The remaining 25% could be attributed to the cost of offering other vaccines. This section reviews the different operational contexts in which new vaccines might be added to existing immunization programmes and, based on data presented in the previous section, assembles evidence about the likely cost increments attributable to these innovations. Since such developments are likely to fall within the territory of national immunization programmes, a brief review of the schedules and operating methods presently promoted by the W.H.0. Expanded Programme on Immunization follows. The Expanded Programme on Immunization currently promotes the develop- ment of immunization programmes in almost all developing countries and encourages the use of immunization against six major diseases: tuberculosis, diptheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis and measles. Through the World Health Organisation and through national immunization programmes, EPI -11 - contributes in many areas of immunization programme planning and management, including training, choice, use and maintenance of chold chain equipment. and in the use of performance monitoring systems. EPI also encourages the 'targeting' of vaccinations to the most vulnerable age groups (infants) and promotes the use of recommended schedules of vaccination. Rotavirus and cholera vaccines do not form part of EPI's present programme. But national immunization programmes are the most likely vehicle for new vaccines aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality in infant population and the gradual development of 'best practice' procedures by EPI to guide programme managers may be expected to establish minimum criteria for new vaccines being incorporated into the programme. These may cover desirable efficacy levels for vaccines, shelf life and cold store requirements and, importantly, the most appropriate schedule for incorp- oration into a multi-vaccine programme. Whilst such criteria will obviously be flexible, it is clear that, from an economic viewpoint, the more closely that a new vaccine complies with existing norms of EPI practice, the lower will be the marginal costs of incorporating it into the programme. Whilst most immunization programmes have difficulties in achieving high coverage, maintaining proper procedures in supplying, conducting and monitoring EPI activity, these are general managerial constraints and not specific (within limits) to the type or number of vaccines handled by a programme. For example, existing cold chain capacity is not an important constraining factor on the introduction of new vaccines, though the quality of cold chain inanagement is commonly a limiting factor on general EPI performance, Similarly, whilst immunization programme supervision and reporting procedures are often poor, they would not constitute an identifiable cost obstacle to the introduction of suitable new vaccines. Compatibility with existing -12 - vaccination schedules is likely to be the most critical factor determining the incremental costs of new vaccines in EPI. The vaccination schedule presently recommended by EPI is designed to encourage the earliest efficacious use of vaccines. It recommends BCG: at birth OPV: from birth, three doses, 4 week intervals between doses DPT: from 6 weeks, 3 doses, 4 week intervals Measles: at 8 months One possible schedule is thus: age 6 weeks BCG/OPV/DPT1 age 10 weeks OPV2/DPT2 age 14 weeks OPV3/DPT3 age 8 months measles Rotavirus and new cholera vaccines are currently in the developmental stage. Rotavirus vaccine has now been field tested in Finland (21): this was an attentuated virus, relatively easy to grow (and therefore expected to be roughly comparable in costs with measles vaccine) and capable of oral 0 administration. An optimal delivery strategy for this vaccine is as yet undertermined but it is considered possible EITHER that a single dose might be given at between 4 and 6 months, possibly with OPV, OR that three doses, at the same ages and frequencies as trivalent OPV could be given. Cholera vaccination with a new, killed, Swedish oral vaccine has indicated possible efficacy levels in volunteer studies of 70-75% but the duration of protection is unknown and there are at present no field trials with this vaccine. A usable vaccine against cholera is currently a remoter possibility than against rotavirus, so speculation about its delivery schedule is more tentative. Three doses given in the second year of life -13 - appears to be one possible schedule (22) and the cold chain requirements are thought unlikely to be more stringent than for existing EPI vaccines. A live oral vaccine is also currently being developed which may have more rigorous cold chain requirements. Cholera vaccination for one year olds and upwards would therefore entail a separate target population and would be less 'readily integrated into the existing activities of most national EPI programmes. The introduction of new vaccines may be expected to entail an upward shift in the average cost per fully immunized child. The question of likely cost magnitudes depends heavily on the extent to which new vaccines can be incorporated into the logistic, training and delivery strategies of working immunization programmes in individual countries. Since the non-vaccine, general administrative element of vaccination costs is predominant in all existing descriptions of average costs, the less the degree of administrative change necessary to accommodate new vaccines, the lower the likely cost increment resulting. Two general scenarios may be distinguished: a) where new vaccines may be incorporated within the existing sequence of EPI activity. This means that the new vaccines Q would be given simultaneously with existing EPI vaccines, either by being combined in the vial or by each immunization contact involving multiple shots. No change in the timing or frequency of contacts for EPI purposes would be entailed. b) where new vaccines require additional visits to or by the immunization team. This is likely to entail additional immunization sessions and additional record-keeping; and, since attendance and drop-out rates are frequently a matter of concern, it may require additional promotional and supervision inputs. The first of these alternatives involves relatively small changes in 14- the likely resource requirements for immunization; and it would therefore seen appropriate to estimate what additional costs such changes, would entail. For estimating cost increments resulting from the use of new vaccines necessitating a change in the schedule, the average cost of existing immnization activity would seem to be the most reliable indicator of cost changes. The marginal costs, that is, the change in total costs due to additional vaccinations being offered to children attending well-baby or immunization clinics will, at least in the short tun, be fairly small. Existing studies coumonly draw attention to the high proportion of immunization costs which are fixed (12) and one indicates that the total variable component may be as low as 20% of overall immunization costs, rising to over 50% as total output increases (8). Vaccines are the major component of variables costs and from Table 1 are seen to have a median share of total costs of between 10-12%; though increases in the use of sterlizing equipment and fuel, needles and syringes and some staff time directly allocated to immunization,,may also be expected when new immunizations are added to a programme. It would seem reasonable to assume that, in an existing multiple antigen immunization programme, the addition of one new vaccine might raise variable costs by a half; so that this would add 10% to 25% to existing total costs, depending on the pre-existing relationship between variable and total costs. Table 5(a) illustrates a 'typical' profile of total and average costs in relation to numbers of children immunized. When 100 children are immunized, variable costs comprise 18% of total costs; when output rises to 1000 children, variable costs are 44% of total costs. (Insert Tables 5(a) and 5(b) here). Table 5(b) shows a 50% increase in the total variable cost -15 component and its effect at different levels of output on total and average costs. When 200 immunization contacts are possible, the effect of a 50% increase in variable costs due to the new vaccine raises total costs from 1250 to 1375. Marginal costs of the new vaccine at this clinic are therefore 125. Thi increment in average costs -total costs divided by the level of output -is frcm 6.25 per contact to 6.87. At higher levels of total output, these figures will change. If 1000 contacts are possible, a similar change in the variable costs of immunization results in a marginal cost change of 400 and an increment in the cost per contact from 1.8 to 2.2. Taking costs per contact from Table 4, Table 6 sets out the average total costs for the 'best practice', 'intermediate' and 'expensive' groups of programmes and shows the increment in average cost per immunization contact that would result from the postulated 50% increase in total variable costs. (Insert Table 6 here). Which of these costs is most applicable in the context of any 'country depends on the existing organisation of EPI activities. For example, where measles vaccination is not presently provided by EPI, will its introduction be most appropriately measured by marginal or average costs? The answer will depend on whether the new vaccine, with its later optimal age for immunization, actually necessitates additional visits by parents with their infants. If it does (that is, if other EPI immunizations are being completed before the age of 8/9 months for most infants), then measles vaccination will involve additional visits and additional sessions and may well be appropriately estimated at the average cost per single immunization contact of $1.3-$6.8. If, onthe other hand, EPI has a large backlog of unimmunized children and is still focussed on reducing the average age for completion of vaccination to one year, then many children eligible for measles vaccination would IN ANY CASE be attending clinics for their second -16- and third doses of OPV and DPT. In these circumstances, it would seem reasonable to regard the measles vaccination as entailing a small increment in the staff time, vaccine and other resources deployed for immunization activity. Since this is probably the case in many countries at the moment, measles immunization may frequently be available at marginal cost, so the figure of $1.70 per contact or less for most countries may be representative. If rotavirus vaccine is developed with ease of integration with EPI as an objective -which seems plausible -then that, too, may be available at marginal cost, though the marginal costs of a three dose immunization would raise the costs per fully immunized child to between $0.39 and $5.10 (three times the incremental values in Table 6). Since these costs per contact were derived from the costs per fully immunized child, including drop-out rates, these cost estimates take account of likely numbers of non-completers. Cholera vaccinations, on the other hand, are clearly to be estimated at existing average costs, since they effectively constitute a separate sub- programme for immunization services, being targeted at a different age cohort. Even without formal consideration of the greater likelihood of coverage becoming more costly for a population in the second year of life, it is clear that a multi-stage immunization at average costs is likely to be in the range $3.9 to $20. In summary, the likely costs of additional immunization being incorporated into an existing EPI programme will depend on the overall efficiency of the existing programme -whether it is a 'best practice' or expensive' programme; at what scale and how its immunization clinics are organised; on how the new vaccine fits into the existing schedule; and on how many doses of it are necessary. A single-shot immunization, given in an economically efficient programme within existing EPI schedules, might cost -17 - as little as 13 cents; a triple-shot vaccine given in an expensive programme outside the normal schedule of immunizations could cost over $20. Programme-specific research is necessary to provide more precise estimates of cost implications. 3. Cost-effectiveness of Immunization Interventions The principal.objective of this review is to identify the likely range within which infant and child immunization costs for new vaccines will fall. The speculative nature of these cost estimates, together with contemporary uncertainty about the effectiveness and most likely schedules for possible new vaccines means that a consideration of the cost effectiveness of these - strategies (both against each other and in comparision with other potential. life-enhancing interventions for children) should allow explicitly for this uncertainty. Recent work by Feachem and Koblinsky and by de Zoysa and Feachem (23,24) has documented the current state of knowledge in relation to the effectiveness of measles, rotavirus and potential new cholera vaccine interventions. The following analysis makes use of the epidem- iological values employed in reviews by these authors and of the general method for measuring cost-effectiveness proposed by them. Cost-effectiveness of case prevention is defined as: C/E = P X 0/ (5 x I x Ri x E) where C/E = cost per case prevented P = population 0 = cost (in dollars) per fully immunized child I = total diarrhoea incidence among children 0-59 months (episodes per child/year) Ri = reduction in I due to immunization of 100% efficacy with 100% coverage at age 6 months E = vaccine efficacy -18 - Cost-effectiveness of mortality prevention is defined as: C/E= P x D/ (5 x Mx Rm x E) where M = total diarrhoea mortality among children 0-59 months Rm = reduction in M due to immunization These formulae employ ameasure of effectiveness which covers a five year period. Whilst convenient, this is somewhat misleading, since the costs of immunization occur at the beginning of the period but the impact on mortality and morbidity is distributed over the first 59 months of life. Programme benefits or effects distributed in the future are normally discounted, so that their 'present worth' can be compared directly with programme costs. The effect of this is to reduce the present worth of a given stream of effects according to the degree to which these occur in the future. The use of an undiscounted index of effectiveness will therefore overstate the present worth of the intervention, although in the present cases this is likely to be by a small amount. Although a precise age distribution of reduced morbidity and mortality from measles and from rotavirus diarrhoea and from cholera is not available, it seems reasonable on existing data (25) to assume that most will fall within the 12-18 months following the immunization. De Zoysa and Feachem use the following values in 2-4 and 8 show how the.e assumptions lead to a ranking of the three interventions in terms of their cost-effectiveness. The minimum values of cost per unit of achievement in each column are based on the highest estimates of incidence and impact of vaccination (reduction in morbidity/ mortality and vaccine effectiveness); the maximum cost per unit achievement data on the most conservative estimates of impact. Different costs per fully immunized child are illustrated in the left column of each table to show how, for each vaccination option, cost of achievement is also affected by the costs of immunization. For case prevention at any given level of cost per fully immunized child, rotavirus and measles immunizations are comparably cost-effective inter- ventions, their likely cost-effectiveness ranges overlapping. Case prevention by cholera immunization, however, is a much less cost-effective mode of resource use. For the prevention of unnecessary death from diarrhoeal disease in children, the picture is broadly similar to that of case prevention among the three possible strategies, though the unit costs of achievement are, of course, higher. The likely cost range for diarrhoeal disease deaths prevented by measles immunization is now lower than by rotavirus immunization at any given cost per fully immunized child. Prevention of child mortality by cholera immunization remains a poor third by comparison with the other two interventions and invites comparison in economic terms with alternative methods of health intervention. These differences in likely cost-effectiveness become further accentuated when the likely cost per fully immunized child is considered. Measles -20 - involves a single contact, which may, in many countries, be combined at marginal cost with OPV and DPT immunization contacts. Whilst rotavirus. vaccinations may be multi-stage, there appears some real prospect that they, too, may be incorporated at marginal cost by being given with other routine EPI immunizations. But even if cholera becomes available as a single dose vaccine, capable of being administered at around $5, both case prevention and death prevention by this type of intervention will compare poorly in terms of cost-effectiveness with rotavirus and measles strategies. -21- TABLE 1 PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION OF ANNUAL IMMUNIZATION COSTS BY MAJOR COMPONENTI Country t mpe Salaries2 Supervision3 Vaccines Transport Other Capital Ivory Coast a) Fixed Centres 62 23 10 0 5 ( incl.under (Otherb) Mobile (Uni ts 24 38 17 8 13 ( Kenya 27 43 3 0 11 16 Gambia 38 7 12 15 12 16 Cameroon 60 -(2) 13 8 5 14 Ghana a) Fixed/outreach 51 (2) 6 21 7 13 b) Mobile Units 51 -(2) 4 27 4 14 Indonesia 25 12 21 14 10 18 Philippines 31 22 12 14 2 19 Thailand 28 20 13 9 4 26 Brazil a) Fixed 68 14 5 1 3 9 b) Campaign 39 19 4 6 25 7 (publ icity=5 Notes: 1 For some countries these data are based on assessments at samples of health units; for others they are disaggregations of national programme expenditures.2 Salaries in most cases refer to payments to immunization personnel.
