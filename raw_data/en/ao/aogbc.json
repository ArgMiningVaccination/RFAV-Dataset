These indicators tell us what proportion of children aged 6-59 months received a dose of vitamin A through the main distribution mechanism during the first semester (January-June) and what proportion of children received a dose during the second semester (July-December). Vitamin A supplementation coverage is included in the WHO Global reference list of 100 core health indicators. How are they defined? These indicators are defined as the proportion of children aged 6-59 months who receive a first and/or a second high dose of vitamin A supplements within a calendar year. The two-dose coverage can be determined by the semester that achieved the lower vitamin A supplementation coverage for children aged 6-59 months in the calendar year. Current international recommendations call for high-dose vitamin A supplementation every 4-6 months for all children between the ages of 6 and 59 months living in affected areas. The recommended doses are 100 000 international units (IU) for children aged between 6 and 11 months, and 200 000 IU for children aged between 12 and 59 months. What are the consequences and implications? Programmes to control vitamin A deficiency increase children's chances of survival, reduce the severity of childhood illnesses, ease the strain on health systems and hospitals, and contribute to the well-being of children, their families and communities. Vitamin A is vital to child health and immune function; hence, in settings where vitamin A deficiency is a public health problem, vitamin A supplementation is recommended in infants and children aged 6-59 months as a public health intervention to reduce child morbidity and mortality. Measuring the proportion of children who have received two doses of vitamin A within the past year can be used to monitor coverage of interventions aimed at increasing child survival rates. Supplementation with vitamin A is a safe, cost-effective and efficient means for eliminating deficiency of this vitamin and improving child survival.
