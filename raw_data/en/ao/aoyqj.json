We do this in great commitment to our planet and out of love for our fellow beings. Energy Therapies\u2014which include modalities such as reiki, aura clearings, therapeutic touch etc.\u2014seek to move or shift energy so it's more supportive to the life functions of the client. They work with proven techniques to alleviate the client's discomfort and bring more harmony into the physical and emotional body. Energy Therapy is a course of study, with practices and protocols in place that can be easily replicated. Integral Spiritual Therapy deals with the soul. It has practices in place to perform soul retrievals, spirit balancing and blessings. Through it we serve Spirit, not the physical realms. We see Spirit in each person and ask the animating force to shift in ways that will bring peace to the client. We don't simply move energy, we ask that Spirit transmute it. This is done through ritual and ceremony. From drumming and feathers to incense and prayer, we work with Spirit to help support the soul. It is also important to note that Integral Spiritual Therapy and Integrative Alternative Therapy are not to be a substitute for conventional medical or psychological services, but is instead to be worked with adjunct to them. Integral Spiritual Therapy No two Integral Spiritual Therapy sessions are identical, although most begin with an initial interview during which the client describes the physical and/or emotional symptoms they are experiencing, as well as problems that may be arising in their life. Depending on individual needs, sessions can take up to 2 hours or longer. In the Native American Medicine Way perspective, true healing \u2014 spiritual healing \u2014 cannot be done on a physical level. Healing means to return to wholeness, and returning to wholeness is purely an inside job. Spiritual therapy addresses the root \u2014 the spiritual \u2014 problems that cause dis-ease. It is important to note that Medicine Men/Women believe that all healing is self-healing. A Medicine Man/Woman learns how to move and manipulate the energy of another's body and can share wisdom from the spirit realm, but true healing must take place inside the spirit of the individual. In other words, a person must be willing and ready to take full responsibility for his or her own healing\u2014 there is no magic pill that lies outside of one's spiritual body. A Medicine Man/Woman can be an outstanding tutor, but will not give all of the answers. Integral Alternative Therapy It's a combination of different alternative therapies approaches based on the individual's needs and preferences. After an initial interview with the client a course of action is determined and one or several therapeutic modalities can be applied in the same session or numerous sessions from 60 to 90 minutes long, also it can be combined as support for the Integral Spiritual Therapy. Some of the therapies used during the session can be but are not limited to: Therapeutic Touch is a biofield (magnetic field around the body) therapy that is an energy-based approach to health and healing. It uses the gift of touch to influence the human energy system, specifically the energy field that surrounds the body, and the energy centers that control the flow from the energy field to the physical body. In this non-invasive energy therapy practitioners consciously use their hands in a heart-centered and intentional way to support and facilitate physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health. Therapeutic Touch can reduce anxiety, insomnia, depression, improve the body's healing abilities and it's used to support the treatment and recovery of many different physical and emotional ailments Vibrational Crystal Therapy is basically the 'laying on' of stones of different vibrational rates onto the body in order to effect healing and change. Crystals have been used throughout history for healing. Crystals work with the human energy field and can move, absorb, focus, direct and diffuse energy within the body. Working with crystalline energy helps the body to find its own natural rhythm. In a Vibrational Crystal therapy session, many different types of crystals are used to balance your body, it may also involve laying out different energy grids or specific patterns of crystals around the body. By using grids, the combination of the stones can enhance their individual properties, and direct energy, this is always specific to you, and one session is never like another. With intuition as a guiding force, a session may combine a mix of Crystal Healing, Reiki, Chakra balancing, and aromatherapy to achieve a complete balancing of the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual being. Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is administered by \"laying on hands\" and is based on the idea that an unseen \"life force energy\" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. If one's \"life force energy\" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress, and if it is high, we are more capable of being happy and healthy.The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words - Rei which means \"God's Wisdom or the Higher Power\" and Ki which is \"life force energy\". So Reiki is actually \"spiritually guided life force energy.\" Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. It has been effective in helping virtually every known illness and malady and always creates a beneficial effect. It also works in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery. A treatment feels like a wonderful glowing radiance that flows through and around you. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects that include relaxation and feelings of peace, security and wellbeing. Aromatherapy is a caring, hands-on therapy which seeks to induce relaxation, increase energy, reduce the effects of stress and restore lost balance to mind, body and soul. Aromatherapy uses natural plant extracts, such as essential oils, hydrosols, and carrier oils extracted from flowers, bark, stems, leaves, roots or other parts of a plant in a variety of ways to to enhance and harmonize psychological and physical well-being. The inhaled aroma from these essential oils stimulates brain function, essential oils can also be absorbed through the skin, where they travel through the bloodstream and can promote emotional, physical and spiritual health . NLP stands for Neuro-Linguistic Programming, Neuro refers to your neurology; Linguistic refers to language; programming refers to how that neural language functions. In other words, learning NLP is like learning the language of your own mind. Flower Essences are a form of vibrational medicine used as a holistic approach to well-being and self-healing. Flower remedies have been used for many years as a way to heal the mind, body, and spirit. Flower essences are similar to essential oils, but they are not the same. Whereas essential oils contain a very concentrated amount of a plant (often intended for aromatic and topical application), flower essences are quite diluted and are made from the living blossoms of flowers from plants and trees. Flower essences work gently and subtly on the emotional body, helping to calm the spirit and ease the mind. This allows not only for mental and spiritual healing, but often for the healing of the body in terms of relief of ailments, illness, stress, and disease. Flower essences are perfectly suitable for anyone looking to improve their emotional well-being, increase their connection with self or others, deepen their meditation practice, clear negativity, or achieve overall healing on a deeper level. appointment Fees Integral Spiritual Therapy Initial Consultation 30 minutes $45 120 Minutes session $150 Integral Alternative Therapy Initial Consultation 30 minutes $45 90 Minutes session $150 60 Minutes session $100 3 - 90 minutes session Package 3 - 60 minute session Package Therapeutic Touch 90 Minutes session $120 Vibrational Crystal Therapy and Aromatherapy "}
