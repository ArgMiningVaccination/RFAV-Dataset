However, although these requirements have been in place for more than 10 years, more than one -sixth of the CHDP physician s in Los Angeles County (LAC) do not meet these minimum requirements. Beginning April 1, 2014, LAC CHDP physicians will be afforded a two -year grace period to meet CHDP Physician Provider Minimum Requirements. By April 1, 2016 LAC CHDP physicians who do not meet these requirements will be subject to disenrollment from the CHDP program. ENFORCEMENT OF AGE RESTRICTIONS Per the CHDP Provider Manual, the scope of CHDP practice for internal medicine physicians is limited to children and youth ages 14 years a nd older.

The LAC CHDP Program will conduct periodic audits of submitted Confidential Screening/Billing Report (PM 160) forms, to ensure CHDP provider compliance with age restrictions.
