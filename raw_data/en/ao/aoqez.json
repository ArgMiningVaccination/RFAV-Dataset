Introduction Anincreasing number ofpatients worldwide have become interested incomplementary and alternative (CAM) inrecent years [1].Ofthedifferent types Chi- Health (NCCIH, [2].The trends inTCM utilization have also increased gradually inTaiwan, and than ofTaiwanese permits unrestricted tobeused forresearch purposes only. Applicants must follow the Processed Personal Data Protection Law(http://ww w.winklerp Pain teaching hospitals and centers Taiwanese study, more than 6%ofsubjects hadreceived acupuncture in2002 The National Health Insurance wasestablished in1995 inTaiwan, and more bytheend of2010 [3]. The NHI program covers notonly Western medical services butalso ambulatory care inTCM. Allclaims data from theNHI program arecollected 24]. demographic characteristics (e.g., sex,date ofbirth, occupation and place ofresidence) and clinical information (e.g., diagnosis, management and treatment) arealso provided inthedatabase. This nationwide database ishighly reliable, which reduces thepotential forsampling bias [25]. have addressed questions about thetrends inutilization ofacu- puncture. Some studies have only reported acupuncture usage inspecific diseases [26], whereas others were conducted decades ago. Forexample, aprevious study described the demographics and patterns Materials and methods Data source Weaccessed theLongitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000) from theNational Health Research Institutes, Taiwan. The LHID2000 contains alloftheoriginal claims data for 1million beneficiaries who were randomly sampled from theregistry ofallbeneficiaries enrolled intheNHI program in2000, and these randomly sampled 1million individuals were followed longitudinally through 2011 according totheir personal identification numbers. The included individuals were removed from thecohort until death orwithdrawal from theNHI program. The beneficiary characteristics, including age, geographic region, and place ofresi- dence, areupdated each year. De-identified demographic and occupation aswell asmedical records ofclinical visits, hospitalizations, diagnosis codes and treatment codes were allincluded inthedatasets. Study samples Weanalyzed adult acupuncture users bythetreatment NHI defines \u00aacomplex acupuncture\u00ba asacupuncture treatment forpatients with specific disorders, such ascerebral vascular disease, spinal cord injury, cancer and psychiatric disorders, which require more effort totreat. The diagnosis codes intheLHD2000 were consistent with the InternatilnaC sCafficiDatiln lcNifeafef,RintvMedifiln,sCiniDaCMldiciDatiln (ICD-9-CM) [27]. Study variables Sex, age, level ofurbanization and geographic region were chosen asindependent variables to explore their effects onacupuncture utilization.

Competing interests :Theauthors have declared thatnocompeting interest exist.than 20years were included inthisstudy. Acupuncture users were categorized into 7sub- groups according toage: 20to29,30to39,40to49,50to59,60to69,70to79and\u001580 years old. There were 6geographic regions assessed, including Taipei and theNorthern, Central, Southern, Kao-Ping and Eastern regions ofTaiwan. Residence areas were grouped into 4levels ofurbanization based onpopulation density (people/km2),theratio ofelderly persons, the ratio ofagricultural workers and thelowest waslevel 4. Statistical analysis The demographic characteristics and medical record data were analyzed bySAS statistical soft- ware (version 9.4forWindows; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The data analysis com- prised descriptive statistics ofthedemographic characteristics ofacupuncture users. The percentage ofacupuncture bydifferent wascalculated asthenum- berofacupuncture users dividing analysis wasused toinvestigate thechange intheutilization rate ofacu- puncture over time. method wasused todetermine thestatistically significant ofthetrend ofmedical andHospi- tal(CMUH104-REC2-115) andtheNational Health Research Institutes, which maintain and manage theNHI database. Results Adults older than 20years who were included inthe1million beneficiaries oftheLHID2000 dataset were included inthisstudy. The valid beneficiaries 677,7542 in2002 and 732,466 in2011 (Table 1).The proportion from 7.98% in 2002 to10.9% in2011. The analysis ofgeneralized estimating equation revealed that acupunc- ture useincreased significantly with (incidence data from 2.45 in2002 to2.22 in2011. Our data revealed that female acupuncture users increased from 8.96% in2002 to12.0% in 2011, where male acupuncture to 1.31:1 2002 and 2011. Residents inlowurbanization areas (level 4)were lesslikely to receive acupuncture. Acupuncture users ofdifferent urbanized residences allincreased from 2002 to2011. clinics than inhospitals (Table 3).There were 6regional divisions considered, including Taipei and theNorthern, Central, Southern, Kao- ping, and Eastern divisions. The percentages ofacupuncture users were highest intheCentral branch bureau and lowest intheSouthern branch bureau. Table 4provides disease toptwodisease toacupuncture visits were injury (50.6%) and diseases ofthemusculoskeletal system and connective tissue (41.8%). Patients suffering from stroke, including cerebral infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage, were thelargest population among those receiving complex acupuncture (Table 5). Discussion Our study revealed that theone-year prevalence ofacupuncture useinTaiwan increased from rate ratio of1.04. Women hada higher acupuncture utilization rate than men, and middle-aged groups were themost likely to receive acupuncture. Ofthesixregions, thepercentage ofone-year acupuncture users was highest inCentral branch bureau. Injury and diseases ofthemusculoskeletal system and con- nective tissue were themajor reason that patients received acupuncture. Patients suffering from stroke represented thelargest proportion ofthose receiving complex acupuncture.Table from 2002\u00b120 n.

TCM theories such asYinand Yang aswell asChinese used communities [32]. Chinese herbal isalso reimbursed byNHI policy and isthus easily affordable bythegeneral public. Acupuncture users were mainly enrollees inthemiddle-aged groups, which users. Residents inhighly urbanized areas usually utilized TCM more than those inlessurbanized areas [35]. The most common diseases among patients receiving acupuncture treatment inTaiwan were injury and disorders ofthemusculoskeletal system and issimilar quicker than Chinese herbal medi- cine [36]. Previous studies among osteoarthritis [37] and fibromyalgia [38] patients also pro- vided substantial evidence supporting thebeneficial effects ofacupuncture inthese disorders. Patients with circulatory disorders, including cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disorders, also received acupuncture. The proportion ofacupuncture users among stroke patients inTaiwan was17% in2008 stroke inpatients with ischemic stroke [39]. Furthermore, a previous study found that ischemic stroke patients experienced increased cerebral blood flow when they received acupuncture treatment [40]. The NHIA launched aPilot Scheme for Health Policy inStroke Adjuvant Acupuncture Therapy (HPSAAT) tosupport the theinpatient with implementation hasalso promoted theutilization and integration ofacupuncture treatment instroke patients.

Acupuncture women with aroma- tase inhibitor-induced arthralgia were ture, arealso covered bytheNHI. There were several limitations toourstudy. First, detailed information about acupuncture, including theselected acupoints, manipulation and needle retention time, were notprovided inthisdataset. The detail information could beonly only analyze theutiliza- tion rate indifferent population and different disease categories. Another limitation wasthat thetreatment codes recorded intheNHIRD only included manual acupuncture, electroacu- puncture and complex acupuncture. Auricular acupuncture, scalp acupuncture and moxibus- tion were allrecorded under thesame treatment codes asmanual acupuncture. may have been recorded asorthopedic manipulation. However, thisstudy stillprovided the most up-to-date information about ofacupuncture of demographic data and thetrends inacupuncture utilization inTaiwan. The large sample size provided bytheNHIRD also minimized selection bias. Conclusion This study provides themost up-to-date report onacupuncture utilization among adults in Taiwan. The major characteristics ofacupuncture users included being middle-aged, female and aresident ofahighly urbanized area and suffering from injury ordisorders ofthemuscu- loskeletal system and connective tissue. Our findings may provide useful information forclini- calpractice and acupuncture research aswell asforhealth policy decision making.
