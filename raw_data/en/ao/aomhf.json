New Research in Homeopathy and Expert Consensus Strasbourg, France 2Robertsau Radiotherapy Center, Strasbourg, France 3Main General Practice Surgery, Strasbourg, France 4Troyes Hospital Centre, Dept of Oncology-Radiotherapy, Troyes, France Institute, Dunkerque, France Context: Homeopathy is the integrative medicine most widely used by patients with cancer in France. However, there were as yet no supportive care guidelines for this therapy. The International Homeopathic Society of Support- ive Care in Oncology (www.shisso-info.com) aimed to makerecommendations in order to propose to all health profes- sionals concerned with supportive care, a homeopathic pre- scription tool respecting the principles of similitude, individualisation and of the in nitesimal dose. Method: We used the method of expert consensus proposed by the French High Health Authority (HAS). It is a consensus method for writing a small number of concise, unambiguous recommendations, answering the questionsasked. This method is proposed when there is a paucity of scienti c argument on the subject, which is the case here. Seven steering groups studied respectively cancer disclosure, surgery, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, radia- tion therapy, hormone therapy and the post-cancer period.These recommendations were presented during the plenary session which brought together some fty physicians, phar- macists, oncologists or surgeons specializing in homeopathic supportive care. Results: Thirty recommendations were discussed, amended and unanimously adopted or not during the plenary session. Some side effects, such as fatigue for example, are common to every patient, because the effects of cancer medication are stronger than an individual 's reaction. Certain situations, however, require an individualised homeopathicconsultation.Conclusion: These recommendations are part of a program to improve good practice in supportive care. They are indicative and do not replace in any way an individualised homeopathic consultation. They are very safe to use as there are no medicine interactions and no signi cant side effects of homeopathic medicine. This is the rst time that such an approach has been implemented in homeopathy circles. The same methodology could be used for other pathologies. Two years 'hindsight has shown that they are indeed comfortable bedfellows. Keywords: Expert consensus, oncological supportive care, homeopathy A002. Homeopathy and Environmental Challenges Leoni V. Bonamin 1 1Graduation Program on Environmental and Experimental Pathology, Universidade Paulista, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Homeopathy is growing in areas beyond human medi- cine because of its capacity to act on all living systems. In agriculture and cattlefarms,especially those oriented to organic production, homeopathy has been a very useful tool and works in harmony with the concept of sustainability, including itsapplication in biodynamic agriculture and agro-forestry. In Brazil, more than 15 companies are established to manufacture homeopathic products for animal and vegetal use. The use of homeopathy has been present in zoos and protective organizations for wild animals, mainly in epidemicsituations. This new perspective points towards a putative ecological role of homeopathy. In a recent study, we veri ed the protective role of isotherapy in Artemia salina exposed to pesticides and heavy metals, highlighting that this crustacean is a known experi- mental model of eco-toxicology. The treatment of Artemia cysts exposed to glyphosate and lead with the respective isotherapeutic, induced better adaptation of these animals tothe harmful medium, reducing the level of egg hatching and the incidence of malformations in the newborn nauplii. Other parameters, like motility and general activity, also improved after the treatment. Physicochemical analyses of the water are still in progress, to provide some understand-ing about the mechanisms involved in this protection. In another set of experiments performed in vitro, the corre- spondence between changes in the dipole moment of ho- meopathic medicines and of the culture medium of responsive single cells could also be observed, using solva-tochromic dyes. This suggests that electric resonance could beJune 14 -16, 2019 London Copyright \u00a9 2020 The Faculty of HomeopathyDOI https://doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0037- 1608960ISSN 1475-4916.A1 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Under this hypothesis, another eld study was set up, using the same method. The treatment of a natural watersource with Phos 30 cH produced signi cant changes of the dipole moment in water samples harvested from different and distant locales of the same environment. That was similar to those effects observed in the medicine itself. The samples were taken before, and at different times after, water treat-ment. The same signals could be measured, even in distant points of the water flow, up to 72 hours after the immersion ofPhos 30 cH into the source. These studies show the importance of knowing how far the homeopathic signal can reach in nature, mainly in water, and unveils the putative role of homeopathy in recov- ering environmental disturbances.

In-vitro Evaluation of the Anti-pathogenic Activity of Okoubaka aubrevillei Mother Tincture/3x in the Human Gastrointestinal Tract Using the SHIME Technology Platform Susann Buchheim-Schmidt 1, Peters2, Gent, Belgium 4ACOMED Germany Background/Aim: Okoubaka aubrevillei (Okou.) is known in homeopathy for its action on the gastrointestinal tract, e.g. in gastroenteritis and traveler 's diarrhea. Within a Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME\u00aethe modulating effect of Okou . on the activity of physiological human proximal colon microbiota and its pre- ventive effect against gastrointestinal infections was evaluated. Methods: Upon inoculation with fecal microbiota from a healthy donor, 4 parallel proximal colon compart-ments of the SHIME \u00aewere treated either with Okou . mother tincture or 3x in therapeutic doses, blank and ethanol control for one week. Using the \"Okoubaka -adapted \"microbial com- munity from Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) Salmonella in 4 between 103-108 CFU for ETEC and 103-106forSalmonella , considering the minimum doses. Concentrations of the pathogensand short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production were measured at 0, 24 and 48 h. The experiments were done in triplicate and normalized to ethanol control. Results: Both Okou . mother tincture and 3x were capable of restricting the colonization of Salmonella enter- itidis and ETEC at 3 of the 4 pathogen doses. A stronger antipathogenic effect was observed for the mother tincture, which included a reduction of 1.1 log-units of Salmonella (p<0.001) and 2.0 units of ETEC ( p<0.001) after 24 h of incubation for the lowest pathogen dose. Total SCFA levels remained unaffected, but propionate and butyrate slightly increased during the rst 24 h and remained high during the 24 -48 h time interval, accompanied by a decreased acetate production which indicates a \"cross feeding \"process from acetate to health-related butyrate.Conclusion: An activating effect of the intestinal mi- crobiome's resistance can be postulated for on Transparent Membranes; a Simple and Effective Method for Investigating the Physics of Homeopathic PotenciesSteven J. Cartwright 1 1Cherwell Innovation Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom Background and Aims: Solvatochromic dyes have demonstrated themselves to be effective detectors of homeo- pathic potencies. Current research is directed at the immobi- lisation of solvatochromic dyes onto transparent membranes in order to examine in detail the primary interaction betweena range of different homeopathic medicines across potency scales. Methods: It has been found that a number of solvato- chromic dyes can be covalently immobilised onto cellulose membranes, thereby allowing a direct examination of theprimary interaction between homeopathic potencies and molecular detectors. Immobilisation means that dye aggre- gation cannot occur and therefore a much clearer picture is beginning to emerge with respect to the kinetics and ther- modynamics of potency-dye interactions. Results: One surprising nding already emerging is that the interaction between dyes and potencies is hysteretic or S-shaped. This behaviour is characteristic of positive feed-back loops or auto-catalytic processes where a process self- strengthens over time before eventually reaching a maxi- mum. Results suggest some kind of resonant interaction between potencies and dyes is taking place, the strength and development of which is dependent upon starting con-ditions and the electronic and structural features of the dye used. Further ndings indicate that potencies are not con- stant in their strength but fluctuate over time. Conclusions: What the possible causes of both the hysteretic behaviour of potencies and the fluctuations in potency strength over time are, and what they mean for homeopathy in general, will be discussed, along with what these results may be telling us about the likely identity of potencies.

A Improve Upper Respiratory Infections COPD EPOXILOCohorts Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can be triggered by Upper Respi- ratory Tract Infections (URTIs), viral aetiology being of in- creasingly higher importance. A homeopathic approach to viral URTI in COPD patients could help reduce its frequencyand related exacerbations. Methods: Prospective, cohorts, multi-center study in Cantabria (Spain), with 219 COPD patients taking a weekly dose of the homeopathic medicine Oscillococcinum (HG \u00bc109) or not (CG \u00bc110) added to conventional treatment and following usual practice. Main objective was measuringPresentation Abstracts A2 Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 1/2020 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. the number of URTIs (follow-up of 4 -5 months). Secondary endpoints duration of URTIs, number and duration of COPD exacerbations, use of drugs, quality of life and adverse events. Results: There was a signi cant reduction in the mean number of URTIs in HG compared to CG (0.51 vs 1.04), with a difference of /C00.52 (CI 95% [ /C00.84;/C00.20], p\u00bc0.001) and 3.3 times more likelihood of suffering /C212 URTI episodes in CG (p\u00bc0.003). The mean duration of the episodes was reduced in HG patients (3.57 vs 5.22 days; p\u00bc0.012). When looking at the exacerbator phenotype patients, there was a signi cant decrease in number of URTIs (0.54 vs and 1.5; p\u00bc0.037). The pre- scription of exacerbation-corticoids was decreased in both groups between baseline and visit 2, but more reduced in HG (22.1% vs 7.5%; p\u00bc0.005). Other variables did not reach statistically signi cant differences between groups. Conclusions: The use of this homeopathic medicine by COPD patients may have a bene cial impact in reducing the number and duration of URTIs and can positively impact the number of COPD exacerbations in patients with the exacer- bator phenotype. Con rmation with studies with a greater sample size and a longer follow-up should be pursued. Keywords: COPD, homeopathy, URTI, exacerbation, cohorts Replication and Germany 3Biodynamic Association Denmark, Herskind, Galten, Denmark Research Institute, Arlesheim, Switzerland Background and Aims: Basic homeopathic research requires stable and reliable test systems to detect biological effects of homeopathic preparations. Baumgartner et al. (2012) described a test system, which revealed speci c effects of a potentized Stannum met . 30x preparation (nomi- nal dilution of 10/C030of the original substance) compared to water 30x as control in a bio-assay using cress ( Lepidium quent computerized image analysis of the crystallizationpatterns. In the present study we performed a replication trial at two independent laboratories, employing meticulousmethodology, among which the integration of Systematic Negative Control (SNC) experiments. Results: Analysis of the data of the replication trial revealed the same data structure in both projects regarding directionality and relative effect size of the homeopathictreatment. SNC experiments did not yield evidence for ex- perimental instabilities, indicative of a robust test system. A meta-analysis of the pooled data of both trials revealed a highly signi cant treatment effect of Stannum met . 30x, and no interaction with experimental day. In a subgroup analysiswe identi ed that the spatial region of the crystallization patterns, where the potency treatment effect manifests, was predominantly con ned to the geometrical centre of the crystallization plates -which is in agreement with the precursor study.Conclusions: We were able to establish a test system yielding reproducible biological effects of an ultra-molecular homeopathic preparation when replicated in ten indepen- dent experiments in two laboratories. Meta-analysis of thedata of both trials yielded a highly signi cant treatment effect. These ground-breaking results point to a promising potential of the method to contribute to basic homeopathic research and call for developing a theoretical model to understand the effects observed.

Homeopathic Treatment Ameliorates Fatigue and Attentional Deterioration in Radiotherapy Breast Cancer PatientsYakov Freed 1 1Homeopathic Supportive Cancer Care, Institute of Oncology, Sheba Medical Centre, Israel Patients with breast cancer experience psychosocial distress such as anxiety, depression, fatigue, and cognitive disturbances. Both fatigue and cognitive dysfunction have been observed as post-treatment outcomes of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The PPI test represents an operational measure of information-protective pre-attentional mechanisms. PPI is a neurological phenomenon in which a weaker acoustic pre- pulse (delivered via headphones) inhibits the reaction to asubsequent strong startling pulse. The reduction of the response amplitude (measured by electromyographic activi- ty from the orbicularis oculi muscle) re flects the ability of the nervous system to temporarily adapt to a strong sensory stimulus when a preceding weaker signal is given. PPI is anobjective tool for fatigue evaluation. In a randomized, double blind, IBR-approved study, 57 female patients who underwent chemotherapy and adjuvant whole breast radiation in the radiation department at Sheba Medical Centre, and who gave written consent for participa-tion, were included in the study: 38 received homeopathic treatment and 19 received placebo. All patients were evaluated at the beginning, during, end and one month after completing radiotherapy for: (i) fatigue level, utilizing the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI);(ii) attention performance, utilizing the Pre-Pulse Inhibition (PPI) task; and (iii) anxiety level, utilizing both the startle response test and examining the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) differences. At baseline, both treated and placebo groups showed similar impaired level of auditory-sustained attention (ASAT; measured by pre-pulse inhibition), probably as a conse- quence of recent chemotherapy. One-month after radiotherapy completion, while the placebo ASAT performance further deteriorated, a signi cant improvement (to normal performance) was observed in the homeopathic treatment group.

Outcome-Speci c Review of Controlled Clinical Studies with Homeopathic MedicinesKatharina Gaertner 1 1University of Bern, Institute of Complementary and Integrative Medicine, Switzerland Background: Though there exists a considerable num- ber of systematic reviews of clinical homeopathy studies,Presentation Abstracts Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 1/2020A3 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. they are limited regarding literature sources and study type. Furthermore, a comprehensive update is needed. Aim: The aim was to conduct an extensive systematic review focusing on the investigated indications and outcomesof the original studies in order to provide a clear view of the existing evidence for each particular indication, to reveal academic voids and to enhance the applicability of the results for therapeutic practice. Method: In addition to available studies from previous reviews, an extended literature search was conducted con- sidering also 'grey 'literature (e.g. Embase, CochraneCentral Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, Science Index Expanded and LILACS), four databases for tary medicine (CORE-Hom and AMED and CINAHL), as well as 25 databases for theses and dissertations, were searched and complemented by manual references.Search limits were set from 01.01.1980 to 30.06.2017. The study records were managed by means of the citation man- ager Endnote \u00aeand were transferred into a previously piloted and standardized data-handling template (Excel\u00ae). Publica- tion type, study aims and target population, study design,sample size and outcomes, as well as intervention details such as potencies, dosage, type of homeopathy and compar- ator, were extracted from the included reports. Results: 600 original studies in 202 medical conditions could be included in the review. For 52 conditions, at least twocontrolled studies for the same homeopathic intervention could be identi ed. They will be presented, using tables for the different clinical indications, and discussed regarding thestudy details (e.g. design, sample size, homeopathic method).

How Homeopathy is Treated in Meta-analyses Robert Hahn 1 1S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Hospital, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, Sweden Many scientists reject homeopathy because there is no plausible mechanism of action. However, medical care today is evidence-based, where a mechanism is not crucial. With abundant literature, evidence is obtained by meta- analyses and systematic reviews. Sadly, several meta-analy- ses authored by classical scientists and skeptics, wherehomeopathic treatment is compared to placebo (water), show evidence of manipulation and bad judgment. The story starts in 1997 when Klaus Linde and co- workers identi ed 89 clinical trials that showed an overall odds ratio of 2.45 in favor of homeopathy over placebo. Thisdifference was statistically signi cant. Linde reported a trend toward smaller bene t from studies of the highest quality, but the 10 trials with the highest quality (highest Jadad score) stillshowed homeopathy had a statistically signi cant effect. These results challenged academics to perform alter- native analyses that, to demonstrate lack of effect, relied on extensive exclusion of studies, often to the degree that conclusions were based on only 5-10% of the material, oron virtual data. Such extensive exclusion exercises, created in retrospect, opens the way for the authors to manipulate the outcome by creating statistical Type II errors and flip-flop phenomena. The ultimate argument against homeopathy is the \"funnel plot \"published by Shang 's group in 2005. How- ever, the funnel plot model is flawed when applied to a mixture of diseases, because studies with expected strong treatment effects are, for ethical reasons, powered lower than studies with expected weak or unclear treatment effects. To conclude that homeopathy lacks clinical effect, scientists must overlook more than 90% of the availableclinical trials. Alternatively, flawed statistical methods must be applied.

Effects of Homeopathic Preparations of on the Growth Rate of Mercury-Stressed Duckweed Lemna gibba L. as a Function of Different Levels Tim J\u00e4ger 1, Sandra W\u00fcrtenberger2, Stephan Baumgartner1 1Institute of Integrative Medicine, 2Scienti c and Regulatory Affairs, Hevert-Arzneimittel GmbH & Co. KG, Nussbaum, Germany Background and developed a bioassay duckweed of this bioassay to homeopathic treatments as a function of stress intensity was also of interest. Methods: A bioassay with arsenic-stressed duckweed (Lemna gibba L.) was adapted for the use of mercuryas stressor. Plants were poisoned with mercury(II) chloride at two differ- ent intensities (slight/severe) for 48 hours. Afterwards plants grew in either Mercurius corrosivus (24x to 30x) or water controls for seven days. Growth rates of the frond (leaf) area were determined using a computerised image analysis system. Six independent experiments with potentised Mercurius cor- rosivus were performed, three for each stress level. Addition- ally, six systematic negative control (SNC) experiments with water were conducted (three for each stress level) to investi- gate the stability of the experimental set-up. All experiments were randomised and blinded. Results: Highly standardised conditions were achieved by using a speci c growth chamber, leading to very small variance ( not yield any signi cant effects, providing evidence for the stability of the experimental system. Growth rates ofslightly stressed duckweed were signi cantly enhanced after application of Mercurius corrosivus 24x -30x compared to the controls. Growth rates of severely stressed duckweed were signicantly reduced compared to the controls. Conclusion: The test system with Lemna gibba L. yielded evidence for speci c effects of Mercurius corrosivus 24x -30x, namely a growth enhancement for duckweed that was slightly stressed and a growth reduction for duckweed that was severely stressed by mercury. The Lemna gibba L. bioassay is developing into a very useful tool for homeopathicbasic research, since it revealed speci c effects of potentized Arsenicum album after arsenic stress, and effects of poten- tized Mercurius corrosivus after mercury stress, and might be used in the future for investigation of the Simile principle.

Background and Aims: Evaporation-induced pattern formation in droplets has been applied to characterize ho- meopathic preparations at high and low potency levels. Here we investigated whether the droplet evaporation method(DEM) may identify differences in succussed vs. unsuccussed homeopathic preparations, and in potencies prepared with different succussion stroke numbers in the low potency range. Materials and Methods: In the present by the application of (i) 100 or (ii)10 succussion strokes between the consecutive dilution steps, and (iii) prepared as an unsuccussed, only gently mixed, control. The experimental set-up stability was examined by positive control experiments. The DEM experimental proto- col consisted of the evaporation of droplets of the analyzedpotency per se, placed on microscope slides and under controlled conditions. The resulting patterns were photo- graphed in dark eld. The images (4026 in total) were subjected to computerized pattern evaluation, consisting of the measurement of their grey-level distribution, aspects oftexture, and fractality. Results: In all ve analyzed homeopathic prepara- the succussed (100 and 10 times) and unsuccussed variants could be signi cantly differentiated by means of at least three of the ve analyzed image evaluation parameters. Signicant differences between all variants were found only for potency 6x) in one parameter per preparation. In most cases, the application of succussion strokes reduced the size, ho- mogeneity, and complexity of the DEM patterns. The control experiments showed reasonable experimental model stability. Conclusions: Phenomenological study of homeopathic preparations in the low potency range, prepared with differ- ent succussion stroke numbers, may contribute to a better understanding of the changes that the material, which is still present at low potencies, undergoes during successive po- tentization steps.

Further Data on Wheat Germination and Silver and Medium Seggau, Austria Background: In pilot studies (GIRI 2016, HRI 2015), wheat grains were observed under aqueous low solutions of silver nitrate, either diluted in distilled water in steps of1:10 by pipetting only ( \"e\") or diluted and agitated ( \"x\"). Untreated distilled water served as additional control (W0). Probes were applied blindly. Germination rates after 28h were higher under \"x\"than under \"e\"(p<0.01 in both studies). System stability was tested and found adequate(GIRI 2018), silver nitrate concentrations were measured and found correctly prepared (GIRI 2019), and it was shown that agitated water did not lead to enhanced germination versus non-agitated water, thus excluding the possibility of an effect of higher oxygen saturation in x-probes (GIRI 2018). Aim: Following up on the pilot studies, the aim was to investigate the in fluence of silver nitrate on wheat germina- tion medium Method: and Germany (10/C02to 10/C024). Experimentalconditions were as similar as possible to those in the pilot study, apart from the fact that silver nitrate 10/C02(not 10/C01) served as mother tincture. Result: After 28h, rates (N grains \u00bc2200) rates were thus higher under x than under e, surpassing the e-values by 7.5% for the overall pooled data (10/C02to The experiments suggest that agitation of molecular probes can have effects that would also deserveconsideration in mainstream biology and medicine.

Mathie 1 1Homeopathy Research Institute, London, United Kingdom Background: In our programme of systematic reviews, assessment of internal validity (IV) and model validity (MV) of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of individualised and non-individualised homeopathic treatment and NIHTrespectively) has enabled us to rate placebo-controlled RCTs as high, moderate or low study quality. Assessments of IV and external validity (degree of pragmatic or explanatory study attitude) have recently been achieved for other-than-placebo (OTP)-controlled RCTs of IHT and NIHT. Aims: To examine the totality of clinical evidence in homeopathic treatment across the four RCT designs, with particular focus on high-quality studies and their meta- analysis. Methods: The 90 RCTs that were included in our four prior meta-analyses comprised the data-set. A study was rated 'high quality 'if it had high IV and acceptable MV (placebo-controlled trials) or if it had high IV and suitable pragmatic or explanatory attitude (OTP-controlled trials). One main outcome measure per RCT was identi ed and used in sensitivity analysis based on high study quality. Results: The quality rating was 'high 'for 5 RCTs, 'moderate 31, and high-quality trials were placebo-controlled (3 IHT, 1 NIHT): Jacobs et al (Pediatrics 1994; childhood diarrhoea); Jacobs et al ( Pediatr Infect ( Drugs RD syndrome). One was OTP-controlled (a pragmatic study ofIHT): Peckham et al ( Homeopathy 2014; irritable bowel syndrome, IBS). Analysis of the high-quality trials identi ed a treatment effect favouring homeopathy over placebo (odds 95% con dence to 3.15; n\u00bc4; p\u00bc0.001); there was no signi cant difference between homeopathy and usual care for IBS. Conclusions: There are 5 high-quality RCTs of homeo- pathic treatment, containing evidence of a distinct effect of homeopathic medicines compared with placebo. Additional high-quality RCT research in homeopathy is necessary toenable more complete and decisive data interpretation. Keywords: Individualised, non-individualised, ran- domised controlled trials, systematic review, Enzymes in Magellanic Santo Amaro, S\u00e3o Paulo (SP), Brazil Magellanic penguins reproduce along the coast of Argentina, Chile and the Falkland Islands. Brazil is part of the migratory route of these animals, which are found in adebilitated state on the coast and sent to rehabilitation centers. When they are not able to be reinserted, they are sent to zoos and aquariums. At Sabina, Escola Parque do Conhecimento, the penguins receive check-ups every six months, including blood collection (hemogram andbiochemistry). Objective: To show the results of homeopathic treat- ment on the liver enzymes (ALT-TGP/AST-TGO) of Magellanic penguins kept in zoos. ALT enzymes are mainly found in the cytosol of hepatocytes and muscle cells, and act on thecatabolism of amino acids and the transport of nitrogen between organs (baseline values: 16 -140 U/L). AST exists in multiple tissues, mainly in the liver and muscles (baseline values: 90 -300 U/L). Methods: Ten Magellanic penguins presented liver enzyme changes at their annual check-up and were treated with four globules of Carduus marianus 6 cH, once a day, for 30 days, and were assessed again through new tests. The datawas analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test, with p<0.05 considered a statistically signi cant difference. Results: In animals treated with Carduus , there was a mean decrease in ALT 141.2 /C661.5 U/L to 65.3/C628.7 U/L ( p<0.05), as well mean decrease in AST values, from 394.7 /C6113.7 U/L to 223.2 /C6116.7 (p<0.05). The response to the homeopathic treatment was similar to the allopathic treatment in previous check-ups, but without any side effects and being easy to administer. Conclusion: Homeopathic treatment for penguins liv- ing in zoos and aquariums is a good option, with excellent results and animal wellbeing.

Effectiveness of Homeopathic Medicines as Add-on to Institutional Management Protocol for Acute Encephalitis Syndrome in 1Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy, Delhi, India 2Clinical Unit (H), Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, India Background: Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is endemic to certain parts of India, with limited treatment options. In our initial exploratory comparative observational study of 151 patients with AES, there was signi cantly reduced mortality with adjunctive homeopathy compared to institutional management protocol (IMP). The presentrandomized placebo-controlled trial brings more statistical rigor to this research program. Methods: This study was conducted at a pediatric unit from 2013 to 2015. Children aged >6 months and /C2018 years and receiving IMP were randomized to receive adjunctivehomeopathy ( n\u00bc325) or placebo as control ( n\u00bc323). The primary effectiveness analysis was based on Glasgow Out- come Scale (GOS). Morbidity was assessed using the Liverpool Outcome Score for Assessing Children at Follow-up. Analysis was by intention to treat. Results: A total of 612 children were analyzed (Home- opathy [H] \u00bc304; The primary outcome, GOS, differed signi cantly between H and C groups. There was 14.8% death/neuro-vegetative state in the H group com- pared to 29.8% in the C group. Relative risk was 0.49 (95%condence interval [CI]: 0.36 to 0.68), with 15.0% (95% CI: 8.6 to 21.6%). Number needed to prevent one additional death/neuro-vegetative statewas 6.6 (95% CI: 4.6 to 11.6). Proportional-odds analysis also revealed a greater effect in the H group: odds ratio, 0.40 (95% CI: 0.27 to 0.60). (n\u00bc116), Stramonium (n\u00bc33), Arsenicum al- vomica (n\u00bc10). Conclusion: Adjunctive homeopathic medicines may improve clinical outcomes associated with AES. Further ran- domized and controlled studies, using double-blinded trial design, are recommended to discover if the current ndings may be corroborated.

Do these trials prove that homeopathy works? Clare describes her 15-year journey to answer this and other related questions: What are randomised controlled trials? How are they designed, conducted and interpreted? What is the difference between a randomised controlled trial and an observational study? What are pragmatic trials? What do 'Homeopathy ' trials Treatment by homeopaths? Homeopathic medi- cines, or something else? Can we design trials that will help patients, clinicians, and homeopaths make the best decisions? This talk illuminates this modern 'scienti c'tool, and the economic, political and cultural forces that continue to shape trials, and concludes by offering suggestions for home- opathy trials in the future.

Tournier1 1Homeopathy Research Institute, London, United Kingdom In recent years, the science and politics of homeopa- thy have become closely intertwined, with public access tohomeopathic treatment and training, as well as regulatory issues, becoming increasingly determined by how the evi- dence base is interpreted by decision-makers. It is therefore of great concern that over the same period, we have seen an ever-increasing divergence betweenthe actual status of the homeopathy evidence base as under- stood by experts in the eld, and how this data is reported by academics from other disciplines and in the mainstream media. The most striking example of academic misreporting is the Overview Report published by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) in 2015. This report, commonly known as 'The Australian Report ', found 'no reli- able evidence 'that homeopathy is effective. Despite being scienti cally flawed and highly inaccu- rate, the Australian Report is currently the most in fluential clinical research publication on homeopathy, having gener- ated damning headlines and been cited by decision-makersworldwide. In 2017 this trend of misreporting continued with publication of the European Academies 'Scienti c Advisory Council 's anti-homeopathy position statement, \"Homeopath- ic products and practices: assessing the evidence and ensuringconsistency in regulating medical claims in the EU \". Despite claiming to have based its conclusions on 'excellent science-based assessments already published by authoritative and impartial bodies ', the 'EASAC Statement ' quotes the infamously flawed Shang et al. meta-analysis published in 2005, a non-scienti c and widely criticised document produced by a UK Parliament Select Committee in 2010, and the 2015 Australian Report. In this session we will: review the key scienti cflaws in the NHMRC Overview Report and EASAC Statement; look atthe impact these publications have had on the homeopathyPresentation Abstracts Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 1/2020A7 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Severity of Radiodermatitis in Breast Cancer Patients with Preventive Treatment with an Homeopathic/ Integrative Protocol Compared with a Control Campo di Marte Hospital, Lucca, Italy Background: To deal with the adverse effects of anti- cancer treatment, the Homeopathic Clinic of Lucca, in collab-oration with the Oncology Department, has set up an Inte- grative Oncology Outpatient Unit in the Public Hospital Campo di Marte of Lucca (Italy). Aims: To present the results of homeopathy and complementary integrative medicine treatment targeted to-wards reducing the radiodermatitis and other adverse effects of radiotherapy (RT). Methods: This is a retrospective observational study conducted on 30 consecutive breast cancer patients under- going radiotherapy from September 2013 to December 2018.The severity of radiodermatitis was evaluated with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scale. One group was treated with Radium bromatum 6 CH before RT, then Belladonna 6 CH after RT, and also with local application of an alkalinizing agent and Calendula ointment. The control group of patients undergoing RTwithout integrative treatment used only standard care -keratoplastic ointments to promote tissue repair and healing. Results: The severity of radiodermatitis was evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the treatment; 17 patients with a homeopathic integrative protocol during RT were compared with a control group of 13 patients without treatment. Preliminary results show that 15 patients withintegrative treatment had G1, 1 patient had G2 and 1 patient had G3 toxicity. In the group of patients who did not receive complementary treatments, 5 patients had G1; 2 patients G2; 3 patients G3, opathy and complementary treatments allows for an effective response to the demand from cancer patients to reduce many side effects of anti-cancer therapies, in particular radioder- matitis due to RT, as well as to improve their quality of life.

Aims: To study the effect of homeopathic treatment on adult patients with atopic diseases who visited the Homeo- pathic Clinic of Lucca (Italy) and long-term evolution of thedisease over approximately an 8-year period.Materials and Methods: Data derive from an observa- tional longitudinal study carried out on 563 atopic adult patients who consecutively visited from 1998 to 2017: 202 (35.9%) suffered from atopic dermatitis, 204 (36.2%) fromallergic rhinitis, and 157 (27.9%) from asthma. Moreover, a long-term study was conducted on a subset of 45/104 adult patients with /C215 years follow-up, who consecutively visited from 2006 to 2012. The study also investigated the evolution of overall symptoms in patients with a complex atopicsymptomatology: that is, patients suffering with more than one atopic disease. The outcomes were evaluated according to ORIDL (Outcome in Relation to Impact on Daily Living). Statistical evaluation was conducted via Wilcoxon 's test applied to matched-pair samples, associated with a two-tailed signi - cance test. The most frequently prescribed remedies were: in asthma, Nat-s and Ars; had moderate or major improvement (71.1% with asthma as the primary disease; 69.8% rhinitis; 67.1% dermatitis). At re-evaluation after 5 complete remission of atopic symptoms was observedin 69.6% patients with more than one atopic disease at the rst visit were completely cured in 54.3% of cases. Conclusion: The results seem to con rm that homeo- pathic medicine produces positive therapeutic responses in atopic adults, and not only in paediatric atopic patients.

Subcutaneous Isopathic Immunotherapy of Allergic Asthma in of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran 2Standard Homeopathic Company, Los Angeles, California, United States 3Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran 4Immunology, Asthma and Allergy Research Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran Background and Aims: Allergen immunotherapy is a promising potential disease-modifying treatment for allergic patients. Subcutaneous immunotherapy is more effective than sublingual immunotherapy, but subcutaneous immu-notherapy is ineffective at a low dose, whereas at high doses it can result in an unacceptably prominent level of systemic reactions. Isopathy is one of the approaches of homeopathywhich means employing causative agents or products of a disease to treat the same disease. In the current study, we evaluated the ef cacy of subcutaneous isopathic immuno- therapy with high diluted ovalbumin (HD OVA) in the treat- ment of OVA-induced allergic asthma in BALB/c mice. Methods: All the experiments were conducted in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Protocol of Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran. HD OVA was prepared in 6C homeopathic centesimal potencies. During the rst week, BALB/c mice were sensitized with OVA and alum. Two weeks later, the mice received HD OVA subcutaneously on days 21, 22, 32 and on day 41 (eight hours after the last challenge) as the treatment. The mice were challenged with OVA (5%) aerosols on days 35,Presentation Abstracts Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 1/2020A8 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Results: bronchoalveolar fluid, allergen-speci c IgE and IL-4 production. It also insigni cant- ly increased the production of TGF- and speci c regulatory T cells population against the allergen. Conclusion: Such data suggest that subcutaneous iso- pathic immunotherapy may be a suitable candidate for the treatment of allergic asthma.

An Assessment of a Public Health Initiative of Homeopathy for Primary Institute India Background: A public health initiative, 'Homoeopathy for the Healthy Child ', was undertaken focusing promotion of healthy teething by provision of home-based care through pre-identi ed homeopathic medicines for complaints during primary teething. The paper reports the impact on teething and episodes of diarrhoea and upper respiratory tract infec-tion (URTI) in children. Methods: Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) were trained in child care and usage of a kit comprising six aged between 6 months to 1 year, and those who still had no teeth between the ages of 1 to 3 years, received CP. Home-based care for diarrhoea, URTI and mild fever was provided using the other ve medicines. Dentition pattern and diarrhoea/URTI episodes, as reported by parents to the ASHAs, were recorded for 12 months. Outcome assessed was change in dentition pattern, diarrhoea/URTIepisodes, and feedback by the ASHAs. Results: 11,426 children aged 6 months to 1 year, and 100 children aged 1-3 years with no teeth, were followed up for 12 months and dentition pattern was recorded. 0.255 proportion of children ( p<0.001) enrolled at 6 months, as compared to 0.039 enrolled at 12 months, had 6 teeth at 12 months. Incidence of diarrhoea showed progressive decline with Podophyllum orChamomilla ; likewise, Bella- observed thy as bene cial and 3 observed no effect; 12 did not respond.Conclusion: To our knowledge, there has previously been no study reporting dentition pattern in children after using CP. This program, with regular use of CP and home- based care with homeopathy and accepted by the communi-ty, opens avenues for further validation in studies using a comparator group.

Possible bene cial therapeutic strategies of the com- plex homeopathic treatment setting as a \"whole medical system \", such as therapeutic relationship, empathy, trigger- ing expectations, hope, use of suggestions and metaphors, resource activation, lifestyle advice, changing conventional medication and others, were reduced to experimental com-parators in the classical approach. Homeopathic observational and outcome studies un- der real medical life conditions have repeatedly shown thathomeopaths yield comparable effects to those of convention- al therapists, but with less conventional drugs exposure and often less costs. Those \"unspeci c effects \"are still a blind spot in the researcher 's eyes but may in fact be highly bene cial for patients and a resource for the health care system. Comparative effectiveness research (CER) strategies have been developed in the last decade to measure the extent to which an intervention, when deployed in the eld in routine circumstances, does what it is intended to do for a speci c population. CER methodology offers a wide range of research designs and advanced techniques, including prag- matic trials, cluster randomized trials, Bayesian approaches, observational research, and also registries. In addition, par- ticipatory stakeholder involvement is used to develop more practically relevant research questions, designs and out-comes. CER is a research strategy that would help homeo- paths to better investigate and present its bene ts and advantages under real life conditions, including the contri-bution of \"unspeci c effects \". Advantages and disadvantages of this approach will be presented and discussed. Keywords: Comparative effectiveness research, home- opathy, outcome studies, pragmatic studies A027. Cutting Edge Research -What are the Priorities for Clinical Research and Evaluation for Homeopathy to Become a Valued Part of the Integrative Medicine Model?Elizabeth Thompson 1 1National Centre for Integrative Medicine, Bristol, United Kingdom Integrative Medicine is a model of healthcare which combines conventional, lifestyle and holistic approaches,informed by high-quality evidence, to improve health and wellbeing. Homeopathic researchers can struggle to get ethical approval to deliver trials of homeopathic interven- tions and create the kind of evidence that will allow it to become part of this growing movement for change in healthcare across the globe. Dr Thompson will review the politics of homeopathic research and share her experience of designing, running andpublishing a range of clinical evaluation and research studies. Within the healing model that underpins homeopathic theo- ry and practice, the challenge remains to identify underlying mechanisms for the action homeopathic dilutions and their speci c effects which we aim to identify within a placebo- controlled trial. Dr Thompson will discuss how an under- standing of complexity, models of healing and local or entanglement effects, is key to designing research in complex interventions and to test the hypothesis that homeopathy can stimulate self-regulating responses to build resilience. This presentation will contribute to an overarching question about the direction of travel needed to activate high- quality global homeopathy research programmes.

Safety and Ef cacy Individualised Homeopathic Treatment in Sciatica -a Phase I Pre-Post Comparison Study Aaron Ka Lun To 1, Yvonne Fok1 1Hong Kong Association of Homeopathy, Hong Kong Background: Cochrane reviews in 2008 and 2016 both showed that the ef cacy of NSAIDs in sciatica for pain reduc- tion and disability were comparable to placebo. A systematic review in 2011 failed to show any long-term bene tf r o m surgery after 1 -2 years. We developed a set algorithm for individualized homeopathic treatment, which can potentially contribute to the reproducibility of the method. The algorithmwas developed based on the principles of classical repertori- zation of local and general symptoms and differential diagno- sis of 10 commonly used remedies in sciatica. Objectives: A phase I trial of a set of algorithms for sciatica is being conducted, in which the primary objective isto compare the difference in the pain intensity of sciatica patients at baseline, day 3, day 7 and at 1 month. The secondary objectives include comparing the effects on acute, sub-acute and chronic sciatica, documenting the frequency and direction of any modi cation of the standardized dosage regimen, any aggravation, adverse event, or rescue medica- tions used. An RCT focusing rst on acute sciatica will be done when these data are available, and the potential for further studies in chronic cases will be revealed. The data from thestudy will be able to provide more information about the effect size and dosage regimen for a more sensitive RCT design. Methods: A prospective observational single group pre-post comparison study is being carried out from April 2018 to April 2019. The pain score pre- and post- treatment will be compared to baseline using paired t-test (Normal distribution) or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (non-Normal).Comparison with relevant controls in other studies will be referred in the discussion. Results: In the data updated in January 2019, 42 participants had been recruited and 34 (81%) of them had nished the follow up at day 7. 64.5% of them reported improvement/signi cant improvement. The most commonly indicated remedies were Rhus toxicodendron ,Colocynthis and Lycopodium clavatum , representing 45.2% of 16.7% of the subjects had reported an aggravation; 2.4% had reported the use of rescue medications. The nal results are due in May 2019. Keywords: Homeopathy, sciatica, individualized, algorithm A029.

Scores were developed toidentify experimental techniques with most reliable outcomes. Results: We identi ed 134 publications of suf cient reporting quality to be analysed in detail. These publications described 203 experiments. Less than 25% used blinding and/ or randomisation, and about one third used adequate controlsto identify speci c effects of homeopathic preparations. The most promising techniques used so far are NMR relaxation, spectroscopy and electrical impedance measurements. Inthese three areas, several sets of replicated high-quality experiments provide evidence for speci c physicochemical properties of homeopathic preparations. Conclusions: For future experiments, we generally recommend using succussed controls, or comparing differenthomeopathic preparations with each other to reliably identi- fy any speci c physicochemical properties. Further in-depth analysis of the experiments is necessary to explore different hypotheses regarding a possible mode of action of potentised remedies.

Use of Papaver somniferum and Arnica montana in Ultra-diluted Form to Assist in Anesthesia Recovery and asAnalgesia for Dogs having Undergone Ovariohysterectomy David Ronald Travagin 1, Cid\u00e9li Coelho2,3 1Integrated S\u00e3o Paulo (SP), Brazil 3HD Science School, S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul (SP), Brazil Ovariohysterectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in veterinary surgery. The objectivewas to assess the effects of using Papaver somniferum 200 cH and Arnica montana 30 cH in the recovery room and as a postoperative analgesia in dogs that had undergone an ovariohysterectomy. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the IntegratedUniversity Center (No. 2124/2017). A total of 40 dogs were considered ASA I (American Anesthesiology Association) after physical and laboratory examinations, and were randomly divided into four groups: Arnica ,Papaver , hydroalcoholic and physiological solution, receiving 4 drops of each treatment every 10 minutes over a period of 1 hour. Anesthesia recovery time (in minutes), as well as the duration of the postoperative analgesia (in hours), was measured using the modi ed Glasgow scale. Heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure and rectal tempera-ture were also evaluated during the recovery period. The study was blinded. The data was analyzed using ANOVA, followed by the Tukey test, with p<0.05 considered a statistically signi cant difference. ThePapaver -treated group recovered from anesthesia Arnica group re- others /C63.6 h): (6.6/C60.9 h), hydroalcoholic (4.1 /C60.9 h); p/C200.05. There were no statistically signi cant differences among the other physio- logical parameters. Thendings of this study coincide with other studies in the literature. It was concluded that Papaver 200 cH is effective in accelerating anesthesia recovery time in dogs and that Arnica 30 cH can be an alternative in the protocol for acute pain management in these animals.

The last reviews ofthis research eld were published in 2009/2011. Due to recent developments in the eld, an update is warranted. Publications on plant-based test systems were to be analysed with regard to publication quality, reproducibility and po- tential for further research. Methods: A literature search was conducted in online databases and speci c journals, including publications from 2008 to 2017 dealing with plant-based test systems in homeopathic basic research. To be included, they had to contain statistical analysis and ful l quality criteria according to a pre-de ned manuscript information score (MIS), ranging from 0 -10. Publications scoring at least ve points were included. They were analysed for use of adequate controls,outcome and reproducibility. Results: 74 publications on plant-based test systems were found. 26 reached an MIS of 5 or higher. Adequate controls were used in 13 of these publications. All of them reported on specic effects of homeopathic preparations. The publication quality is still varied: a substantial number of publications (23%) did not adequately document the methods used. Four reported on replication trials. One replication trial found effects of homeopathic preparations comparable to the original study; three replication trials failed to con rm the original study but identi ed possible external in fluencing factors. Five publica- tions described novel test systems. Eight trials used systematic negative control experiments to investigate test system stability. Conclusions: Quality of publications has increased continuously in the period investigated. Regarding researchdesign, future trials should implement adequate controls to identify speci c effects of homeopathic preparations and include systematic negative control experiments to docu- ment test system stability. Further external and internal reproduction trials, and control of in fluencing factors, are needed to verify results. Keywords: Homeopathy, plant-based test systems, review A032.

Vladimir Voeikov1, Alexander Konovalov2 1Lomonosov Moscow State University, Faculty of Biology, Moscow, Russia 2Arbuzov Institute of Organic and Physical Chemistry, Kazan Scienti c Centre RAS, Kazan, Russia One of the major claims against homeopathy is that ultra-high dilutions (UHDs) of biologically active substances are identical to a pure solvent and therefore cannot possessbiological activity. Thus, it is necessary to nd out if UHDs differ from the solvent in their physical-chemical properties. Recently revolutionary discoveries concerning the propertiesof aqueous systems with \"normal \"concentrations of solutes, as well as of UHDs prepared from them, were made. Contrary to the current opinion that solutions are homogenous systems, it turned out that sub-micrometer \"domains \", consisting of both solute and solvent molecules, emerge after dissolution of solutes in water. Upon dilution, even to ultra-high degrees, sub-micrometer structures do not disappear; on the contrary, their size usually increases. These structures in UHDs -called \"nano-associates\" (NAs) by Konovalov -are negatively charged; their and sizes change non-monotonically with serial dilutions. Pat- terns of NA parameters correlate with biological effects produced by UHDs. Shielding of UHDs from ambient electro- magnetic elds (EMF) prevents NA emergence in UHDs; paradoxical properties differentiating them from pure water,including biological activity, also disappear. Therefore, aque-ous systems containing domains and NAs (in UHDs non- shielded from EMF) should be considered disperse systems rather than classical solutions. Emergence of domains and NAs in them represents the process of self-organization, turning them into dissipative non-equilibrium entities. Dynamic structuring of aqueous disperse systems with charge separation in them is provided by energy supplied by environmental EMF and redox reac- tions, with the participation of reactive oxygen speciespermanently proceeding in aqueous systems. We propose that newly discovered properties of UHDs, representing disperse systems of a \"water in water \" type, prove that they are basically different from a pure solvent, af rming that homeopathy elec- tromagnetic eld Prevalence and Likelihood Ratio of Six Common Objective Homeopathic Signs in Patients Responding to Muriatic medicines -Multicentre Prospective Observational Study Silvia Eizayaga3 Medical Association (APH), S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil 2Independent researcher, The Netherlands 3Department of Homeopathy, Maimonides University, Buenos Aires, Argentina Assessment of prevalence and likelihood ratio (LR) of symptoms in responders to speci c homeopathic medicines appears currently to be the best scienti c method to con rm or rule out guiding indicators for such medicines. The aim of the present study is to assess these parameters for 6 common objective homeopathic signs, believed to be indicators of muriatic medicines. Each of these signs was de ned in advance. Their presence was assessed in every new consecutive patient by 8 homeopathic physicians in 3 different countries. This patient group was considered asthe control population. The target population consisted of patients respond- ing to a muriatic homeopathic medicine. Patients were considered as responders when ful lling all the following criteria: more than 3 months of treatment with only onehomeopathic muriatic medicine; no other intervention dur- ing this period; ORIDL score \u00fe2 or higher (as assessed by the patients themselves); and the physician 's impression that clinical improvement was attributable to the medicine. The same signs were assessed in this population. Up to the time of writing, 52 responders to a muriatic medicine, 39 of whom received Natrum-mur , were compared to 846 controls. LR signi cantly higher than 1 was found in 3 of the signs (LR; 95% con dence interval): cracked lips herpes (1.96; 1.08 to 3.55); and skin eruptions on the frontal hairline (2.44; 1.42 to 4.18). In the Natrum-mur sub-group, which exhibited similar results to those overall, a fourth sign showed LR >1: dry palms (1.89; 1.08 to 3.30). The remaining 2 signs, accentuated substernal fossa and geographic tongue, could not be associated to the responding population. Conclusions: 3 of the 6 assessed homeopathic signs could be associated to muriatic homeopathic one speci cally to Natrum muriaticum , by using a relatively simple, fast and conservative protocol.

A New Area of Scienti c Validation of Homeopathy: Systems Theory Peter Adams1 1Stroud Natural Health Clinic, United Kingdom Homeopathy is gradually receiving scienti c valida- tion. But there is an area of science where validation is available, and which is currently not being considered. There are remarkable parallels between the homeo- pathic principles of health and disease and complex systems theory. The law of cure, the value of symptoms, organisms ' optimisation of their responses and other homeopathic prin- ciples can be derived from systems theory and cybernetics.These remarkable correlations provide extra scienti c sup- port for homeopathy and new ways of looking at some long- established homeopathic principles. They can also help to lead orthodox medicine to a new understanding of health and illness based on systems science. Keywords: Systems science, scienti c validation, cybernetics P002. Suppression Gustavo Aguilar-Velazquez 1 1Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico A recent literature review provided a number of studies with experimental information to support the phe- nomenon of suppression proposed by homeopathy. This phenomenon states that when a treatment is focused onlytowards local symptomatology, it may deepen the disease originating mental symptoms. Since the in flammation pro- cess could help understand the suppression phenomenon, this article will describe it in detail. Experimental studies reveal that in flammation is a cyclic process that does not end when the in flammatory stimulus disappears, but when spe- cic mechanisms stop this process in order to return to homeostasis. For example, in flammatory cells can change their enzymatic systems from pro-in flammatory to anti- inflammatory, producing molecules called lipoxins and re- solvins. Such molecules cease in flammation, generating anti- inflammatory mediators, promoting the exit of phagocytes from in flammation sites, eliminating chemokines and repair. flammatory drugs (sup- pression) to stop in flammation may with this physiological process, continuing with pro-in cytokine IL-1, IL-6, and INF-, which activate receptors in the hypothalamus. Once these are released in the brain, they affect neural circuits that regulate behavior. The presence of these molecules decreases the availability of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, increasing their re-uptake and stopping their synthesis by inducing the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygen-ase, which breaks tryptophan, a precursor of these amines. The events mentioned can cause signi cant emotional changes found in clinical depression, for instance -so much so it has been observed that the severity of depression is propor- tional to these cytokine levels. This mechanism couldsupport the phenomenon where by suppression of physical symptoms causes the appearance of mental symptoms, given that the suppression of a local in flammatory process is not solved at its origin.

Aspirin: From High Doses to High Dilutions -A Historical Critical Review and New Proposals Adalberto von Ancken 1, Francisco Brazil 2Universidade de Maim\u00f3nides, Argentina Platelets and vessel walls interact to retain blood flow homeostasis during in flammatory conditions. Rebound ef- fects of anti-thrombotic agents, such as prostanoids and COXinhibitors can lead to thrombosis, infarct and stroke. Aspirin has been prescribed for decades due to its powerful anti- platelet action, but it is also related to withdrawal syndromepeaks, resistance and thrombogenesis. Moreover, other para- doxical effects have also been described. A single high dose of aspirin can generate thrombus eight to ten days later; how- ever, highly diluted aspirin can also produce the same effect in one hour, by unknown pathways, though it is known thathigh dilutions of aspirin can reduce PGI2 activity. Additional- ly, aspirin anti-thrombotic effects are also reversed by its high dilutions. Despite the fact that COX-2 selective inhibition and highly diluted aspirin have pro-thrombotic properties, the simultaneous administration of both does not further in-crease thrombus formation. Metabolic changes in platelets, rebound effect, delayed inhibition of COX-2 and residual endothelial aspirin accumulation are plausible hypotheses, since these patterns lead to the concept of hormesis. However, other elds of investigation, such as the characterization of nanostructures and electronic eld properties of high dilu- tions, have not been studied yet for aspirin. Further studies involving the participation of COX-2 in macrophages, and thedescription of high dilution physicochemical properties and their putative relationships, are promising areas for follow-up in this subject.

High Dilution Medicine in the Treatment of Separation Anxiety in Dogs: A Descriptive Brazil Separation anxiety in dogs causes great distress, which leads to many clinical symptoms. Homeopathy diag- noses susceptibilities in sick individuals and treats them globally with a single medicine through the law of similarity, according to Samuel Hahnemann 's unicism. The aim of this study was to quantify the behavioural changes seen in dogstreated with a high dilution medicine for separation anxiety. The demographic pro les of the dogs and their changes in cortisol levels during treatment were also to be documented.By means of a qualitative questionnaire lled in by their owners, 23 dogs diagnosed with separation anxiety were selected and repertorized according to classical homeopathy and treated with verum high dilution medicine or placebo, besides blood collection. On the 30th day, dogs were reap-praised and could undergo changes in their medicines and potencies. On the 60th day a new blood sample was collected for comparison. The pharmacist was responsible for random- izing and dispensing verum medicine or placebo. In the verum group, 11 dogs (68.75%) were classi ed as having received effective treatment. There was no signi cant differ- ence in cortisol levels between the groups ( p<0.05). The mean age of the dogs was 4 years and 7 months, and destructiveness was the most common clinical symptom. Most of the dogs were male, mixed breed, not neutered,living with a couple without children, hyper-attached to theirPresentation Abstracts Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 1/2020A13 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Though it is possible to conclude that high-dilution medicine was able to modify dogs 'behaviour, and as a feasible alterna- tive to separation anxiety treatment, it is not possible toconclude any connection between high-dilution medicine and cortisol. Homeopathic Treatment for Modifying Anger and BloodPressure in Patients with Essential Hypertension - Comparison Against Standard Care Treatment Leena Bagadia 1,2 1Maharashtra University of Chandaben M. Patel Homeopathic Medical College, India Background: Hypertension (HT) is the most perva- sive disease worldwide, causing multiple chronic condi-tions without apparent symptoms. Global burden of disease is extremely high due to HT. The Framingham study tells us that about 90% of people after the age of 65 years have a lifetime risk of developing HT. The aetiology of hypertension is various and complex, involving both ge-netic and behavioural factors. More and more people experience increased anger, anxiety and depression brought on by globalization, cultural changes, socioeco-nomic changes, and stress at the work place. Anger is a critical contributing factor in essential hypertension (EHT). In our research, we tried to correlate anger with EHT and to treat anger -and thus the level of hypertension -with homeopathic simillimum. Objectives: 1. To investigate the relationship between level of anger and level of hypertension. 2. To evaluate the safety and ef cacy of homeopathic treat- ment on anger -and thereby on blood pressure (BP) -in comparison with standard care treatment forhypertension. Methods: 300 patients with EHTwere screened, 172 of whom (108 men, 64 women) were enrolled after informed, voluntary consent. They were divided into two equal groups by simple randomisation. After thorough case-taking, all patients were advised regarding DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), life-style modi cation and anti-hyper- tensives, as per individual requirements. The STAXI-2 scale was applied to measure anger at the beginning and after six months 'study period. One group was kept on placebo and the other on individualised homeopathic medicine. Regular fol- low-up was every two weeks. Data generated was analysed by SPSS v.21. Results: Except state anger and its components, all other variables of anger, as well as systolic and diastolic BP,were remarkably reduced ( p<0.001) by homeopathy. Also, 89% of patients in the homeopathy group experienced relief in the symptoms of co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, gastro-esophageal re flux dis- order and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. Standardcare with anti-hypertensives had little impact on anger or the general psychopathology of patients, and had no effect on co- morbidities. Conclusion: The patients treated with individualised homeopathic treatment showed statistically signi cant im-provement in anger and hypertension, and also showed notable relief in the symptoms of co-morbidities.

It includes both clinical observations of potentized medicines and also observations of the actions of potentized medicines on healthy subjects (provings). Thisstudy was undertaken to determine the degree to which observations within the materia medica could be correlated with the physiological mechanisms for thyroid inhibiting substances in their undiluted state. Method: Four of the most speci c symptoms for iodine de ciency were selected to describe the hypothyroid state. Symptom representation for the four selected symp- toms within the homeopathic materia medica was compared for two halogen inhibitors, for three substances which in flu- ence thyroid hormone target tissues, for six substancesknown or suspected to increase thyroid stimulating hormone or decrease thyroid hormone levels, and for eleven substances not known to inhibit thyroid activity. To avoid knowledgebias, only those compilations of materia medica whose publication dates preceded the discoveries of crucial aspects of thyroid physiology were used as source materials for investigation. Result: Homeopathic medicines derived from 11 sub- stances with mechanisms for inhibition of thyroid activity were more likely to exhibit selected symptoms than the medicines derived from the 11 substances without known physiological mechanisms for thyroid inhibition. The differ- ence between groups was analyzed via the Mann-Whitneynon-parametric U test and was statistically signi cant to p<0.01. After observations obtained from provings alone were removed from analysis, the difference between groups of clinical symptoms remained signi cant to p<0.01. Only the two halogen inhibitors of iodine (bromine and fluoric acid) and one in fluencer of thyroid hormone target tissue (calcium carbonate) were signi cantly goitrogenic. Conclusion: With respect to thyroid inhibition, there is a signi cant correlation between observations recorded within the homeopathic materia medica and the purportedphysiological mechanisms for the substances.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. patients. This research aims to investigate the extent of, rationale for, as well as strengths and challenges associated with, telemedicine-based consulting by homeopaths and naturopathic doctors in active clinical practice. Methods: Using a census-based approach, state-regu- lated homeopaths ( n\u00bc502) and naturopathic doctors (n\u00bc1502) in Ontario, Canada were surveyed using the online Qualtrics survey tool. Survey questions captured de- mographic and socio-economic data of respondents as well asopinions regarding respondents 'motivations behind tele- medicine use. Results: The survey is ongoing with a current response rate for the homeopathy email respondents of over 30%, and over 60% of homeopaths reporting having performed a homeopathic consultation with a patient using face-to-face online video in the past 6 months. Preliminary analysis indicates that for respondents who reported telemedicineuse, the average percentage of their practice devoted to face- to-face online video was approximately 20%. In contrast, approximately 35% of naturopaths who have responded to date reported having performed a consultation with a patient using online video in the past 6 months, with approximately10% of their practice devoted to online video consultations. Conclusions: Face-to-face online video appears to be used by a majority of homeopaths in Ontario, Canada. Ontario homeopaths are nearly twice as likely to engage in online video consultations as naturopaths. Future analysis of thedata will explore the motivations behind telemedicine use amongst homeopaths and naturopaths in Ontario as well as any demographic or socio-economic factors in fluencing tele- medicine usage.

Bonamin1 1Postgraduate Program in Environmental and Pathology of Paulista University UNIP, Brazil 2Paulista University, UNIP, Brazil 3DiagnOx Laboratory, Cherwell Innovation Centre, United Kingdom Introduction: Homeopathy is a recognized science throughout the world, but the lack of knowledge about its mechanism of action still renders it controversial. Currently,several theories are proposed, one of which is that speci c electromagnetic elds of the solvents can convey information to biological systems, from the diluted raw material. Recently,the use of solvatochromic dyes has been proposed to identify changes in the solvent dipole moment, along successive dilutions, by solute interference. The present research pro- poses the evaluation of the dielectric activity of homeopathic drugs by means of the absorbance curve obtained by differentsolvatochromic dyes, using ranging from 6 to 200 cH (as well as the controls: pure water, dynamized pure water and vehicle [30% ethanol solution]),were analyzed by the solvatochromic dye method to establish an absorbance curve. The dyes used were: ET33, BDN and Violet Methylene. The analysis was performed in a FEMTO spectrophotometer (Brazil), with high sensitivity for optical density variations and with a wavelength scan of at least 1nm. All samples were analyzed in triplicate and the resultswere evaluated by one-way ANOVA and Tukey 's post-test, with Results: tested of Antimonium crudum 120 cH and Phosphorus 30 cH showed an increase in the peak of absorbance of Methylene Violet, but not the other dyes. On the other hand, only Antimonium crudum 30 cH showed an increase in the absorbance of the ET33 dye. The analyses of other samples, potencies and dyes are still in progress. Conclusions: Preliminary results indicate that varia- tion of different solvatochromic dyes might be useful in the characterization of different potencies of homeopathic med-icines, according to changes in the peak of absorbance ob- tained in the visible light electrical Dilutions of cinale 1Department Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India Background and Aim: Symphytum of cinale (SO) root and leaf extracts are used as a remedy for bone fracturehealing, anti-in flammation, and also prescribed clinically in high dilution as a homeopathic medicine.

The objective of this study was to characterize SO mother tincture (SOMT), 6c, 30c and 200c, and to and osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells. Methods: Physico-chemical of SO were studied with high resolution liquid chromatogram mass spectrometer (HRLCMS), nuclear magnetic resonance scanning electron microscopy (TEM).

Homeopathic Immunotherapy against Cancer Eneida Brazil 2Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Brazil Introduction: Our research team at Federal University has studied, in vitro and in vivo , cancer cells treated with homeopathy in the last 20 years. After using different prod-ucts and analysing the different results carefully, we arrived at two complexes produced with homeopathic techniques, coded as M1 and M8. The results obtained using these twoproducts were surprising and some were published in scien- tic journals with good impact. Methods and Results: The most appropriate and di- verse methodology was used, with several controls: Confocal, Histochemistry, Electron Microscopy, Flow Cytometry, SlideScanner, Matrigel matrix invasion, ImageJ software, etc. Our studies, in vitro and in vivo , have demonstrated that the medicines M1 and M8: prevented lung and subcutaneous melanoma growth; decreased angiogenesis inside tumors (p<0.01); decreased some extracellular matrix molecules, such as perlecan and hyaluronic acid, decreasing metastasis (in Transwell plates, p<0.01); activated macrophages, that can activate other cells in the immune system as well as endothelial cells and broblasts; modulated cytokines such as TNF IL10; increased the differentiation of NK cells (in flow cytometer, p<0.001) but reactive (NO) production. Conclusions: M1 and M8 are homeopathic complex medicines with immunomodulatory without tox- icity or mutagenic effects. This homeopathic immunotherapy can gently restore the immune system to recognize tumor cells; thus, they can be used to help in all cancer immune-phenotypes without acting on a speci c molecular target and without toxicity, since the self-healing is stimulated through the immune system. However, the absence of clinical trials has limited their extensive use in cancer immunotherapy, despite the promising results in vitro as well as in vivo . Moreover, because in homeopathy we do not have a molecule to track, there is an impediment to further progress with these medicines without greater understanding of their physiological mechanism of action.

Homeopathic Treatment of Psoriasis: Series Francisco and Aims: Psoriasis is a chronic disease frequently treated in homeopathic practice. However, there is only one prospective uncontrolled multi-centric study pub- lished, with 2 years of follow-up. The aim of this paper is to evaluate retrospectively the treatment results of patientswith psoriasis in the Department of Homeopathy of Univer- sidad Maimonides. Methods: The totality of cases of psoriasis who at- tended the Homeopathic clinic was searched. Forms were created and examined with EpiInfo software. Evaluated out- comes: type of psoriasis, severity, presence of arthritic psori- asis, prescription criteria, homeopathic remedy used, skin outcome, presence of aggravation, outcome of psoriatic ar- thritis, safety of the treatment. Follow-up was evaluated for 1 year. Patients without at least 1 follow-up visit were excludedfrom analysis.Results: A total of 94 patients presented a clinical record of psoriasis: 49 returned once for follow-up and 18 had follow-up visits up to and including one year. Plaque psoriasis was 86% and guttate psoriasis represented 14%. Psoriaticarthritis was present in 15% of the cases. The predominant criteria for prescription was the totality of symptoms and the most frequently prescribed potency the 6 cH. A small or large improvement in psoriasis was observed in 57% of the patients at the second consultation and in 64.7% of the patients after 1year of treatment. The most frequently used remedies were Sulphur, Lycopodium, Pulsatilla and Arsenicum album , but the variation was high. Four of 6 patients with arthritis reportedto be better at the second consultation, but only 2 of 6 after one year of treatment. No serious adverse events were observed. Conclusions: Homeopathic treatment of psoriasis, in- cluding psoriatic arthritis, appears to be safe and to havesome positive outcome. Prospective controlled trials should aim to verify these results. Keywords: Homeopathy, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis P012. Ef cacy of Homeopathic Herd Health Management in Antibiotic Resistant Dairy Cattle in Northern Spain Mar\u00eda Fernandez Portales 1 1International Association for Veterinary Homeopathy and Veterinary College of Asturias, Spain Background: Milk yield in dairy farms worldwide has improved due to advances in genetics, feeding and cattlehandling. Maximum yields lead to stress and immunosup- pression of the animal, having to rely heavily on antibiotics to preserve health. Consequently, there is an ever-increasing level of antibiotic resistance and chronic disease in dairy farms. Objectives: To demonstrate the effectiveness of home- opathy-based treatments in dairy farms with above average disease incidence and antibiotic resistance. Study Design: Longitudinal, observational, and prospective. Methods: The study was conducted in three Holstein farms (average: 25 animals/farm) in semi-extensive systems, fed concentrated feed, silage and pasture. The measured variable was SCC (somatic cell count per millilitre), taken from the milk tank every 48 hr. and analysed with SPSS software. The cut-off number for an acceptable sample was SCC250. From 2013 to 2015 the animals were treated individ- ually with classical homeopathy, and from 2015 until 2017 a preventative homeopathy herd health program was imple-mented. Choice of treatment program was based on disease aetiology in each herd, blood work, and SCC. Treatment administration was the Plus Method (3 pills/125 ml of mineral water) of 6, 30 or 200 cH potency. Administration route was P.O. or in concentrated feed. Results: Prior to homeopathy treatment (2007 -2013), only 22%, 25% and 27% of the samples from each farm had an SCC below 250. Once homeopathy treatment was started(2013-2017), these farms reached 66%, 56% and 46% (respec- tively) of days with SCC below 250. Main Limitations: Lack of proper assessment by the farmer and sub-optimal nutrition. Conclusions: When comparing treatments in dairy farms, homeopathy is more effective at keeping SCC below the 250 threshold.

Physicochemical Characterization of Dynamized 1Research and Development Laboratory of Integrative and Complementary Practices, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 2Brazilian Center for Physical Research, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 3Institute of Macromolecules Professor Eloisa Mano, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil Homeopathic medicine is de ned as the pharmaceu- tical form obtained by the method of dilutions followed bysuccessive succussions or crushing. Clinical homeopathic results have proven the ef cacy of these drugs by different experimental models. However, with regard to the dynamics of solid systems, scienti c knowledge is still very undeveloped. In this context, in 2013, a Multicentric Project (Brazil- Italy) was started with the objective of expanding the studies of this system using dynamized solid systems prepared with metallic zinc in lactose (ZnMet). In this way, the present work evaluated the physical-chemical and structural changes re-sulting from the trituration process. The X-ray diffraction results indicated no changes in the crystalline structure of the lactose after the grinding process and also the presence of the zinc signal in the rst potency (ZnMet 1dH). Evaluation of differential exploratory calorimetry data shows that both the presence of zinc and the dynamiza- tion process alter the enthalpy values of the solid system as well as the dehydration temperature. In the Raman spectros-copy analysis, the amplitude and area of ZnMet (3 dH and 6 dH) samples were observed, especially in the region with the highest truss vibration (from 200 cm /C01to 500 cm/C01). In the infrared spectroscopy analyses, a decrease in signal intensity due to the dynamization process and thepresence of zinc was observed, suggesting the formation of a complex between the metal and lactose. The scanning elec- tron microscopy evaluation showed small particles with rough appearance on the lactose surface, indicating the adsorption of zinc to lactose. This set of results suggests that the presence of zinc and the grinding process alter the enthalpy, polarization and vibration of chemical bonds of the dynamized solid system, and these methodologies are sensitive enough to characterize these homeopathic systems.

The present study examined the feasibility of a homeopathic consultation andtreatment program, provided as part of an integrative oncol- ogy service. Methods: The electronic medical les of patients undergoing a homeopathic consultation in an integrative oncology service clinic were examined retrospectively. Ad-herence to the homeopathic treatment regimen and per- ceived response to the treatment were evaluated. Results: Theles of 124 patients (34 males, 90 fe- males) were examined, of which two-thirds reported acquir- ing and self-administering the homeopathic remedy asprescribed, and nearly three-quarters reporting a bene cialeffect. Adherence to the homeopathic treatment regimen was greatest among patients attending a second visit, as opposed to having only telephone/e-mail follow-up ( p<0.005). An association was found between a perceived bene cial effect of treatment with attending a follow-up visit p\u00bc0.04), female gender ( p\u00bc0.02), p\u00bc0.048), diagnosis of breast cancer ( p\u00bc0.014), and current radiation treatment (vs. chemotherapy; p\u00bc0.003). Patients reporting chemo- therapy-induced peripheral neuropathy were to report a bene cial effect ( p\u00bc0.004), as were female patients reporting hot flashes ( p\u00bc0.005) and those referred by an oncologist ( p\u00bc0.046). No adverse effects were attrib- uted to homeopathic treatment. Conclusions: Homeopathy can be incor- porated within a supportive care integrative oncology ser- vice. In addition to demographic and cancer-related characteristics, as well as symptoms, patients attending asecond visit (vs. only telephone/e-mail follow-up) were more likely to adhere to and perceive a bene cial effect from the homeopathic regimen.

Individualized Homeopathic Treatment in Women with Recurrent Cystitis: A Retrospective Case Series Katharina Gaertner 1 1University of Bern, Institute of Complementary and Integrative Medicine, Switzerland Background: Approximately 13% of women develop recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) in their lifetime. Most clinicians are faced with repeated and long-term ad- ministration of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This leads, however, to increased presence of drug-resistant bac-teria and the disruption of normal levels of intestinal and vaginal flora and might lead to persistent infections and/or damage of the urinary tract. A new strategy is therefore warranted. Methods:Design: Case series of all patients treated with indi- vidualised homeopathy (iHOM) for rUTI at the Institute of Complementary Medicine, IKOM, at the University of Bern, Switzerland. Subjects: Four females, aged 30 -79. Observation time: November 2013 to August 2018. Analysis: Frequency of UTI and of antibiotic (AB) treatment were documented in the patients 'les. Addition- ally, treatment outcomes were assessed retrospectively in a validated questionnaire on Impact on Daily Living (ORIDL). Results: The frequency of UTI and the need for AB reduced from at least monthly to less than 3 times a year. Three of the four women had no cystitis and related intake ofAB for more than 2 years. In two of these patients, a relapse of symptoms could be treated ef ciently with a repetition of the same homeopathic remedy. The subjective outcome assess- ments of all patients was reported positive. Three patients appraised major improvement for the main complaint. Discussion: The treatment options for rUTI are limited and not always successful. Within this case series a new approach, iHOM, results in a positive outcome, both objec- tively (by reducing the frequency of UTI and the amount of AB courses) and subjectively as per patients 'assessments. Conclusion: The evolution of the disease in the analysed patients suggests that iHOM might be a reasonable approach for the treatment of rUTI. It should be further investigated with prospective open-label and controlled studies.

Analysing the Con flict between Biomedicine and Homeopathy Joanne Greenland1 1The Aurum Project, Brookvale NSW, Australia The broad objective of this research project is to understand con flict and con flict management and to apply that knowledge to the con flict between biomedicine and homeopathy. My presentation examines a variety of theoret-ical frameworks around con flict. Initially examining con flict as a topic and its historical role in war and politics alongside new strategies used currently, I bring to light an understand-ing of con flict in general. Using the perspective of Gandhi 's non-violent resistance, Clausewitz 's strategy on war, Machia- velli 's political strategic considerations and Sun Tzu 'sA r to f War, I disclose how con flict has been managed historically, what strategies have been used to succeed and what mistakeshave resulted in defeat. I have chosen to study military and political con flict strategies because biomedicine currently has the power to marginalise other therapeutic approaches, such as homeopathy, using strategies usually reserved for war and politics. Through the available body of information from the NHMRC report, I will disclose how orthodox medicine is using its dominant position to write reports and make claims as a mechanism of exclusion, a strategic plan to marginalise homeopathy. I will look at the strategies used by orthodoxmedicine to gain dominance and the de ciency of homeo- pathy 's approach culminating in its lost position. Homeopathy fundamentally challenges the implicit assumption of biomedicine (that disease is to be fought) with its intrinsic principle of symptom similarity. Ironically, vac- cination sits as a centerpiece expression of this principle. From my own experience as a homeopath I suggest the Law of Similars as a mechanism for con flict resolution. Conclusions drawn from this investigation may pro- vide novel approaches to con flict resolution and a theoretical framework where rapprochement between biomedicine and homeopathy may be possible.

Understanding the Extent and Diversity of Homeopathic Practice in The broad objective of this project is to understand the extent and diversity of professional homeopathic practice in Australia. A snapshot of clinical practice taken over an eight-week period is reported. The demographics of patients, con- ditions treated, and remedy prescriptions are studied. This pilot study is approved through the Ethics Committee process. Informed consent is obtained by both the homeopath and the patients in their practices. The data tool used to collect patientdata, HomeoStats , is an online interface allowing homeopaths to enter limited information about their patients for the study. Data added included patients ': age, gender, ethnicity, place of birth and current residence, presenting condition(s) as de ned by the International Classi cation of Primary Care-II, and remedy and potency prescribed. All the patient data is de- identi ed at the point of collection. The population of homeo- paths in Australia is an unknown number. The industry is unregulated. However, the Australian Register of Homoeo- paths (ARoH) is a self-regulating body de ning minimum standard of practice for homeopaths in Australia. Registrationwith ARoH is used as an essential requirement for homeopaths to participate in this study. The total population of ARoH members is 513 at the start of the survey. The project 's secondary aims include practitioner education and researchupskilling through the use of Practitioner Based Research Networks. The primary aim of these networks is to engage practitioners to increase their skills in research and transfer learning into clinical practice, contributing to an increase in capacity for homeopathy in Australia.

Whilst biases affecting the reliability of repertory rubrics are now betterunderstood, biases associated with the actual decision-mak- ing process are still under-researched. Objectives: \u0081To identify and explain the main biases affecting decision making in homeopathic practice. \u0081To illustrate the role that decision support systems can play in reducing these biases. Methods: The literature on heuristics and biases that can affect decision-making was searched. Those deemed relevant for decision-making in homeopathic practice were identi ed. The role that a clinical decision support system (Vithoulkas Compass ) can play in minimizing the identi ed biases was assessed. Outcomes: The role and implications of the availability heuristic, the representativeness heuristic, the anchoring heuristic as well as con rmation bias will be explained. Repertory software and decision support systems are impor- tant tools for improving the quality of homeopathic decision- making. The most important proposed and illustrated inno- vations are: 1. Prompts about potential biases during the symptom selec- tion process. 2. Visualization of the prevalence (base rate) of the selected symptoms in the general patient population during the decision process. 3. Prompts during the differential diagnosis not to exclude a particular remedy in the absence of particular keynote symptoms. 4. Delaying the shortlisting of potentially indicated reme- dies, and to base the shortlist on multiple analytical strategies. Conclusions: The Vithoulkas Compass online homeo- pathic platform aims to integrate the latest knowledge onreducing biases in clinical decision-making. Optimal deci- sion-making involves blending the useful aspects of heuris- tics with a slow thinking process that balances the tendency to'jump to the wrong conclusions 'as and when needed.

Wound Healing Following Tooth Extraction and Arnica montana C30 Birgit Keip1, 1Interuniversity College for Health and Development, Graz/Castle of Seggau, Austria Background: Pursuing suggestions from empirical medicine, a pilot study in 2015 investigated and describedeffects of Arnica montana C30 on wound healing. 23 subjects received the verum, 23 received placebo. One day after tooth extraction, 15 verum and 10 placebo-treated subjects werepain-free, 13 and 5 respectively showed smooth (versus jagged) wound edges and 20 and 22 presented pink (versus livid) wound edges. After one week, all 23 subjects in the verum group and 21 in the control group were pain-free, none had post-operative bleeding, 20 and 17 showed smooth and19 and 6 showed pink wound edges. Although statistically non-signi cant, this outcome indicated some bene ciary effect on wound healing of Arnica C30. Objective: To replicate the pilot study on Arnica C30 and the course of healing after tooth extraction. Methods: The study design was unicentric, controlled, randomised, double-blind. All 117 recruited subjects com- pleted received Arnica C30, 59 re- ceived non-medicinal globuli. We recorded pain, bleeding, and wound status postoperatively on day 2 and day 7. Results: On day 2, 42 verum and 40 placebo-treated subjects were pain-free, 50 and 42 respectively had no post- operative bleeding, 28 and 24 showed smooth and 8 and 4presented pink wound edges. After one week, all subjects were pain-free and had no post-operative bleeding, 40 and 43 showed smooth and 26 and 22 pink wound edges. None of these trends was signi cant (p >0.05). On pooling the results of this and the pilot study, the only statistically signi cant trend was on pink wound edges ( p<0.01). Conclusion: The trends found in the present study are largely in agreement with those of the pilot study. Further research on the effects of Arnica montana C30 thus appears worthwhile.

Emotional and Mental Causes as Catalysts in the Development of Cancer Hardik Khamar 1,2 1Department of Homeopathy, Dept of Materia Medica, Dr. V. H. Dave Homeopathic Medical College, Anand, Gujarat, India Substances that cause cancer have been identi ed both by studies in experimental animals and by epidemio- logical analysis of cancer frequencies in human populations (e.g. the high incidence of lung cancer among cigarette smokers). Since the development of malignancy is a complex multi-step process, many factors may affect the likelihoodthat cancer will develop, and it is overly simplistic to speak of single causes of most cancers. Nonetheless, many agents, including radiation, chemicals and viruses, have been found to induce cancer in both experimental animals and humans. However, all the persons exposed to potential carci- nogens do not necessarily develop cancer. Often it has been observed that some mental or emotional traumas act as trigger factor or act as catalysts in development of cancer. The present research focuses on studying cancer cases by evaluating the time frame of the mental or emotional trau-mas that patients may have suffered and the time duration inwhich cancer developed. 100 patients have been studied from the time of an emotionally or mentally traumatic episode and any development of cancer within 0 -6 months, 0 -12 months or 0 -24 months. Appropriate non-parametric tests are being applied to analyse the data. The context of the research is to widen the possibility of homeopathic treatment in cancer. Various homeopathic medicines are known to treat effects of mental trauma and itsailments. It can be a valuable tool for homeopaths to utilize the data and further enhance the management of cancer with homeopathy. Keywords: Cancer, emotional causes, homeopathic management P021. Homeopathic Preparations in the Low Potency Range Studied by Means of Pattern Formation in Evaporating Droplets: Screening Experiments, Sample-Differentiation and Repeatability Maria Olga Kokornaczyk Cancer Research, 2Scienti c & Regulatory Affairs, Hevert-Arzneimittel GmbH & Co. KG, Nussbaum, Germany 3Institute of Integrative Medicine, University of Witten/Herdecke, Herdecke, Germany Background and Aims: Here we propose, for the rst time, the droplet evaporation method (DEM) as a tool todistinguish low potencies prepared from different substances on a qualitative and quantitative basis. Low potencies ( /C206x) contain measurable quantities of the starting substance and so give the possibility to study the changes this very sub- stance undergoes in the course of successive potentizationsteps. Materials and Methods: The experimentation con- sisted of: (i) screening of 1x -6x potencies deriving from 19 different substances of mineral, vegetal, and animal origin; (ii) experiments aiming at the differentiation of homeopathicpreparations at the same potency level prepared from 4 pre- chosen substances ( Echinacea, Baptisia, Luffa range 2x -6x; and (iii) control experiments. The DEM experimental protocol consisted of the evaporation of droplets of the analyzed potency per se, placed on microscopeslides and under controlled conditions. The resulting patterns were photographed. Images from main and control experi- ments (ii and iii; in total 2331 images) were evaluated by measuring their grey level distribution and texture. Results: Potencies of mineral origin showed the great- est form variety, whereas potencies of vegetal origin in the potency range 2x -4x created fractal patterns, probably in the course of diffusion-limited aggregation. The differentiation ofhomeopathic preparations at the same potency level pre- pared from range 2x - 4x, whereas patterns from higher potencies could no longer be differentiated and resembled the pattern of pure solute.The control experiments showed reasonable experimental model stability. Conclusions: DEM seems to represent a promising tool for further studies on homeopathic preparations in the low potency range: for instance, comparison of potencies versusdilutions, or qualitative studies on complex homeopathic preparations regarding the in fluences of single compounds on the DEM patterns.

Duckworth1, Susan Williamson1 1University of Central Lancashire, United Kingdom Background: Despite being used satisfactorily by mil- lions of people worldwide for a range of conditions, and the homeopathy community 's efforts to integrate homeopathy into NHS services, homeopathy provision has been declining. Aim: A pragmatic investigation of the integration of homeopathy in the UK NHS. Method: A nationwide postal survey among 144 members of the Faculty of Homeopathy mapped demograph- ic data and integration of homeopathy services in the NHS, building on a Canadian integration model proposed by Boon in 2004. To enable a comprehensive understanding, 10 semi-structured interviews explored homeopaths' strategies to integrate homeopathy successfully into NHS services. Results: A sample of 72 respondents revealed that 27 were actively offering homeopathy treatment in their NHS service. According to the continuum proposed by Boon, UKservices integrating homeopathy treatment are characterised as collaborative and multidisciplinary. Seven pro les of ho- meopathic providers in the NHS could be distinguished. In the interviews, several suggestions were put forward to restore the badly damaged image of homeopathy. The intervieweesdisagreed about whether integration was the preferred strat- egy to reach this goal, or even whether integration was desirable at all, but the accreditation of homeopathy withinthe healthcare system was deemed vital for the survival of homeopathy, even for the success of private practices. A lack of resources and the dwindling numbers of newly trained homeopathy practitioners were mentioned as a matter of concern. A major frustration was the negation of existingevidence for homeopathy, leaving homeopaths questioning what kind of evidence -from fundamental research or from outcome studies -would be the best way forward. Conclusion: Despite positive results regarding the integration of homeopathic services in the NHS, the informa-tion disclosed in the interviews revealed a concern about the survival of homeopathy. Keywords: Health service, homeopathy, integration P023. Symptom Severity and Functional Status in Patients with Joint Pain, Back Pain, Headache, and Cough: A 10-year Retrospective Analysis of The Swaziland Homeopathy Project Elizabeth Macera Barbara Braun2, Homeopathy Project, Swaziland Background and Aims: Over the past 10 years, the Swaziland Homeopathy Project has treated 9,866 patients in Eswatini and Mozambique in Southern Africa. The patients ranged in age from under 10 to over 79 years and 79% were female. Most lived in rural areas. The Project practicesclassical homeopathy. Research Questions: What are the most common pre- senting symptoms? What are the characteristics of the patients reporting these symptoms? Do these patients report improve- ment in their symptom intensity and functional scores? Method: We conducted a retrospective analysis using de-identi ed chart data. We collapsed similar symptoms into categories and ascertained the most frequent presenting complaints. Patients reported symptom severity on a visual analogue scale and overall function on a modi ed KarnofskyPerformance Scale Index at each visit. We extracted the scores as reported on initial and follow-up visits. Results: The most common symptoms treated were joint pain, back pain, headache, and cough. These four symp-toms were reported at 33,649 visits, 50% of which have at least one follow-up. Of the patients seen for each of these com- plaints, 11 -19% were male and 81 -89% were female. Symptom severity improved in 49 -63% of patients, with the complaint of headache showing the greatest improvement. Approximately10% of patients reported a worsening of symptom severity. Regarding the functional scale, 41 -49% of patients reported improvement, while 11% reported deterioration in their over-all function regardless the symptom. Those who were treated for cough reported the greatest functional improvement. Future Direction: In this retrospective chart analysis, patients reported improvement in their symptoms. Patients complaining of headache and cough possibly incurred thegreatest bene t, so these symptoms will be the focus of the next phase. The future prospective study will investigate statistical signi cance and attempt to differentiate improve- ment beyond that expected from placebo.

Usage Protocol Study of Calendula of cinalis compared to Chlorhexidine in Oral Hygiene of Patients Admitted in the Intensive Care UnitLeila Cristina Mour\u00e3o 1,2, de Janeiro, Brazil UFRJ, 7Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Background: Pneumonia is de ned as the presence of pulmonary in ltrate of infectious origin, with the onset of fever, leukocytosis and oxygenation reduc- tion. Ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) one that occurs after 48 h of endotracheal intubation and affects 9 - 27% of patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In order toprevent patients from developing VAP, intervention protocols were drafted. One of those was oral hygiene using chlorhexi- dine (CLX) as mouthwash at the concentration of 0.2% or 2%,the latter being more effective. Depending on the length of use and the concentration increase, the bacteria will develop resistance to CLX, while some studies show the use of Calendula of cinalis (Cal off) as bene cial. Aims: The present study aims to develop pharmaceu- tic gel formulations, using Cal off in 1 DH potency and CLX in 2% concentration, for further evaluation of their physico- chemical, microbiological and biological response character- istics in ICU patients. Methods: The two formulations were prepared ac- cording to the Brazilian Pharmacopeia (FB) 5th ed. and the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopeia (FHB) 3rd ed. Stability studies were performed during their storage in a greenhouse, at room temperature or in a refrigerator, and according to appropriate standards.Presentation Abstracts Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 1/2020A20 This document was downloaded for personal use only.

Results and Conclusions: Preliminary results show the mother tincture of Calendula presents all the quality para- meters required for use in homeopathic medicine. The for- mulations developed showed a pH drop in all gels as well as aviscosity decrease for gels stored in the greenhousefor 30 days. The gels stored at room temperature did not have alterations in their organoleptic characteristics. The gels were applied in 8 ICU patients and it was observed that the treatment with Calendula gel was more effective, as it inhibited microbial growth in 50% of the patients, after 3 sample collections. The study is underway with an expected duration of 6 months.

However, contamination by Aspergillus flavus ,a na flatoxin- producing fungus that causes post-harvest rot, is a serious impediment to its commercialization. Substances of plant origin are an important therapeutic resource and the dynam-ization of essential oils is a safe and ef cient pharmaco- technical technique. Aloysia polystachya is a plant native to South America whose essential oil has a considerable biocidal effect. Aim: To determine the ability of the original and dynamized essential oil of A. polystachya to inhibit the in- vitro multiplication of the fungus A.flavus isolated from Brazil nuts. Methods: The essential oil of A. polystachya , obtained by hydro-distillation, was diluted with Tween 80 (1%) andthen dynamized. The activity of the original and dynamized essential oils of A. polystachya was evaluated by the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) methods. The vehicle control was per- formed and resazurin was used for the reading. The analyseswere performed in triplicate and the results were submitted to ANOVA, the means of the treatments being compared by the Scott-Knott test ( p<0.05). Results: The original essential oil of A. polystachya presented an MIC of 1.56 g.mL /C01, differing statistically from the MIC of the dynamized form, which was 0.01 g.mL/C01.I n the MFC evaluation, both treatments presented fungistatic activity against A.flavus . Conclusions: The highly diluted essential oil of A. polystachya presented signi cant fungistatic activity against A.flavus and, therefore, may be a promising resource in the control of post-harvest contamination in Brazil Dairy Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus par- asitism causes large losses in bovine herds, and its control by means of synthetic carrapaticides causes resistance prob- lems, as well as the risk of residues in food and environment. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of a homeopathic complex in the control of the natural infestation of lactating dairy cows and its in vitro effect on engorged females. Methods: The tests were carried out in two dairy farms between May and October 2018. One farm is certi ed organic, with 70 animals, and the other uses the conventional production model, with 16 animals. The homeopathic formu- lation was composed 6 CH and auto-isotherapic of tick 30 CH. The bovine females received orally 10 grams per day of the homeopathic com- plex, incorporated into sucrose. The outcome parameters, as designated by the producers, were degree of infestation (%) and physical appearance of the parasites. For in vitro evalua- tion engorged females of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus , collected from naturally infested animals, were submitted to the immersion test. Results: According to the producers 'designation, in both farms there was a mean reduction of infestation by 80%in the treatment period and alteration in the coloration of the lighter parasites, with a more wrinkled appearance. In the in vitro test, the homeopathic complex showed an ef cacy of 13% and 55%, in the organic and conventional farm respectively. Conclusion: The homeopathic complex presented ef- fective control in the natural infestation of ticks in dairy cows of organic and conventional farms.

The Homeopathic Approach to Treatment of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome a Set-up Sujata Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, chronic lifestyle-linked disorder associated with hyperandrogenism, oligo-anovulation and polycystic ovarian morphology. According to Indian Council of Medical Research, one out of ten women in India suffers from PCOS and the numberis increasing alarmingly, even in rural areas. Changing dietary habits (consumption of fatty, processed foods) and sedentary lifestyles result in decreased metabolism, insulin resistance and obesity -factors contributing to menstrual irregularities. Aim: The objective of the study was to assess the efcacy of homeopathy as a treatment option for PCOS. Methods: A retrospective observational study of 72 patients, who were diagnosed cases of PCOS, was carried outat a community hospital in rural Maharashtra. In a mass setting with a large number of patients from poor socio-economic strata, presenting with common symp- toms of PCOS, there was paucity of characteristic symptoms. Therefore, the keynote method of prescribing was employed.The data regarding each patient 's presenting symptoms was noted. The protocol followed in this study was formed based on totality of common symptoms of PCOS (irregular menses, obesity, secondary hirsutism, lethargy, acne, infertility). One characteristic symptom (keynote) was selected as a differen-tiating rubric to choose the most similar remedy from the ones derived. Each patient 's monthly progress and clinical out- comes, up to one year of starting therapy, were noted.

Homeopathic Background: Tomato leaf virus (ToLCV) disease vectored by white flyBemisia tabaci , is the Lycopersicon esculentum ), caus- ing 38-100% yield loss, depending on the stage of the crop at the time of infection. This has stimulated research to nd a suitable remedy. Use of the homeopathic nosode Psorinum in agriculture was to validate the potential of agro-homeopathy in viral infection. According to Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, 'Psorinum is not a simple biotherapy, rather it is a homoeo- pathic remedy having been the object of experiment, accord- ing to the methodology of proving '. Methods: The study was conducted in Sarada Krishna Homoeopathic Medical College, Kulasekharam, Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu, India during the years 2017-18. Thestudy aims at observing variation in Psorinum treated and untreated groups of tomato plants susceptible to ToLCV infection. The observations identi ed for study were growth parameters and yield attributes such as duration of flowering and fruiting events. Fruit weight, yield/plant etc. were alsocalculated. Biochemical characters, such as lycopene and ascorbic acid, were inferred by suitable laboratory protocol. All parameters were expressed as mean /C6SE. Disease inci- dence by ToLCV was observed at regular intervals by the appearance of key symptoms. Real-time PCR methods wereused for the quanti cation of viral load in Psorinum 30 treated sets of tomato plants along with the control. Results: Signicant variation was observed in growth parameters, especially in height of the plant and fruit weight; yield showed 42.6% greater increase than the control group.Biochemical parameters, especially ascorbic acid showed 12.4% greater increase when compared with the control group. Analysis of virus DNA by RT-PCR showed 31.6% greater reduction of viral load when compared to control group. Statistical analysis of treatments revealed signi cance at p<0.001. real-time PCR P029. Implication for Hydrogen Free Radical Formation in the Presence of Hydrogen Nanobubbles Ichiro Otsuka 1 1Ex-af liation Department of Chemistry, Ohu University, Japan Strong vertical shaking in the traditional homeopath- ic preparation can cause the generation of air nanobubbles in water. Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) images of 4CHand 30CH water may reveal Brownian bubbles with a mean diameter of around 100nm and concentration of 3 -4/C210 7 particles/mL. Nanobubble research may provide a new ap- proach to understanding of homeopathy as there exists a close parallelism between homeopathic dilution and nano-bubble water.Using NTA, we have studied a puzzling phenomenon of size-dependent spontaneous combustion inside H 2/O2 nanobubbles in the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen nano-bubble water. We measured time-dependent NTA size dis-tributions of H 2/O2nanobubbles after mixing H 2and O 2 nanobubble water to determine the size of the mixed gasnanobubbles pertaining to the combustion. We found an initial increase and subsequent decrease in the total volume of the nanobubbles, showing a signi cant reduction in the number density of the nanobubbles with less than 100 nm. This implies water formation at room temperature through hydrogen free radical generation that is conjectured from theexperiments of hydrogen nanobubble effects found by elec- tron spin resonance and fluorescence spectroscopy and by simulations.

Urticaria and Homeopathy: The Unmet Clinical Needs Vinita Pandey 1 1Health Zone Clinic, Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom Background: Chronic urticaria (CU) is a disturbing allergic condition of the skin, de ned as the occurrence of hives, pruritus and/or angioedema for more than 6 weeks. Aim: To assess the clinical outcome associated with individualised homeopathic remedies on CU symptoms in patients who had remained symptomatic despite concomi- tant antihistamine therapy. Methods: We performed a clinical observational study of ten patients in the treatment of CU symptoms over a two- year period (2015 and 2016). Informed consent was obtained from each patient. End points were measured from a daily diary that re flected weekly hive score (WHS) and weekly itch score (WIS). QoL was evaluated using a CU quality of life questionnaire (CU-Q2oL) score. Results: Overall average WHS at baseline was 18.2 (standard deviation, SD, 3.6) and WIS was 21 (SD, 0). At 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks the mean (SD) change frombaseline in the WHS was /C09.7 (4.4), /C013.3 (4.8) and /C018.2 (3.6) respectively. Mean (SD) changes from baseline in WIS after 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks were /C08.6 (2.4), /C015 (2.8) and /C020.9 (0.3) respectively. Overall mean CU-Q2oL scores at baseline of all ten patients were 76.0 (1.0) which improved to 43.7 (0.5) at week 4, 28.2 (0.4) at week 8 and 23.9 (0.2) at week 12. In all patients, use of antihistamine decreased from 10 mg twice daily at study baseline to none at week 12. Conclusion: Individualised homeopathic treatment was associated with alleviation of CU symptoms, enabling reduction in use of conventional treatment. The results presented in this study can be considered as a step towardsa pilot pragmatic study using homeopathy. Keywords: Chronic urticaria, weekly hive score, weekly itch score P031.

Two homeopathy projects have been exploring ways in which evidence from clinical practice can support homeopa- thy in their countries for tenyears. The Swaziland Homeopathy Project (SHP) and the Kenya School for Integrated Medicine (KSIM) have been collaborating in producing clinical evidenceand together have over 10,000 cases in their database system. SHP uses the Access database to evaluate outcomes, using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which is a psychometricresponse scale that can be used in questionnaires. It also uses a Karnofsky/Lansky Performance Status to evaluate overall functionality. These scoring mechanisms were chosen to evaluate overall wellbeing and individual symptom scores in an African context. KSIM is working on a ve-year project sponsored through the European Union with the Ministry of Health, Kenya. It has introduced an innovative data collection system based on DHIS2 (District Health Information System 2), an open-source software platform used by 55 countries worldwide. KSIM has adapted DHIS2 to homeopathy datacollection, also using VAS and Karnofsky scores to evaluate homeopathic outcomes. Both data collection approaches (Access and DHIS2) are being evaluated and monitored for their ef ciency and usefulness. Each innovative data collection model has the potential to create a very large database of clinical outcomes in homeo- pathy. VAS and Karnofsky scores have been shown to be useful tools for evaluating clinical outcomes in an African country.Homeopathic outcomes show positive results, and developing an online data collection system with DHIS2 shows especial potential in clinical situations in Africa and beyond.

We aimed at investigating whether additional intake of Hypericum C200 might lead to a signi cant decrease of perceived pain and conventional pain medication com-pared to placebo in patients undergoing spinal microdiscectomy. Methods: Between 2015 and 2018 a randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Department of Neuro- surgery at the Community Hospital Herdecke. In-patientsundergoing spinal microdiscectomy were randomly selected into homeopathic treatment or placebo, both in addition to usual pain management. 3 globuli of either verum or placebo were administered after surgery every 12 hours for 3 -5 days. The primary outcome was pain reduction at these 3 -5 post- operative days, measured on a visual analogue scale. Statisti-cal analysis was done by means of a repeated measures model. Results: A total of 95 patients were included in this preliminary analysis, of which 47 patients (49.5%) receivedhomeopathic treatment. No signi cant between-group differ- ence was found with respect to patient demographics such as gender (Control: 25 (52.1%) versus Verum: 21 26.8 /C64.2 versus 27.9 /C65.2 years); and duration of surgery (mean: 62.5 /C620.6 versus 66.4 /C628.3 min). With respect to pain reduction, there was a similar decrease in pain intensity from 5.6 /C62.3 (Control) and 5.8 /C62.6 (Verum) to 3.0/C62.6 (Control) and 3.0 /C62.5 (Verum), with no signi cant group differences based on complete case analysis ( N\u00bc66). Discussion: This preliminary data analysis showed comparable socio-medical parameters between the two groups. The results however did not con rm any difference in pain reduction between them. Further analyses of the intake of pain medication and the evaluation of sensory and affective pain perception are currently underway. Keywords: Microdiscectomy, Hypericum pain, RCT P033. Systematic Observations Suggest a Non-material Mode of Action in Substances Diluted beyond Inverse Avogadro 's Number -A Pre-Pilot Study in Human Volunteers Karin Switzerland 4Institute of Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Bern, Switzerland Background: The mode of action of potentised sub- stances beyond inverse Avogadro 's number is yet unknown, despite proven effects on complex biological systems, such as plant and animal laboratory experiments, homeopathic drug provings and therapeutic use in humans. Objectives: To demonstrate (i) individual susceptibili- ty to homeopathic ultra-high diluted remedies (HUHDRs) and (ii) non-material effects of HUHDRs in humans. Method: Healthy volunteers participated in an obser- vational application trial of different HUHDRs in variouspotencies using a gas discharge visualisation (GDV, bio- well.com) camera for biometric measurement of changes in the bioelectric eld taken from electrophotonic emissions of thengertips. Results: In all three participants, without ingesting but holding the respective probes of HUHDRs, (i) individual reactions to certain remedies, (ii) non material-transferred effects, (iii) time-related instant or post-withdrawal vanish-ing effects, and (iv) individual speci c reaction patterns to so- called constitutional remedies were detected, on both the psycho-emotional and the physiological level. Conclusion: This is the rst published systematic approach to demonstrate a non-material eld-like mode of action of HUHDRs in humans by GDV. This non-invasive, well- established and safe biometric method is a promising step of biomarker development in HUHDR research. Furthermore, these preliminary results might draw attention to this way of demonstrating effects of HUHDRs and encourage further in-depth research in this eld.

A Quantitative Analysis on Effectiveness of Homeopathic Treatment in the Management of Allergic Rhinitis in Children Kanika Sabharwal 1 1Department of College, Maharashtra, India Background: rhinitis affects about 10 -40% people globally. About three-fourths of Indian children suffer- ing from allergic rhinitis are found to be symptomatic, ham- pering quality of life and emerging as a leading cause of schoolabsenteeism. Homeopathy aims to boost immunity, alter sus- ceptibility and decrease the predisposition towards allergies. Aim: To determine the role of homeopathy in treating allergic rhinitis -reducing the frequency and intensity of attacks, boosting immunity and increasing tolerance towards various allergens. Methods: \u0081A descriptive, observational study, including 30 cases. \u0081An evaluation tool, ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis & its Impact on Asthma), was used to stage the allergic rhinitis before and after treatment, and paired t-test was applied. \u0081During homeopathic treatment a 2-fold approach was used -a medicine to boost immunity and modify the allergic tendency during symptom-free periods, and anacute remedy during exacerbation of the allergic episode. \u0081Outcome measurement was done based on the post- treatment stage. Symptoms persisting in stage 1 and 2 were considered as improvement, and symptoms /C204d a y s a week or /C204 weeks were considered as stage 0 or cured. Results: Analysis of the cases after 6 months of treat- ment revealed that 70% of included cases were cured, 27%showed improvement at 3% were drop-outs. Conclusion: \u0081Based on the results, the null hypothesis was rejected and it was concluded that homeopathy is effective in treatingpaediatric allergic rhinitis by modifying the allergic tendency. \u0081The objective of reducing the frequency and intensity of episodes after treatment with homeopathy was attained, as evident from the post-treatment analysis. \u0081Allergen tolerance towards weather change and coloured food was achieved.

Systematic Review of Conceptual Criticism of Homeopathy Viola Scherr2, Tim for Cancer Research, Hiscia Research Institute, Arlesheim, Switzerland Background: Homeopathy, with its long tradition as complementary medicine therapy, is often a subject of de- bate, especially in non-peer-reviewed media, in which itseffects and plausibility are highly discussed. Due to the lack of knowledge on a remedy-speci c mode of action, pre-clinical and clinical effects of homeopathy are questioned, and lack of scienti c evidence emphasized. This systematic review aims to summarize and evaluate peer-reviewed scienti c articles regarding conceptual criticism of homeopathy. Methods: The literature search strategy included orig- inal peer-reviewed scienti c articles on conceptual criticism of homeopathy, following the current recommendations of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviewsand Meta-analysis Cochrane Li- brary, EMBASE, Europe PMC, PhilPapers, PubMed and Web of Science provided the basis of the literature search. Editorials, comments, reviews, meta-analyses, clinical trials and exper- imental studies were not considered. Results and Conclusion: Only a few articles were found. Implausibility of homeopathic basic principles (law of sim- ilars, potentization procedure) according to the current stateof scienti c knowledge is one of the statements made. In some cases, further conclusions are drawn, such as that homeopathy is ethically unacceptable. Based on the present analysis of the scienti c peer-reviewed literature, the current discussion in the public media is not mirrored by a corres-ponding scienti c debate.

Manchanda1 1Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy, New Delhi, India Background (Why to Integrate): WHO endorses health service delivery to become more integrated and people- centric by re-orienting the model of care and coordinating services within and across sectors. It is thus essential to integrate homeopathy in national health programs of coun- tries that can aid in reducing healthcare burden and diminishcosts. India 's current healthcare system is not sustainable for its population. With rapid health transition, India is facing a 'triple burden of disease 'in the form of un nished cases of communicable diseases, rising non-communicable diseases that are related to lifestyle, and the emerging threat of infectious diseases. On other hand, there is lack of suf ciently trained healthcare manpower. Method (How to Integrate): Homeopathy is playing a considerable role in meeting the health care needs of the population in India by its integration at appropriate levels, within speci ed areas of responsibility and functioning, in the overall healthcare delivery system, especially with regard to the preventive, promotive and public health objectives. TheGovernment of India has launched several schemes and national programs wherein homeopathy is being utilized for its inherent advantages of its patient-centric approach, cost-effectiveness, ease of administration and gentle action. Result and Discussion (Current Integrated Scenario in India): The results of a nationally representative healthsurvey, 2014, reveals that homeopathy has signi cant pres- ence in India, with popularity more among children ( <5 years), particularly in urban areas. Homeopathy is widely practiced in Uttar and the north-eastern states of India. India has a very conducive infrastructure, with 284,471 homeopathy doctors, 201 under-graduate and 50 post-graduation colleges, 7,544 government-run clinics and 164 hospitals pertaining tohomeopathy that are run by state governments and munici- pal bodies -all of which exists as a sustainable support to public health. The growth rate of homeopathy has increasedfrom 1,935 doctors per 10 million population in 2007 to 2,136 doctors per 10 million population in the year 2017. Through the Indian model of meaningful integration of homeopathy in healthcare, we are focusing on providing education through the university system, adequate drugcontrol measures, high quality research and participating in public health initiatives. The resulting improvement in health outcomes of the country thereby contributes towards achiev- ing Universal Health Coverage.

Medicinal and Placebo Effects of Homeopathic Remedies: A Comparative Study of Patients withSomatoform Low Back Pain and Patients with Pathological Low Back Pain K. T. Subhadra 1,2 Homoeopathic Medical Association, India Introduction: Low back pain is the most common musculoskeletal disorder reported in clinical practice. Chronic low back pain is also a leading symptom of somatoform pain disorder, where the physical symptoms often are not physi- cally explainable. The study was intended to nd whether there was any difference in the effect of individualized ho-meopathic medicines, compared with individualized homeo- pathic medicines when given along with placebo, compared with placebo alone, in pain and functional disability, anxiety, depression and wellbeing in patients with pathological low back pain and in patients with somatoform low back pain. Methods: A pre-post experimental design was used for the study, with pain as the primary outcome variable and anxiety, depression and wellbeing as the secondary outcome variables based on the Oswestry low back pain scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Invento-ry and the PGI General Wellbeing Measure. 225 patients with pathological low back pain and 225 patients with somato- form low back pain were each divided into three separatecategories, receiving either homeopathic medicine alone or homeopathic medicine with placebo or placebo alone. Insti- tutional ethical committee clearance was obtained, and patients were enrolled only after giving their informed consent. Data were analysed using ANCOVA. Conclusions: Major ndings showed that homeopath- ic medicine when used alone can be more effective in managing pain and other co-morbid conditions in patients with low back pain of a pathological nature. Homeopathic medicine in combination with placebo had an effect in somecases. Placebo alone was found to be mostly ineffective on pain and disability, anxiety and depression, but was effective on the wellbeing of patients with somatoform low back pain.

A Time-to-Deterioration (TTD) N-of-1 Clinical Trial Design for Use Susanne Ulbrich-Z\u00fcrni1, Klaus von Ammon2, Stephan Baumgartner3 Switzerland 2Institute of Complementary and Integrative Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland 3Institute of Integrative Medicine, University of Witten/Herdecke, Herdecke, Germany Background: Application of the randomised con- trolled trial (RCT) in research into individualized homeopathyhas several known limitations, such as selecting the appro- priate individual remedy, and inherent ethical problems of placebo interventions. Methods: Based on recent considerations of the pos- sible use of N-of-1 trials in homeopathy and its limitations,we developed a modi cation of the N-of-1 trial design. Results: The key element of the proposed study design is to select 'time to deterioration '(TTD) after intervention as primary outcome in an N-of-1 trial. We assume a positive homeopathic treatment effect relative to baseline on a givenmeasurement scale (e.g. Conners Global Index (CGI) in ADHD). If treatment consists e.g. of a few doses of Q-poten- cies, deterioration can be expected after some time. After reaching a particular threshold value (TV) in the outcome scale (e.g. 30% decrease of CGI), the next trial medication isgiven. Verum and placebo are administered double-blind and randomly in time. Assuming that verum has stronger effects than placebo, the timespan until TV is reached is longer afterverum application compared to placebo. The adequate ho- meopathic remedy can be determined in an open or single- blind screening phase with an adequate success criterion (e.g. 50% improvement in CGI). Data from TTD N-of-1 trials can be easily aggregated and synthesized in meta-analysis, since theoutcome is always measured in time units. Discussion: The TTD trial design is appropriate for chronic stable conditions. Major advantages are: placebo phases are self-limiting and as short as possible, thus minimis- ing ethical problems and patient drop-out; carry-over effectsare limited by the choice of the threshold value; TTD data yield information on duration and time-course of homeopathic as well as placebo treatments. Placebo could be replaced by another homeopathic remedy to compare ef cacy of different treatment options. Keywords: N-of-1 trial, research methodology, homeopathy P041. Ultradiluted Viscum album in the Treatment of Melanoma in University, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Introduction: Melanoma is the sixth most common leading cancer worldwide and its incidence is continuously rising. The management of patients with melanoma has been historically challenging, with extremely low survival rate.Thus, the emergence of innovative treatments becomes a necessity. Homeopathy, introduced by Hahnemann, becomes an interesting treatment option, especially taking into ac- count the levels of similarity. Ultradiluted Viscum album (mistletoe) has been used, based on the anatomic-pathologi-cal similitude model for cancer control. The aim of this workinvolves the treatment of melanoma in a dog, through peri- tumoral subcutaneous applications 10-year-old male non-pedi- gree weighing 22 kg, attended the NaturalPet Vet Clinic,in Brasilia, Brazil, in August 2018. Physical examination showed a black skin wound, 2 cm in diameter, in the medial face of the scapula, present for 2 days. Material for biopsy was collected. The patient was medicated with V. album D3, peri- tumoral subcutaneously, every 7 days for 4 weeks. After thattime the animal was medicated with V. album D3, D6, D9, D12, D30 in combination, Results: The biopsy revealed melanocytic melanoma. A reduction of the wound was observed at the end of 4 weeks. The patient was periodically assisted and returned to the veterinarian 'so fce once a month for a follow-up analysis. At the time of writing, after 6 months of treatment, the animal remains unchanged and in perfect health. Conclusion: V. album proved to be an important therapeutic tool for the treatment of canine melanocytic melanoma: the therapy signi cantly reduced the wound manifestation of the disease, with no side effects such as leucopenia. Throughout the treatment period the patientremained without physical, hematological and biochemical alterations. The patient 's overall health was preserved, and the quality of life was improved, with no alterations similar to the original lesion. However, further studies are needed to fully understand how homeopathic medicines act in thetreatment of this disease. Keywords: Mistletoe, cancer, homeopathy P042. Mixed Methods Homeopathy Research of the '3H s ': History; Health-Related Quality of Life; 1, 1Medical of Homeopathic Physicians, Bulgaria Background: Homeopathy is a charismatic medical practice but an under-investigated clinical eld. We present a research contribution from Bulgaria. The aim is three-fold, within the '3Hs 'framework: 1) to review the History of homeopathy in a post-communist country; 2) to investigate the Health-related Quality of Life (HrQoL) of chronically ill homeopathy patients; and 3) to Hear parents 'voices. Methods: The observational multi-centered study (Ethical approval, 2016) followed a mixed methods converg- ent-parallel design. The EQ-5D-3L instrument was used during the quantitative phase for assessing HrQoL of patients receiving individualized homeopathic medical treatment(IHMT) for more than a year ( n\u00bc211;>18 years old); there were no restrictions on the consultation length and pre- scribed homeopathic remedies. The qualitative phases in-cluded historical research and in-depth interviews with parents who choose homeopathy for their children (n\u00bc19). The research settings were out-patient homeopath- ic clinics. Results: 1. Homeopathy was introduced into Bulgaria by Dr Mirkovic in 1885; its use was forbidden in 1944. Its modern history began in 1992 with the rst teaching course; legal recog- nition was granted in 2001. 2. HrQoL results: patients without problems in any of the ve domains of EQ-5D represented 29.5% of the total ( n\u00bc65); only 6.2% ( n\u00bc13) reported any extreme problem. The mean state of health/VAS was 75.3 (SD, 18.2). More than half of the patients ( n\u00bc137, 64%) had used IHMT forPresentation Abstracts Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 1/2020A26 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. longer than 3 years. There was a positive correlation between duration of IHMT and VAS-self-rated valuation (r\u00bc0.171; p\u00bc0.013). More than a quarter of the patients (n\u00bc64, 30.3%) were using homeopathic remedies as complementary to 18.5%) or to non-conventional therapies ( n\u00bc25, 11.8%). Further re- search is needed to prove causality of the intervention. 3. Hearing parents 'voices was considered in four elds: Choice of homeopathy; Family dynamics; Supportive en- vironment; Relationships -child -homeopath).

Developing Homeopathic Treatment Guidelines for Patients with Hepatitis C Domingos Jose Vaz Do de Reciclagem e Assist\u00eancia em Homeopatia, SP, Brazil 7Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ, Brazil 8Hospital Federal da Lagoa and SMS, RJ, Brazil Hepatitis C has been studied for a long time. Despite consensus that, overall, reduction in in flammatory activity prevents progression to brosis and increased mortality, that same reduction usually prevents progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma thus improving the quality of life of patients. In the Hepatology Service of the Hospital Universi-t\u00e1rio Antonio Pedro, linked to the Faculty of Medicine of the Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), many patients, even though they are regularly followed, are unable to follow the recommendations of conventional treatment -due to medi- cation side effects or because they have achieved cure criteriaat the end of therapy. Faced with this demand, we assume the challenge of designing homeopathic treatment guidelines for hepatitis C, based on the assumptions of this integrative practice and guided by Carillo 's Theory of Complex Systems. The project initially involved the participation of 42 patients.As a result, we studied the materia medica of Zincum metal- licum and China of cinalis for liver support, given their tropism for the liver, initiating one or another (or combining both). Of the 42 initial patients, 4 withdrew from the protocol for personal reasons, leaving 38 participants. In therst consultation we prescribed the liver support reme- dies. In addition, we proceeded with semi-structured inter-views, asking the patients about the most signi cant changes they were experiencing in their quality of life. Patients 'self- reported major symptoms were determined using the vali- dated Likert-scale questionnaire, WHO -QOL 100 (World Health Organization -Evaluation of Quality of Life). After 14 months of homeopathic treatment, there was signi cant improvement in all symptoms reported by patients, in the order of 75%, demonstrating that homeopathy is a feasible adjunctive therapy, particularly addressing improvement in quality of life. Further studies are indicated. Keywords: Homeopathy, hepatitis C, liver, welfareP044. Constitutional Homeopathic Treatment in Cases of Pre-diabetes and Insulin Resistance at a Primary Health Centre: A Feasibility Study Gyandas Wadhwani 1,2 1Holistic Homoeopathic Clinic & Research Center, New Delhi, India 2Former Chief Medical Of cer (NFSG) (Homeopathy), Directorate of AYUSH, Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, New Delhi, India Background: India, a recognized epicentre of the global diabetes mellitus pandemic, is witnessing an increas- ing number of people being diagnosed with pre-diabetes andinsulin resistance. Having pre-diabetes initiates the long- term damage of diabetes, and without intervention it is likely to become type 2 diabetes in 10 years or less. Aim: To assess the feasibility of constitutional homeo- pathic treatment along with therapeutic lifestyle changes incases of pre-diabetes and insulin resistance. Methods: Between 1st April 2014 and 29th July 2016, all patients who were diagnosed either with pre-diabetes [ICD10: R73.09; abnormal fasting blood glucose level (100 - 125 mg/dl), an elevated HbA1c level (between 5.7 and 6.4%),or an abnormal glucose tolerance test (140 -199 mg/dl)] or with insulin resistance [ICD10: E88.81] at the World Univer- sity Services Health Centre, South Campus, Delhi University (Primary Health Centre), were referred to the co-located Delhi Government Homeopathic Dispensary and enrolledafter obtaining due consent. These registered patients were treated with constitutional homeopathic medicines along with therapeutic lifestyle changes and followed up every4-6 weeks. They were not on any supplements or hormonal medications during the course of observation. Results: Out of the 32 registered cases, results were analysed clinically and serologically in 25 [12 females and 13 males; aged 14 to 67 years] at 6-monthly intervals, based onthe pre-de ned inclusion criteria. 22 different remedies were prescribed in these cases, after individualization, in centesi- mal potencies. Only one person required the same remedy in LM potency due to failure of response to the centesimal. Serological markers normalized under homeopathic treat-ment in 88% of cases. Conclusion: The results of the study suggest the feasibility of constitutional homeopathic treatment in cases of pre-diabetes and insulin resistance. However, a pragmatic comparative study would more effectively evaluate the role ofhomeopathic treatment in these clinical conditions. Keywords: Pre-diabetes, insulin resistance, homeopathy P045. An Open-Label Pilot Study to Explore Usefulness of Homeopathic Treatment in Scabies in a Primary Health Centre Catering to a Low Socioeconomic PopulaceGyandas Wadhwani 1,2,3 1Holistic Homoeopathic Clinic & Research Center, New Delhi, India 2Former Chief Medical Of cer (NFSG) (Homeopathy), Directorate of AYUSH, Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, New Delhi, India 3Aude Sapere Group, South Africa Background and Aim: Scabies affects around 200 million people at any one time, causes an intensely itchy rash, and may lead to secondary bacterial infection, autoim-mune disease and poor QOL (quality of life). The WHO recommends that scabies be added to the neglected tropical disease portfolio and calls for action to improve control efforts. There are a number of medicines cited in homeopath- ic literature which can be used for treatment of scabiousinfestation. A pilot study was therefore undertaken to explorePresentation Abstracts Homeopathy Vol. 109 No. 1/2020A27 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. the usefulness of homeopathic medicines in the treatment of scabies. Methods: In this study, more than 5,000 patients were screened at Delhi Government Homeopathic Dispensary AaliVillage (DGHDAV), New Delhi, India between 1 stApril 2014 and 31stMarch 2015, and 146 were enrolled on the basis of pre-de ned inclusion criteria. A single homeopathic medi- cine was prescribed for each patient with the help of materia medica and/or repertory on the basis of presenting symp-toms. Response to homeopathic treatment was assessed on VAS (visual analogue scale) for itching and ORIDL (Outcome in Relation to Impact on Daily Living) scores for QOL .Results: Remedial response was gauged in most of the patients within 48 hours and complete recovery was seen in 79.5% cases in a mean time of about 22 days. Signi cant differences were recorded in patients in their pre- and post-treatment VAS and ORIDL scores. Conclusion: Homeopathic medicines have potential to treat scabious infestation by removing pruritus, eradicating lesions, restoring sleep and improving QOL. Homeopathy may provide a cost-effective treatment for scabies and a random-ized controlled trial should be considered.
