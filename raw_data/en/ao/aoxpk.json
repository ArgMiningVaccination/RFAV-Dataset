By [Dr Sy Powell](/experts/dr-sy-powell) \u2014 Written on Mar 16, 2021 Photo: getty When it comes to health, there are several nutrition tips that can help \u2014 but they are often ignored or unknown, even by physicians. Nutrition is defined as the process of obtaining food we need for health and growth. In the modern times of refrigeration, chemical preservatives, genetic modification, and intensive factory animal farming, there's an abundance of food and foodstuff. We no longer rise at dawn, eat two or maybe three meals a day, and then fall asleep at night to allow our bodies to prepare for the next sunrise. Unfortunately, the cost of this abundance has been [an epidemic of obesity](https://www.yourtango.com/experts/dr-christina-marino/what-is-obesity-how-to-prevent) and chronic diseases. Obesity is a marker for chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and autoimmune diseases. The medical community is beginning to understand that diet and lifestyle are key factors in the battle against the root cause of these chronic diseases. [Food is the new medicine we need.](https://www.yourtango.com/2020332324/why-eating-healthy-important-quotes-about-health-diet) Nutrition isn't just about weight loss, but also about living a long and disease-free life. RELATED: [5 Realistic Steps To Improving Your Eating Habits](https://www.yourtango.com/2020334546/five-realistic-steps-having-healthy-eating-habits) Good health and weight loss are not as simple as \"eat less and move more.\" The science of nutrition has grown with numerous studies, demonstrating the healing power of eating nutrient-rich, non-processed or refined, real foods \u2014 no drugs, deprivation, or surgical procedures required. We must eat to live. And, our choices of what to eat, when to eat, and how much to eat are the key to achieving vibrant health and longevity \u2014 this is called \"conscious eating.\" Functional medicine has got it right: It's not about balancing calories in with calories out. Rather, it's about understanding the biochemistry of our bodies. All calories are not all created equal. Their involvement and interactions in the many chemical reactions, pathways, and ancestral systems that we're made of determines our energy levels, weight gain or loss, the strength of our immune systems, and how well our bodies age. We truly are what we eat. Yet, what we eat is just one part of the issue of [wellness and health](https://www.yourtango.com/2016288390/best-healthy-lifestyle-habits-tips-morning-routine). Here are 5 overlooked nutrition tips for maintaining optimal weight and wellness. 1. Drink water. Hydration is critical to sustaining life, but can water help you lose weight? You bet it can! Replacing sugary beverages with water will cause weight loss since you are decreasing sugar calories. In addition to saving sugar calories, it will save you money, too! Studies show that just [increasing daily water intake is associated with less weight gain over time](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4901052). Also by activating what's called [the \"diving reflex,\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538245) you can get the body to burn calories more efficiently. This reflex allows you to survive immersion in cold water by diverting blood flow and energy to your core, slowing your heart rate, while raising your metabolic rate to give us more energy. Studies reveal that drinking one cup of water prior to eating results in increased metabolism that can create \"negative\" calories by burning more calories than you took in from your meal. 2. Include vinegar. Chemically, vinegar is acetic acid that, when consumed, enhances your muscle's glucose uptake. (Think: More energy to exercise.) Adding two teaspoons of vinegar to a high-glycemic meal reduces the spike of sugar in your blood by 23 percent! Try [apple cider vinegar](https://www.yourtango.com/experts/ingrid-dehart/health-benefits-apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss-blood-sugar) or any of the many deliciously flavored kinds of vinegar. Never drink vinegar straight, but dilute in a 2 to 4 oz glass of water, use in dressings, or drizzle over foods like Southern-style collard greens. 3. Time your calorie intake. This means eating the bulk of your calories earlier in your day. Older studies believed that the identical amount of calories eaten earlier in the day results in less weight gain than if eaten later in the evening. But, [according to WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/diet-truth-myth-eating-night-causes-weight-gain#1), this doesn't make a difference. However, snacking at night, whether it's from boredom or as a form of stress relief, can cause you to overeat. In addition, it also leads to indigestion and sleep problems. So, it's best to enjoy a piece of dark chocolate in the afternoon, as opposed to in the evening while watching T.V. in bed. Notice how Europeans eat their biggest meal midday when they are the most active.

Zinc is required for many chemical reactions, as well as for the absorption of other vitamins and minerals. And just one Brazil nut daily will give you the [RDA for selenium](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Selenium-HealthProfessional/) which may provide some protection against viruses. [Pistachios contain the most melatonin](https://americanpistachios.org/about-us/pistachio-power-unshelled/press-releases/study-finds-american-grown-pistachios-contain) than any other nut out there in the world! Eating just two gives you a physiologic melatonin dose to aid in sleep, and when timed well, they are one of the best foods to eat for jetlag. Related Stories From YourTango: 5.

Confining eating to a set window of time of your own choosing (start with eight to 10 hours for an eating window) for seven days a week will help to get rid of evening eating.
