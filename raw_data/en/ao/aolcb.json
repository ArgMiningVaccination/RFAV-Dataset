I'm so relieved to find this forum and see that I'm not the only one having a complete nightmare after getting the Pfizer vaccine. My symptoms started to appear around 10 weeks post vaccination - I have pretty much all the symptoms mentioned over here including heart palpitations, pain and numbness in legs and arms, horrible insomnia and difficulty staying asleep for more than 1h. I've never felt more lonely, tired and discouraged in my life, I've been to several doctors and even ended up at the ER and all I've been told is that I'm completely fine and need to relax a bit as it's probably all psychological. It's been 3 weeks since I started having the symptoms and it's not getting any better. Hope we will all get past this soon!! Your symptoms will improve but it is a slow process. It's going to take a few months but you may be able to shorten the duration by switching to an anti inflammatory diet. Taking turmeric, omega 3, pineapple, b vitamins, vit d and c, lots of rest and water. It's definitely not psychological it's very real and very worrying but you have come to the right place. We are all suffering with a Mish mash of side effects from the vaccines so you can reach out to others on here it is a small comfort to know you are not alone.

I just want to say I am 12 weeks post first and only Pfizer and I haven't done a dang thing different. I have probably been eating worse because I'm so frustrated. I am 6 months post partum and ironically don't want to take anything that may harm the baby since I'm breastfeeding. I say ironically because I took the shot but have always been super careful in pregnancy and breastfeeding to not eat or consume anything which may cause issues. This shot was recommended by several organizations in BFing such as ACOG, SMFM, and CDC. Also my child's provider said it was fine as well as other pharmacists and another pediatrician I know so I took it. I was hesitant and wish I hadn't taken it. My point is I'm feeling 90% better and I have done nothing different. I quit worrying about it this last week and stayed off of here until yesterday. I'm just writing to say maybe it is time that is the only healer. I have not taken any prescriptions or supplements.

It has been going on for 10 weeks now. Is there anyone here on the forum where this symptom has disappeared after such a long time? I had almost daily muscle aches in left arm until well after 3 months. I still get it but not as much as in the beginning. Pfizer left arm. [@courtneymchale2288](https://vestibular.org/participant/courtneymchale2288/) can you please add me as well i am emailing you my email address. Thank you for setting this up. [@chelsun](https://vestibular.org/participant/chelsun/) Hi Chelsun, did you have a lot of floateres and were they always there? As in not the kind that you get with migraines that come and go. And did they fade away gradually or are they still there but you just don't notice them? Sorry about so many questions, but I think this is really awesome news and gives me hope. I am 6 months out since I got them and still no improvement. I wanted to know if anyone has considered trying LDN (low dose naltrexone) to relieve these horrid symptoms? Its an immune system modulator and alot of people use it for chronic inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases I have 1mg capsules at home from last year. I was going to take them but i fell pregnant so never used. (unfortunately was miscarriage) I was tempted to try lastnight but i was scared it may cause bigger issues. here are some 60 natural immune system modulators as herbs, plants and food- I use just a few myself, many here are unknown to me entirely. I just think it is kinda cool to see how many there are that are not 'drugs' per se. Nature provides many options, of course seek appropriate medical advice for all forms of medicine you might ingest. Wormwood, for instance, is !NOT to be used by the inexperienced without advice. But it is an immunomodulator. below list is from this journal article [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S168411821100185X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S168411821100185X) Table 1. A brief description of common book by S. Buhner is a great book to read and reference. Cheaper at Alibris.com I find. [jacquelyn sauriol](https://vestibular.org/participant/jacquelynsauriol/) Hi everyone, I am on my 10th week post 2nd dose of moderna. Currently my symptoms are: 1. off-balance/equilibrium (but not vertigo/ spinning - more like \"room tilting\". in the last one month, it has slightly improved I feel) 2. pressure inside head (behind the nose, around my jaw and mouth, inside the ears, this has increased over the last one month) 3. blurry vision 4. pinky finger of my left arm feels number than the rest of my body - sometimes get pins and needles 5. tinnitus 6. clicking/crackling sound inside my head when i move my head a certain way/ or swallow. 7. anxiety/panic (but has reduced compared to last month) I came across this article. I am wondering if this is what some of us are going through? [ https://www.aans.org/en/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Occipital-Neuralgia ](https://www.aans.org/en/Patients/Neurosurgical-Conditions-and-Treatments/Occipital-Neuralgia) Love and prayers 3 people reacted [@saba](https://vestibular.org/participant/saba/) the floaters was one of the first things that improved. I had a large floater laying on my retina previous from being vaccinated. The eye specialist I saw, said it I would evidently ignore it and no longer see it and indeed I did. With the floaters I had with the vaccine, I'm not sure if they went away or if I'm ignoring them. The specialist also recommended I protect my eyes from sunlight and the blue lights from devices. I sincerely hope you improve! Healing energy sent your way. In December it will be 5 months for me since taking first and only dose of Pfizer. Still have side effects. The lack of sleep doesn't help. Hoping thing will improve. I've read a lot of recovery stories on here which is great and gives hope to vaccine long haulers like myself.
