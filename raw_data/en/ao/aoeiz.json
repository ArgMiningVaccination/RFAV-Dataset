Sipping a liquid diet of lemon water and cayenne or green juice, or eating salad for weeks on end may help you meet short-term health goals, but these detox diets aren't sustainable because they don't involve, well, food. Plus they may not provide you with sufficient quantities of [protein and fibre](https://www.culinarynutrition.com/guide-to-basic-culinary-nutrition-terms/) needed to release those toxins out of your body. Instead, let's stop the cycle of consuming in excess and subsequently cleansing in excess, and try adding detoxifying foods into the diet on a regular basis. These detox foods will gently help you remove harmful toxins from your body, make you feel great, and are absolutely delicious! What is Detoxification? Our bodies are exposed to a wide range of compounds in daily life. Some of these are from external sources that we ingest, such as environmental pollution, heavy metals, [plastics](https://www.meghantelpner.com/blog/plastic-packaging-and-the-inconvenient-truth-on-recycling/), from food, drugs and alcohol. Other substances are ones that our bodies make, [such as hormones](https://www.culinarynutrition.com/20-best-hormone-balancing-foods/) or cholesterol, that serve a purpose and then need to be shuttled out. The detoxification process is our body's automatic and natural ability to filter out toxins so they are no longer harmful. You can [learn more about detoxification in our podcast episode](https://www.culinarynutrition.com/do-we-really-need-to-detox/).

Crucifers are rich in glucosinolates, which are sulfur compounds that help to [neutralize and eliminate carcinogens](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18458837), as well as indole-3-carbinol (I3C) - an important nutrient that [prevents estrogen-related cancers](https://jn.nutrition.org/content/133/7/2470S.long). If you're looking for more reasons to love that bunch of broccoli, crucifers also [activate detoxification enzymes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23631258), support [the immune system](https://www.culinarynutrition.com/9-immune-supportive-foods-to-cook-with/), free radical-fighting antioxidants, and are fantastic sources of fibre.

Flaxseed Photo: [VeganBaking.net](https://www.flickr.com/photos/vegan-baking/8593210803) When we begin to detoxify, we need something to grab on to those harmful chemicals and transport them away. Enter flaxseeds. These little seeds are extremely high in fibre, which is great for the digestive tract and helps us eliminate unwanted toxins. Flaxseeds are also a wonderful source of free radical-fighting omega-3 fatty acids, and [cancer-preventing Photo: [Alice Henneman](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alicehenneman/5873974406) If you've ever sliced an onion or minced a clove of garlic, then you know how pungent these babies can be. But that strong smell is where the power lies - or wafts, in this case. Allium vegetables like garlic, onions, leeks and scallions contain sulfur compounds that [enhance the detoxification enzymes, which](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11962257) help us wipe out toxins and [inhibit carcinogens](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319016409000528).

Cilantro (or Parsley) Photo: [Thamizhpparithi Maari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriander#/media/File:A_scene_of_Coriander_leaves.JPG) Cilantro is a powerful herb packed with anti-microbial properties and it is thought to contain compounds that help [bind to heavy metals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3654245/) and [remove them from the body](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8914687). If you're a cilantro-hater, then swap it for parsley.

Try this recipe for [turmeric paste](https://www.culinarynutrition.com/homemade-turmeric-paste-recipe-and-how-to-use-it/), which you can use in both sweet and savoury recipes. Green Tea Photo: Content Pixie via Unsplash An incredibly potent antioxidant, green tea helps to [prompt the enzymes involved](https://academic.oup.com/carcin/article/21/1/63/2733398) in our liver's second phase of detoxification, which transforms toxins into less harmful toxins so we can shuttle them out of our bodies. [ Research shows that green tea can also protect us](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5124528/) from toxins we're exposed to in the environment, including: - smoke - pesticides - mycotoxins (compounds from fungi [that cause disease and even death](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5834427/)) - polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a set of pervasive industrial chemicals that [can impact our immune system, brain and thyroid](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21438643/) Dark Leafy Greens Photo: Heather Barnes via Unsplash Greens [are incredibly nutrient-dense.](https://www.culinarynutrition.com/guide-to-dark-leafy-greens-how-to-use-them/) They can help rid us of heavy metals, and produce the enzymes that go on to make antioxidants and enzymes that aid detoxing.

Low Glycemic Vegetable Juice Photo: Christina Rumpf via Unsplash Vegetable juices don't contain fibre and have high concentrations of nutrients so you're able to consume far more nutrition at once than if you tried to eat all of those fruits and veggies on their own.

Lifestyle practices can help enhance additional detoxification channels like our lungs, skin and mind. Here are a few extra things you can do. Sweat it Out Use a sauna 3 times weekly, and preferably [an infrared sauna if you can](https://www.meghantelpner.com/blog/infrared-sauna-benefits/).
