Article begins on page 152.148 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021148 Editorials As this pandemic continues into its second year, it is hard to be cheerful and optimistic. In terms of silver lin- ings, 2020 was likely a far better year for the environment. Climate change shifted into a lower gear and nature was able to take a deep breath. Many large industrial centres noted less smog with improved views, and many wa- terways were blessed with the reappearance of fish and whales. The recent run of mass shootings in the United States reminded me that these previ-ously common events were seldom spoken of in 2020. I took comfort, thinking that per- haps the pandemic has also led to reduced gun violence for our southern neighbors. Imagine my surprise when I researched the topic and learned that gunshot deaths climbed during 2020. According to the Gun Violence Archive, about 45 000 Americans died of gun violence in 2020 compared to roughly 40 000 in 2019. In fact, shooting deaths in 2020 outpaced the next highest recent year (2017) by more than 3600. Last year, the United States noted the highest 1-year increase in homicides since they started keeping records. Some claim that this is not a gun problem but a mental health issue. However, recently a man went on a rampage with a knife in North Vancouver, stabbing multiple victims and end- ing one woman's life. I would argue that if this obviously disturbed individual had access to an assault rifle the toll would have been much higher. COVID-19 mobilized the world, and the United States has been a leader in developing a vaccine to combat the pandemic. Imagine what could be accomplished if a fraction of the resources devoted to combating a virus were directed toward ending gun violence. One fact that is often overlooked is that gun violence is a male problem. When was the last time you heard about a woman going on a shooting rampage with a semiautomatic weapon? Mass shooters are predominantly men who turn to violence as a means of solving some internal strife. Men must do better and learn to control their emotions without resorting to acts of aggression. Lastly, before we feel too smug here in Can- ada, and specifically in our home province, we should look at another local epidemic. In 2020 there were approximately 1000 deaths in BC due to COVID-19. In comparison, more than 1700 individuals died of illicit drug toxicity (the majority from fentanyl). The coronavirus pandemic has drawn sig- nificant attention and effort to fight it. Measures include regular briefings from the provincial health officer and health minister along with a mobilization of public health and health region resources. The population has tolerated previously unheard of restrictions with minimal complaint. I wonder what could be accomplished if similar ef- forts were directed toward the often-marginalized population of people who use drugs and the overdose crisis. Forgive me for my pandemic musings, but this challenging time lends itself to reflection, and with that a desire for seeking hope amid the ruin. Sadly, we won't find any uplifting change when it comes to gun violence and illicit drug deaths. n \u2014David R.

Doctors Helping Doctors 24 hrs/day, 7 days/week 149 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021149At the BC Medical Journal , we often receive submissions from clinicians who want to share their findings, but they aren't sure how to approach the subject of research ethics. Here is a brief summary for our readers and prospective authors. What is a research ethics board? Research ethics boards (REBs) are \"autonomous entities whose primary responsibility is to pro - tect the rights and welfare of human partici- pants taking part in research.\"1 They can also help to ensure that research is of high quality and is clinically important.2 The University of British Columbia has several such boards, in-cluding Children's and Women's, BC Cancer, Providence Health Care, and the UBC Clini-cal Research Ethics Board. These committees are composed of individuals from varied back- grounds such as physicians, scientists, research- ers, ethicists, and community members. There are also private for-profit ethics boards, which adhere to the same principles and are selected by some researchers for expediency or if the researchers are not affiliated with a university. Why is research ethics approval necessary? Involuntary studies on human subjects in the past have had horrendous consequences. The Nurem- berg trials exposed the \"scientific\" evils of the Nazi regime and resulted in the creation of the Nuremberg Code in 1947.3 Unfortunately, around the world, including in North America, there were many subsequent occurrences of atrocities committed in the name of research. The World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (1964, last updated 2013) was created to further address the ethics and safety of human research and its application to special populations. 4 Today, the standards for research involv - ing humans adhere to the Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS2 2018), which is a product Research ethics board approval: What, why, when, how? of Canada's three federal research agencies.5 Applications to UBC's REBs require all team members to have completed a tutorial on the Tri-Council Policy Statement. 6 The key prin- ciple is informed consent, where research par- ticipants are fully informed about the potential risks and benefits of the study. When does a study need research ethics board approval? In Canada, any research study involving hu- man participants, human tissue, or human data requires research ethics board approval before commencement. If you are undertaking a quali- ty improvement project, it does not require REB oversight. However, it is important to note that REBs cannot review research that has already been done; if there is any doubt about your proj- ect constituting research, it is best to consider the intention of the project before beginning. A sorting tool, available on the PHSA website, can be a helpful first step (https://rc.bcchr.ca/ redcap/surveys/?s=HNWAAKFF97). If re- search ethics appear to be required or you are uncertain, contact your local REB. At the BCMJ, we also receive submissions of quality improvement projects that have been written up for publication. For example, a medical student was supervised by an attend- ing physician to perform a review of treatment times for different diagnoses in the emergency department. This study represents a retrospec- tive chart review, which involved collecting pa- tient data, de-identifying the information, and analyzing the results. Depending on the nature and specifics of the project, the BCMJ may ask the principal investigator to seek confirmation from a local REB that the project was, in fact, quality improvement and, therefore, did not re- quire REB oversight. If the research would have required REB approval, it cannot be granted retrospectively; therefore, the submission would not be accepted for publication.How can researchers obtain ethics approval? Research ethics boards have a standardized ap- plication process. UBC uses an online platform called Research Information Systems (RISe) to track applications, amendments, and an- nual renewals. Ethics boards generally allow for two levels of review depending on the type of study: delegated review (subcommittee re-view of studies deemed minimal risk) and full review (anything beyond minimal risk). The timeline for review and approval can vary due to committee schedules and the number of revisions required, but it may take anywhere from days to months.

In Big White, BC, we have about two suspected rib fractures per day. We ultrasound everyone at point of care, and get X-rays if positive (to rule out pneumo/ hemo), high clinical suspicion, or prolonged symptoms (indirect compression tenderness or unable to accomplish three pushups by day three). Everyone with a confirmed fracture is advised to avoid skiing or snowboarding for 6 weeks, and I estimate the median compliance is 4 to 5 weeks. Late complications have been very low (none observed in about 2000 cases). \u2014Mike Figurski, MD KelownaObituaries We welcome original tributes of less than 500 words; we may edit them for clarity and length.

Dr Muhammad \"Max\" Zahir 1936-2021 On 20 March 2021, Dr Max Zahir continued his journey into new realms. Symbolically, our beloved Max left us as we ushered in the first day of spring. The finality of his passing was met with the dawning of rebirth. Max graduated from King Edward Medical College in Lahore, Pakistan, and as top graduate in his year, he was awarded a prestigious Rhodes Scholarship to study hematology at Oxford University. In 1965 he obtained a PhD with a thesis titled \"The Nature of Wound Healing with Special Reference to Scab Formation.\"In 1967, soon after completing his PhD, Max joined the faculty at the University of Maryland as an assistant professor of medi- cine. However, the pressure associated with the academic publish-or-perish lifestyle prompted a move to New Brunswick, where he joined the medical staff at the Moncton Hospital. The bit- ing cold winters were not always easy to navi- gate, and a move to British Columbia followed in 1974. A 28-year career with the Pathology Department at Royal Inland Hospital was the highlight of his decorated career. During the latter part of his tenure at Royal Inland Hospital, Max held the position of chief of pathology. This experience led him to partake in a number of outside affiliations, including 5 years of service as president of the Society of Specialist Physicians and Surgeons of BC (1993-1998), as well as chair of the Laboratory and Nuclear Medicine Subcommittee for the BC Ministry of Health just prior to his retire- ment in 2002. With any professional endeavor, Max was lauded for his diplomacy, attentiveness, and unfailing leadership. A momentous retirement project was the publication of his memoirs in the book titled 1947: A Memoir of Indian Independence. \u2014Kate Zahir Recently deceased physicians If a BC physician you knew well is recently deceased, please consider submitting an obituary.

I often use this term myself. As a specialist in mental health, and as a child of parents who experi- enced homelessness and abuse, trauma is a familiar phenomenon for me, professionally and personally. But trauma carries different meanings for different people. For some, trau- ma means broken bones and ruptured organs. For others, it is a multigenerational experience of racism and oppression. And for others still, it stems from everyday experiences such as being called by the wrong pronoun or being told that you have dressed too provocatively. Collective trauma suggests that we have all been injured in some way, which isn't necessarily true of the pandemic. That's not to say people haven't suffered; we have seen far too many deaths; too much illness, isolation, and loneliness; and too many racist attacks and lost jobs. There are some who have fared well, at least economically, during the pan - demic. Health care workers have been differen- tially affected\u2014having to make heartbreaking phone calls to family members of COVID-19 victims, hunt desperately for PPE in the initial weeks of the pandemic, and many seeing their practices and operating rooms closed due to pandemic restrictions. Again, there are some who were able to make a swift move to virtual care, and some have not seen a single case of COVID-19. Sometimes we need to use different termi- nology to avoid preconceived ideas and experi- ences associated with certain words. That's why I use a different term to describe what has led us to experience so much fatigue, frustration, and fear, while at the same time triggering self-reflection, innovation, and change. It is a term that encompasses the good and the bad, the injurious and the healing, the fatiguing and the motivating. I suggest using the term mass disruption to describe this unique time in our history. The word disruption describes the rupture of our social connections, restrictions put on our usual ways of coping with stress, and the negative impacts on our economic security. It can also describe the collective awakening that has triggered global movements to com- bat systemic racism, gender-based violence, and inequality\u2014movements that have gained considerable momentum in spite of pandemic restrictions. It should come as no surprise that a prohibition on social gatherings, while nec- essary to save lives, has not impeded these calls for change. The need for human dignity is universal. In health care, this mass disruption has meant that some colleagues have and will ex-perience problems such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Doctors of BC's Physician Health Program has seen record-setting demand from colleagues in dis- tress. And from what we know from previous global and regional disasters, we can anticipate this demand to continue increasing, peaking as much as a year or more after the pandemic before subsiding. We know that some of our patients, especially those who have been person- ally affected by COVID-19 or who have had protracted courses of illness, will continue ex- periencing challenges long after the last person is vaccinated. We saw this with SARS in 2003, MERS since 2012, and myriad other outbreaks of disease around the globe. Mass disruption in health care has also in- terrupted the old ways of doing things. In the span of weeks, we went from less than 10% to more than 90% of medical visits taking place virtually. That number has dropped since we adapted to pandemic conditions and found a better balance between virtual and face-to-face care, but it will never fall to prepandemic lev-els. Health care is one of the last industries to see disruptive innovation brought on by the Internet age. The pandemic is exacting a heavy toll, but it is also triggering changes that will resonate for decades. On occasion, you'll still catch me calling the experience of the past year a collective trauma; many people and some groups have certainly had a traumatizing experience. But more than that, we have experienced a mass disruption to our way of life, our way of coping, our way of doing business, and even our way of thinking. A mass disruption need not be a negative ex- perience. History is full of examples of how dis- ruption can be the impetus for positive change. The change could be personal: a look at one's life goals, reconsidering one's career, reconnect - ing with friends and family. The change could be organizational: taking stock of how we re- sponded to the pandemic, addressing gaps and shortcomings, doing better next time. Or the change could be global: awakening to the reali- ties faced by disadvantaged and marginalized groups, highlighting the interconnectedness of nations, and motivating one another to build a better world. COVID-19 has created a mass disruption for us all, but we choose how to respond. n \u2014Matthew C. Chow, MD Doctors of BC President152 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021152prEmisE The year 2020 was fraught with tragic events that brought social injustices into the spotlight worldwide. Follow- ing the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, directly due to the actions of local police, and what can only be described as the racially targeted killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the Black Lives Matter movement gained significant mo- mentum in the United States, and with it, calls to address the enduring inequities rampant in modern society. But social injustice and racism are not restricted to the United States. This year alone saw the brutal recorded assault of Indigenous Chief Allan Adam at the hands of police in Alberta; the fatal and independent shootings of two young Indigenous people, Rodney Levi and Chantel Moore, by police in New Brunswick; and the recent recorded evi- dence that Indigenous patient, Joyce Echaquan, endured appalling racist and insulting com- ments from health care professionals as she was dying in a Quebec hospital. These Cana-dian incidents were covered by the media but Systemic racism and medicine: A commentary A reflection on historical mistakes that we must recognize and learn from to catalyze positive change.

This article has been peer reviewed.probably represent the tip of the iceberg; many incidents most likely go unreported to authori- ties or the media. These incidents are rooted in institutional- ized and societally accepted racism that goes back centuries. The legacy of slavery and the long-standing Jim Crow laws in the United States, and the govern- ment sanctioned, en- forced residential school system imposed on Ca- nadian Indigenous com- munities, have created social-economic inequi- ties and multigenerational trauma. Social injustice af- fects individuals beyond those of African or Indig- enous background, and is not limited to racial inequity; other groups in- cluding women and the LGBTQ community similarly continue to face discrimination and bias. The World Health Organization defines social determinants of health as \"the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.\" Although these circumstances exert their effects on the individual, they are shaped by structural phenomena. Slavery and colonialism in the US and Canada has produced a legacy of racism, injustice, and brutality that pervades medicine as it does all social institutions. Rac- ism and discrimination are deeply ingrained in our society and represent significant social determinants of health\u2014a truth that is backed by a growing body of evidence that highlights disparate health outcomes in racial minorities. While physicians and other health care workers are committed to providing the best care and treating all patients equally, systemic racism exerts its effects subconsciously and insidiously. The 1932 Tuskegee Study serves as a historic example of the ideological effects of systemic racism in academic medicine, which allowed for this shameful experiment to take place in the name of medical science and the \"greater good.\" In this study, 600 African Ameri- can men from Alabama, 399 of whom had syphilis, were enlisted to partake in an experiment intended to observe the natural his- tory of untreated syphilis in Black populations. The study was conducted without the benefit of patients' informed consent, and participants were simply told that they were receiving treat- ment for \"bad blood\"\u2014a colloquial term used to describe syphilis, anemia, fatigue, and other ailments. Individuals who enlisted in this study over its course of 40 years were given ineffective medicines and denied proper treatment. The study is blamed for significantly impacting the willingness of Black individuals to participate in medical research today. It is estimated that the life expectancy of Black men also fell by up to 1.4 years following the release of the study's details, in part due to a seeded mistrust in the health care system that remains today. 1 One contemporary study2 showed that Black patients are more likely to trust and heed the advice of Black physicians compared to Treating patients the same or equally does not imply equity; doing so ignores the disparities that have existed for generations and continue to exist today. 153 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021153 prEmisE physicians of a different race. The researchers estimated that Black physicians could reduce the cardiovascular mortality gap between Black and White patients by 19%, but Black patients have a much lower chance of finding a racially concordant physician compared to White and Asian American patients. At the same time, ethnicity cannot be ignored in medicine. Treat - ing patients the same or equally does not imply equity; doing so ignores the disparities that have existed for generations and continue to exist today. Recent calls for ethnically inclusive medical education have been made after atten- tion was brought to the fact that darker skin tones are underrepresented in images showing dermatological manifestations of disease. In the wake of COVID-19, which is disproportion- ately affecting communities of color, physical findings such as the \"COVID toes\" rash have been presented in medical literature only in individuals with a lighter skin color.As in America, Canadian academic medi- cine contains examples of unethical research and poor treatment of minority groups. Ian Mosby3 recently brought to light the series of nutrition research experiments on approxi- mately 1000 Canadian Indigenous children that took place between 1942 and 1952 across six residential schools. These experiments were initiated to investigate the effectiveness of vari- ous nutritionally fortified foods in the diets of Indigenous people after widespread hun- ger and malnutrition in Canadian residential schools was noted in the early postwar period. Groups of malnourished children were denied adequate nutrition while others were fed food formulas deemed illegal for sale to the gen- eral public due to violation of food adultera- tion laws. Some groups were even subjected to supplement regimens of vitamins alone in order to observe the physical manifestations of malnourishment. The lasting effects of systemic racism result - ing in inequity are reflected in current health data. Indigenous people are among the high- est risk groups for developing diabetes and its complications, and are overrepresented in HIV, tuberculosis, and sexually transmit- ted infection cases. The stroke rate is nearly twice in the Indigenous population compared to non-Indigenous Canadians, and the suicide rate among Indigenous youth is 5 to 7 times higher than in their non-Indigenous peers. Today, safeguards exist to protect the well-being and rights of those who volunteer for medical research, and they are enforced by institutional research ethics boards. This does not, however, alleviate the mistrust felt in af- fected communities that was created by deplor- able research efforts of the relatively recent past. Today, it is generally accepted that research involving the Indigenous community must be done in consultation with representatives of 154 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021154the community, the outcomes of the research must be available for dissemination to the com - munity, and the research must be of potential benefit to the community. What can we do? As health care profes- sionals, we interact with individuals from all eth - nicities, genders, religions, and social backgrounds. We play a direct role in the type of care they re- ceive, and, in doing so, directly influence their health outcomes. Therefore, we first have an individual and collective responsibility to un- derstand the roots of contemporary health disparities so that we can fight the systemic racism that exists. Next, we must define and understand what racism is. Racism can present in many ways, and it is not limited to the bla- tant events seen in the media. Perhaps its most dangerous form is subconscious bias, which can subtly influence how we interact with others and how we, in turn, are treated, all without us realizing its effects. To overcome this, we must be conscious of our interactions and carry an open and willing attitude to identify and con- trol our implicit biases. We must also learn to manage overt bigotry safely and educate our peers on how to do the same. All instances of discrimination, bias, prejudice, and ignorance that arise should be firmly rejected. Finally, we must continue to plant the seeds of change so that our efforts are not short-lived. Educators must continu- ously evaluate their learn- ing materials and develop curricula that ensure equal representation of all peo- ple for all levels of medical education. Our medical schools should continue to promote cultural sensitivity and encourage fu- ture physicians to practise and model tolerance, respect, kindness, and open-mindedness. n references 1.

Kombucha is a popular fermented black or green tea that attracts customers with its unique mix of fruity and sweet-and-sour flavors, prom- ises of low sugar content, and a variety of alleged health benefits. Kombucha appeared as early as 2000 years ago in China and Tibet, but only made its way to the West via repatriated Rus- sian prisoners after World War I.1 Kombucha is gaining popularity Sales approached US$1 billion in the United States in 2018, and the market is projected to reach US$6.2 billion by 2026. 2 Is it healthy? Part of kombucha's popularity is that is has less sugar than soft drinks. Another selling point is the presence of the yeast and bacteria central to the fermentation process. These probiotic microbes are alleged to convey health benefits ranging from antioxidant effects and anticancer properties to reversing hair loss. To date, clinical trials have not confirmed these claims.1,3 Kombucha has a secret While kombucha is marketed as a health- ful beverage,1 an inconvenient truth exists; it This article is the opinion of the Environmental Health Committee, a subcommittee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opinion of Doctors of BC.

In Canada, the ethanol con- tent of a beverage must be below 1.1% in order for it to not be regulated as an alcoholic bever- age. (In the US, beverages must be below 0.5% ethanol content.) Yet kombucha is a fermented product, and although ethanol production is much diminished once the drink leaves the factory and is refrigerated, the production of alcohol continues\u2014more so at higher storage temperatures and sugar content. One US in- vestigation found alcohol levels of 7%, higher than that of beer.2 This ability of kombucha to have increased alcohol content after produc- tion has raised concern among Canadian and US health agencies, the BC Centre for Disease Control among them.3 Indeed, class action suits have been launched over false advertising of alcohol content.4 The situation is particularly concerning for at-risk populations (including children and pregnant women), as consumers may often be unaware that there is alcohol in kombucha. 5 What do we do now? The BC Centre for Disease Control's recent study into this issue5 recommends that: Labeling must clearly indicate alcohol content. Alcohol content must be at or below 1% for the shelf life of the product. Consumers be clearly informed to keep the beverage refrigerated. Hopefully, regulators will act to ensure that kombucha stays in the market in a way that minimizes risk and allows informed adults to enjoy its unique flavors. n \u2014Lloyd Oppel, MD references 1.

The gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis is direct visualization at laparoscopy; however, current guidelines sup - port the initiation of empiric treatment prior to laparoscopy in patients with suspected endome - triosis. Clinically diagnosing endometriosis can be challenging because the signs and symptoms are Giselle Hunt, BSc, Catherine Allaire, MD, Paul J. Y ong, MD, Caitlin Dunne, MD Endometriosis: An update on diagnosis and medical management A shift toward early clinical diagnosis of endometriosis, one of the most prevalent gynecological disorders, and initiation of empiric medical treatment without the need for laparoscopy is critical to improving the care and quality of life of patients who suffer from the disease.

A stepwise pelvic exam may reveal anatomic features of endometriotic implants, and imaging, predominantly transvaginal ultrasound, can be a useful adjunct. First-line medical manage - ment of endometriosis-related pain includes com - bined hormonal contraceptives or progestin-only hormone treatment. If there is no improvement in symptoms after a 3-month trial, a referral to a gynecologist is appropriate in order to consider gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, GnRH antagonist, or laparoscopic treatments. In patients with more complex disease, a referral to the Centre for Pelvic Pain and Endometriosis at BC Women's Hospital and Health Centre should be made. Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological condition characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, and estrogen-dependent inflammation.1 It is estimated that 1 in 10 reproductive-aged women suffer from endometriosis, making it one of the most prevalent gynecological disor- ders.2 The extent of disease varies considerably from isolated peritoneal lesions to widespread pelvic adhesions, infiltrating lesions, and ovar - ian cysts. Most endometriotic disease is located on the pelvic peritoneum; a smaller percentage involves the bowel, bladder, and upper abdomen. The disease rarely occurs beyond the peritoneal cavity (e.g., cutaneous, thoracic).3Women with endometriosis may experience severe pelvic pain, including dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and nonmenstrual chronic pelvic pain. However, some women with endometrio- sis are asymptomatic.4 In addition, infertility may occur in up to 30% of women with endo- metriosis.5 Affected women may also report fatigue, lower back pain, and urological and/or gastrointestinal symptoms.5,6 These symptoms are often chronic and are a major cause of dis- ability and impaired quality of life because they can negatively affect women's work productiv- ity, social lives, and intimate relationships, in part by reducing the quality of their sex lives.7 Studies also suggest that there are higher rates of depression, anxiety, and emotional distress in women with the condition.7 The direct and indirect annual costs, including health care re- sources and lost productivity, in Canada are estimated to be $1.8 billion.8 Diagnosing endometriosis is particularly challenging in the community setting because it presents with a variety of nonspecific symp- toms that overlap with other gynecological and nongynecological disorders. Historically, a definitive diagnosis has necessitated surgical removal and histological examination of tissue. As a result, the diagnosis of endometriosis is often delayed up to 10 years after the initial onset of symptoms, and thereby postpones ap- propriate treatment and causes psychological distress.9,10 Qualitative studies that have ex- plored other reasons for the significant delay 159 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021159Hunt G, Allaire C, Y ong P , Dunne C clinical in diagnosis attribute it in part to normaliza- tion of pain by both the patients and physi-cians and to the lack of access to specialized examinations.10,11 There is a need for further education about endometriosis for both health care providers and patients, with the goal of reducing diagnostic delay by making a clinical diagnosis and enhancing women's experiences of care.11-14 With the move away from a surgical diag- nosis toward a clinical diagnosis of endome- triosis, family physicians and other primary care medical professionals play an important role in identifying patients earlier after devel- opment of clinical symptoms, validating their concerns, and directing them to appropriate investigations or treatment. There is emerging evidence that the early recognition and treat- ment of symptoms may prevent long-term morbidity such as chronic pain.15 This arti- cle reviews the contemporary diagnosis and management of endometriosis, and provides information on when and how to access the BC Women's Centre for Pelvic Pain and En- dometriosis to obtain specialized diagnosis and treatment. Pathogenesis The main hypotheses for the cause of In addition, affected women likely have alterations in multiple biological pathways that establish and support the proliferation of this disease. These include the downregulation of apoptotic pathways and an impaired immune response that prevents clearance of refluxed menstrual debris, which promotes implantation and growth of endometrial cells.16 Endometrio- sis is also characterized by a positive feedback loop between local estradiol production and inflammation.17 There is a 5% to 8% increase in the risk of developing endometriosis in those with an af- fected first-degree relative. Other risk factors include in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol and longer lifetime exposure to estrogen, such as in early menarche or late menopause.1,17 Historically, there has been a perception that endometriosis is a disease of primarily Cauca-sian women. However, it can be present in all ethnicities, although there are some interesting differences between ethnic groups, including the possibility of more severe anatomic disease in East and Southeast Asians. 18 History The first step in diagnosing a woman with suspected endometriosis is to take a thorough history, and both acknowledge and evaluate her symptoms. Dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia, and infertility are the most common symptoms of endometriosis [Box 1].5 A national case-control study of more than 5500 women with endometriosis reported that the likelihood of endometrio- sis increased with the number of symptoms present, from an odds ratio of 5.0 with one symptom to 84.7 when seven or more symp-toms were present. 6 The differential diagnosis for these symp- toms is lengthy and includes gynecological conditions such as primary dysmenorrhea, ad- enomyosis, ovarian cysts, and pelvic inflamma- tory disease, as well as chronic pain syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, myofascial pelvic pain, and fibromyal- gia. These conditions may also co-occur with endometriosis. In the context of persistent pain, endometriosis has recently been recognized as one of the chronic overlapping pain conditions that affect mostly women and reflect a sensi- tization process of the central nervous system (central sensitization). 19 Asking about the temporal relationship be- tween pain and the menstrual cycle may prove helpful because primary dysmenorrhea typi- cally occurs with the onset of menstrual flow, is nonprogressive, and lasts approximately 8 to 72 hours, while menstrual pain associated with endometriosis has been described as progressive, cyclic, or acyclic, and it may extend beyond 72 hours.20 The Society of Obstetricians and Gyn - aecologists of Canada guidelines recommend using tools such as the patient questionnaire provided by the International Pelvic Pain So-ciety (www.pelvicpain.org) for evaluating pel-vic pain. History of infertility, benign ovarian cysts, and previous pelvic surgery are associated with endometriosis, and a family history of the disease should further increase suspicion of the diagnosis.14 Physical examination The physical examination, which includes ab- dominal, pelvic, and in some cases rectovaginal examination, helps further refine the differen- tial diagnosis and determine the appropriate imaging. Digital pelvic examination should be performed as a single-digit palpation for tenderness [Figure 1]. Deep infiltrating endo- metriosis nodules (palpable thickening) may be felt in the posterior vaginal fornix. On bimanual exam (digital pelvic exam plus abdominal palpa- tion together), findings suggestive of endome- triosis include a fixed, retroverted uterus, Chronic pelvic pain Cyclic dyschezia Cyclic dysuria Lower back or abdominal pain Abnormal bleeding Fatigue Infertility Cyclic catamenial symptoms, including cyclic leg pain, rectal bleeding, hematuria, and dyspneaBox 1.

Investigation Transvaginal (TV) ultrasound is regarded as the first-line investigational tool for suspected endometriosis.21 While TV ultrasound cannot detect superficial peritoneal disease, it has a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of ovarian endometriomas [Figure 2].22 The ability to detect deep infiltrating endometri- otic lesions is shown to improve significantly when the TV ultrasound is performed by an endometriosis specialist.23 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high diagnostic accu - racy in detecting endometriomas and deep infiltrating endometriosis, and is less operator dependent.22,24 However, MRI is considered a second-line imaging technique after TV ultra- sound because of higher costs and reduced availability.24 Finally, while many biomark- ers are being researched, there is currently no biomarker recommended as part of routine investigation of endometriosis.21 Diagnosis Current guidelines created by professional societies, including the Society of Obstetri- cians and Gynaecologists of Canada, state that direct visualization at laparoscopy, preferably with histologic verification, is the diagnostic gold standard.20,21 However, the guidelines also advocate for medical treatment of clinically suspected endometriosis without a surgical di- agnosis. There has been a push by experts in the field to move away from a surgical diagnosis and toward a clinical diagnosis, where patients' symptoms and signs are emphasized.14,20 This does not diminish the value of laparoscopy as a diagnostic tool, particularly when diagno- sis is uncertain. Laparoscopy is also a valuable treatment option for endometriosis in women who do not attain symptomatic relief through medical management. During laparoscopy, endometriosis is sur- gically staged, most commonly by using the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine staging system, which classifies the disease as minimal, mild, moderate, or severe (Stage I to IV).21 Of note, surgical staging only marginally correlates with severity of pain or risk of infertility, and an accurate diagnosis of endometriosis highly depends on surgical skill.4,5 Despite being a minimally invasive procedure, a laparoscopy still carries a 7.5% risk of minor complications and a 1.4% risk of major complications.21 Most societies advocate a see-and-treat approach to surgery for endo- metriosis, and state that a purely diagnostic surgery (without treatment at the same time) is not in the best interest of the patient. In pa-tients with signs of advanced disease (ovarian endometrioma or deep infiltrating disease), a referral to a gynecologist with expertise in surgi- cal management of endometriosis is indicated. Current treatment Treatment of patients with endometriosis pain may include medical therapy, surgical therapy, or both. Medical treatment is intended to reduce pain through hormonal suppression and reduc- tion or elimination of menses.1 Fertility-sparing surgical treatment aims to relieve symptoms through ablative techniques or excision of le- sions, while still conserving reproductive func- tion, and therefore, may be indicated as first-line therapy for temporary pain relief in women seeking spontaneous conception.25 The first-line treatment for women who do not wish to conceive in the near future is com - bined hormonal contraceptives or progestin- only hormone treatment, with analgesics as needed. Other hormonally suppressive treat- ment gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists plus add- back therapy, but this is generally viewed as a second-line treatment due to cost and side effects. An oral GnRH antagonist (elagolix) for endometriosis was approved in Canada af- ter promising results of the randomized con- trolled trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2017.26 Danazol was an early treatment for endometriosis; however, its FIgUrE 2. transvaginal ultrasound. Endometriomas contain old brown blood, which is why they have been referred to as \"chocolate cysts. \" On transvaginal ultrasound, endometriomas often display a characteristic ground glass appearance. 161 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021161androgenic side effects limit its clinical useful - ness, and it has now fallen out of favor. Because these hormonal therapies have similar clinical effectiveness in treating endometriosis-related pain, patient preference, cost, and side effect profiles are important in treatment selection.27 Recurrence of pain upon discontinuation limits the usefulness of hormonal therapy.28 Common treatment options are summarized in Table 1. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a common first-line treatment that work by reducing the production of pros- taglandins, which are believed to be respon- sible for causing dysmenorrhea and cramps.29 While NSAIDs effectively treat primary dys- menorrhea, a Cochrane review did not find any high-quality evidence to support NSAID efficacy in treating endometriosis-related non - menstrual pain.29 Despite this, NSAIDs are still widely used in the management of endometrio- ses due to their low cost, few side effects, and ready availability; however, women should be counseled on the increased risk of gastrointes-tinal ulceration and cardiovascular disease. 28 Combined hormonal contraceptivesCombined estrogen and progestin contracep- tives (combined hormonal contraceptives), including combined oral contraceptive pills, transdermal patches, and vaginal rings, are con- sidered first-line treatment for endometriosis in women without contraindications.21 Combined hormonal contraceptives inhibit ovulation, re- duce menstrual flow, and cause decidualization and atrophy of endometriosis implants, which leads to a reduction in pain.28 The efficacy of combined oral contraceptive pills in providing relief from endometriosis-related pain has been confirmed in several randomized control trials.30 Either cyclic or continuous administration of combined oral contraceptive pills is accept- able. However, continuous regimens may be more beneficial in reducing pain symptoms.31 Advantages of prescribing a combined hor- monal contraceptive include relative afford- ability, ease of use, contraceptive benefits, and noncontraceptive benefits such as a reduced risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.32 Combined hormonal contraceptives can be taken safely for prolonged periods of time and are well tolerated. Adverse events are generally mild and include nausea, headaches, weight changes, and mood changes, and importantly, a small increased risk of venous thromboembolism.32 The most frequent reason for discontinuing combined hormonal contraceptives is breakthrough bleed - ing or spotting, which is treatable [Box 2].32,33 ProgestinsProgestin-only therapies are another first-line option that and induce decidu- alization and atrophy of endometriotic lesions.28 Several progestins are available in Canada, in a variety of formulations, including oral, paren-teral, and intrauterine systems; most are used off-label for treatment of endometriosis symp- toms [Table 1]. Dienogest is the only progestin currently approved in Canada for the indication of endo- metriosis treatment. Norethindrone acetate is another available effective progestin, with early studies showing its efficacy in relieving chronic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea in women with endometriosis.34 The most common side ef - fect with progestin-only therapies is menstrual cycle disturbance, which can be managed with a 10- to 14-day course of low-dose estrogen to counteract endometrial atrophy.28 Mood changes and weight gain are also clinical con-cerns. 35 However, progestins do not have the same thrombotic risk that combined contra- ceptives have. If a patient has responded well to these endometriosis-specific progestin ther- apies and wishes to have long-term therapy (e.g., 5 years or longer), potential long-term impacts on bone and lipid metabolism should be discussed. Another clinically useful but less studied progestin is the norethindrone-only contraceptive pill (mini-pill), which can be titrated up to obtain amenorrhea. Medroxy- progesterone acetate can be prescribed as an oral agent or an intramuscular injection (e.g., Depo-Provera). The Depo-Provera form has been associated with a reversible decrease in bone mineral density.35type Dose cyclic combined hormonal contraceptives Monophasic, biphasic, or triphasic pill 1 tablet/day continuous combined hormonal tablet/day Progestins Dienogest 2 mg, 1 tablet/day Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate 150 mg IM every 6-8 weeks Levonorgestrel intrauterine system 52 mg released over 5 years Counsel about consistent pill use and smoking abstinence to reduce risk of breakthrough bleeding. Switch to a different combined hormonal contraceptive (higher dose of estrogen or different type of progestin). Add a 7-day course of oral estrogen.

GnRH agonists with add-back therapy Several GnRH agonists are available in Can- ada and can be administered via intramuscu - lar, or intranasal and luteinizing hormone), which stops estrogen production by the ovaries. Subsequent hypoestrogenism leads to hypo-atrophic regres- sion of the endometrium.37 GnRH agonists cannot be safely administered for longer than 6 months due to symptoms of estrogen defi- ciency, including a possible irreversible loss of bone mineral density. The concurrent use of add-back hormone therapy, such as low-dose continuous estrogen with progestin, has enabled extended therapy with maintenance of bone mineral density.38 While GnRH agonists with add-back therapy are an effective treatment for endometriosis, they should be considered second-line because they are an expensive and complex form of therapy. 37 GnRH antagonists In contrast to the other medical therapies, GnRH antagonists have only recently become available, with the oral GnRH antagonist elago- lix approved by Health Canada in 2018. Oral GnRH antagonists produce a dose-dependent hypoestrogenic environment via pituitary go-nadotropin suppression, which inhibits endo-metriotic cell proliferation. 28 The efficacy and safety of elagolix for the treatment of pain as- sociated with endometriosis were established in two 6-month, phase 3 clinical studies.26 Two different doses, 150 mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily, were compared against placebo. Both doses of elagolix significantly improved dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain during a 6-month period. Both doses resulted in hypoestrogenic effects, including hot flushes and reduced bone mineral density, and the dif- ferences were significant when compared with placebo. However, the difference between the lower dose of elagolix and placebo was smaller than that for the higher dose. The potential for balancing effectiveness and tolerability by individually titrating the dosage of elagolix, as well as its oral route of administration, are po- tential advantages of this medication. Add-back therapy may also be used to counter the hy- poestrogenic effects. When to refer Pelvic pain management should not be de - layed in order to obtain surgical confirmation of endometriosis. Based on the available evi- dence and in keeping with national guidelines, combined hormonal contraceptives, preferably used continuously, and/or progestin-only thera - pies should be considered as first-line options and may be started as empirical therapy by the family physician. They may also be combined with NSAIDs. If there is no improvement in symptoms and no signs of advanced endome- triosis after a 3-month trial, a referral to a com - munity gynecologist is appropriate. In women with suspected endometriosis who are actively pursuing a pregnancy or have impaired fertility, referring to a fertility clinic is recommended.27 The BC Women's Centre for Pelvic Pain and Endometriosis is an interdisciplinary tertiary care centre founded in 2011 to treat those patients with the most challenging cas-es of pelvic pain and endometriosis [Table 2]. The centre has gynecologists with expertise in endometriosis surgery and pelvic pain who collaborate with in-house physiotherapy, coun- seling, and nursing to provide interdisciplinary care.39 The centre's website provides addi - tional information for patients and providers (www.bcwomens.ca/our-services/gynecology/ pelvic-pain-endometriosis). Summary There is consistent evidence that endometri- osis, particularly endometriosis-related pain, can have a significant detrimental impact on a woman's quality of life. Because women with endometriosis may suffer physically, socially, and emotionally, there is a considerable need for earlier diagnosis and treatment. We are shifting toward a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis and initiation of empiric medical treatment without the need for laparoscopy. A patient who presents with dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, or dyspareunia should raise suspicion for a diagnosis of endometriosis, particularly if they have other associated symptoms, such as cycli- cal intestinal or urinary complaints, fatigue, or infertility. It is essential that these symptoms are not normalized or dismissed. Dysmenor- rhea that interferes with a woman's ability to function in her daily life and is not responsive to over-the-counter medication needs to be taken seriously.

Ultimately, primary care physicians should feel empowered to clinically diagnose endometriosis. Recognizing endome- triosis and initiating empiric treatment earlier is a critical step to improving not only the care but also the quality of life of the patients who suffer from this disease. n competing interests Dr Allaire has participated in a clinical trial within the last 2 years, is a member of an advisory board with the commercial organization Abbvie, and has received an honorarium from the commercial organization Hologic.

This study aimed to review self-poisoning hospitalization trends in BC, with a focus on 10- to 19-year-olds. Methods: Self-poisoning hospitalization rates were calculated by age group, sex, and year for the fis- cal periods 2009-10 to 2016-17. Among 10- to 19-year-olds, rates by census division for the fis - cal periods 2012-13 to 2016-17 were calculated and compared to the availability of local mental health services.Samantha Pawer, BSc, Fahra Roy Purssell, MD, FRCPC, Ian Pike, PhD Self-poisoning among British Columbian children and youth: Demographic and geographic characteristics A study on the alarmingly high rates and increasing trends of self-poisoning among children and youth in BC found that 10- to 19-year-olds living in rural neighborhoods with poor access to local mental health services are at highest risk.

This article has been peer reviewed.Results: There were 20 413 self-poisoning hospi- talizations (55.8 per 100 000 population) in BC, including 3842 among 10- to 19-year-olds (92.9 per 100 000 population). Rates significantly increased 2.7-fold for 10- to 14-year-olds (24.0 to 64.7 per 100 000 population) and 1.7-fold for 15- to 19-year- olds (103.9 to 180.1 per 100 000 population) over the study period. Rates were highest in rural areas with poorly distributed mental health services, relative to urban regions. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need to tailor prevention strategies for youth and increase access to mental health services throughout BC. Background Self-poisoning is a major public health con- cern in Canada, particularly among children and youth. Among 10- to 17-year-old Canadi- ans, 2140 young people were hospitalized due to self-poisoning during the 2013-14 fiscal year, which accounted for 87% of hospitaliza- tions due to self-inflicted injuries.1 Parachute and Alberta's Injury Prevention Centre found that between the 2008-09 and 2018-19 fis- cal periods, 10- to 14-year-old and 15- to 19-year-old Canadians had the largest percent increases in self-poisoning hospitalizations, with an average yearly increase of 12.6% and 6.9%, respectively.2 Between 2008 and 2013 in Newfoundland and Labrador, self-poisoning hospitalizations among 12- to 17-year-olds increased 2.7-fold.3 Meanwhile, previous re- search by our group indicated that in British Columbia, 15- to 19-year-old females had the highest self-poisoning hospitalization rate (191.6 per 100 000 population) compared to all other age groups.4 These findings are highly concerning because self-poisoning is associated with greater risks of suicide and accidental death.5 With increasing trends in self-poisoning and the significant cost of treating such inju- ries, the Canadian health care system is facing a growing burden. Per patient, self-poisoning hospitalizations are more expensive than other self-inflicted injuries such as cutting, hanging, and jumping.6 Annually, suicide and self-harm costs in Canada exceed $76 mil- lion for 10- to 14-year-olds and $426 mil - lion for 15- to 19-year-olds.7,8 The per capita cost of suicide and self-harm in BC is higher for youth than for adults,6,9 at $216 among 15- to 24-year-olds and to 64-year-olds. 8,9 Child and youth self-poisoning is highly taxing economically and socially, which makes it of utmost importance that action be taken to reduce occurrences of these preventable injuries. 165 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021165Pawer S, Rajabali F, Smith J, Zheng A, Dhatt A, Purssell R, Pike I clinical Reasons for the increase in self-poisoning among children and youth are unknown, al - though a mental health diagnosis is a factor.3 In 2003, the BC Ministry of Children and Family Development introduced the Child and Youth Mental Health Plan10 to provide free mental health services for children and young people up to 18 years old in BC, although a 2019 BC Coroners Service report recommended that youth mental health services be expanded in nonurban areas.11 While these services are imperative to support the positive well-being of young British Columbians, it is unknown whether proximity to them reduces local rates of child and youth self-harm. To explore gaps in existing literature and to inform youth self-harm prevention strate- gies, our study had two goals. The first was to explore detailed epidemiological self-poisoning hospitalization trends in BC; the second was to describe rates among 10- to 19-year-olds by geographic region in relation to accessibility of local mental health resources. Methods Self-poisoning hospitalization data in BC from the 2009-10 to 2016-17 fiscal years were retrospectively described in terms of epide- miological trends and patterns. This study was approved by the University of British Colum- bia/Children's and Women's Health Centre of British Columbia Research Ethics Board (#H13-01321). From 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2017, hos- pitalization data for all ages were obtained from the Discharge Abstract Database, BC Ministry of Health. From 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2017, hospitalizations were extracted from the database by dissemination area (DA: a geo- graphic area with approximately 400 to 700 residents12) for 10- to 19-year-olds, and were converted to census divisions (CD: a group of neighboring municipalities comprised of numerous DAs12). Data were extracted using the most responsible diagnosis codes for intent (X60 to X69), as well as poisoning (T36 to T65), as per the International Statistical Clas- sification of Diseases and Related Health Prob- lems, Canadian version 10 (ICD-10-CA).13 The geocode location of all public youth mental health services in BC, including interventional, preventive, diagnostic, and multidisciplinary programs, as well as a map of the province di- vided by CD, were acquired from the BC Data Catalogue.14 BC population data by DA were collected from Statistics Canada's 2011 and 2016 Census Profiles.15 Descriptive statistics and Wald's 95% confi- dence intervals were calculated. Hospitalization rates per 100 000 population were calculated by age group, using the total number of poison- ing events over the study period divided by the respective age group population and then multiplied by 100 000. Poisoning rates among 10- to 14-year-olds and 15- to 19-year-olds were compared with other age groups by year of occurrence and sex. Results were considered significant if the 95% confidence intervals did not overlap.Rates of self-poisoning hospitalizations per 100 000 population of children and youth were calculated for each CD. These rates were dis-played as a heat map of BC using the Quan- tum Geographic Information System software (QGIS; version 3.6.2-Noosa). The density of youth mental health services was calculated for each CD by adding the number of services per CD, divided by the 10- to 19-year-old popula- tion of that CD, and multiplying by 100. These values were overlaid on the heat map. Using QGIS, the distribution of clusters of youth mental health services was also included on the map. Results Between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2017, there were 20 413 (55.8 per 100 000 population) self-poisoning hospitalizations in BC, 3842 of which were among 10- to 19-year-olds (92.9 per 100 000 population). Six self-poisonings (0.03% of cases) were excluded due to a miss-ing sex identifier. Among all British Columbians, 15- to 19- year-olds had the highest self-poisoning rate; the rate among 10- to 14-year-olds was rela-tively moderate. For both children and youth, rates were significantly greater for females com- pared to male age-mates [Figure 1].

Rates increased 2.7-fold from 24.0 (17.9-30.0) to 64.7 (54.3-75.0) per 100 000 among 14-year-olds, and 1.7-fold from 103.9 (91.9-115.8) to 180.1 (164.2-196.0) per 100 000 population among 15- to 19-year- olds. Among children and youth, increas- es were largely among females [Figure 2B]. Self-poisoning hospitalization rates increased 1.3-fold from 8.5 (3.5-13.5) to 10.9 (5.0-16.8) per 100 000 population for 10- to 14-year-old males, and 3.0-fold from 40.6 (29.3-52.0) to 121.9 (101.5-142.3) per 100 000 population for 10- to 14-year-old females. Among 15- to 19-year-olds, rates increased 1.5-fold from 46.2 (35.1-57.3) to 69.8 (56.0-83.6) per 100 000 population for males, and 1.8-fold from 166.2 (144.4-188.0) to 297.2 (267.9-326.6) per 100 000 population for females. Between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2017, of the 29 CDs in BC, those with the high- est child and youth self-poisoning rates were Skeena-Queen Charlotte (422.9 per 100 000 population), Central Coast (337.4 per 100 000 population), and Northern Rockies (328.4 per 100 000 population) [Figure 3]. Those with the lowest rates were Stikine (0 cases), Mount Waddington (< 5 cases), and Kootenay Bound- ary (39.7 per 100 000 population). In terms of mental health service density for children and youth, Stikine, Mount Wadding - ton, and Kitimat-Stikine had the most services, with 20.0, 2.9, and 2.5 per 100 population of 10- to 19-year-olds, respectively, while Capi- tol, Fraser Valley, and Central Okanagan had the fewest services, with 0.6 per 100 popula- tion of 10- to 19-year-olds. Census divisions with the high rates of self-poisoning, such as Skeena-Queen Charlotte, Central Coast, and Northern Rockies, had small clusters of mental health services, with poor coverage in many rural areas [Figure 3]. Conclusions Self-poisoning is a considerable issue in BC, where high rates and increasing trends among children and youth are alarming. In surveys administered to a large representative sample of young people age 14 to 21 in Victoria, BC, in 2003 and 2005, 17% of participants admit- ted to performing at least one act of nonsui- cidal self-harm.16 More recently, our study has highlighted that self-poisoning is a sig- nificant and growing problem, particularly for BC children and youth. The exceptionally high self-poisoning rates among females age 10 to 14 and 15 to 19 are striking, which is consistent with research that has found higher self-poisoning rates among female youth com- pared with males.3 Although self-poisoning is more severe among young females, in the 2016-17 fiscal year, self-poisoning hospital- ization rates among males age 15 to 19 in BC surpassed those of all other male age groups. The growing number of 10- to 19-year-old self-poisonings in BC is of great concern. The factors driving these increases are mostly specu- lative, although depression\u2014a demonstrated risk factor for adolescent self-poisoning in Newfoundland and Labrador3\u2014could also be central to the issue in BC.

Our findings have ad- dressed these gaps by demonstrating that young people age 10 to 19 living in rural neighbor- hoods with poor access to local mental health services are at higher risk for self-poisoning than those living elsewhere. Given the recent increases in depression diagnoses and antidepressant prescriptions for females age 12 to 19,17 mental health and anti- depressant accessibility may have contributed to increased self-poisoning rates among female youths. Mental health and the use of antide- pressants, however, are complicated subjects in relation to self-harm and suicide. Although Health Canada has not approved the use of any antidepressants by minors, and antidepressants increase young people's risk of suicide ideation, the benefits of antidepressant treatment greatly outweigh the potential dangers.18 For physi- cians who prescribe off-label antidepressants to children and youth, close monitoring is es- sential. The most common reason for adolescent self-harm is the desire to relieve psychological pain.19 With patients at high risk for self-harm, physicians can discuss healthier methods of ex- pressing emotions, such as exercising, listening to music, or calling a friend.20 Existing self-harm prevention methods include gatekeeper training, screening for high-risk individuals, encouraging help-seeking behavior, and providing access to crisis lines and online resources.21 Evidence supports the importance of self-harm screening and risk assessment.22 For this to be effective, the BC Ministry of Children and Family Development recommends that family physicians regularly repeat training for the recognition and treat- ment of depression.23 To help address this issue in BC, not only should physicians familiarize themselves with the signs associated with high risk of self-harm, but they can also discuss depression and anxiety with their child and youth patients, and refer those patients to pediatricians, psychiatrists, or local mental health services if necessary. Although im- proved mental health screening and treatment in BC may reduce self-poisoning incidents among children and youth, not all 10- to 19-year-olds who poison themselves are mentally ill, and many will not take the initiative to address their con- cerns with a health care practitioner.An additional screening opportunity ex- ists within emergency departments. With development led at BC Children's Hospital, the HEARTSMAP mental health assess-ment tool is used throughout much of BC by emergency department clinicians to screen children and youth who present with men- tal health emergencies.24 An adapted version called myHEARTSMAP , a self-assessment tool that was validated among young people age 10 to 17 in Western Canada, was used to pronounce psychosocial challenges among emergency department patients with nonmen- tal health presentations and provide treatment recommendations when needed.24 Upon com- paring myHEARTSMAP results to those from HEARTSMAP assessments conducted by research nurses, 92.7% of youth were able to identify their own psychiatric issues. Of all participating patients, 36.4% were determined to have psychosocial concerns, which is higher than what has been observed across Canada.24 Accordingly, employing myHEARTSMAP in BC emergency departments is expected to improve detection of mental health concerns among high-risk children and youth, and pro- vide customized care plans to potentially reduce rates of self-harm among young people age 10 to 19 throughout the province. In focus groups held in 2010 and 2015 for 12- to 22-year-olds in rural and urban BC, a key suggestion for improving youth health was to increase accessibility to mental health counselors.25 In 2013, focus groups were held with youth age 15 to 25 in rural and urban BC, who discussed the experiences they had as 16- to 18-year-olds involved with mental health services (15-year-olds shared their expecta- tions).26 Main talking points also included the lack of services in rural BC, as well as fears that relocating in order to access services leads to isolation from support systems, and thus causes more harm than benefit. Those who moved back to their rural communities after receiv- ing mental health care in urban centres often mentioned that services and follow-up care were not available locally. Our study found that many census divisions with the greatest density of youth mental health services had the lowest self-poisoning rates, which suggests that greater availability of mental health services may be associated with improved mental health and, therefore, fewer acts of self-harm. To improve health care in high-risk re- gions, the Ontario Hospital Association launched Local Health Hubs for Rural and Northern Communities,27 which provide com - prehensive health care in one rural location. Mental health services are incorporated into this model, with the aim to improve screen- ing and treatment.28 Local Health Hubs liaise with larger health care centres to facilitate referrals and telemedicine for patients, and provide mental health education and support for rural physicians.28 Having Local Health Hubs in northern and rural BC may improve mental health services for children and youth residing in those locations, although the ef- ficacy of this system has not yet been proven due to its novelty in Canada. 28 The BC Child and Youth Mental Health Plan states that all children, from birth to 18 years old, should have access to basic mental health services,10 but there are inconsistencies in the services provided to children and youth in different regions of the province. Further- more, by mapping the distribution of youth mental health services, we found that services are scarce in several areas. For example, in the Northern Rockies, all 12 youth mental health services are located in Fort Nelson,14 which has an area of 13 km2 and a 10- to 19-year-old population of 400 individuals.15 The rest of the census division has an area of 85 098 km2 and a 10- to 19-year-old population of 270 individuals,15 meaning that many children and Existing self-harm prevention methods include gatekeeper training, screening for high-risk individuals, encouraging help- seeking behavior, and providing access to crisis lines and online resources.clinical Self-poisoning among British Columbian children and youth169 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021169youth living in northeastern BC (where there is no public transit) have to drive for hours to access mental health services. Often, this is simply not feasible. Of all 29 census divisions, the Northern Rockies had the third highest rate of self-poisoning hospitalizations among children and youth age 10 to 19. The situation was similar for the Central Coast census division, which had the second highest rate of self-poisoning among 10- to 19-year-olds, yet just three youth mental health services. Due to the rugged landscape of the Central Coast, modes of travel are costly and time-consuming, which makes it nearly im- possible for many children and youth to ob- tain in-person mental health treatment. This emphasizes the need for implementation of, and improved access to, additional services in rural and isolated areas of BC. While under- used across Canada during the study period,29 telehealth provides a potential solution. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a shift to telehealth use, which removes many barriers to accessing health care; for example, by eliminating the need to travel to urban cen- tres. However, limitations still exist, including insufficient bandwidth and inadequate access to technology. Key locations of focus identified in this study include rural areas in the Northern Rockies, Central Coast, Skeena-Queen Char- lotte, Kitimat-Stikine, and Bulkley-Nechako, which were census divisions with high rates of self-poisoning among children and youth age 10 to 19. Child and youth self-poisoning needs to be urgently addressed. Our study identified critical rural areas in BC that would benefit from more accessible youth mental health services, and highlighted the need for self-harm prevention strategies in those areas. Ultimately, it is ideal to prevent self-harm among children and youth by employing a layered strategy with multiple approaches that reduce risk and promote posi- tive well-being. A valuable opportunity exists for public health officials, policymakers, clini- cians, and mental health workers to develop and amend self-harm reduction strategies for children and youth, thereby reducing the burden that these preventable injuries have on Brit- ish Columbians, our economy, and our health care system.Data limitationsSince there were no personal identifiers in the available data, hospital readmissions and trans- fers could not be excluded. We estimate that approximately 4% of self-poisoning hospital- izations were either readmissions or transfers, meaning that the number of double-counted individuals represents a small proportion of the total number of cases. On the other hand, the data are not all encompassing, in that they include only cases for which poisoning was the primary cause, not those for which poisoning was a contributing factor. Therefore, this study likely underrepresented the total number of self-poisoning hospitalizations in BC. Factors that vary across geographic regions, such as economic conditions, the nature of jobs, types and availability of social supports, eth- nic composition, and culture, could not be ac- counted for in this study. It is challenging to compare youth mental health services availabil - ity among census divisions because the char- acteristics of each varies greatly with another. For example, Stikine had a small population of only 40 children and youth age 10 to 19, which could account for the high density of youth mental health services\u2014nearly tenfold higher than any other census division. If Stikine and Greater Vancouver were each 10 000 km,2 they would have 6 and 920 636 residents aged 10 to 19 years, respectively.15 With these different population densities, a greater density of youth mental health services does not equate to easier access, use, or equitable or culturally safe access within that region, particularly in remote census divisions that have small populations dispersed over large geographic areas.Finally, due to coding limitations of the hos- pitalization data, this study could not differenti- ate between suicide attempts and nonsuicidal self-injury, but rather grouped these behaviors as self-poisonings. Summary Self-poisoning is an ongoing issue for children age 10 to 14 and youth age 15 to 19. From 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2017, the children and youth in this age range in BC demonstrated high rates of self-poisoning hospitalizations, which unlike any other age group, increased throughout the study period. It is important to assess potential risk factors that are con- tributing to the increased self-poisoning rates among children and youth, and to explore rea- sons for higher rates among females age 10 to 19 compared with males, including the role of mental health. Children and youth age 10 to 19 living in rural neighborhoods that have low accessibility to mental health services are the most vulnerable to self-poisoning. This reveals an urgent public health issue in BC\u2014one that medical practitioners can act on by advocating for more and/or greater access to youth men-tal health services in high-risk regions. In the meantime, physicians should monitor young patients for signs of mental health concerns, and closely follow up with those who have been prescribed antidepressants. With patients who might be at high risk of self-harm, physicians can also discuss alternative coping strategies to help reduce the number of self-harm cases among young British Columbians. Still, fu- ture research should be conducted to explore the efficacy of existing self-harm prevention strategies and youth mental health services in high-risk areas. n competing interests None declared. references 1.

Housing is a social determinant of health and is implicated in various health outcomes. Addition- ally, a person's living situation is interlinked with loneliness and social isolation, for which older adults are at higher risk. Loneliness in older adults is correlated with a decline in function, lower self- reported health scores, and overall mortality. One way to address these challenges in BC is with an intergenerational housing model, where older adults live in communities that promote ties with younger generations. Several intergenerational programs exist worldwide, and they have signifi- cant benefits for all involved. Intergenerational housing projects are gaining traction in Canada and can serve as a method of improving the health and well-being of older adults while providing benefits to society at large. Background The older-adult population in Canada is pro- jected to continue expanding over coming de- cades. As of 2018, individuals age 65 and older made up 17.4% of the Canadian population. Projections estimate that by 2068, this percent- age will grow to between 21.4% and 29.5%.1 Intergenerational housing as a model for improving older-adult health Housing options that promote connections between generations should be implemented as a means of providing benefits at both an individual and societal level. Raiya Suleman, BHSc, Faizan Bhatia, BHSc Ms Suleman and Mr Bhatia are fourth- year students in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia. This article has been peer reviewed.Additionally, it is expected that there will be over 5.5 million Canadians over the age of 80 in 2068, compared to 1.6 million in 2018.1 This situation requires considerable thought and action from the Canadian health care and po- litical systems. A growing challenge among the older-adult community is housing, and it is exacerbated by age-related issues such as social isolation, acces - sibility concerns, and so- cioeconomic factors. Of particular relevance is social isolation, which is defined as \"a quantifiable method of reduced social network\" and is directly related to loneliness, which is the perceived lack of a social network.2,3 Social isolation is a prevalent issue among older adults, who are at higher risk due to the loss of family members and geographical distancing.4 A longitudinal cohort study by Perisonnoto and colleagues de- termined that approximately 18% of individuals over the age of 60 live alone, with 43% of sub-jects reporting that they feel lonely. 5 Similarly, the Canadian National Seniors Council esti- mate that approximately 50% of people over the age of 80 report feelings of loneliness.6 While the BC government recognizes the importance of social and intergenerational connections and their ties to mental and physical health, lim- ited initiatives exist that target social isolation.7 Additionally, the 2019 BC Centre for Disease Control report on social isolation discussed the impact on seniors. It also stated that hous- ing was a \"key component of fighting social exclusion,\" but highlighted that housing for seniors was not a priority for most municipali- ties in BC.8 The literature on loneliness among older adults living in care facilities is also scarce; however, one study explored loneliness in senior housing communities and found that 42.7% of older adults living in these communities were mod- erately lonely and 26.6% were severely lonely, using the Hughes scale.9 Across studies, loneliness among older adults is shown to have negative health con- sequences. For example, loneliness is correlated with a decline in func- tion with activities of daily living, negatively impacting subjective health and increasing the risk of conditions such as depression, inconti- nence, hypertension, and vision impairment, as well as overall mortality.5,9-12 It is clear that social isolation, and consequently, senior hous- ing, are public health issues. Intergenerational housing models serve as a potential solution to address these concerns and help mitigate the consequences associated with social isolation. Senior housing models Several models of housing for older adults exist nationwide, together creating tiers for delivery of care that can be used based on an individual's specific needs. In general, these tiers include independent living, assisted living, long-term Across studies, loneliness among older adults is shown to have negative health consequences.172 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021172care, and hospice care, with respite care serving as a temporary option at almost all levels to pro- vide caregiver relief. Independent care options involve minimal professional assistance, while assisted living is suited for older adults who are able to make decisions but require support due to physical and functional health challenges.13 Long-term care is designated for medically complex patients who require 24-hour nursing care1,3 Hospice care is for patients who are at end of life and require symptom management, and it is one of many palliative care options. 14 Intergenerational housing facilities could employ a uni- or multi-tiered approach to older-adult housing, depending on commu- nity needs and available resources. The premise of intergenerational housing is that seniors' needs are met in a similar way to the hous- ing options mentioned above, with the added opportunity to reside with or among younger individuals who do not require these services. The BC-based company Happipad is a hous- ing solution that frequently facilitates inter- generational housing.15 Through its website, Happipad often connects seniors looking for social connections and additional income to younger tenants looking for affordable hous- ing.15 Purpose-built intergenerational-housing spaces also exist in Canada, such as the newly established Generations facility in Calgary, which integrates assisted, long-term, and pal- liative care in a multigenerational environ- ment.16 Similarly, Harbour Landing Village in Regina is a care centre for older adults that promotes personalized care and intergenera- tional activities.17 Similar housing schemes are seen worldwide. For example, the Netherlands has housing plans in which students are of- fered free accommodation provided they spend 30 hours each month with their older-adult housemates.18 In Fujisawa, Japan, Aoi Care houses elderly people with dementia, and is unique in that its residents decide on their daily activities, frequently choosing to interact with children by playing ball or selling tea made at the centre.19 Generally, studies show that living and spending time with family, and specifically caring for grandchildren, serve as protective factors against older-adult loneliness, further supporting the concept of intergenerational housing.20,21Intergenerational programs Existing intergenerational programs demon- strate an improvement in seniors' health and well-being, suggesting a similar benefit would be realized through intergenerational housing. One study conducted in Japan noted that older adults who actively participated in an intergen- erational program that involved regularly read- ing to school-age children over an 18-month period reported improved subjective health and social networks compared to controls.22 A follow-up study based on this program was conducted 7 years later and demonstrated that the control group had higher odds of having decreased intellectual capacity as well as lower levels of interactions with children.23 Addi- tionally, at follow-up, the intervention group demonstrated higher levels of physical function related to fine motor skills, as measured through functional reach and grip strength.23 Functional limitations are also a risk factor for loneliness; therefore, intergenerational programs may help address this underlying issue.24 Another study in Japan consisted of explor- ing the impacts of participating in a weekly intergenerational day program that paired se-niors with school-age children for 6 months. 25 The study noted that a subgroup of seniors who reported higher scores on a depression scale at enrolment showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms after participating in the program.25 A randomized trial with a similar program was conducted in the United States, which involved older adults volunteering in a local elementary school for 15 hours per week.26 This program yielded positive outcomes for participants in the intervention group when compared to the control group.26 Specifically, 4 to 8 months after completing the program, older adults in the intervention group showed signifi- cant improvement in physical activity, strength, and cognitive ability.26 They also reported an increased ability to be able to turn to someone for help, perhaps indicating a decreased sense of social isolation.26 Furthermore, 80% of the seniors returned to the program the following year, suggesting the program yielded a positive experience for the participants.26 While systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the topic of intergenerational housing and programming are limited, one systematic review compared seven studies on intergenerational programs, five of which showed mixed or posi- tive outcomes for older adults.27 Importantly, Hawkley and colleagues described that loneli-ness can be alleviated, with one method being through increased socialization. 24 Benefits to society Beyond the direct effects of improving the health of older adults, intergenerational pro- gramming can lead to beneficial outcomes for society as a whole. For example, programs that paired older adults with youth led to an increased sense of trust and social capital.28 Additionally, such programming promotes in- tergenerational ties and leads to an increased sense of community. This may have a cyclical effect that ultimately decreases social isolation. The direct relationship between loneliness and depression is of note as depression costs the Canadian health care system $32.3 billion in GDP annually.29 Although the financial ramifi- cations of loneliness are not the primary driver for promoting intergenerational programs, the cost is substantial. Vasiliadis and colleagues state that the excess annual adjusted cost of depression in seniors in Canada in 2006 was $27.4 million.30 As well, the cost of managing chronic depression is estimated to be twice that of hypertension and diabetes combined.31 With these statistics, we can start to appreciate the worldwide economic impact of tackling geri-atric mental health with reduced social isola-tion and loneliness through intergenerational housing. The benefits of intergenerational hous- ing also extend to the rest of the population. These include reduced housing costs for stu - dents through housing incentives and reduced caregiver burnout as a result of the added sup- port network in intergenerational programming and housing initiatives. The latter is particularly important as the Canadian General Social Sur- vey for Caregiving and Care Receiving found that 34% of caregivers for their grandparents felt worried or distressed about their role and responsibilities as primary caregivers. 32 There are also beneficial effects for young- er generations who participate in such pro- grams. For example, children may benefit from improved academic performance, positive Bcmd 2B173 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021173Bcmd 2B perceptions of the elderly, and enhanced skills related to communication and empathy.33,34 Additionally, as concluded in a literature review conducted by Park in 2015, intergenerational programming has a positive effect on youth, and demonstrates a reduction in feelings of anxiety and an improved sense of self-worth.35 Conclusions Intergenerational housing models should be further explored as a way of addressing old- er adults' concerns about housing and social isolation in BC and Canada. Existing inter- generational programs benefit seniors through improved self-rated health scores, physical func- tion, and cognition. Additionally, such programs have positive impacts on society at large, foster- ing a sense of community, improving intergen- erational ties, cultivating economic gain, and increasing social capital. n competing interests None declared. references 1.

The JCCs bring together doctors, government, health authorities, patients and families, health professions, and other stake- holders to improve access to care by centring it on patients and families, building physician capacity, and coordinating system services. Through their Physician Master Agreement, Doctors of BC and the BC government allocate funding to four committees that each have a distinct focus and mandate: Joint Standing Committee on Rural Issues: Enhances physician services in rural and remote areas. General Practice Services Committee: Strengthens primary and community care. Shared Care Committee: Improves collabo - ration between family doctors and specialist doctors. Specialist Services Committee: Engages specialist doctors to collaborate, lead quality improvement, and deliver quality services. Work of the JCCs is grounded in the In- stitute for Healthcare Improvement's (IHI) principles of quality improvement and framed by the IHI's Triple Aim.1 JCC funding and sup- port enables divisions of family practice, medical staff associations, and the Rural Coordination Centre of BC (RCCbc) to take a grassroots approach to enhance patient care and improve professional satisfaction for doctors.

Enhancing surgical and obstetrical care In rural BC communities where surgical care is provided by family physicians with enhanced surgical skills or solo general surgeons, the Rural Surgical and Obstetrical Networks (RSONs) Initiative stabilizes, supports, and enhances the delivery of surgical and obstetrical care to local populations. The initiative is based on a five-pillar framework: scope and volume, remote presence technology, clinical coaching, con - tinuous quality improvement, and evaluation. RSONs build on local, regional, and provincial relationships to enhance the care provided by and between teams. Teams include members of interdisciplinary OR and maternity teams supported by a local community coordinator and with support from RCCbc. These networks are supported in Creston, Fernie, Golden, Ha- zelton, Port Alberni, Revelstoke, Smithers, and Vanderhoof, and are in development in Powell River and Sechelt.

Establishing team-based care networks Physicians in divisions of family practice are working with health authority and community partners to establish primary care networks (PCNs) through 39 regional collaborative partnerships. A PCN is a team of health care providers made up of doctors and other health care professionals who work together to pro- vide primary care to patients in a geographi- cal area. The foundation of the PCN is the patient medical home, a community practice where patients get the majority of their care with an emphasis on longitudinal relational continuity and a team-based approach to care. While the focus is on primary care, special- ists have an important role within PCNs. They are involved in PCN planning and in conver- sations at the provincial, regional, and com - munity levels. Forty-three PCNs have started implementation as of spring 2021. Read more at https://gpscbc.ca/what-we-do/system-change/ primary-care-networks. Coordinating surgical optimization Doctors are working with health authorities and facilities to improve assessment and man- agement of patients in need of surgery. The Surgical Patient Optimization Collaborative (SPOC) addresses the need for a coordinated approach to optimize or prehabilitate patients for surgery. Prehabilitation can reduce adverse events during a surgery, improve outcomes and recovery for patients, and increase patient and caregiver satisfaction. Since May 2019, SPOC has worked on developing a sustainable process that enables patients to optimize different components of their health (e.g., diet, smoking, anemia, physi- cal activity) in preparation for an elective pro- cedure. To date, the collaborative has formed multidisciplinary surgical prehabilitation teams in 15 hospitals, created a resource guide for caregivers to help implement prehabilitation practices, and improved communication be- tween family doctors, surgeons, and patients. SPOC is scheduled to complete in May 2021. It is anticipated that the prehabilitation processes initiated by the collaborative will be integrated into routine surgical practices in BC.

In 2020, 1724 people died of drug overdose compared to 984 people in 2019.1 There has been a significant increase in the proportion of opioid samples containing strong sedatives. These sedatives include ben- zodiazepines, etizolam, and xylazine. in 20% of opioid samples checked by the BC Centre on Substance Use and 50% of samples from the Vancouver Island Drug Checking Project. Particularly concerning is that benzodiazepines were detected in 50% of illicit drug toxicity deaths in BC in December 2020 and January 2021. 2 Benzodiazepines and etizolam enhance the action of the neurotransmitter, gamma aminobutyric acid. Patients with ben- zodiazepine overdoses may have profound CNS depression. Symptom onset occurs in 0.5 to 2 hours. Symptom duration can vary depending on the agent and dose; generally, patients with etizolam overdoses will be sedated for many hours. Also of note is that urine toxicology will not detect all benzodiazepines. Point-of-care screens in BC will detect etizolam but their reported sensitivity is 50% to 70%. It is, there- fore, important to treat patients clinically if benzodiazepine toxicity is suspected.Potent sedatives in opioids in BC: Implications for resuscitation, and benzodiazepine and etizolam withdrawal This article is the opinion of the BC Centre for Disease Control and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.Dependence to and withdrawal from ben- zodiazepines or etizolam may occur after expo- sures of only a few weeks.3 Increasing exposure to benzodiazepines puts many people who use drugs at risk for withdrawal symptoms (e.g., agitation, sleeplessness, autonomic instability), which may be difficult to clinically differentiate from opioid withdrawal or stimulant toxicity. With- drawal from benzodiaz- epines and etizolam has been increasingly reported across BC over the past 6 months. The effects of both benzodiazepines and eti- zolam can be reversed with flumazenil. However, flumazenil should not be used in the treatment of suspected ben- zodiazepine or etizolam overdose because it is associated with dysrhythmias and seizures. Flumazenil can also precipi- tate benzodiazepine or etizolam withdrawal. If seizures occur after the use of flumazenil, they can be very difficult to treat.4 Xylazine is a partial alpha-2-adreneric agonist respira- tory depression. Benzodiazepine adulteration makes the re- suscitation of patients with illicit drug overdose complex. The mainstay of overdose treatment is monitoring and supportive care. As respirato- ry depression is the major cause of opioid overdose mortality and morbidity, patients' respiratory sta- tus should be monitored. Simply measuring a pa- tient's respiratory rate may be an unreliable estimate of respiratory function; therefore, monitoring oxygen saturation and end tidal carbon dioxide should be instituted if available. Hypoventila- tion should be treated with respiratory support. Hypoglycemia may occur in opioid overdose, so clinicians should check serum glucose.5 Naloxone is a competitive opioid antagonist that is in reversing opioid overdose. In cases where opioid overdose is suspected, lay and health care responders should give naloxone to patients with hypoventilation or who are unable to protect their airway.

However, responders should still administer naloxone, as it will reverse opioid-related toxicity. Naloxone should be titrated to effect, and opioid withdrawal pre- cipitated by naloxone should be avoided. At the BC Drug and Poison Centre, we recom- mend the following naloxone regimen if there is clinical suspicion of opioid overdose: 0.04 to 0.1 mg initially, followed by subsequent doses (q2-3 min): 0.4 mg, 0.4 mg, 2.0 mg, 4.0 mg, then 10 mg.6 If ongoing sedation persists due to prolonged effects of concurrent benzodi- azepines, patients should be monitored until they are safely ventilating and their level of consciousness returns.

PUTTING INDIGENOUS CULTURAL SAFETY INTO PRACTICE with guests Dr Terri Aldred and Len PierreAvailable for streaming on all podcast platforms A Doctors of BC Podcast 179 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021179 worksafEBc Medical advisors are physicians who work at WorkSafeBC to provide medical reviews of injured worker claims. They are your colleagues and are licensed with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC. Many are accredited in sports or occupa- tional medicine, have training in mental health, and maintain clinical practices. They regularly enlist the expertise of physician specialists in orthopaedics, internal medicine, ophthalmology, and psychiatry to support our case management teams for the benefit of injured workers. In 2021, WorkSafeBC medical advisors will reach out to community physicians earlier in the claim process to assist with their patients' recovery and return to work. There is consensus about the value of work for injured workers\u2014it's healthy, it contributes to recovery, and it leads to better health outcomes.1 Yet not all injured workers reap the health benefits of work. Some recover at home for ex- tended periods\u2014away from work and isolated from co-workers and regular routines\u2014placing them at higher risk of suicide, obesity, heart at- tack, depression, and substance abuse.2 The Early Medical Advisor Involvement process involves reviewing all claims without a return-to-work plan 8 weeks after the date of injury. The medical advisor will contact the attending physician to discuss opportunities for additional treatment/rehabilitation, obstacles to the patient's recovery, and potential work opportunities if the patient is not yet ready to return to regular duties. This allows medical advisors to collaborate with community physicians about how Work-SafeBC can assist, with the goal of functional Medical advisors reaching out to community physicians: A new WorkSafeBC initiative This article is the opinion of WorkSafeBC and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.recovery and some form of return to work. We piloted this initiative in 2020 and have seen a positive impact from the medical advisor con- necting with the injured worker's physician. Medical advisors can offer support and guidance to community physicians on the claim process and disability management, can expedite refer- rals for imaging or specialist consultations, and can promote collaboration between community physicians and WorkSafeBC. Ultimately, the initiative aims to provide and support excel- lent worker care along with timely and safe return to work. For the worker, this early review can help address outstanding medical issues in a timely and efficient manner, provide for a medically supported return to work, and keep the worker connected with the workplace and colleagues. The community physician has an opportunity for enhanced collaboration with WorkSafeBC; this integrated sharing of information opti- mizes care and access to resources for their pa- tient, supports patient recovery, and promotes a greater understanding of the benefits of return to work as part of the treatment plan. For the employer, an appropriate earlier return to work helps their employees remain connected with the workplace. Many employers can accommodate medical restrictions, offer- ing light or modified duties while an injured worker is recovering. To date, we have seen the following outcomes: Earlier clarification of diagnoses, medical restrictions, and treatment plans. Greater understanding of the role of medical advisors and benefits of peer-to-peer col - laboration among community physicians. Enhanced communication leading to effi- cient engagements and a follow-up system with community physicians. Early discussion of expectations, return- to-work planning, and the identification of barriers to returning to work. Targeted and early support for community physicians with a focus on safe, durable, and timely return to work as part of treatment plans. Early identification of the absence of a pri- mary care provider, allowing for the mitiga - tion of this common challenge.We thank you in advance for your engage- ment when one of our medical advisors contacts you.

MacDermot Prize for Excel- lence in Medical Journalism: Best article or essay was awarded to Jillian Lin for her article \"Palliative care and legacy creation\" [BCMJ 2020;62:292-293]. Jillian would like to thank both Betty and her late aunt, who inspired the article, as well as Dr Pippa Hawley for providing guidance on the Legacy Project. Jillian wrote this article as a second-year UBC medical student. She is now a third-year student going through clini-cal core rotations in the Vancouver-Fraser re- gion. As she goes through her clinical rotations, she continues to learn from patient encounters and feels fortunate to be involved in caring for another person's well-being. Jillian aspires to be a resident physician in Canada when she graduates in 2022. She is excited for the years to come and curious about what kind of physi - cian she will become. Her professional interests are broad but consistently include youth and children's health, mental health, social medicine, and palliative care. The 2020 J.H. MacDermot Prize for Ex - cellence in Blog Writing: Best blog post was awarded to Paige Dean for her post \"Stay in- formed, stay safe: How to handle everyday activities during the COVID-19 pandemic\" [BCMJ.org, 28 June 2020]. Paige is in her final year of medical school at UBC and feels fortunate to have spent the past 4 years training in beautiful British Columbia, a place she proudly calls home. Although the past year has brought many changes, she found great fulfillment by participating in this project (Practical solutions for COVID-19 challeng-es), which helped her navigate the uncertainty brought about by COVID-19. Paige hopes to spend her career providing holistic medicine as either a pediatrician or a family doctor. Outside of medicine, Paige is an avid runner, enjoys ex- ploring the great outdoors by hiking and skiing, and looks forward to the return of live music and theatre performances so that she may con- tinue to indulge her passion for the arts. The winning article and blog post were se- lected by BC physician and regular contributor to the BCMJ, Dr George Szasz, in lieu of the Editorial Board. An Editorial Board member had competing interests with several of the eligible articles; therefore, the Board elected to defer to an external judge to ensure an im-partial result. Dr Szasz found the candidates' work to be excellent, clever, and sometimes even touching. Each article was informative, interesting, and wildly varied in content, while the blog posts were short, focused, and written in a conver- sational manner, making it a difficult task to choose a first among equals. In the end, Dr Szasz found Jillian Lin's essay to represent the most significant achievement in medical writing. He was grabbed by her touching pre-sentation about a medical student's journey in understanding death, and the description of her halting and fearful approach to death and her evolving courage to be involved with dying people. In the blog writers' group, Paige Dean's post resonated for Dr Szasz. He felt her fear of inadequacy and insecurity when trying to offer factual health information to patients, and her description of how she gained confidence made for a realistic blog post. Congratulations to all authors. BC medical students are encouraged to submit full-length scientific articles and essays for publication con- sideration. Each year the BCMJ awards a prize of $1000 for the best article or essay written by a medical student in BC, and may award a prize of $250 twice per year to the writer of the best blog post accepted for online publication in the preceding 6 months.

Simultaneously, phy- sicians recognized the need for insurance to protect their assets and provide peace of mind to their family, and demand for our services increased significantly. For the Doctors of BC Insurance Depart- ment, this meant shifting our 22-person team of advisors, administrators, and support staff from a paper-based office environment to a fully remote setting. Doctors of BC worked closely with the insurance carriers and our IT team to ensure continuous and seamless sup- port during this time of uncertainty. As a result, digital processes were developed and enhanced to ensure all insurance applications and queries were handled confidentially and in a timely manner. Here are some of the ways physicians can now interact virtually with Doctors of BC for their insurance needs: Schedule appointments with insurance ad- visors via a 24/7 online booking system. Use enhanced videoconferencing tech- nology via your tablets, desktops, and mo - bile devices to stay connected on a personal level. Complete and sign most applications dig- itally (eliminating the need to print and manually sign). Access higher limits of insurance coverage without providing blood or urine tests, thanks to updated underwriting guide - lines. (Please ask your insurance advisor for details.) Access individual insurance certificates outlining coverage and plan details online in the members area of the Doctors of BC website. Pay invoices online, or set up automatic direct debit payments (complete a banking change form to begin). Submit forms electronically to change or add beneficiaries on your life insurance or accidental death and dismemberment poli - cies or to add new dependants or office staff to your health and dental plan. We look forward to seeing you again in per- son, but until then, we are a phone call, email, or Zoom meeting away for all your insurance needs. \u2014Kerri Farrell Project Coordinator, Members' Products and ServicesnEws Your 2019 mini profile is now available on the Doctors of BC website.

Read the post: bcmj.org/blog/new-episode -doctalks-physician-burnout-during-covid-19British Columbia Medical Journal @BCMedicalJournal British Columbia Medical Journal @BCMedicalJournal182 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021182nEws The Joint Standing Committee on Rural Is- sues ( JSC), a partnership of Doctors of BC and the BC government, has announced sig- nificant changes to the Rural Retention Pro- gram (RRP) that will increase eligibility for incentives and benefits and stabilize funding to better recruit and retain physicians into practices in rural communities. The RRP of- fers incentives and benefits to encourage doc - tors to establish and maintain practices and connections in rural communities. The pro-gram is designed to enhance the supply and stability of physicians in rural communities as defined by the Rural Subsidiary Agreement (RSA). The changes reflect feedback from extensive consultations with rural physicians, communities, and health authorities as part of a review of the program. This completes the first phase of the review. Consultations Recognizing that the eligibility criteria had been largely unchanged since the program started nearly 20 years ago, the JSC under- took a comprehensive 3-year review of the RRP starting in August 2018. Facilitated by the Rural Coordination Centre of BC, nearly 600 rural physicians were consulted via fa- cilitated dialogue, webinars, and a provincial survey. In addition, medical and administra- tive leaders in each rural health authority, community groups, subject matter experts, and other partners were consulted to develop recommendations. Feedback included suggestions to address the annual fluctuation of rural points in some communities, to ensure the RRP remains a relevant incentive program including coverage for medical or parental leaves, and to create equity with the business cost premium. The JSC agreed to hold the points con- stant while it conducted the review. Changes to the Rural Retention Program Effective 1 April 2021, the changes are: A temporary reduction of the RRP in- come eligibility threshold. The JSC rec - ognizes that COVID-19 has impacted professional practice. To broadly support physicians whose income may have been impacted, the income requirement for eli - gibility of the RRP flat fee in 2021/22 has been reduced from $75 000 to $65 000. New and retroactive eligibility for phy- sicians on parental leave or planning medical leave are available. Until now, physicians on parental or medical leave were not eligible to receive RRP pay - ments. To support physicians to stay in the community, the changes mean that physicians will be eligible for the RRP flat fee payment and their earned RCME benefit for a period of 12 months, effec - tive retroactively to 1 April 2020. The Rural Business Cost Modifier (RBCM) is being introduced to support physicians who reside and practise in rural communities. This change aligns pay - ments to rural physicians with doctors in urban areas who are eligible for the business cost premium payments as per the recent Physician Master Agreement. An increase will be added to rural phy - sicians' RRP flat fee payment disbursed through the health authority on behalf of the JSC. The minimum point threshold to be eligible for full rural benefits has been reduced from 6.0 to 1.5 points. The com - munities falling between 1.5 and 14.99 points will now be considered \"C\" des - ignated communities and will be eligible for those benefits. This means that more communities will be eligible for RRP payments for their physicians, and they will be able to continue to receive other benefits under the RSA. To help mitigate year-to-year variations and uncertainties, and to appropriately stabilize the community points, the JSC will now implement point assessments using a five-year rolling average. This will ease the year-to-year fluctuations, stabilizing payments and benefit levels in communities.

T 604 6 38 BC al Journal vol. 63 no. 4 | May 2021The British Columbia Medical Journal is a general medical journal that seeks to con- tinue the education of physicians through review articles, scientific research, and updates on contemporary clinical practices while providing a forum for medical debate. Several times a year, the BCMJ presents a theme issue devoted to a particular discipline or disease entity. We welcome letters, blog posts, articles, and sci- entific papers from physicians in British Columbia and elsewhere. Manuscripts should not have been submitted to any other publication. Articles are subject to copyediting and editorial revisions, but authors remain responsible for statements in the work, including editorial changes; for accuracy of references; and for obtaining permissions. The cor- responding author of scientific articles will be asked to check page proofs for accuracy. The BCMJ endorses the \"Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals\" by the Inter- national Committee of Medical Journal Editors (updated December 2016), and encourages authors to review the complete text of that document at www.icmje.org. All materials must be submitted electronically, preferably in Word, Editorial process Letters to the editor, articles, and scientific papers must be reviewed and accepted by the BCMJ's eight-member Editorial Board prior to publication. The Board normally meets the last Friday of every month, at which time submissions are distributed for review the following month. We do not acknowl- edge receipt of submissions; the editor will contact authors of articles by email once the submission has been reviewed by the Board (usually within 8 to 10 weeks of submission). The general criteria for acceptance include accuracy, relevance to practising BC physicians, validity, originality, and clarity. The editor contacts authors to inform them whether the paper has been rejected, conditionally accepted (that is, accepted with revisions), or accepted as submitted. Authors of letters are contacted only if the letter is accepted and editorial staff need further information.

Please adhere to the follow- ing guidelines: Images must be high resolution; if unsure, send highest resolution possible and we will advise if necessary. Number figures consecutively in the order of their first citation in the text and supply a brief title for each. Place titles and explanations in legends, not in or on the illustrations themselves. Provide internal scale markers for photomicro-graphs. Ensure each figure is cited in the text. Color is not normally available, but if it is neces-sary, an exception may be considered. Units Report measurements of length, height, weight, and volume in metric units. Give temperatures in degrees Celsius and blood pressures in millimetres of mercury.
