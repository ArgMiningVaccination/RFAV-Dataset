The guiding principles for revision of the standards have mainly been the experience of stake holders including assessors, hospitals, members of accreditation and technical committees and industry experts . Before finalization of these, public op inion was also sought. Secretariat of NABH did bulk of job by collating and assimilating the feedback information, linking with relevant chapters and presenting to the technical committee for deliberations. This was again discussed in detail by industry ex perts. It was finally and extensively reviewed by Committee appointed by Ministry of AYUSH, which went in to thought process and came out with the edition, which is now in your hands. The accreditation standards are not expected to be prescriptive. They only lay down the requirements and it is up to the healthcare organizations to come out with the systems, processes and modes of measuring performance indicators, which can demonstrate compliance to the requirements as specified in the standard. NABH has tried its best to be as objective and pragmatic as possible. There can be more than one way, by which a n Ayurveda healthcare organisation can comply with the requirements of the standards. Three books are being made available for use by the stakeholders ie 2nd edition Standards book, a guidebook containing glossary and a compilation of va rious practices in the form of annexures, including matrix for calculating quality indicators and other relevant material . Accreditation as we know is basically a framew ork which helps healthcare organizations to establish objective systems aimed at patient safety and quality of care. Documentation plays an important role in defining such systems. Wherever there are references to documented requirements, it needs to be cl early understood that such documentation needs to be established and understood at all levels, reviewed at regular intervals, and controlled and evidenced for their effective implementation by way of records. The second edition of these standards has put more focus on clinical care aspects. Structural requirement which used to be a separate book in first edition, have been incorporated in second edition at appropriate places. \u00a9 National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Provid ers vi The requirements of the standards shall have to be identified; evidenced by data gathered, analysed and interpreted with the aim of improving the quality system of a hospital. Wherever the word shall/should is used, it is imperative that the organisation implement the same. Where the phrase can/could/preferable is used the organisatio n would use its discretion and implement it according to the practicability of the proposed guidance. In general, the organisation will need to establish clear evidence backed by robust systems and data collection to prove that they are complying with the intent of the standards. These systems are as we say, defined, implemented, owned by the staff and finally provide objective evidence of compliance. Some of the key issues are as follows; 1. Patient related: monitoring safety, treatment standards and qu ality of care. This would mean to effectively meet the expectation of patients and their families and associates. 2. Employee related: monitoring competence, on -going training, awareness of patient requirements and monitoring employee satisfaction. 3. Regu latory related: identifying, complying with and monitoring the effective implementation of legal, statutory and regulatory requirements which affect patient safety. 4. Organisation policies related: defining, promoting awareness of and ensuring implement ation of, the policies and procedures laid down by the organisation, amongst staffs, patients and interested parties including visiting medical consultants. 5. NABH Standards related: identification of how the organization meets the NABH standards and the objective elements. Where a part of an element, an element or a standard cannot be applied (for example, related to emergency, surgical proceudres, laboratory services, radiological services, etc) in a particular organization, adequate explanation and just ification must be provided to NABH and its team of assessors to enable exclusion of applicability. In particular, it must be ensured that the intent of each chapter of standards is understood and applied. The 2nd edition of Ayurveda hospital accreditation standard is divided into 10 chapters, which have been further divided into 9 8 standards (as compared to 94 in first edition). Put together there are 5 90 objective elements (as compared to 492 in first edition) incorporated within these standards. The incr ease in objective elements is to put increased emphasis on patient safety and also to encourage healthcare organizations to pursue continuous quality improvements. Objective elements are required to be complied with in order to meet the \u00a9 National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Provid ers vii requirement of a pa rticular Standard. Similarly, standards are required to be complied with, in order to meet the requirement of a particular Chapter. Finally, compliance with all chapters is equally important to establish compliance with the Accreditation Standard. The St andards shall facilitate health care organizations to deliver safe high quality care. In the beginning of each chapter, intent is given to highlight the summary of the chapter. The intent statement provides a brief explanation of a chapter's rationale, me aning, and significance. Intent statements may contain detailed expectations of the chapter that are evaluated in the on -site assessment process. For most of the objective elements, interpretation is provided in a separate book just to further elaborate on how that objective element can be met. We are thankful to chairman & members of Technical Committee who have put great efforts to accomplish this task. These standards are equally applicable to government and private hospitals, and are applicable to who le organisation. Standards are dynamic and would be under constant review process. Comments and suggestions for improvement are appreciated. We seek your support in keeping these standards adequate to the need of the industry. Dr. K.K.

This will facilitate in appropriately matching patients with the organization's resou rces. Only those patients who can be cared for by the organization are admitted to the organization. Out -patients who do not match the organization's resources are similarly referred to organizations that have the matching resources. Patient s that match the organizations resources are admitted using a defined process that includes patient and family education. Patients cared for by the organization undergo an established initial assessment and periodic and regular reassessments. Assessments may include laboratory and imaging services. The laboratory and imaging services are provided by competent staff in a safe environment for both patients and staff. These assessments result in formulation of a definite care plan . Patient care is multidisciplinary in nature and encourages continuity of care through well defined transfer and discharge protocols. These protocols include transfer of adequate information with the patient.

The process includes documented policies and procedures that guide the availability, safe storage, prescription, dispensing and administration of medications. The standards encourage integration of the pharmacy into everyday functioning of hospitals and patient care. The pharmacy should have oversight of all medications stocked out of the pharmacy. The pharmacy should ensure correct storage (as regards to temperature, look -alike, sound -alike etc), expiry dates and maintenance of documentation. Every high alert medication order should be verified by an appropriate person so as to ensure accuracy of the dose, frequency and route of administration. The process also includes monitoring of patients after administration and procedures for reporting and analyzing medication errors & adverse drug events. Policies and procedures guiding the use of formulation s containing toxic/narcotic drugs. Safe use of high alert medication is guided by documented policies and procedures.
