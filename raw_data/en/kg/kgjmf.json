In view of supporting WHO in the development of WHO benchmarks for training in Yoga, Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, New Delhi, has been designated as WHO collaborating centre in Traditional Medicine (Yoga)-IND 118 in India. MDNIY, as the collaborating centre for traditional medicine (Yoga), aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine through modern science, research, and technology to improve the health and wellness of people and make preventive and curative healthcare affordable and also accessible to all. The objectives of the WHO Collaborating centres are diverse and include the collection and dissemination of information on Yoga, standardization of terminology, methods, and procedures, generating evidence- based information on the safety, quality, and cost-effectiveness of traditional medicine products and therapies, development, and application of appropriate technology, provision of reference substances and other services, participation in collaborative research as well as capacity building through various training programmes. Yoga has evolved over thousands of years and deals with the physical, physiological, psychological, and spiritual well-being of human beings, especially women. This publication will be a valuable addition to the literary traditions of Yoga. It traces essential yogic practices and contains varied information for healthy living for women. This book consists of thirteen units. The first unit is introductory in nature, and the remaining twelve units present a brief description of menstruation issues, pregnancy, diet and nutrition for pregnant women, the role of Yoga in women of reproductive age, etc. It also educates about the role of counselling in the prevention and treatment of several mental health disorders and discusses the importance of the different stages of pregnancy in women. Evidence-based research describes the importance of Yoga in women of reproductive age. The language and explanations are simple and illustrative, allowing learners to understand and practice Yoga with ease. It is indeed a comprehensive book of Yoga, from a knowledge perspective, and a remarkable treatise on the ancient science of well-being. Good health is one of the foundations of happiness and well-being. Whether one is a career-oriented professional, a middle-aged homemaker, or is entering her twilight years, this book will help everyone understand and manage the key yogic principles and practices for a healthy life. When the health system grapples with change, the least we can do is take charge of our health. Contributions on each subject and topic are based on the Consultative Committee's rigorous efforts, procedures, recommendations, research, and deliberations meant to share the best yogic practices. I hope the publication will be very useful for Yoga enthusiasts, particularly the women population and the inquisitive minds searching for timeless truths in modern-day lifestyle. Dr. Ishwar V.

This chapter makes us understand the Anatomy and Physiology of reproductive system .It is important to understand the feminine strength, the physical and the spiritual- as it has the capacity to move towards the goal, overcoming the obstacles it encounters like river. Men are strong, but women as tough ones. Motherhood is the highest honour not only for woman but also for a man. Woman gets it by nature, but man has to strive for it. We should respect womanhood, respect her self dignity, give her options and occasions for self development.) 1.1 Introduction Women of today face multiple challenges in life. Caring for the elderly people, children, and others in the house, managing the household chores, cooking food, etc. are tasks carried out by women at the household level. The pressures of working women are even more. Women belonging to socio-economically vulnerable sections of society, especially in rural areas, face the additional burden of low access to quality medical facilities. The social stigma and the veiled threat of being subjected to various social evils make them feel insecure and unsafe, both in rural and urban areas. As they fight discrimination at various levels, situations sometimes reach a stage where one starts to wonder whether being born as a woman is a bane or a boon.1 In any community, mothers and children constitute a priority group. The legal age group of child bearing in India, which is15-45 years2,3, constitutes 22.2% of total population (about 140 crore)4, Women belonging to reproductive/child-bearing age group face innumerable challenges ranging from issues of dowry, female infanticide, sex selective abortions, and lack of access to education and health care to being subjected to domestic violence and so on. All these social evils and discrimination from a predominantly patriarchal society have a negative impact on the reproductive health of women. The high stress levels of working women within and outside the house pose severe physical and mental burden on them. More often than not, such stress levels lead to increased incidence of menstrual cycle- related and psychosomatic problems. There is an increase in the incidence of polycystic ovarian syndrome by 30%-40% in adolescent girls.5 These are alarming figures. A study conducted by a non-governmental organization (NGO) states that women do more than 67% of the total hours of work and earn only 10% of the world's income. At the same time, 67% of world's illiterate adults are women.6 In India, child sex ratio has dropped to 929 females per 1000 males in 2021.* 92% of women suffer from gynecological problems. In spite of all maternal and child health (MCH) care facilities, India remains second highest in the world in maternal mortality rates. Women have little control over their fertility and reproductive health. There have been efforts made at personal, social, and governmental levels, but women continue to remain victims of wrong social customs and attitudes7. (*https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1782601) 1.2 Female Reproductive System and Menstruation8 The female reproductive system consists of external genitals and internal reproductive organs. The external genitals comprise structures visible externally from the pubis to perineum, glandular and YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India2 vascular structures. The internal reproductive organs are uterus, oviducts (fallopian tubes), ovaries, and vagina. Uterus: In a non-pregnant condition, the uterus is pear shaped. The size and configuration of uterus undergo dramatic changes throughout the life. It is a unique organ in that sense. In a girl child, the uterus is very small and inactive. It increases in size at an age when a girl starts menstruating. It expands and attains a size of 7-8 cm in long axis, 5 cm in breadth and 3-4 cm in length transversely during reproductive age. After menopause, it involutes, shrinks, and atrophies. To accommodate a growing foetus and other products of conception, the uterus increases in size during pregnancy. The uterus has an outer covering layer called the serous peritoneal layer, a thick middle layer or the myometrium, and the inner mucous layer of glands and supporting stroma called endometrium. The uterine cavity is triangular in shape. The mucosa of uterine cavity is shed off cyclically every month in the form of menstruation. The mucosal lining gets replaced every month if there is no conception. The uterus is under the influence of ovarian hormones - estrogen and progesterone. Cervix: Cervix projects through the wall of vagina. It is 3-4 cm in length. It provides receptivity to sperms for fertilisation. It plays an extremely important role at the time of parturition. It is hard and fibrous in non- pregnant state. Cervix has an internal and an external os opening in the vagina. At the end of gestation and during labour, the internal os gradually disappears, the cervical canal becomes part of lower part of uterus leaving only the external os. Fallopian Tubes: Fallopian tubes are two long tubular structures on either side of the uterus, opening in the endometrial cavity. The fertilisation of egg by sperms occurs in fallopian tubes. Ovaries: Ovaries are pearly white structures, two in number, 3-4 cm in size on either side of uterus under the fallopian tubes. They have an irregular surface with the presence of mature or immature follicles on them. Ovaries do the most important function of producing an egg in the reproductive period of life. Onset of menarche or first menstural cycle signals maturation of the reproductive system. Ovaries serve as important endocrine glands secreting estrogen and progesterone hormones. Vagina: Vagina is a long fibro-musculo-membranous tubular passage extending from cervix to vulva and it opens on the perineum between the urethra and the anus. It has an ability to expand enormously at the time of the birth of a baby. It has mucous secreting glands allowing lubrication. Even in normal condition, vagina is capable of great distension, but in pregnancy the ability is increased many times. During pregnancy, the blood supply increases, the wall lengthens, and vaginal discharge increases. 1.3 Menstrual Cycle Menstrual cycle is the monthly cycle. This is the process of changes in ovaries and endometrium (uterus lining) starting with the preparation of egg for fertilization. This is at intervals of about one lunar month (28 days). The cycle starts from puberty until menopause, except during pregnancy. Figure 2: Ovary Figure 1: Anatomy of Female Reproductive SystemYOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India3 Figure 3: Representation of different phases of menstrual cycle along with changes occurring in uterus, pituitary, and ovarian hormonesPhysiology of menstrual cycle9-15 Menstrual cycle describes the changes in a woman's body going through menstruation, the follicular phase, ovulation, the luteal phase, and then back to menstruation. Phases of the menstrual cycle Primarily regulated by the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary gland in the brain and maintained by feedback from the ovaries and uterus, the menstrual cycle may be elaborated upon in terms of distinct events or phases. The terminology of menstrual phase is based upon the area of the female body being investigated; however, the all terms describe the same 28-day menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle is discussed in terms of the hormones released during those 28 days-follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The menstrual cycle is also described based on the cell structures developed in the ovaries (follicle and corpus luteum) as a response to the hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. Both these perspectives yield the terms follicular phase and luteal phase. If the focus is on the output function of the ovaries, the release of hormones again allows for a distinction in phase terminology-the estrogen (or estrogenic) phase and the progesterone (or progestational) phase. Menstrual cycle is divided into phases based on the changes in the endometrium: menstrual phase, proliferative phase, ovulatory phase, secretory phase, and premenstrual phase. Figure 3 shows four graphic depictions of the menstrual cycle based on different points of focus. 1. FSH and LH released by the anterior pituitary gland throughout the cycle. 2. Ovarian hormone levels of estrogen and progesterone are charted across the 28-day cycle. 3. Activities of the ovary engaging in follicle formation, ovulation, and corpus luteum formation. 4. Endometrium changes inside the uterus are drawn to indicate tissue sloughing or the degeneration of the uterine wall during the menstrual phase and then growth or the thickening of the uterine wall across later phases. Figure 3 elaborates each phase and the accompanying roles of the anterior pituitary gland, ovaries, and uterus. YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India4 Menstrual phase (Days 1-5): In the menstrual phase (also known as menstruation, period, flow, and menses), the lining of the uterus start to disintegrate and are shed as blood, endometrial tissue, tissue fluids, and mucus. Ovarian activity is minimal and ovarian hormonal levels of estrogen and progesterone are relatively low. Proliferative, estrogenic, or follicular phase (Days 6-12): In follicular LH secreted anterior pituitary gland stimulate the formation of fluid-filled sacs or cell clusters called follicles. Each follicle houses a developing ovum (egg), but only one follicle reaches full maturity. Ovulatory phase (Days 13-15): During the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, after about 16-24 hours following the peak in LH (others estimate 30 hours), the mature follicle ruptures and releases the ovum it has developed. Fertilisation can occur within this window of time; ovulation (the release of the ovum) usually occurs on day 14. Secretory, progestational, or luteal phase (Days 16-23): During this phase, the empty follicle transforms its endocrine cells into a structure called a corpus luteum. This mass of tissue secretes large amounts of progesterone and some estrogen. Progesterone maintains the thickening of the uterine walls and causes the cells of the uterus to release other hormones and enzymes to prepare the endometrium for implantation of a fertilised ovum. Premenstrual phase (Days 24-28): In the premenstrual phase, the fertilised ovum is not implanted in the uterine lining; the corpus luteum starts degenerating and the estrogen and progesterone levels starts to decline. This drop in hormones leads to spasms of the arterioles that cause a breakdown of the endometrium. The high concentrations of prostaglandins cause the uterine muscles to contract, which sheds the lining as tissue, mucus, and blood. After the 28th day, menstruation (bleeding) begins and the female is returned to day 1 of the menstrual cycle. 1.4 Absence of Phases of Menstrual Cycle: Follicular Phase, Ovulatory Phase, and Luteal Phase16 The important phases of menstrual cycle are as follows: Follicular (before the release of the egg) Ovulatory (release of the egg) Luteal (after the release of the egg) These phases are regulated by endocrine hormones -luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormones (FSH)-produced by the pituitary gland. These hormones promote ovulation and stimulate the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen and progesterone stimulate the uterus and breasts to prepare for possible fertilisation. Irregular secretion or lack of hormonal secretion leads to irregular menstrual cycle. Follicular phase: It is often the longest phase of the menstrual cycle. It is also the most variable phase. It begins on the first day of period and ends during ovulation. Hypothalamus sends signal to the pituitary gland to release FSH. FSH stimulates the ovaries to produce follicles where the eggs are present. Estrogen make the eggs mature and the thickening of uterine lining. This lining is important for a possible implantation of fertilised egg. Any disturbance in FSH, LH, and estrogen leads to faulty linings and pre- matured eggs/quick ripening of follicles. YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India5 Ovulatory phase: It occurs at the middle of menstrual cycle approximately on the 14th day. In this phase, the mature egg is released from the ovary. Raised estrogen in the follicular phase sends signals to the pituitary gland to secrete LH, which starts the process of ovulation (release of matured egg from the ovary).Medications, lifestyle factors such as overweight or underweight and irregular diet pattern affect the hormone levels and cause irregular hormone production or damage the ovaries, resulting in ovulation issues. Luteal phase: The luteal phase is usually about 12-14-days long. During this time, ovaries release a hormone called progesterone. If the ovaries do not release enough progesterone or the lining of the uterus does not respond to the hormone, it leads to a condition called the luteal phase defect. It causes more frequent periods, heavy uterine bleeding, miscarriage, spotting between periods, etc. The attitudes, opinions, practices, superstitions, and beliefs about the natural phenomenon of menstrual cycle make a young adolescent stepping into adulthood feel as if something unwanted has happened in her life. Actually, the rhythmical and harmonic hormonal changes of cyclic nature have made it the most remarkable biologic event in a female body. Unfortunately, a lot of mis-beliefs and wrong correlation with religion make it the most unacceptable natural phenomenon. Although it is an extremely important natural event as with any other natural system of body. Wrong use of hormonal medication either to prepone or postpone the menstrual cycle can definitely harm the body with a lot of undesirable side effects. Menstruation is a periodic and cyclic flow of menstrual blood from the uterus. It is a biological process dependent on complex hormonal and physiological changes that can be disturbed by a variety of factors17. The normal cycle is 24-35 days but it varies with each individual woman. Menstrual cycle is an outward and visible sign of the periodic activities of the ovaries. This point is of clinical importance because alteration in menstrual rhythm can only be due to a disturbance in the ovarian activity. Regulation of menstrual cycle is done by signals from hypothalamus and pituitary gland. 1.5 What is Hypothalamus? Hypothalamus is a very tiny portion of the brain that is responsible for maintaining homeostasis, body rhythm, and harmony. Hypothalamus can be considered as a major centre in the local area network (LAN) of the body. It receives and controls signals from endocrine glands. Among the endocrine glands, the pituitary gland with both its anterior and posterior portions is in close relation to hypothalamus. Pituitary gland and hypothalamus have a connecting network of capillaries called portal vessels. The delivery of hormones secreted from hypothalamus is done through this circulation to pituitary gland. This is the 'hypothalamus-pituitary' axis. Functions of hypothalamus touch almost every important function in a human body. Hypothalamus -Pituitary-Ovarian (HPO) axis18 Hypothalamus secretes two groups of hormones; 1. Releasing or stimulatory hormones. 2. Inhibitory or suppressor hormones. Various hormones are carried via portal circulation to anterior pituitary and posterior pituitary. Pituitary gland secrete different types of hormones acting on other body organs such as uterus, ovaries, breasts, kidneys, thyroid and adrenal gland and general growth affecting the aging process. Hormones from hypothalamus are corticotropin-releasing hormone (GnIH).YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India6 Stimulati on of hypothalamus (H) leads to stimulation of pituitary (P). This further leads to stimulation of the target organ (Ovary). Any stressful situation leads to stimulation of CRH from hypothalamus causing stimulation of ACTH or adrenocorticotropin hormone from anterior pituitary leading to raised corticoids from adrenal glands (target organ). This is H-P-O axis. 1.6 Effect of Emotions19,20 Limbic system of brain controls emotional behavior. Hypothalamus with its related structures holds a key position in the limbic system, it is the headquarter of the limbic system. Entire human emotional framework is based on the training of hypothalamus. Hypothalamus is less than 1% of the brain mass, but it has an important role to control vegetative, endocrine functions and emotional drives. Emotions are powerful thoughts. Emotion is experience and expression. The word emotion arises from a Greek word'E-movera', which means to stir up. Intense thinking or pondering over a thought repeatedly gives rise to emotions. Positive emotions release a lot of endorphin, which acts as a natural opioid or pain killer. Negative emotions increase the blood levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol and, and other stress-related substances. It is extremely important to control emotions to prevent disease. Aristotle has put it in correct words: 'Anyone can become angry. That is easy but to be angry with right person, to right degree, at right time, for right purpose, in right way is not easy'.' A stressful event in life or evil thoughts disturb the neuro- endocrine axis. SEM-HPO axis22 SEM-HPO axis stands for Spirituality, Emotions, Mental State-Hypothalamus, Pituitary Organ / (Target Organ) axis. Spirituality gives a firm foundation of thinking. If a person develops a spiritual attitude, he tries to go nearer to his own self. As we have already seen, an attitude of introspection makes a person egoless. 'E' stands for emotions. As discussed earlier, emotions arise as a result of the influence of either internal or external environment. Emotions act upon the mind and the mind acts upon the body. This is SEM-HPO axis (Figure 4). Only a perfect balance of physical (HPO), spiritual, emotional, and mental (SEM) axis can bring about perfect homeostasis or harmony in body. Probable mechanism of effect of stress on menstrual cycle21 Stress activates the release of CRH from hypothalamus. CRH activates sympathetic nervous system and also regulates ACTH secretion. Probably, excessive stress stimulates the production of cortisol and endorphins. This reduces the release of gonadotropins necessary for the process of ovulation. It suppresses secretions of FSH and LH. This could probably play a role in the genesis of an ovulatory cycles. Figure 4: Representation of stress on axis22YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India7 A lot of hormones responsible for maintaining the menstrual cycle are disturbed because of stress. They include hormones from thyroid gland, adrenal gland, and hypothalamic amenorrhea demonstrate hypercortisolism suggesting that this could be the pathway by which stress interrupts the reproductive function. A similar mechanism could be explained in the stress of modern lifestyle predisposing to problems of Poly Cystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD), obesity- related menstrual disturbances. The role of pineal gland to maintain circadian rhythm, which contributes to the normal menstrual cycle rhythm, cannot be neglected. Pineal gland serves as an interface between the environment and hypothalamic pituitary function. Pineal activity can be viewed as the net balance between hormone and neuron-mediated influences. 'Just as body is casting off substances it doesn't need any more, so we too can throw off worn-out ideas and self-images and make the most of this opportunity for self-renewal', says, Swami Paramahansa Satyananda Saraswati. 1.7 Yoga and Women of Reproductive Age Yoga practices have the potential to maintain a balance and harmony between the whole body and the reproductive system. This balance and harmony can provide greater vitality and radiant wellness to women of reproductive age. Yoga practices such as Shat Kriyas, Sukshma and Sthulavyayamas , Pranayama , and treat menstrual disorders, poly cystic ovarian diseases (PCODs), hormonal imbalances, psychological and psychosomatic disorders, metabolic disorders (obesity, diabetes, etc.). Regular practice of Yoga helps in the development of muscular strength, prevents obesity, assists in the development of reproductive organs, and in maintaining a hormonal balance. A few modules on Yoga have been prepared and presented in this publication with the aim of providing evidence-based Yoga therapy for women of reproductive age. References 1. Rawat S, Kumar P .

Mandal. 2006YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India9 There are five reproductive stages in a woman's reproductive life cycle. These are (1) pre-menarche (before the first menstrual period) stage; (2) the reproductive, pre-menopausal stage; (3) the early menopausal transition stage; (4) the late menopausal transition stage; and (5) menopause. Between menarche (puberty) and menopause (roughly the age between 12 and 49 years) a woman can get pregnant and bear children. The reproductive system in the body of women is a delicate and complex system. Women's health and women's reproductive health are high priorities for the healthcare systems/departments. As per Population Reference Bureau, the population of women aged 15-49 is estimated at 1742.3 million worldwide and 323 million in India.1 2.1 Complications of Pregnancy Complications of pregnancy are health problems that are caused by or during the period of pregnancy. Approximately 87%-94% of women report at least one health problem immediately after the postpartum period.2,3 Long-term health problems such as anemia, obesity, and urinary tract infection (UTI) (persisting after 6 months of postpartum) are reported by 31% of women.4 The relationship between age and complications of pregnancy is now being researched with greater impetus.5 Commonly seen complications are miscarriage, premature labour and birth, pre-eclampsia, low amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), gestational diabetes, ectopic pregnancy, and placenta previa. 2.2 Menstrual Disorders and Infertility Menstrual disorders are a common gynecological problem among women of reproductive age.6 Pre- menstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a common health problem of women in the reproductive age and is defined as a collection of emotional symptoms, with or without physical symptoms, related to a woman's menstruation cycle.7 PMS occurs during the luteal phase of menses; however, it disappears with menstrual flow. The prevalence of PMS has been reported in 20%-32% women in their pre-menopausal stage8 and in 30%-40% of the reproductive female population.9 Heavy menstrual bleeding affects up to 30% of women in their reproductive period.10 Infertility is a big problem of this age group. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the national prevalence of primary and secondary infertility in India is 3% and 8%, respectively.11,12 Menstrual problems were noticed in 35.36% of women with almost equal distribution in urban and rural areas. The common menstrual problem of dysmenorrhea was found in 27.41% of subjects; another study reported 25.2%.13 2.3 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common heterogeneous endocrine disorder characterised by irregular menstrual cycle, hyper-androgenism, and polycystic ovaries. The prevalence of PCOS varies depending on the criteria used to make the diagnosis, but is as high as 15%-20% in women of reproductive age. Risk factors associated with PCOS in adults include Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes. Insulin resistance affects 50%-70% of women with PCOS leading to a number of comorbidities including metabolic syndrome, hypertension, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and diabetes.14 2.4 Vitamin A Deficiency As per a WHO report, over 7.2 million pregnant women in the developing world are Vitamin A-deficient (serum or breast-milk vitamin A concentrations <0.70 mol/L), and another 13.5 million have low Vitamin EPIDEMIOLOGY 02YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India10 A status (0.70-1.05 mol/L); >6 million women develop night blindness (XN) during pregnancy annually. Roughly 45% of Vitamin A-deficient and xerophthalmic children and pregnant women with low-to-deficient Vitamin A status lives in South and Southeast Asia.15 2.5 Anaemia WHO estimates the prevalence of anaemia in pregnant women at 14% in developed countries, 51% in developing countries, and 65%-75% in India. This would mean that about one-third of the global population (over 2 billion) is anaemic.16, 17 2.7 Chronic Pelvic Pain As per a review article, the prevalence of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) ranges between 5.7% and 26.6%. There are many countries and regions without any basic data in the field of CPP . CPP has a major impact on health-related quality of life, work productivity, and health-care utilisation. It is the single-most common indication for referral to women's health services, accounting for 20% of all outpatient appointments in secondary care.18, 19 2.8 Urinary Incontinence20 For a study conducted in European and Asian populations during a 12-month period, 1250 women of reproductive age responded to the standard urinary incontinence questionnaire. All these women were admitted to the outpatient clinic with various gynaecologic complaints, except for women whose main complaints were urinary incontinence. The prevalence of urinary incontinence was 24.5% in 6.6% women, the incontinence occurred at least once daily. The lowest prevalence was found in the younger age- groups (18-29 years) and the highest in 40-44 years of age. References 1. http://www.prb.org/Data Finder/Topic/Rankings.aspx?ind=18 2.

Lack of exercise, lack of adequate sleep, irregular life style, improper food habits are mainly responsible for the development of a variety of health issues like Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Abnormal Uterine Bleeding (AUB), hypothyroidism, anaemia, deficiency of vitamins, and many other problems related to digestion and other systems including metabolic syndrome. Incidence of fibroid uterus, endometriosis, and malignancies is also increasing, calling for the urgent attention of health-care providers. A high percentage of women all over the world suffer from menstrual disorders and AUB. The first mention of heavy uterine bleeding (HUB) was in the ancient literature by Hippocrates, who was born in 460BC. Since then, the concept of normal and abnormal uterine bleeding has been ever evolving. As we see, patho-physiology, diagnosis, changing concepts of modalities of treatments, etc. are all examples of such evolution. The following parameters are be taken into consideration to describe normality or abnormality of menstrual cycle: Regularity of menstruation: Irregular, regular, or absent (Amenorrhea). Frequency of menstruation: Frequent, normal, or infrequent (Oligomenorrhea). Duration of menstrual flow: Prolonged, normal, or shortened. Volume of menstrual flow: Heavy (Menorrhagia), normal, or light (Hypomenorrhea). Any other abnormality like inter-menstrual bleeding, premenstrual or post-menstrual spotting should also be specified. A. Problems related to non pregnant state 3.1 Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Although first described by Stein and Leventhal in 1935, it is becoming one of the most prevalent lifestyle- related multi-system disorders of modern age today. Global prevalence of PCOS is 2.2% to 26%. One in 15 women worldwide, based on the population studied, suffers from PCOS1. In India, incidence in North India is 3.7% between 18 and 25 years2. In Mumbai, it is about 22.5% for the age group 15-24years.3PCOS leads to a lot of hormonal problems leading to irregular menses, heavy or scanty menses, growth of unwanted hair, infertility, and diabetes. 3.2 Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is reported to occur in 9%-14% women between menarche and menopause.4 The prevalence varies in each country. In India, the reported prevalence of AUB is about 17.9%.4 Descriptive terms that have been used to characterise AUB patterns include menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, polymenorrhea, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and heavy menstrual bleeding.5 3.3 Classification of Causes of AUB A universally accepted system of nomenclature and classification seems a necessary step for medical education. It is important to distinguish acute from chronic AUB in non-pregnant women. Chronic AUB is defined as abnormally high bleeding from uterine corpus, the regularity and/or the timing of which WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE: PHYSICAL PROBLEMS IN VARIOUS PHASES03YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India13 has been present for at least three months. It does not need urgent interventions. Acute AUB, on the other hand, is an episode of bleeding that needs immediate intervention. There may or may not be an underlying element of chronic AUB. Most accepted definition today is the 'PALM-COEIN' classification system, an acronym that describes etiology of AUB. It will be out of the preview of this discussion to go in to the details of this classification system and the basis behind this classification. All those interested may refer to the standard textbooks in gynaecology. However, for uninitiated, the PALM-COEIN classification depicts following:6 P : Polyp A : Adenomyosis L : Leomyoma M : Malignancy and hyperplasia C : Coagulopathy O : Ovulatory dysfunctions E : Endometrium I : Iatrogenic N : Not classified 3.4 Obesity The prevalence of obesity is rising. The WHO estimates that over 1 billion people are overweight, with 300 million meeting the criteria for obesity10. 26% of non-pregnant women aged between 20 and 39 are overweight and 29% are obese11. Obesity affects the health of women in many ways. Being obese increases the risk of diabetes and coronary artery disease, lower back pain, and knee osteoarthritis. Obesity also affects both contraception and fertility. Maternal obesity negatively affects pregnancy outcomes (increased risk of neonatal mortality). Obese women are at higher risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, cervical cancer, and ovarian cancer. 3.5 Macro and Micro Nutrients Deficiency Nutrients like Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, iodine, folate, and iron are required for the normal physiology of human physiological functions. While these nutrients are more common in women after attaining puberty, deficiency of these nutrients leads to anaemia, thyroid disorders (hypo or hyper), low immunity, etc13,14. 3.6 Uterine Prolapse Uterine prolapse happens due to the sliding down of the uterus from the pelvic cavity into the vaginal canal due to weakening of the pelvic supporting connective tissue and the pubococcygeus muscle and aging. Uterine prolapse occurs most commonly in women who have had one or more vaginal births12. B. Problems related to Pregnancy 3.7 Preeclampsia Preeclampsia is the high blood pressure (hypertensive) disorders of pregnancy. It leads to maternal and perinatal mortality (stillbirths and deaths of new-born within a week of life) and morbidity. Preeclampsia occurs in about 10% of all pregnant women around the world. In India, the incidence of preeclampsia is reported to be 8%-10% among pregnant women. According to a study, the prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 7.8% with preeclampsia in 5.4% of the studied population in India.7YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India14 3.8 Hyperemesis gravidarum Hyperemesis gravidarum is extreme, persistent nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. It can lead to dehydration, weight loss, and electrolyte imbalances. Morning sickness is mild nausea and vomiting that occurs in early pregnancy. 3.9 Musculoskeletal Disorders Most chronic pains occur due to musculoskeletal disorders. During the pregnancy period, many hormonal and anatomical changes take place in the female body, which may cause various musculoskeletal problems.8 Biomechanical factors also play a major role along with hormonal influences to produce symptoms in mild to late pregnancy.9 Usually, weight gain during pregnancy results in postural changes that produce pain and musculoskeletal problems. Lumbar lordosis, forward flexion of the neck, and downward movement of the shoulders also occur to compensate for the enlarged uterus and change in the centre of gravity. References 1.

The breakneck speed of life, mismatch of speed at the physical and mental levels, failure of fulfillment of expectations from the self and others remain the root cause of psychosomatic problems. Depression, emotional upsurges, lack of confidence, irritability, and disturbed interpersonal relationships can lead to major health related issues such as onset of hypertension and diabetes at an early age. Tackling the psychological problems depends not only on cultural and financial background, but also on education, the ability to cope with demands of life, and a total positive attitude in life. A value-added enriched yogic lifestyle helps to achieve the goal. Common psychological problems seen in women are listed below1. Depression Anxiety and specific phobias Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Suicide attempts Eating disorders 4.1 Psychological Issues of Women after Puberty2, 3 Puberty is the process of hormonal and physical change that causes a young person to reach sexual maturity. The process may extend from one to three years. Girls usually attain puberty about a year earlier than boys. During this adolescent stage, they experience many physical and psychological changes, resulting in confusion, anger, and being rebellious. They need support and understanding to survive this stage and emerge as mature adults. Learning about the most concerning psychological changes that take place during puberty can help the adolescent to prepare himself or herself better this stage. A few common problems seen among adolescents are listed below. Bodily dissatisfaction and low self-esteem Mood swings Asserting independence Sexual awakening 4.2 Psychological Issues of Women During Pregnancy4, 5 Pregnancy is a roller coaster of emotions and to sail through this ninemonths journey, every woman should be given utmost care and emotional support13*. Pregnant women may feel many changes at the physical, social, and mental levels. During pregnancy, a woman's emotional state undergoes various changes and plays a vital role in pregnancy. As hormonal fluctuations are on a rise, high stress levels cannot be avoided. It may also cause feelings of nausea or vomiting, causing huge discomfort.WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE: PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES IN VARIOUS PHASES04YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India16 Usually, mood swings, concerns about the health of the baby and her own, and irritability are approached with slight indulgence. However, when these are intense and prolonged in time, they may slowly develop into mental disorders. Many external factors such as lack of support from family, friends, and the living environment also cause mood swings. The prevalence of major depression is higher in women than in men. In 2010, its global annual prevalence was 5.5% and 3.2% for women and men respectively, representing a 1.7-fold greater incidence in women6. The prevalence rate of depression in India ranges from 1.5/1000 to 37.74/1000. Higher rates of depression have been reported in the rural population compared to the urban population7. 4.3 Postpartum Issues8 Post pregnancy, most mothers find it difficult to cope with the new situation. Mothers undergoing this situation is generally said to be having 'baby blues' or 'postpartum blues'. The onset of postpartum blues begins on the third or fourth day after delivery, and lasts for about two weeks. Clinically, it falls within a sub- depression state, with symptoms such as nervousness, embarrassment, sadness, crying, and mood swings. 4.4 Psychological Issues of Women During Menstruation9,10 Recent research surveys say that approximately 19% of women aged between 18 and 55 years' experience menstrual-related problems like heavy bleeding, cramp, or premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Other problems commonly seen include feeling sad, dysphoric mood, nervousness, restlessness, low energy levels, hopelessness, or worthlessness. Cigarette smoking, alcohol, drug abuse, and being overweight or obese are also frequently reported among women with menstrual-related problems than those without menstrual related problems. 4.5 Psychological Issues of Women During Perimenopause, Pre-menopause, and Menopause stages11, 12, Perimenopause is a defined period of time beginning with the onset of irregular menstrual cycles until the last menstrual period; it is marked by fluctuations in reproductive hormones. This period is characterised by (a) menstrual irregularities; (b) prolonged and heavy menstruation intermixed with episodes of amenorrhea, decreased fertility, and vasomotor symptoms; and (c) insomnia. Menopause is one of the most significant events in a woman's life, which brings in a number of physiological changes that affect the life of a woman permanently. Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting in the loss of ovarian follicle development. Some important psychological disorders during menopause are listed below. Schizophrenia Bipolar disorders Panic disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Anxiety, mood swings, irritability, and depression Other issues include night sweats, insomnia, fatigue, loss of confidence, feeling of neglected and hot flashes (Hot flash is the sudden feeling of warmth in the upper body, which is usually most intense over the face, nec k and chest.).YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India17 References 1.

Women empowered means mother India empowered. Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru (First Prime Minister of India) Educating female children helps to make healthier, wealthier, and safer communities. Education also helps to reduce child deaths, improve maternal health, and deal with the spread of communicable diseases. Education has a profound effect on girl's and women's ability to claim other rights and achieve their rightful status in a society, such as economic independence and political representation. Educated women tend to become role models and an inspiration to others. Education gives them the ability to positively influence their lives, their families and in wider communities. Educated women have an ability to take leadership roles, especially within the community and focus on societal development. Education enables them to take proper decision with confidence, empowers them, and strengthens their voice in the modern society. Therefore, educating female children is more critical for the development of communities and the society as a whole. In general, education also helps address the current global challenges such as poverty, health issues, ignorance, lack of tolerance and conflicts, etc. 5.2 Importance of Counselling in Women Currently there is a growing interest in the area of women's health, including women's mental health. Women are the biggest consumers of health care worldwide, they make more visits to their doctors, fill more prescriptions and have more surgeries as compared to men.1 Women have unique health needs across the reproductive lifecycle related to menstruation, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause. They have only received attention from mental health professionals later. One must also be concerned about the social context (poverty, violence, discrimination, work inequities, etc.) that affects women's mental health. Gender differences leading to mental health problems have long been recognised. These occur more frequently in women than men, especially depression and anxiety related disorders2. Anxiety disorders are common and are seen in one among ten individuals. The number of women who develop anxiety disorders is far greater than men. The term anxiety refers to an unpleasant and overriding mental tension. Anxiety disorders refer to a range of specific mental illnesses, which include phobias, panic disorder, post-traumatic stresses disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Studies have documented high rates of comorbidity between major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety, concurrently within episodes of illness and over the lifetime of individuals3,4. Within anxiety symptoms are more likely to precede depressive symptoms than to follow them and tend to predate the onset of major depression. Depression is a common mental disorder that presents with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. Today, depression is a major public health problem, and considered as the second greatest cause of death and disability worldwide5. Epidemiological data worldwide demonstrates that depression is approximately twice as common in women than in men, as its onset peaks during the childbearing years of life6. Research studies also show that gender disparity in the rates of the first onset of depression (around 13-15 years of age) and that this disparity is maintained thr oughout life.ROLE OF COUNSELLING AND PROPER EDUCATION TO FEMALES OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE05YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India19 Counselling is helpful in the prevention and treatment several mental health disorders that appear in women of reproductive age. Counselling is a mode of educational system that helps both genders to develop their capacities to the full in the terms of intellectual, social, physical, and moral capacities. Without a proper and systematic intervention to remove the gender discrimination in education, half of the human resources in most countries will be under-utilised or un-utilised. Socio-cultural beliefs and practices in schools often discourage girls from learning and subsequently lower their aspirations leading to disturbances in mental health. Effective counselling helps to improve the self-image of girls and women of reproductive age, and also broadens their educational and occupational ambitions. 5.3 Role of Counselling during Physiological Changes in Women Physiological changes that occur in women of reproductive age are mainly due to hormonal changes during the ageing process. In this period, women will be more prone to mental disturbances and mood swings. These disturbances may be prevented by proper guidance and counselling to the individual. 5.4 Role of Counselling during Puberty Children during 12-19 years of age, especially female gender, start seeing changes in their bodies. This physiological process is called puberty. The changes in hormones start affecting their moods and thoughts psychologically too. Due to these physiological and psychological changes, they experience a great deal of physical and mental modifications. They become extremely sensitive and start experiencing mood swings and fluctuations in the level of confidence. If children are not guided or counselled properly, they could end up following the wrong path and become prey to negative things (drugs, peer pressure, etc.) that could ruin their lives. To prevent this, children of these ages should be subjected to counselling for addressing their feelings and thoughts properly and allowing them to grow into healthy, sound-minded adults. Premarital counselling for women is also essential for identifying their assumptions/expectations and helping them deal with potential conflicting outcomes. Counselling would also help them develop the skills to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of their partner and deal with the partner suitably to bring happiness in the married life. It enables women to live together without losing their individual identities. This means not only spelling out what is common to both but also accepting and appreciating their differences. 5.5 Importance of Antenatal, Natal, and Postnatal Counselling Pregnancy may give happiness, joy, and many other positive emotions to pregnant women. However, a whirlwind of emotions, mental distress, anxiety, sadness, and a sense of inadequacy may also occur during the period of pregnancy. They have to create a new identity as a mother, which is challenging, and they have to deal with physical, psychological, relationship, and emotional changes too. Proper guidance and counselling can help them overcome the emotional difficulties and deal with their new identity as a mother. Prenatal counselling for pregnant women helps to heal any old psychological injury, so that pregnant women can be mentally free any kind of stress. For instance, traumas experienced in their childhood have the potential to give them a negative impact on their physical and psychological well-being, either consciously or unconsciously. Such situations can be avoided through prenatal counselling. Postnatal counselling will facilitate a good relationship and a healthy attachment with the new-born baby.YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India20 5.6 Counselling at the Stages of Pre-menopause and Onset of Menopause Menopause is the normal, natural transition in a woman's life that happens between the ages of 40 and50. During this time, ovaries get smaller and stop producing the hormones estrogen and progesterone that control the menstrual cycle. During this time, there will be depletion of eggs due to which fertility declines. Eventually, women at this stage are no longer able to become pregnant. Menopause has three stages - premenopausal, menopause, and post menopause. About 3.5 years before the onset of menopause, the secretion of estrogen starts to reduce leading to irregular menstrual cycles; this condition is called premenopausal stage. Women may feel the signs and symptoms of hot flashes, sleep disturbances (insomnia), mood changes(irritability, depression, anxiety, etc.) during these three stages of menopause. Counselling helps them understand the physiological and psychological changes and maintain their mental and physical health. Yoga and Counselling in the management of diseases7 The role of a counsellor is to empathetic and not sympathetic. A good Yoga instructor should try to be a good listener. It is important to remove all mis-conceptions about yoga as therapy, and at the same time to build confidence in the mind of the beneficiary. Skillful talking is essential find out the root cause of trouble. Counselling should be helpful to vent out negativity and build positivity. Releasing stress itself doubles the benefit of practices. Counselling plays an important role in the management of various diseases. Given below are a few instructions that could be useful to yoga therapists (as counsellors) and also to those who aspire to become counsellors. 1. Give a very warm welcome to the beneficiary with a smiling face. 2. Establish intimacy with the beneficiary by taking her into confidence. 3. Patience is mandatory. 4. Show limited compassion. 5. Try to find out skillfully the root cause of sufferings. 6. Beneficiary will not open out fully in one sitting. So, have more sittings, if necessary. 7. Some beneficiaries talk too much, stop them skillfully. They should not feel insulted. 8. Try to collect family history and also history of the disease. 9. Try to ascertain the nature of the beneficiary (whether sensitive, emotional, bold, timid, reserve minded, open minded, etc.). 10. In some people, too much discipline or expectation of being perfect is also a cause of tension. Advise them to change the thinking pattern and make necessary adjustments to cope with unwanted happenings. 11. Bear in mind that all persons are not alike. This factor should be given due consideration while fixing the treatment modalities. 12. The tremendous speed of the mind is the cause of most diseases or sufferings. Therefore, slowing down the speed by adopting certain yogic practices is the remedy. 13. Make her understand that acceptance is half the solution, so accept whatever has come to her.YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India21 14. Remove the fears, phobias, and complexes and infuse intense desire to come out of the trouble. This type of motivation and determination is necessary. 15. Change her attitude towards life in general and the disease in particular. 16. Convince to change her lifestyle. 17. Advise to enjoy some hobbies and also life not for material gains but for true happiness and satisfaction. Real happiness does not depend upon material things, it comes from within. 18. The modern concept of managing the disease is:'Programming can be changed, it must be changed'. ('I am definitely going to suffer from asthma because my parents are suffering from it'; this is a programmed mind.) 19. Look at the sufferings from different perspectives. Take it as an opportunity to bring total transformation. 20. Make the beneficiary understand her own hidden potential for self-healing. If she firmly resolves to come out of the sufferings, nothing is impossible. References 1. Niaz, U. Women's Mental Health; A Millennium Publication.

Parents and society can help before conception , during pregnancy to give positive and healthy input to Annamaya kosha, Pranayama kosha and Manomaya kosha to experience a blissful journey from womb to external world. This input is in the form of good diet and incorporation of Yogic life style.) Pregnancy is the period of nine months or so during which a woman carries a developing embryo and fetus in her womb. For most women, it is a time of great happiness and fulfillment1. During pregnancy, it is of prime importance that various dimensions of her are in harmony. The period of pregnancy (gestation) is divided into three periods or trimesters consisting of 14 weeks each (40 weeks i.e. 280 days is normal duration of gestation period) 2, 3. 1. First Trimester (1-14 weeks): The womb grows to the size of a lemon in 8 weeks, and from the time the respiration increases by 40%, discomforts like nausea, tenderness in breasts, etc. appear during this period4. The following physical changes and signs can also be observed:- Extreme tiredness Tender, swollen breasts Dyspepsia with or without vomiting (morning sickness) Cravings or distaste for certain foods Mood swings Constipation (trouble having bowel movements) Need to pass urine more often Headache Heartburn Weight gain or loss 2. Second trimester (15-28 weeks): The uterus size expands up to 20 times its normal size, women begin to put on weight and the morning sickness will start to subside and eventually fades. The following are the common physical changes and signs seen during this time. Body aches, such as back, abdomen, groin, or thigh pain Stretch marks on the abdomen, breasts, thighs, or buttocks Darkening of the skin around nipples A line on the skin running from belly button to pubic hairline Patches of darker skin, usually over the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip. Patches often match on both sides of the face. This is called the mask of pregnancy. Numb or tingling hands Itching on the abdomen, palms, and soles of the feet Swelling of the ankles, fingers, and facePREGNANCY: A SPECIAL CONDITION 06YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India23 3. Third trimester (29-42 weeks): Weight gain occurs the most in this period. The abdomen starts to transform in shape due to the foetus turning in a downward position for birth.5 The physical changes and signs that happen during this period are as listed below. Shortness of breath Heartburn Swelling of the ankles, fingers, and face Tender breasts, which may leak a watery pre-milk called colostrum Trouble sleeping The baby 'dropping', or moving lower in abdomen Contractions, which can be a sign of real or false labour Though pregnancy and childbirth are not unnatural events, the physical, mental and emotional adaptive changes in the body largely determine women's good health and a positive outcome of pregnancy. The normal growth of foetus can be affected by a number of factors such as pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), or even psychosomatic stress2. It is known that hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) reacts to sustained stress. This affects the uterine circulation, in turn, decreasing the blood flow reaching the deciduas affecting the implantation site. Stress makes a woman prone to abortion, as well as other medical complications of pregnancy. Pregnant women were also advised by Hippocrates to beware of unnecessary psychic stress. Psychological and physical stress have seldom been formally studied but seem intuitively important says William's textbook of Obstetrics3. Maternal stress reacts to sustained stress (HPA axis) resulting in endocrine disturbances, repeated abortions, pregnancy induced hypertension, anxiety and functional impairment, immune maladaptation, premature delivery, small gestational age for foetus and post-partum depression8. Yoga is a simple and natural method that helps in the preparation of the mother and baby for childbirths. Yoga helps to keep body and mind fit during the gestation period and also in the period of pre and postnatal periods. Further, Yoga develops flexibility in both body and mind and helps to reduce the labour pain, and helps in normal delivery. Yoga practice for lactating mothers 9-12 Multiple factors influence the failure of breastfeeding during the lactating period. 80% of failure in lactating mothers occurs due to psychological conditions, especially stress. Stress affects the secretion of oxytocin hormone (the hormone that stimulates the production of breast milk). This leads to incomplete desire of a mother to breastfeed her baby as the milk formation is not smooth or no milk comes out at all, this is called lactation failure. Failure of exclusive breastfeeding will reduce the number of brain cells by 15%-20%, which can inhibit the baby's intellectual development at a later stage. Yoga is easy to practise and is cost-effective too as it can be practised at home. Yoga provides relaxation to lactating mothers and also smoothens the process of the production of breast milk. Yoga movements help to stimulate the pituitary gland and enable it to release the hormones called oxytocin and prolactin to produce breast milk. Oxytocin signals to 'let down reflex' for release of milk, which meets the nutritional needs of infants. The main Yoga exercises for lactating mothers are to strengthen the area of chest around the breasts. The breast exercises become powerful when done along with deep breathing practices or Ujjayi pranayama as well as relaxation and meditation. These movements will provide relaxation and a feeling of confidence in the mother for success ful breastfeeding.YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India24 1. Exercise the muscles around the breast: Exercise helps to improve blood circulation around the breasts, strengthens the supporting muscles of breasts for respiration, and opens the chest cavity in all directi ons. 2. Movements of Asana : Asana focuses on stretching and strengthening of particular body parts and helps to increase the blood flow and secretion of hormones from glands (endocrine) in the body. Asana practices help to align, strengthen, and cleanse the nervous system, especially the spine. Practice of Asanas improves the general health and wellbeing of the body, mind, and emotion/state of mind. 3) Movement of Pranayama: Pranayama is regulated controlled breathing technique / practice in Yoga. Breathing technique is important because it helps to maximise the capacity of the lungs, improves the strength and pliability of the body, relieves tension, increases peace, and generates new energy. 4) Relaxation: Relaxation stage is helpful to raise self-awareness. Practicing relaxation posture helps to release the hormones, more stably and smoothly into the blood for circulation. This relieves muscle tension, feeling more peaceful with quietened mind.

Eating ' Satvik ' , balanced food in limited quantity in a happy frame of mind is necessary to maintain health.) Reproductive age represents a major portion of a woman's life. Therefore, it is important to understand the dietary needs in different phases of reproductive age. The nutritional requirements in a woman vary depending on physical activity, age, gravid or non-gravid state, and during lactating or non-lactating stage. Women in developing countries often face the problem of malnutrition due to deficiency of iron and vitamins. Besides, obesity among women is becoming an increasing phenomenon. Both these extremes can have adverse effects on the menstrual cycle and the outcome of pregnancy. Apart from a balanced diet with adequate proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, fibre, and water, Yogic literature describes a diet full of Trigunas (i.e., Tamasic , Rajasic , Satwic diet). Diet has to be Seemiti, which means a balanced diet ( santulit ) in moderate quantity. Food, according to Yoga, not only forms the body but also helps in increasing the kriyashakti (power to act) and manashakti (will power) in an individual. Diet of mind is equally important. In that context, the following points may be kept in mind. Have good food for generating good thoughts. Avoid mental or emotional excitation while eating. Do not curse the food you are eating. Always pray before you start eating. Do not watch TV or enter into controversies or read when you are enjoying food. As per Yoga, the quantity of intake of food attains as much importance as to the quality of the food. Gheranda Samhita prescribes the following tips in this regard. Divide stomach into four equal parts. Two portions of the capacity of stomach should be filled with solid food, the third portion should be filled with water, and the fourth portion should be left empty for movement of gases. This is a general guideline, should not be taken literally. Durando faulty diet/stale food not only invites ill health, but also disturbs the mind and emotions and causes diseases. A good diet is an absolute prerequisite for Yoga Sadhana. Swami Swatmarama describes six important reasons for failing to achieve the goals of Yogic practices. Hathpradipika (H.P) captures the six reasons atyaharaprayasaschaprajalponiyamaghraha jana-sangghaschalaulya cha habhiryo ghovinasyati H.P 1.15 DIET NUTRITION IN VARIOUS PHASES 07YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India26 (Meaning: Yoga becomes futile by overeating, exertion, talking too much, severe austerity, public contact, and fickleness of mind. Ref.:K aivalyadham H.P .) Atyahara (over-eating) tops the list. Swatmarama further advises not to eat stale, too salty, too bitter, too sour food or food which is heated over and over again. An ideal diet, according to him, should be: . puhasumadhurasnighdhaghavyadhatu-prapohaam manobhilahitayoghyayoghibhojanamacharet H.P 1. 66 (Meaning: A person who wants to follow Yogic path should eat food that is nourishing and healthy, with enough fat content derived from cow's milk. Such food, when eaten in a happy mood and with contentment, nourishes Saptadhatu .) 7.1 Importance of Diet at Different Phases Diet at the stage of puberty1, 2 Proper diet and nutrition are more important in pubertal age, especially in a female. At the puberty stage, certain physical and psychological changes take place during the transition of childhood to young adulthood. These changes prepare the human for reproduction. This transition affects the body shape, size, structure, and composition and also involves maturation of sexual organs and starts to gain secondary sexual characteristics. Any type of nutrient deficiency in this stage leads to ill effects on the future health of the individual and also to her children. Inadequate diet leads to delayed sexual maturation and some type of retarded physical growth. Adolescents need more energy because of their increased activities and basal metabolic rates. They need minimum 2200 kcal/day to meet this energy need for which they have to take proper food containing carbohydrates, protein, and fat in a balanced combination. Their diet at this phase should consist of lean protein sources, dairy products, whole grains, nuts, vegetables, and fruits. Nutrients required during pubertal stage3 Children at this stage are recommended 25% of total energy as fat, with less than 10% of it from saturated fat. Protein need of adolescents lies between 45 and 60 grams/day. Approximately 45% of peak bone mass is attained during adolescence, therefore, adequate calcium intake (approx. 1200 mg/day) is important for developing a dense bone mass. Iron is an important nutrient at the stage of puberty. Deficiency in iron leads to anemia and menstrual disorders. Iron plays a vital role in the rapid growth and expansion of the blood volume. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for iron is 12-15 mg/day. Other micro and macronutrients like zinc, folate, magnesium, potassium, and selenium also play important roles in this stage. 7.2 Diet during Pregnancy4 The diet of a pregnant woman can have a profound and lasting effect on her child's health. The general expression that you are what your mother eats during the pre-natal period stays true in this context. YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India27 During pregnancy, a woman is eating for two, including her foetus. The extra energy need can be easily met by having one or two snacks of smaller amount of food, which helps in alleviating uncomfortable side effects of pregnancy such as vomiting, nausea, and heartburn. Earlier, the recommendation for energy intake during pregnancy was 300 kcal/day in the second and third trimester periods. Now it has been revised to 340 kcal/day for the same period. There is no recommendation for increase in calories during the first trimester. Comparison of nutrients needs Acceptable micronutrients distribution range (AMDR) Nutrients (unit of measure/day) Adult women (non-pregnant) Pregnancy Lactation E (mg) 12 12 15 Vitamin K (mcg) 140 140 140 Calcium 6 Protein: It is estimated approximately 925g of protein is accumulated during pregnancy. Protein is made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks for human cells. It is important for the growth of the foetus, especially the brain, and also for the growth of breast and uterus. It is even more important to get enough protein during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters as the foetus grows faster at this stage. These increased demands must be met by the maternal diet. Pregnant women should consume 75-100g/day of protein (about 20% of calorie intake).YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India28 Fat Pregnant women should consume about 33% of their calories from healthy fats (about 40-60g/day). This energy from fat is used for foetal growth and development, specifically the brain and vision. It also serves as a source of fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids: DHA and EPA Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for the development of human body. As our bodies cannot synthesise these fatty acids, the demand should be fulfilled through diet. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) occur naturally together in foods. During pregnancy, DHA is extremely important for the development and growth of the foetal nervous system. Consuming adequate DHA and EPA during pregnancy is linked to higher intelligence, better vision, and a more mature central nervous system (CNS). Also, inadequate DHA during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk for maternal depression. The minimum recommended amount of DHA for daily consumption is 300mg/day. Carbohydrates It is recommended that 45%-65% of calories should come from carbohydrates, i.e., a minimum of 175g/ day. These sources should be coming from cereals, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, which are rich in fibre.

In the process of child birth, she becomes a life giver, vulnerable to losing her own life also. Postnatal period is the scientific term for the 6-week period following childbirth. During this period, the body tissues, particularly the genital and pelvic organs, return to the pre-pregnant state. Diet taken by the mother in this period directly affects this process. Inadequate diet can result in anemia and malnutrition and it can cause infections and excessive blood loss in puerperal period. Healthy eating is important when the mother is breastfeeding. Mother's body has a greater need for most nutrients. Some of the extra energy required for breastfeeding comes from body fat stored during pregnancy. However, to meet the extra nutrient needs, it is important to eat a variety of nutritious foods. The increase in energy utilisation during post-partum period increases the need for some specific nutrients such as thiamin and niacin. Recommended intakes for other nutrients (e.g., copper, iodine, manganese, biotin, choline, riboflavin, and folate) are increased, based on the amount of nutrients secreted in milk. Iodine:12Adequate iodine in breast milk is essential for baby's growth and brain development. It is recommended that all breastfeeding women should take a supplement containing 150 micrograms of iodine. Calcium:13,14 The recommended daily allowance for lactating woman ageing 19-50 is 1000 mg/day (pregnant and non-pregnant). Calcium and Vitamin D are essential for the growth and prevention of rickets in children. Vitamin D is essential for the absorption of calcium from the intestines. Iron:15,16The daily requirement for iron in pre-pregnancy and post-partum periods is 15 mg/day. Iron deficiency during lactation leads to reduction in immunity and anemia in lactating mothers leads to clogged milk ducts, mastitis, nipple sores, etc., according to MOBI Motherhood International. All of this leads to a negativ e impact on the quality of breast milk and its volume.YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India31 7.4 Criteria of a Balanced Diet 1. Diet should consider age, sex, body weight, habits, physical activity of the person. Consider likes and dislikes, if possible. 2. Total dietary fat should be less than 30% of the energy intake. Carbohydrates about 60% and 10% of proteins (1 g/kg) is an ideal diet. 3. Use of unsaturated fatty acids i.e., use of vegetable oils and fish oils, is advisable. Restrict use of butter and hydrogenated oils. 4. Cholesterol intake should be minimised. 5. Salt intake should be within limits (not more than 5 g/day). 6. Use high fibre containing food. Do not cook an item, which can be eaten raw, and do not fry an item, which can be boiled, do not eat fried food. 7. Less spicy, less oily, freshly prepared (within 3 hours.) Satvic food is advisable. 8. Pay attention to eating. A meal shared with family or with colleagues in a happy mood, with exchange of thoughts and views without any differences of opinion helps to digest food properly. Do not watch TV while eating. 9. Frequent small meals at spaced intervals are more ideal. A proper morning breakfast, adequate lunch, and light dinner should be ideal. There should not be overloading under any circumstances. 10. Avoid irregular timings of eating food. 11. Our tradition considers food as 'Brahman' (Pure Consciousness). Treat food like that and consume with great respect for it. 12. Constipation is a common problem during pregnancy and also post pregnancy. To prevent this, the diet should include plenty of fluids, high fibre foods (whole meal/wholegrain breads and cereals), fruits, prunes, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds. References 1.

Yoga means, value added enriched life style . The purpose of celebrating 21st june as International day of Yoga, is to make us understand the potential of Yoga to make this world a better place to live .This chapter explains potential of Yoga for good reproductive health.) 8.1 Role of Yoga Yoga is the science of living. Yoga is equanimity. It is a perfect lifestyle to bring joy, happiness, peace, and harmony to human beings. Yoga helps to train emotions. A person with a mastery over emotions views happiness and misery without any difference. Yoga means spiritually evolving, Yoga means emotion culturing, Yoga means controlling mind, and Yoga means physical reconditioning. Thus Spiritual-Emotional-Mental-Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Organ (SEMHPO) axis works collectively to integrate all the Levels1. Yoga, far from being mere physical or breathing acrobatics, is a science of body and mind, it is an attitude towards life elevating us to manifest the immense potentialities dormant in us2. The investigations and the research into the physiological, biochemical, neurological, psychological aspects of yogic practices have provided deeper understanding about effects of Yoga on various systems of body3-7. A study by Shamanthakamani etal . claims an improved birth weight with reduction in occurrence of complications of pregnancy as a result of consistent yogic practices during pregnancy. Pregnancy is a state of physiological stress demanding a lot of adaptive changes at physical, mental, and emotional levels. Transmission of maternal stress on the foetus can cause a reduction in trans-placental blood flow, placental transfer of stress hormones, and increased rate of premature delivery8. Pregnancy seems to be an ideal situation to test the effects of yogic practices. There have been studies to prove the correlation of a high state of anxiety with high resistance index (RI) of uterine artery and the presence of pre-diastolic notch (PDN) 9. Yogic practices decrease the sympathetic tone hence, they bring about a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance.10,11 In a study by Damodaran Asha et al, it has been reported that yogic practices bring reduction in blood pressure, blood glucose, and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) catecholamine levels. They also report a decrease in sympathetic oxidant stress due to regular yoga practices. Regular practice of Asanas also promotes placental growth and vascularity. It might prove useful to reverse maternal endothelial dysfunction12. Practice of Pranayama improves respiratory adaptability during pregnancy13,14. Stress is known to affect menstrual cycle. Yoga being the science of mind helps to cope with the stress in a better way.15Yogic practices help to relieve symptoms of anxiety associated with PMS. Practices of ROLE OF YOGA IN WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE 08YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India34 Mantra, Japa , devotional songs, and Naada Yoga can elevate the mood by bringing about a balance in the levels of hormones. 8.2 Special note on different Yogic practices performed Once Yoga is understood as a science of body, mind, and spirit, every effort should be done to attain the highest level of sensitivity to experience the beneficial effects of practices. Dehasadhana (Physical practices) The important aspect of performing an Asana is to attain relaxation in the final posture. In other words, one should be physically and mentally stable and comfortable (Sthirsukhamasanam - Patanjal Yoga sutras) and should be able to meditate on the infinity (Anantasamapattibhyam) in the final posture of Asana. Principle of Sthirasukhamasanam Sthirasukhamasanam means being physically and mentally stable and comfortable while performing a particular Asana . Asanas are supposed to be performed in five stages, as briefed below. 1) Primary or preparatory stage: In the primary stage, a person begins to perform an Asana (i.e., sitting position, lying supine, lying prone, standing position). 2) Marching towards goal: This has to be smooth, rhythmic motion with full awareness. 3) Final posture: Once the final posture is attained up to individual limits, stay in that posture for a few breaths with concentration on breath (Pranadharana ). One should not compete with others to achieve the final posture. There should be no force applied. Stability and comfort in the final posture is the ultimate goal. 4) Reverse action: Reverse action is the way of releasing the posture. It should be gradual and systematic. 5) Primary stage: To get back to the state where one started from and relax in the preparatory/primary stage, before going ahead with the next practice. Only the group of muscles that are involved in active movement should be contracted and other groups of muscles have to be relaxed. There should not be any undue stretch or strain on any muscle. Practice of Asanas is done to 'relax' and not to exert one's self. Therefore, even a few simplified Asanas done in a perfect state of mind prove beneficial. Yogic kriyas help us bring control over uncontrollable reflexes, whether physical or mental. Pranasadhana (Breath practices) Main purpose of Pranayama is mind control through breath control. Pranayama is not simply a breathing practice, but much more than that. It is controlling the prana , which is nothing but embodied consciousness. It is not at all easy. Practice of Pranayama has to be done with awareness of prana. We have to develop a higher level of sensitivity to feel the presence of prana flowing in the nadis. Breathing is a useful tool to bring a balance in the flow of pranic energy to cure a disease or discomfort. Bhavasadhana (Emotion) Bhavasadhana is culturing and sublimation of emotions. Diverting or channelling the emotions for a more constructive purpose is the aim of Bhavasadhana .YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India35 Chanting mantras (Japa ) and singing or listening to devotional songs can have physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual beneficial effects. Naadyoga has been introduced by Swami Pramahansa Bihar School of Yoga', Munger. Naadyoga uses seven pure notes of Indian classical music for concentrating on various Chakras of the body. A beautiful correlation of Shuddhaswara with each chakra in the body makes one sensitive to progressively higher levels of consciousness. Naadyoga is the practice of listening to Antarnaada or Anahatnaada while mantra Yoga is listening to outer sound vibrations. Naada, according to Hatha Pradeepika, is the means of achieving liberation or kaivalya (H.P .Kaivalyadhama edition 4.90/91). Practice Avarohana of seven Suddhaswaras . Attitude of satisfaction, can be cultur ed with Naadyoga . Divya Sadhana (Divine , Dharana, and Dhyana. Divya sadhana helps to make us realise our own potential. It opens the treasure of happiness, which is core of all of us. Divya sadhana is the process of self-realisation.It is the thoughtless state of mind; it is useful to treat stress-related diseases as this sadhana can handle weak, agitated, excited, irritated, restless, impure minds.

Journal of clinical and diagnostic research: JCDR. 2013 Oct;7 (10):2133.YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India37 Studies have shown that Yoga can be used as a therapeutical agent for women during their reproductive age. A few studies that establish Yoga's therapeutical value have been briefly explained below. 9.1 Yoga for Pregnant Women Narendran, Shamanthakamani, et al. (2005) conducted a study to find out the efficacy of Yoga in pregnancy. For this study, 335 (169 Yoga Group + 166 Control Group) women attending the antenatal clinic were enrolled. Yoga practices such as Asanas , pranayamas , and meditation were practised by the Yoga Group for one hour daily, from the date of entry into the study until delivery. The members in the Control Group did only walking for 30 min daily. Results have shown that the birth weight of babies in the Yoga Group was significantly higher as compared to the babies of those in the Control Group. Preterm labour was significantly lower in the Yoga Group. Complications such as isolated intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) with associated IUGR were also significantly lower in the Yoga Group. There were no significant adverse effects noted in the Yoga Group. The results indicate that an integrated approach to Yoga during pregnancy is safe1. A research study by Hawrelak, J., & Myers, S. (2009), Shown 30 mins yoga practice at least three times per week for the last 10-12 weeks of pregnancy is found to be more effective means for facilitating maternal comfort during and after labour, decreasing pain during labour and shortening labour duration.2 Beddoe, Amy E., et al. (2009), have studied the effect of 7 weeks of mindfulness-based Yoga intervention combined with Iyengar Yoga and mindful-based stress reduction programming women going through the second trimester and third trimester. The results show that women practicing mindfulness Yoga in their second trimester reported significant reductions in physical pain from baseline to post intervention compared to women in the third trimester whose pain increased. This preliminary research supports Yoga's potential efficacy in these areas, particularly if started early in the pregnancy3. In a research review conducted by Jiang Q et al. (2015), a total of 10 randomised controlled trials on Yoga for Pregnancy/Postnatal/Prenatal were evaluated. The findings of this research review consistently indicate the benefits of Yoga intervention such as lower incidences of prenatal disorders (p0.05), small gestational age (p<0.05), lower levels of pain and stress (p<0.05), and higher score of relationship (p<0.05). In addition, Yoga can be safely used for pregnant women who are depressed, at high-risk, or experience lumbopelvic pain. Yoga was also found to be a more effective exercise than walking or standard prenatal exercises.4 In a pilot trial conducted by Battle CL, et al. (2015), 34 depressed pregnant women underwent 10 weeks of prenatal Yoga programme. Maternal tension and depression were measured before and after the intervention and the results showed significant reduction in the depression level in the post-intervention scenario. This study suggests that prenatal Yoga may be a viable approach to overcome antenatal depression. The practitioner may have advantages in terms of greater acceptability and feasibility in application than standard depression treatments.5 9.2 Yoga for Menstrual Problems Rani, Monika, et al. (2013), conducted a study to find out the effect of Yoga Nidra in 150 subjects with menstrual irregularities. The duration of yogic intervention was 35-40 min/day, five times a week for 6 months. Results have shown a significant reduction in the thyroid-stimulating hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, and prolactin in the intervention group, compared with the control group. YOGA AND FEMALE HEALTH ISSUES: EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH09YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India38 This indicates the efficacy of Yoga Nidra on hormone profiles and in patients with menstrual irregularities such as dysmenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and hypomenorrhea.6 The study of Rani, Khushbu, et al. (2011), pertained to determining the effect of Yoga Nidra in the psychological general well-being of patients with menstrual irregularities. For this study, 150 patients with menstrual irregularities were enrolled. The Yoga Nidra intervention, developed by Swami Satyananda Saraswati (School of Yoga, Munger, Bihar, India), was used, which consisted of 35 min/day, five days a week for 6 months. The results have shown improvements in all aspects of well-being such as anxiety, depression, positive well-being, and general health in the Yoga group when compared to the control group subjects. These findings indicate the efficacy of Yoga Nidra in subjects with menstrual irregularities7. Rakhshaee Z (2011), studied the effect of three Asanas in women with primary dysmenorrhea. 92 patients in the age group of 18-22 with primary dysmenorrhea were enrolled and were divided randomly into experimental group (50) and control group (42). Three Asanas , namely Bhujangasana (Cobra pose), Marjariasana (Cat pose), and Matsyasana (Fish pose) were practised during the luteal phase. Visual analogue scale was used to measure the intensity, the duration of pain was calculated in hours; and a questionnaire regarding menstrual characteristics was also filledup. The experimental group reported significant reduction in the intensity and duration of pain as compared to the control group8. Yang NY et al. (2016), conducted a case control study in 40 students with menstrual cramps and distress. The subjects were randomly allocated in exercise group (20) and Yoga group (20). Menstrual cramps and menstrual distress levels were measured by using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire for distress. Baseline and post-therapy data comparison has shown significant decrease in both menstrual pain intensity and menstrual distress scores in the Yoga group as compared to exercise group. These research findings indicate that Yoga interventions may be helpful reducing menstrual cramps and menstrual distress in females with primary dysmenorrhea9. In a study conducted apparantely 50 healthy females in the age group of 18-20 years were randomized into two groups. Group I (n=25) consisted of subjects who practiced Yoga for 35-40 minutes per day, six times per week for the duration of three menstrual cycles. Parameters like body weight, resting SBP (systolic blood pressure), DBP (diastolic blood pressure), sympathetic activity, scores of anger, depression, and anxiety, and the score of well-being in premenstrual phase were measured and compared preand post Yoga sessions. There was significantly higher percentage of decrease in the body weight, heart rate (HR), SBP , and DBP in the Yoga group as compared to the control group in both the phases from the initial menstrual cycle to the second cycle and onwards between the second and third cycles. There was a significant decrease in anger, depression, and anxiety scores, the increase in the well-being score was also significant in the Yoga group as compared to control group from the initial to second and third cycle in the premenstrual phase while the change was significant only in the depression score in the postmenstrual phase.10 9.3 Yoga for PCOS Nidhi R, Padmalatha V, Nagarathna R, and Amritanshu R (2013), conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine the effect of Yoga in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). For this study, 90 girls in the age group of 15-18, who had fulfilled the Rotterdam criteria, were recruited and randomised into two groups: the Yoga Group and the Physical Exercise Group. After a holistic Yoga programme for 12 weeks, the preand post data were analysed. The analysis shows significant difference in the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) of members in the Yoga Group as compared to those in the Physical Exercise Group. This result indicates that Yoga acts effectively in reducing testosterone, and mFG (modified Ferriman-Gallwey) score for hirsutism, as well as in improving the menstrual cy cle.7YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India39 A conceptual study by Karandikar A N (2017), tested Yogasanas for their adjuvant therapeutic value in treating PCOS. The study revealed that Yogasanas boosted overall metabolism, increased the blood circulation of organs and tissues, helped in weight loss, alleviated stress, and relaxed the mind and body as well. The selected Yogasanas had positive effects on the female reproductive organs and also on digestion and metabolism8. 9.4 Yoga for Psychological Issues Davis K et al. (2015) conducted an RCT on pregnant women with symptoms of depression and anxiety using Yoga as an intervention. 46 women were recruited and randomised into two groups: Yoga Group and Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) Group. Participants of both groups showed improvements in the reduction of depression symptoms, but the Yoga Group showed significantly greater reduction in the negative effect as compared to the TAU Group. The study establishes the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of prenatal Yoga in the management of depression and anxiety9. Schuver K J and Lewis B A (2016), conducted a pilot study to find out the efficacy of a 12-week Yoga intervention as against a walking group. The research findings suggest that mindfulness-based Yoga programmes may be used as a tool to manage ruminative thoughts among women with elevated depressive symptoms.10 Kanojia S et al. (2013), conducted an RCT to assess the effect of Yoga on autonomic function and psychological status in both phases of the menstrual cycle in healthy young females. Fifty subjects were randomised into two groups (25 Yoga + 25 Control). The Yoga Group practised Yoga for 35-40 minutes a day for six days in a week for the duration of three menstrual cycles. There was no change in the premenstrual phase as compared to the postmenstrual phase in both the groups in the initial cycle. However, the later stages showed significant decrease in the body weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate in the Yoga group in comparision to the control group in both phases from initial to second and onwards between second and third menstrual cycle. The Yoga group also got significantly lower score in depression and anxiety, and increased the score of well-being in premenstrual phase as compared to the control group. This result indicates that Yoga significantly alters autonomic functions and psychological status in young healthy females. Also, regular practice of Yoga has beneficial effects on both phases of menstrual cycle by bringing parasympathetic dominance and psychological well-being probably by balancing neuro-endocrinal axis11. Kim S D (2017), did a systematic review on the psychological effect of Yoga nidra in women with menstrual disorders. The study states that Yoga nidra may give favourable effects in terms of reducing psychological problems in women with menstrual disorders. The study also suggests that mindfulness- based Yoga programme (consisting of Yogasanas , Pranayama , and Meditation) may be used as a tool to manage ruminative thoughts among women with elevated depressive symptoms12. 9.5 Yoga for Musculoskeletal Disorders \u00dclger \u00d6 and Yal N V (2011), conducted a study to determine the effect of Yoga in gait and balance in women with musculoskeletal problems. In this study, 27 patients with osteoarthritis and low back pain were enrolled. Yoga programme comprising Asanas , Pranayama , and stretching exercises were given for a duration of 4 weeks, twice a week. Patient's static balance and gait were measured preand postyoga intervention. The results have shown significantly higher gait and balance value indicating that Yoga has a positive effect on balance and gait parameters of women with gait and balance disturbances that are caused by musculoskeletal problems13. 9.6 Further Research Findings Yoga is rooted in Indian philosophy and has been a part of traditional Indian spiritual, philosophical, and psychological practice for millennia. In a survey carried out in the US, a typical Yoga user has been YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India40 shown to be a female and of reproductive age14. Likewise, 85% of Australian Yoga users were reported to be females and 61% to be less than 45 years of age15. Of these Yoga users, 3% and 4% cited pregnancy as a motivation for initiating and continuing Yoga practice, respectively. Further, between 17% and 19% of Australian women practice Yoga during pregnancy16. While antenatal Yoga has been claimed to hold therapeutic benefits beyond other forms of practices, the number of clinical trials investigating the effects of Yoga in pregnant women remains limited, most data do, however, demonstrate a positive association between the practice of Yoga and pregnancy, labour, and birth outcomes1. A growing body of evidence indicates that Yoga benefits physical and mental health by down-regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system17. Yoga has become an increasingly popular form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among people with pain18. Even a simple home-based Yoga programme available on a DVD was shown to reduce menstrual pain and improve the overall health status. A study observed that Anuloma-Viloma and specific Yogasanas are effective in premenstrual syndrome19. In another research, it was found that Yogic practices reduced the severity and duration of primary dysmenorrhea. The findings suggest that Yoga poses are safe and simple treatment for primary dysmenorrheal20. References 1. Narendran S, Nagarathna R, Narendran V, Gunasheela S, Nagendra HR.

It is necessary to advise a 'tailor-made Yoga course' suitable for needs rather than a generalized 'ready-made Yoga'. 4. Try and develop confidence and positivity in the mind of the beneficiary. 5. Learn about the basic anatomy, physiology, psychology, and pathology. 6. There should be no hesitation to consult a doctor. 7. Treatment of 'diseased' rather than 'disease' with simplification of practices has to be the principle of treatment. Take care of 'disease-induced fear syndrome'. Make active efforts to remove the fear about the disease. 8. Keep the atmosphere at the Yoga centre conducive to healing. The general appearances of a Yoga teacher, his/her talk, and cleanliness at the centre, and self-discipline and silence have to be maintained. 9. A self-motivated and determined Sadhaka (practitioner) responds more to yogic therapy rather than a person who is forced into it. 10. Advice on 'diet' and 'counselling' have an extremely important role. The guidelines for them have been mentioned in this book elsewhere. 11. Asana practice in pregnant women should start after 14 weeks of pregnancy, as nausea and fatigue would have been decreased by this time. Those who are already practicing Yoga may slow down the practice or should practise at a moderate speed. If they feel light-headedness, instruct them to lie down and practise simple slow breathing. 12. Avoid full inversion, advanced back-bending Asanas , which create intra-abdominal pressure to prevent any complications in pregnancy. 13. Pregnant women should be instructed to practise balancing Asanas with support (e.g., wall support, chair) because pregnant women tend to lose balance. 14. Instruct and encourage leg movements during Asana practice as pregnant women with anemia or low blood pressure may get dizziness, nausea, etc. Prolonged standing leads to pooling of blood towards lower limb. 10.2 Instructions to Yoga Practitioners 1. The instructions to Sadhakas have to be absolutely clear as the practices are going to be different for every group. 2. An adolescent would be enthusiastic to practise Asanas ; however, special precautions need to be taken while conducting practices for pregnant women. Certain rules and principles should be common for all. 3. Do not force any Sadhana on anyone. METHOD OF INSTRUCTION FOR YOGA PRACTICES IN DIFFERENT PHASES OF WOMANHOOD 10YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India43 4. Advise tailor-made Yoga that suits the need of an individual rather than a common protocol. 5. A self-motivated Sadhaka responds better to Yoga therapy. Refer to protocols discussed below, discuss with your Yoga teacher and then finalise the plan. 6. Practices should be performed daily for at least 45 minutes daily. Relaxation at the end is a must. 7. Religion, nation, dress, faith, tradition, wealth, poverty, gender, etc. should not come in the way of performing Yogic practices. Keep in mind only the following points. Time: Dawn is the most appropriate time. If it does not suit you, do the practices in the evening. In case both these timings are not convenient, do the practices at any suitable time, but ensure that there is a gap of at least four hours after the midday meals. Allow a period of about two-and-a-half hours to elapse, after the breakfast, or a cup of tea/coffee, respectively. You are required to leave a margin of about half an hour after performing Yogic practices before you take any food. Seat: Spread a mat, carpet or a blanket on the floor and cover it with a clean towel, which should be specifically used only for this purpose. Place: It should be quiet, clean, and well-ventilated. Clothes: Minimum, light, and loose clothes are advised. Do not disregard the seasonal needs and social customs. Food: Take nutritious food in moderate quantity. Do not overeat. Bath: Performing Yoga Sadhana after a bath is conducive to cleanliness of your body and mind. 1) A woman having normal health can perform any Asana . For any physical complaints and their removal, do only those practices as specifically advised and instructed. 2) Brief the Yoga teacher in advance if you have undergone any operation on any part of your body. 3) Asanas of a particular posture are advised to be avoided during the acute stage of any disease. However, as the disease subsides, the Asanas can be performed under the guidance of an expert. 4) In spite of taking all precautions, if you feel a little exhausted while performing any Asana , take rest in Shavasana . 5) Do not start in a state of excited mind. Prayers, chanting of 'OM', burning of incense sticks, purification of nasal passage, concentration on breath, all these would help to appease, calm, pacify, stabilise, and please your mind. 6) Do not perform the practices hurriedly, forcibly, with extra energy or with more pressure, stress or stretch. 7) Try to reach the final posture slowly and with ease. Act according to your capacity, wait for some time and then reach the starting position. According to the fundamental principle of Asanas as propounded by Patanjali , (PYS 2.46), in the final posture you should attain steadiness and pleasure (i.e. devoid of any pain). 8) Always breathe in and out through the nostrils, (except when you are advised to do by mouth, i.e. Shitali and Seetkari Pranayama ). Do not try to stop your breath. If you find that your rate of breathing is accelerating at the end of an Asana , it is indicative of incorrect performance and posture on your part.YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India44 9) In the final position of an Asana , do Pranadharana, i.e., concentration on breathing. If this is done, greater harmony can be achieved. Do it as per your capacity. Avoid a competitive mindset. 10) You can certainly do any other exercises. However, maintain a minimum period of half an hour between these two different types of practices. 11) Women during the period of their menstrual cycle should avoid certain practices/Asanas . As such exclusions are dependent on the physical built-up of each lady, expert advice should be sought in this account. 12) While practicing Pranayama , be aware that we have to regulate our inhalation and exhalation slowly and effortlessly. 13) Do not attempt Kumbhaka (retention of breath) in the initial stages. 14) Increase the time of exhalation as compared to inhalation gradually (ideal proportion of time is exhalation should be twice that of inhalation). 15) Feeling exhausted, feeling heaviness in the head, and losing control over the breath are all signs of incorrect practices of Pranayama . Stop all further practices and seek the advice of an expert. 16) The correct practice of Pranayama would help to achieve ease, alertness, enthusiasm, together with mental peace, happiness, and tranquility. 17) Practise Shavasana or guided relaxation at least for some time. 18) It is advisable to learn practices from an expert to avoid mistakes. 10.3 Yoga Therapy for Pregnancy Practicing Yoga during Pregnancy period supports and prepares the women forgiving active birth, physically, mentally and emotionally. Yoga really helps those who are pregnant for the first time (primigravida). Yoga helps in both prenatal (antenatal) and post-natal phases. Yoga practices during Pregnancy need to be planned as per the various stages of pregnancy (three trimesters). Women who are already Yoga practitioners can continue their practice but they should be attentive to their body changes and movements. They should avoid or modify certain poses and practices during pregnancy (e.g. inverted poses, Kaphalabhati , and abdominal stretching Asanas ). Role of Yoga Yoga practice during Pregnancy helps to improve the stamina and strength of women to carry the baby besides helping them to balance their physical and mental states. Regular practice helps in relieving tension in the lower back, hip, lower limbs, and upper limbs, as well as in increasing the blood circulation by elongating the muscles. Yoga practices improve the connection between the baby and the mother. Yoga practices such as Bhadrasana , Sukhasana , and Baddhakonasana help to strengthen the pelvic muscles and helps during labour and also helps in faster recuperation and attaining the normal posture after the birth of the baby. Practicing meditation and Pranayamas during pregnancy helps to reduce stress, anxiety, and pregnancy- induced hypertension. Yoga also helps to deal with mood swings and increases the sense of well-being. 10.4 Yoga Therapy for Gynecological Disorders Specific Considerations Regular practice of Yoga can negate several gynecological disorders. The only precaution to be taken here is that one should do only those sets of practices that can alleviate specific disorders.YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India45 Once we understand Yoga as a lifestyle, and a healthy and methodical effort towards self-perfection, a few simplified yogic practices can be prescribed as common for all problems. Consistency and dedication in practices are mandatory. Inverted postures have to be avoided during menses. Menstrual Disorders: A. Premenstrual Syndrome(PMS) PMS is best grouped with psycho-neuroendocrine disorders. Numerous theories have advanced on postulating the probable etiopathogenesis of PMS. This includes nutritional, neuroendocrine, metabolic changes, vitamin mineral deficiencies, etc. PMS is a common health problem in women. The prevalence of PMS has been reported in 20%-32% of premenopausal1 and 30%-40% of the reproductive female population2.Symptoms of PMS consist of both psychological and physical factors. Quantification of symptoms is, however, difficult. Diagonally opposite postulates have been put forward to explain etiology of PMS. One of the theories suggests diminished luteal phase levels of endorphin in women with PMS3,4while some suggest an improvement in symptoms following the administration of endorphin inhibitor (naltraxone) 5. Disturbed levels of prolactin, prostaglandins ovarian hormones are also suggested to be responsible for PMS. Role of Yoga Yoga helps to bring homeostasis in the levels of different hormones. Yogic practices help to reduce the sympathetic tone and help to relieve symptoms of anxiety associated with PMS. Bhavasadhana can be of great help. Practicing Asanas such as Balasana, Bhujangasana, Matsyasna, Sethubandhasan, Vajrasana, Pranayama such as Nadishodhana and Bhramari helps to reduce stress and anxiety. Practices of Mantra, Japa , devotional songs, and Naadayoga can bring about a balance in levels of endorphins in the luteal phase elevating the mood. B. Dysmenorrhea Dysmenorrhea is painful menstruation. Pain is a subjective symptom and cannot be assessed accurately by an outsider. Perception of pain during menses is different in each woman and will vary with altered circumstances. It is more common up to five years after menarche. In about 3%-10% of girls up to 19 years of age, dysmenorrhea causes disruption of daily routine with time off work or study.6 Majority of women suffer from mild discomfort. Girls whose mothers have dysmenorrhea are most likely to suffer not because of heridity , but more because it becomes a psychological conditioning. Lifestyle, stress, and occupation play an important role in the perception of pain. Precise cause of dysmenorrhea has to be ruled out by examination and investigations like ultrasonography. Role of Yoga Irrespective of etiology, yogic practices help to withstand the pain associated with menstruation. Practice of Suryanamaskaras and a few selected Asanas helps to relieve vascular congestion. Practice of topsy- such Viparitakarani useful.YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India46 Practice of Pranayama, Naadyoga, and Bhakti Yoga releases a lot of endorphins, which help in taking care of pain. Regular yogic practices also help to cultivate more positive attitude towards acceptance of the problem. Yoga has an important role in addressing various health-related problems of women in the reproductive age. Examples of such problems include hormonal imbalance, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), psychological disorders, metabolic disorders, and in the case of chronic pelvic girdle pain. References 1.

YOGA FOR WOMEN OF REPRODCUTIVE AGE Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India83 (\"Let us revise chapter of our life thoroughly. Let us eliminate disturbing and horrible mistakes\". It is never to late to re- write the history. Wake up, rise and realize the goal. Mental equilibrium is a process to Sadhana. \"Abuse, adjust, accommodate, bear insult, bear injury, highest sadhana\"- Swami Paramahansa Satyanand Saraswati. We are walking in jungle full of thorns. So, instead of removing thorns one by one later, wear proper shoes of Sadhana to protect us. This chapter highlights importance of Yoga lifestyle in journey of life.) Yoga helps in leading a holistic way of living. It combines both physical postures and breathing techniques to uplift the psychological and physiological aspects of health. It has been known to bring in mindfulness, self-awareness, and physical health benefits. The benefits include weight loss, fitness, stamina, emotional wellness, peaceful sleep, and acceptance of one's thoughts and emotions. Yoga, in general, is helpful to both men and women. Now the question arises as to what specific benefits does it bring to women? Women are prone to physical, mental and psychological problems because of their reproductive cycle and related hormonal imbalances. From the onset of puberty to the menopause, a woman's body endures a lot of physical and mental strain. Yoga acts as a restorative process to preparing and bearing all that comes with life. The various Asanas are designed to bring calmness to the wandering minds of the teenagers while making the hormonal imbalances bearable. Yogic poses help manage the period cycles, promote a healthier body, remove toxins, and give peace of mind. Yoga poses combined with good breathing techniques and meditation help avoid emotional instability and develop the reproductive organs in a healthy way. Women in their 20s and 30s manage their career and household chores amidst period cycles, pregnancy, and tiresome schedules. Yoga brings balance into their lives by inculcating a habit that improves their hormonal balance, body strength, self-acceptance, and calmness. While the responsibilities of the world can be daunting, taking out 40 minutes for the practice of Yoga helps bring energy, sanity, and peace of mind. Then comes menopause, when a woman's reproductive cycle comes to an end. The transition period is hard to handle specially with a whole lot of hormonal changes. One is known to undergo fatigue, pain, mood swings, hot flashes, and disturbed stomach during this period. Yoga activates the energy chakras and provides strength to women to deal with their physiological and psychological changes. It aids in optimising the performance of the body organs. It also balances the hormones and moods, while bringing in inner peace to attain a quality of life. Yoga is an ancient system developed over the centuries by the sages of India. Yoga is both a science and art of preparing and purifying the mind, body, and spirit. The main aim of Yoga is to maintain homeostasis of the mind and to ensure better coordination of body with mind so as to lead a healthy life. Present-day women play equal and more role as compared to men besides performing the traditional roles of a daughter, a housewife, and a mother. Now Today, their roles extend beyond the four walls of their houses, and play responsible roles in all dimensions such as in the socio-economic and political spheres. In today's stressful life, practicing Yoga can help women lead a balanced, healthy, and happy lives, besides spreading positivity around them.
