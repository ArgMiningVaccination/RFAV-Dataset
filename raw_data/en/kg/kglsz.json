No cure exists for the symptoms, but in the 1950s effective vaccines were developed and have been used around the world since then. This allowed some richer countries to eliminate the disease entirely in the 1960s and 70s. But large outbreaks continued around the world. In the early 1980s, there were an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 cases worldwide per year [1](#note-1) and the disease was still prevalent in 125 countries. As a response the \"Global Polio Eradication Initiative\" (GPEI) was founded in 1988 to fight the virus's spread and disease burden with a global vaccination campaign. Since then the world has made rapid progress against the disease and until 2016 the number of paralytic cases was reduced by 99.99% with 42 cases in that year worldwide. The latest data on the number of polio cases is always up-to-date [here](http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/). As of 2021 the virus has been found to circulate in only two countries in the world - Afghanistan and Pakistan - and it is hoped that the disease will soon be eradicated globally. Interactive charts on Polio Polio, short for poliomyelitis, is an infectious disease that is caused and transmitted by a virus called the poliovirus. One of the severe symptoms of polio is paralysis and the disease is therefore also known as \"infantile paralysis\". The name poliomyelitis is derived from Greek and translates to gray (polios) marrow (myelon), which refers to the tissue in the center of the spinal cord, which when affected causes paralysis. Paralyzed limbs such as arms or legs waste away over time which is the cause of deformed child legs most commonly being associated with the disease polio. The symptoms vary widely between patients. Most infections do not lead to any symptoms, but others suffer terribly and for some it leads to death. Between 1 in 50 and 1 in 500 infections result in paralysis, among people who have not been vaccinated. [2](#note-2) The majority of infections (72%) do not lead to any symptoms. About a quarter of cases (24%) result in \"abortive\" poliomyelitis which leads to nonspecific symptoms for a few days, such as a fever or a cold, and 1-5% of cases lead to \"non-paralytic aseptic meningitis\", in which the patient suffers from stiff limbs for up to 10 days. [3](#note-3) The poliovirus is found only among humans and is transmitted via the so-called fecal-oral route. In other words, polio is mostly transmitted by drinking water that has been contaminated by the feces of a person carrying the poliovirus. The virus therefore spreads especially well in conditions of poor sanitation, for example when people defecate in the open or do not filter their water before drinking it. The fact that the virus can only survive in humans (and no other animals) makes it possible to completely eradicate the disease from the world - if it was a virus with an animal host such as influenza (birds) or tuberculosis (cows) that occasionally mutates to attack humans, polio could only ever be controlled but not eradicated. Its relatively long incubation period of up to 10 days and three fourths of infections not showing any symptoms makes polio extremely difficult to monitor and the virus can spread for several months without being detected. Monitoring has to focus on identifying patients that suffer from symptoms or rely on stool samples. Because single identified cases might indicate larger outbreaks, the WHO recommends to treat such cases as a public health emergency when only one child is identified with a wild, endemic polio infection in a country that was previously declared polio free. [4](#note-4) Polio can lead to the death of infected patients when the paralysis is immobilizing their breathing muscles. [5](#note-5)To prevent the death by suffocation, Harvard professors Philip Drinker and Louis Agassiz Shaw invented the so called \"iron lung\" [6](#note-6) (shown in the picture) in 1928. Infected patients would be placed in an air-tight tube - with their heads outside - and the machine decreased the pressure inside the box, to induce inhalation, before returning to the normal outside pressure conditions, to induce exhalation. Most patients would spend one to two weeks in an iron lung before their paralytic symptoms faded and independent breathing was achieved once again. In the case of permanent paralysis, on the other hand, patients would be bound to live inside the iron lung for years. As it is often the case with innovations, the iron lung became only widespread when the price declined substantially. John Emerson managed to construct an iron lung at half the cost in 1931. In the meantime, Philip Drinker had tried to protect his invention with a patent and therefore filed a lawsuit against Emerson for using the original iron lung set-up. Emerson did not succumb, claiming that life-saving devices should be made available to the public at low cost rather than be used for private financial gains, and in the end, Drinker's lawsuit failed. [7](#note-7) The falling price of the Iron Lung enabled mass distribution and widespread use from the end of the 1930s onwards. The cost of one iron lung in the 1930s amounted to US-$1,500, which is the equivalent of approximately US-$26,000 in 2016 when accounting for inflation. [8](#note-8) The design quickly spread to Western Europe and was widely used for polio patients there, too. The [data visualization further below](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/reported-paralytic-polio-cases-and-deaths-in-the-united-states-since-1910?time=1910..2010), which shows the prevalence of polio in the US over the last century, shows two large outbreaks in 1916 and 1952. It can be seen that in 1916, before the widespread use of iron lungs, the death rate increased sharply when the case rate increased. But after the widespread use of iron lungs from 1939 onwards and during the largest polio outbreak in the US in the 1950s the death rate did not show the same strongly correlated increase anymore. This is because the breathing assistance of the iron lungs prevented the deaths of the many polio patients suffering from paralyzed breathing muscles - the iron lungs were a large step forward in mankind's struggle against polio. A hospital room in the US with patients in iron lungs in 1952 [9](#note-9) Historical Perspective The history of polio can be divided into three major phases: [10](#note-10) - The endemic phase from antiquity to the nineteenth century in which the disease occurred relatively rarely and did not result in many paralytic cases. - The epidemic phase until the mid-20th century, during which the world saw large-scale outbreaks and increased geographic spread. - And the vaccine phase that followed the introduction of vaccines in 1955. In this phase polio prevalence has been reduced first in richer countries and over the last decades in poorer countries around the world. The hope is that the world will see a fourth and final phase, in which polio is entirely eradicated from the planet. Infectious diseases are generally believed to arise from the interplay of various developments such as humans' settlement in urban structures, crowding that causes poor hygiene, food shortages enhancing populations' morbidity, and the domestication of animals. The exact origins of the disease are not known, but based on the characteristics of the disease, epidemiologists are able to hypothesize how the disease has evolved and spread. [11](#note-11) Because the disease requires a human host and does not survive outside the human body for longer than one to two weeks, the disease could only have developed when humans started to settle in larger agglomerations. Various skeletons have been found with deformations similar to polio [12](#note-12) but the most widely-referenced indication of polio has been an Egyptian stele (pictured) depicting Doorkeeper Roma with one leg skinnier and deformed, both typical symptoms of paralytic polio. An Egyptian Stele dating back to 1403-1365 BC of a man with polio [13](#note-13) Since then, evidence of polio occurrences are scarce. But in different times records to polio-like diseases appear. The poet Sir Walter Scott was infected with polio at the age of eighteen months in 1773 and the disease paralyzed his right leg for life. In his Treatise on the Diseases of Children in 1789 the London pediatrician Michael Underwood writes about a children's disease, possibly polio, that is a \"debility of the lower extremities\". [14](#note-14) Known outbreaks in the 19th century recorded no more than 30 cases as can be seen in the table, taken from Smallman-Raynor & Cliff (2006). [15](#note-15) Polio-like outbreaks the 19th century, populations experienced only relatively small outbreaks. This changed around the beginning of the 20th century. Major epidemics occurred in Norway and Sweden around 1905 and later also in the United States. [17](#note-17) Why did we see such large outbreaks of polio only in the 20th century? Or, in other words, why did the transition from the endemic to the epidemic phase take place? The answer, again, lies with hygiene standards. As polio is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, the lack of flush toilets and the lack of safe drinking water meant that children in the past were usually exposed to the poliovirus before their first birthday already. At such a young age, children still benefit from a passive immunity that is passed on from their mothers in the form of antibodies. These are proteins that identify the poliovirus as something foreign and therefore signal to the body that they should be eliminated (done by either the antibodies themselves or different cells called macrophages). Thereby, virtually all children would contract the poliovirus at a very young age. While protected from developing the disease thanks to the maternal antibodies, their bodies would produce their own memory cells in response to the virus and that ensured long-term immunity against polio. The latter is important as the mother's cells have a half-life of only 30 days (starting from the last day of breastfeeding). [18](#note-18) Once the maternal antibodies decrease in number, children lose their passive immunity. As hygiene standards improved, the age at which children were first exposed to the poliovirus increased and this meant that the maternal antibodies were no longer present to protect children from polio. That improved sanitation was a driving factor in polio outbreaks is also illustrated by the fact that the age at which polio was contracted increased over time. During five US epidemics in the time period 1907-1912, most reported cases occurred in one- to five-year-olds, whereas during the 1950s the average age of contraction was 6 years with \"a substantial proportion of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults\". [19](#note-19) Being exposed to the poliovirus after losing the protection from maternal antibodies meant that they were more likely to get polio, resulting in an increase in case and death numbers around the turn of the 19th and 20th century. The chart here shows the annual absolute number of reported deaths and cases in the United States over the last century; the corresponding perspective on the rate of deaths and cases is shown in [this visualization](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-of-polio-rates-in-the-united-states-1910-2010). Big outbreaks happened frequently. In 1916 for example, the poliovirus infected more than 27,000 Americans and killed more than 7,000 people. At that time, the cause and spread of the disease was not yet known, so panicked New Yorkers shut down schools, public cinemas, and swimming pools. For a while it was believed that cats or mosquitoes were spreading the virus which lead to the killing of more than 72,000 cats and the extensive spraying of the insecticide DDT, in a futile attempt to interrupt the transmission of the virus. [20](#note-20) Each of these large outbreaks came to an end because, like most viral diseases, the spread of the poliovirus in moderate climates like in the USA is seasonal and is mostly transmitted during the summer months. By October 1916, enough New Yorkers had been infected and developed immunity in response so that in combination with the natural seasonal decline of the virus's spread the case numbers had already dramatically dropped and would not surge again. This can be seen in the graph as the US recorded less than 5,000 cases in the following year. Containing the second major outbreak in the USA in the 1950s, on the other hand, was largely aided by the successful development of polio vaccines that would hinder the transmission of the virus. The vaccine against polio What changed the history of polio forever was the development of a vaccine against the disease. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself had been diagnosed with polio at the age of 39 and subsequently bound to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. While this might have been a misdiagnosis in Roosevelt's case, [21](#note-21) his presidential influence was crucial in the set-up of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The non-profit organization soon became known as \"The March of Dimes Foundation\", referring to polio victims' inability to walk, and successfully collected a substantial amount of donations for vaccine research and its 'Iron Lung' distribution program. Years of research went into the effort to develop an effective vaccine. The chart shows the large increase in scientific publications on polio in the 1950s. The medical doctor and virologist Jonas Salk put forward a promising vaccine and in the spring of 1953, the foundation rolled out a large-scale trial of the Salk vaccine for which 1.83 million children in 44 US states received either a placebo or the vaccine shot. [22](#note-22) Salk's supervisor Thomas Francis insisted to introduce a control group into the trial design and thereby paved the way for Randomized Control Trials, which have become a very influential method in medical and social science research in the following decades. The foundation was supported mainly by donations from the American people, who were collecting dimes, quarters, and dollars for decades in the hope of research finally uncovering a way to protect oneself against polio. Oshinsky (2005) even reports that the foundation received donations from two-thirds of the US population and a poll claims that more Americans knew about the field trials than about the president's full name (Dwight David Eisenhower). [23](#note-23) On April 12, 1955, the tenth anniversary of Roosevelt's death, Francis announced that Salk's vaccine was effective and potent in preventing polio. Within just two hours, the US Public Health Service issued a production license and the foundation prepared for a national immunization program. The conference had been live-broadcasted to physicians all over the country who had gathered in movie theaters to watch the announcement, millions of Americans received the news over the radio, spontaneously putting down their work in celebration of the news. [24](#note-24) At 10:30PM of the same day, Thomas Francis and Jonas Salk gave a televised live broadcast interview in which Salk, when asked who owned the patents to the vaccine, famously answered \"Well, the people I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?\" [25](#note-25) His answer was in the spirit of the foundation having funded the vaccine research with American's private donations and his conviction that life-saving technology should be for the benefit of society as a whole rather than for private financial gains. Shortly afterwards Dr. Albert Sabin introduced a live polio vaccine that could be administered orally (rather than Salk's by injection), the oral polio vaccine (OPV). [26](#note-26) While Salk's vaccine only protected the central nervous system, Sabin's vaccine also protected the digestive tract and thereby prevented the spread of the wild polio virus more effectively. The easier administration also made vaccination efforts less expensive as it did not require trained health workers. For these reasons, OPV has been used around the world and it is the vaccination that is responsible for the dramatic reduction in polio infections globally that we document below. The graph of the number of reported polio cases and deaths in the United States shown above shows the impact the national immunization scheme had: Within 7 years, the number of reported polio cases went below 1,000 and by 1979 the US was declared polio-free. It is easier to see this decline if you switch the y-axis in that chart from linear to logarithmic. Numbers of publications about polio by year, 1890 to 1986 - Cambridge World History of Human Diseases [27](#note-27) Dr. Sabin's Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV) was tested on more than 100 million people in the Soviet Union before obtaining its license in 1961. Because its production costs were lower and the oral administration easier, OPV was and still is the predominant vaccination serum in many countries. It was only during the 1970s and 1980s with several polio surveys throughout the developing world that became known as \"lameness surveys\" that it became apparent that polio was as much a problem in developing countries as it was in Western Europe and the United States. Bernier (1984) [28](#note-28) cites 46 of these \"lameness surveys\" in 24 countries, with a prevalence of paralytic polio ranging from less than one to 19 cases per 1,000 children. Modlin (2010) [29](#note-29) claims that these countries suffered from a higher prevalence of polio than the USA during its peak polio outbreaks. [30](#note-30) Mass campaigns in Brazil, Cuba and Mexico proved the vaccine's effectiveness in different geographical areas but only with the foundation of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative at the World Health Assembly in 1988 did the polio vaccine find its place in many national routine immunization programs. [This visualization](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/polio-vaccine-coverage-of-one-year-olds?tab=chart&country=OWID_WRL+South-East%20Asia+Africa+Americas+Europe) here shows how the polio vaccine coverage of one-year-olds has substantially increased around the world since 1980. By switching to the chart view you can see the change over time for each country and the world as a whole. Globally you can see that in 1980 only 22% of one-year-olds were vaccinated against polio, and this increased to a coverage of 86% of the world's one year-olds in 2015. In rare cases, the altered live poliovirus that is used in the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) can mutate and regain its ability to attack the central nervous system (\"neurovirulence\"). This means that a small share of people who receive the OPV vaccine develop paralysis, which has the same symptoms as paralysis from the wild poliovirus. There are two ways this can occur: - Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). If the mutations to regain neurovirulence occur spontaneously - in a person who was recently vaccinated - it is called vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). This is very rare: for every million doses of oral poliovirus vaccines, there have been between 0.09 and 25 cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. [31](#note-31) - Vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV). If the mutations to regain neurovirulence occur over a longer period, it is known as vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV). This can be identified by its genetic similarity to the genome of the virus used in the vaccine. There are several types of VDPVs. They are defined by the GPEI as follows. [32](#note-32) - Immune deficiency associated vaccine derived poliovirus (iVDPVs) - these are VDPVs that come from people who have primary immunodeficiencies. - Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPVs) - these are VDPVs for which there is evidence that they have been transmitted between people in the community (i.e. they are found in multiple individuals who are not direct contacts; from an individual and an environmental sample; or from two environmental samples from different sites or at different times). These can spread in the community and cause new outbreaks. - Ambiguous vaccine derived poliovirus (aVDPVs) - these are VDPVs for which there isn't evidence that they come from people with primary immunodeficiencies or evidence that they have been transmitted between people in the community. The risk of vaccine-derived polioviruses circulating in the population is generally very low, and the world now has new effective vaccines to contain them. [33](#note-33) The vast majority of cases of cVDPVs come from the oral poliovirus vaccine against poliovirus serotype 2, rather than vaccines against other serotypes. You can see this in the chart. In the vaccines against serotypes 1 and 3, there are many genetic mutations that distinguish them from the wild poliovirus strains, which means it is extremely unlikely that they can revert into a form that can cause disease. However, in the vaccine against serotype 2, there are fewer genetic mutations that distinguish it from the wild poliovirus strain, meaning that in some rare cases it is able to revert into a form that can cause disease. [34](#note-34) Although it may seem counterintuitive, cVDPV2 outbreaks are more likely in communities with low coverage of vaccines for poliovirus serotype 2, such as OPV2 vaccines. This is because these communities have lower immune protection against poliovirus serotype 2, which some vaccine-derived viruses have reverted into. [35](#note-35) Although the wild poliovirus serotype 2 was last reported worldwide in 1999, cVDPV2 cases have occasionally occurred in under-vaccinated communities in the years that followed. In the map, you can see the number of cases of all cVDPVs in each country. There are multiple ways to contain cases of cVDPVs. In 2016, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative recommended in 2016 that countries switch the vaccines they used - from using an OPV which contains vaccines for all three serotypes (called a trivalent vaccine) to another OPV which contains vaccines for only serotype 1 and 3 (called a bivalent vaccine). [36](#note-36) Along with this, they also recommended countries use inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV) towards serotype 2 instead of the OPV, because it does not have the risk of mutating to regain neurovirulence. [37](#note-37) However, this comes with a trade-off: the OPV vaccines are much cheaper and easier to administer than the IPV vaccines, which typically require injections. [38](#note-38) Since 2019, all 126 countries that previously used OPV now use at least one dose of IPV. [39](#note-39) Since 2020, countries have a new vaccine to use against serotype 2: the novel oral poliovirus vaccine (nOPV2). These new vaccines are much more genetically stable than the previous OPV2 vaccines, which makes it much less likely that they will revert and gain neurovirulence. [40](#note-40) Like the previous OPV vaccines, the new vaccines are easy to administer as they are given orally, and they are being rolled out to countries with cases of VDPV2 to contain those outbreaks. [41](#note-41) Global decline of polio In 1988, the World Health Assembly - the governing body of the World Health Organization (WHO) - launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) which was tasked with eradicating the disease globally by the year 2000. [42](#note-42) The eradication of the disease in just 12 years was an ambitious plan, polio was still endemic in 125 countries of the world in 1988. The GPEI was set up as a public-private-partnership and today brings together several organizations, among which are the WHO, UNICEF, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Rotary International and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. [43](#note-43) As can be seen in the [graphic depicting the decade of the last recorded paralytic polio cases below](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-decade-of-the-last-recorded-case-of-paralytic-polio-by-country), several countries had either eradicated or were very close to eradicating polio in 1988. They had achieved that by way of routine immunization programs which entails the basic schedule of each child receiving three Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV) before its first birthday. Since its inauguration in 1988, the GPEI has offered support for these routine immunization programs to governments, but in addition to these the GPEI also ran - National Immunization Days (NIDs), on which children receive two doses of OPV 4-8 weeks apart regardless of their immunization history, - outbreak response immunization programs, for which all children below the age of five years in the vicinity of a detected case of paralytic polio receive one OPV dose, and - mopping-up immunization programs, during which under-five-year-olds living in outbreak-prone areas are visited in their homes and receive two OPV doses one month apart. Even though the GPEI has not yet reached the goal of eradicating polio, it has been successful in reducing the prevalence of polio around the world: reported polio cases have been reduced by 99.99% and two of its three serotypes have already been eradicated. In 2017 the polio virus is endemic in three countries only: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan - colored in dark red in the map. Up-to-date information on polio is available on the website of the GPEI [here](http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/). The map displays the year of the last recorded case of polio for each country and each decade is color-coded. You can see that the Americas were the first world region to be certified polio-free in 1994. The WHO certifies not individual countries but only entire world regions as polio-free. The considered world regions are the six [WHO world regions](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/who-regions): Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific. To be certified polio-free, a WHO region needs to (i) record no wild indigenous polio case for at least three years, (ii) have a reliable surveillance system in place, and (iii) prove its capacity to detect and respond to imported polio cases. [44](#note-44) The interactive map shows for each country when the last case of endemic paralytic polio was recorded. The map also shows when the four polio-free WHO regions achieved this status, three years after the last country in that WHO region recorded the last endemic polio case. The visualization documents the number of reported polio cases from wild polioviruses (WPVs) by country. The number of reported cases is an underestimate of actual polio cases, because some cases go undetected or unreported. Wild polioviruses refer to the polioviruses that have been historically endemic in many countries, and excludes vaccine-derived polioviruses. You can explore this data for many countries using the \" Add country \" button. In 2001, there were 14 countries that reported cases of wild polioviruses. By 2021 there were only three countries where wild poliovirus cases were recorded: Afghanistan, Pakistan and Malawi. Until recently, there were three strains of wild polioviruses. Poliovirus serotypes 2 and 3 have both been eradicated globally. The last case of wild poliovirus serotype 2 was seen in 1999 in India, while the last case of wild poliovirus serotype 3 was seen in 2012 in Nigeria. That means they were declared globally eradicated by the WHO in 2015 and 2019 respectively. All reported cases since 2013 from wild polioviruses have been caused by wild poliovirus serotype 1. The interactive visualization highlights the global decline in the number of paralytic polio cases from 1980 onwards. In the early 1980s, an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 people suffered from paralytic polio cases every year. In 2020 there were 1873 paralytic polio cases. In the 1980s the world saw many more paralytic polio cases every week than today in an entire year. The cases are shown for each of the six WHO world regions and you can change the view from absolute to relative numbers of polio cases by clicking on \"Relative\" in the chart. In the 1980s between 50% and 75% of all estimated cases occurred in the South-East Asia region, this region has not recorded a single case after 2011 and was certified to be polio free in 2014. This data of the estimated total number of paralytic polio cases is based on the number of [reported paralytic polio cases](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-number-of-reported-paralytic-polio-cases-by-world-region). Our estimations of the total number follow the methodology by Tebbens et al. (2010) [45](#note-45) which estimates how widespread underreporting - especially in earlier periods - of polio is and then corrects the number of paralytic polio cases to arrive at the estimated true number of cases. For many countries, Tebbens et al. apply a correction factor of 7, which means that they multiply the number of reported paralytic polio cases with seven to arrive at the true number of paralytic polio cases per country. We discuss how we adapted their method to apply correction factors to all countries, including those that did not receive GPEI support, on a separate page [here](https://ourworldindata.org/estimating-total-global-paralytic-polio-cases). Other sources estimated similar figures. The WHO estimated the number of paralytic polio cases to be between 200,000 to 300,000 per year during the 1980s. [46](#note-46) The visualization documents the number of reported polio cases by country from 1980 onwards. The number of reported cases is an underestimate of actual polio cases, because some cases go undetected or unreported. Reported polio cases include endemic, imported and vaccine-derived cases. For instance, the United States, which eliminated polio in 1978, still recorded some polio cases in the 1980s because imported cases were included. This is also the case for countries that only recently achieved their polio-free status, such as India and Nigeria. Although Nigeria has been certified polio-free, this status refers to the wild polioviruses specifically. As you can see, several countries continue to report polio cases in 2021, which is due to vaccine-derived polioviruses. Cases of polio have fallen dramatically over time. In 1980, there were over 50,000 reported cases of polio worldwide. But in 2021, this number was down to 649. The interactive map presents the number of polio cases per 1 million inhabitants of each country, to account for differences in the population size and make comparisons between countries more meaningful. You can press play in the bottom left corner to show the change over time. It can be clearly seen how the WHO regions achieved their polio-free status, the Americas for example were certified in 1994. By clicking on any country you can see the change over time of the polio rate in that country. The costs and benefits of eradicating polio It is estimated that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative led to the prevention of 2.17 million cases of paralytic polio between 1988 (when the GPEI began) and 2018. [47](#note-47) The chart visualizes the benefit of the eradication campaign by comparing the actual cases with an alternative history in which the GPEI did not exist. The red part of the chart is based on a model that estimates the number of paralytic polio cases without the eradication campaign, for the 105 countries that received support from the GPEI. Without the eradication campaign, this study assumed that the coverage rates of polio vaccines would match the rates of other routine vaccines in countries during the same time period. The benefits of this global health campaign are not limited to polio itself. In addition to preventing paralytic polio, many children around the world have received other health benefits that were made available to them as part of the polio immunization campaigns. These are called supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), where other vaccinations and nutritional supplements have been distributed. [48](#note-48) The GPEI received US-$15.2 billion in donations from 1985 to 2019. [49](#note-49) The large majority was only received from 2004 onwards, as the graph from their [Financial Resources Requirement Report in 2016](http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/FRR2013-2019_April2016_EN_A4.pdf) shows. This funding contributed to additional polio eradication efforts in the form of National Immunization Days (NIDs), outbreak response immunization and mopping-up immunization. Current expenditure on polio eradication and the Endgame Strategic Plan In 2013, the GPEI launched an ambitious five year plan to fully eradicate polio called [Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018](http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/PEESP_EN_A4.pdf) which would cost US-$5.5 billion (in 2015 it was increased by a year and extended to US-$7 billion), also see the section on [the benefits of eradication rather than reduction](https://ourworldindata.org/polio/#benefits-of-eradication-rather-than-reduction) for more information. Even though polio was endemic in only Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2013, it proved especially difficult to monitor the virus and to reach every child for immunization in these contexts which makes the endgame strategy so expensive in comparison to the GPEI's previous budget. That's why, in 2016, US-$536 million of the total GPEI budget of US-$925 million were spent in these three countries. However, the GPEI is still actively supplementing immunization projects in 39 other countries to prevent the poliovirus's transmission across borders and the disease's re-establishment. [51](#note-51) The map indicates which these countries are that still receive support from the GPEI; only six of these fund their immunization efforts partially themselves. From 2016 to 2019, the GPEI intends to spend 80% of its budget (US-$3,062 million) on detecting and interrupting polio which includes their support of OPV campaigns and Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA) schedules. The initiative's remaining objectives are to (i) replace the oral with the injection vaccine, funded with US-$431 million, to (ii) contain poliovirus stocks, funded with US-$60 million and to (iii) plan for the transition to a post-polio world, funded with US-$26 million. To put these numbers into perspective, [global malaria financing](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/254912/1/WHO-HTM-GMP-2017.4-eng.pdf?ua=1) amounted to US-$2.9 billion in 2015 which was more than twice as large as the GPEI's budget of US-$1.39 billion one year later in 2016. Or, to give a second comparison, in 2016 the US government spent [US-$1,116 billion](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52409) on major health care projects, a budget that is more than 800 times larger than the GPEI's global spending on polio in the same year. Even in comparison to the total $7 billion budget for the entire Polio Eradication & Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 the US Department's health expenditures are 142 times that. [53](#note-53) In 2013, the GPEI implemented \"The Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018\", costing an additional $5.5 billion in addition to the already $9 billion spent by the organization since its implementation in 1988. The initiative hopes to especially finance the last stretch of vaccination campaigns in the three countries where polio is still endemic today (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria), keep the remaining countries, especially in the vicinity of the former, polio-free and closely monitor the occurrence for at least three years after the last reported case. Even though the additional financial needs seem very high, the GPEI argues that eradication is the most cost-effective strategy, by illustrating in their graphic reproduced here that the long-term costs of controlling rather than eradicating will be substantially higher. The benefits of eradicating polio extend beyond the health domain of having less people suffering paralytic polio. In the economic domain, less polio patients translates into lower healthcare costs. Furthermore, once the virus has been eradicated, the world can stop the production and administration of the polio vaccine as well as the extensive surveillance of paralytic diseases suspected to be polio. The discontinuation of these costly activities will therefore result in extensive economic gains from eradication, as well. It is very difficult to accurately estimate these economic gains as it requires assumptions on for example the marginal economic value of a healthy person over a paralyzed polio patient or until what year you calculate these gains for. Tebbens et al. (2010) [54](#note-54) have attempted such a modeling exercise and arrive at a net benefit of adding GPEI vis-\u00e0-vis just national routine immunization of US-$40-50 billion in their chosen time horizon of 1988 to 2035. Such a cost benefit analysis is made even more difficult by having to extrapolate the actual case counts from reported incidence figures, which is explained in more detail in [our data quality section](https://ourworldindata.org/polio/#global-polio-data-after-1988) below. The GPEI's estimation of eradication vs. control costs due to polio [55](#note-55) With 72% of polio infections not leading to any symptoms - and 99.5% of cases resulting in only temporary symptoms - it would be extremely difficult to record all cases of polio. The number of detected polio cases is lower than the total number of cases and the gap is larger when monitoring was less complete in the past. The set-up of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative brought about a global surveillance and monitoring framework that includes the counting of only those cases that resulted in permanent paralysis. Therefore, it should be taken into account that data on polio - especially historical data - is associated with considerable mismeasurement. This greatly inhibits our ability to compare the disease burden of polio historically across countries as well. [56](#note-56) As we have explained above, only 0.5% of polio infections lead to permanent paralysis. It is this subgroup of polio victims with the most severe symptoms - paralysis - that is cited in most discussions regarding the prevalence of polio. But unfortunately authors do not always make this clear, and instead of referring to the 'number of reported cases of polio' - as it is commonly done - it would be accurate and more complete to speak of the 'number of reported paralytic cases of polio' when this is what is actually referred to. The great variance in reporting standards even within countries was already nicely illustrated by Dauer in 1946. [57](#note-57) He compared the number of reported deaths due to polio with the number of reported cases of polio. The reproduced map shows this ratio for each US state between 1940 and 1944. The national average of 11.2 cases per reported death was used as a benchmark and while the author acknowledges that some variation might be due to differences in virulence among different strains of the poliovirus, this variation is not powerful enough to explain such stark differences in the ratio across different parts of the USA. Instead, Dauer attributes these differences to varying reporting practices. Furthermore, in years of larger-scale polio outbreaks more non-paralytic cases are recorded than in years with smaller paralytic polio case counts. In the past children's paralysis was often not correctly diagnosed as polio. Stool samples need to be analyzed to be able to distinguish paralytic symptoms from Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, transverse myelitis, or traumatic neuritis. [58](#note-58) Reported number of polio cases per polio deaths in the United States, 1940-1944 [59](#note-59) With the establishment of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 1988, monitoring and reporting procedures became standardized around the world. The GPEI's surveillance system relies on the detection of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), which refers to paralytic symptoms more generally and is occurring in a population for reasons other than polio, such as trauma or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). Having to report all cases of AFP in any child under 15 years of age means that a country with a good monitoring system in place should detect [at least 1 AFP case per 100,000 under-15-year-olds](https://web.archive.org/web/20190410031140/http://polioeradication.org:80/who-we-are/strategy/surveillance/). If the number of AFP cases is less than 1 per 100,000 under-15-year-olds then there is reason to suspect that paralytic polio cases too are underreported. Each case of AFP should be followed by a diagnosis to find its cause. Within 14 days of the onset of AFP two stool samples should be collected 24 to 48 hours apart and need to be sent to a GPEI accredited laboratory to be tested for the poliovirus. [60](#note-60) Since 2000, the [WHO reports](https://extranet.who.int/polis/public/CaseCount.aspx) these surveillance quality indicators on a yearly basis for each country as the \"Non polio AFP Rate\" and \"% Adequate Stool Collection\", respectively. These WHO data were used for the [Tebbens et al. (2010) model on the economic benefits of polio's eradication](https://ourworldindata.org/polio/#economic-savings) to generate an estimate of the actual total number of paralytic polio cases based on the reported number of paralytic polio cases and a correction factor for the share of not-reported paralytic polio cases. The section A of the graphic shows the correction factor the authors used - the number of reported paralytic cases was multiplied by this factor to arrive at their estimate of the true total number of paralytic polio cases. The authors estimate that in the 1980s and 1990s the number of reported paralytic polio cases was around 7-fold lower than the true total number. One crucial piece of information for the estimation of this correction factor is that several developing countries administered surveys specifically on paralysis in the 1980s and arrived at paralytic polio case counts much higher than the initially reported figures. As shown in section B of the graphic, Tebbens et al. (2010) estimate the total global number of paralytic polio cases to be around 270,000 per year in the late 1980s when the [reported](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-number-of-reported-polio-cases-by-world-region) number of cases only surmounts to around 30,000 paralytic cases per year. Other sources estimated similar figures. The WHO estimated the number of paralytic polio cases to be between 200,000 to 300,000 per year during the 1980s. [61](#note-61) It is therefore even more remarkable that as reporting standards improved over time - and a greater number of paralytic polio cases are detected and reported - the number of paralytic polio cases dropped dramatically, so that only 42 paralytic polio cases were reported in 2016.
