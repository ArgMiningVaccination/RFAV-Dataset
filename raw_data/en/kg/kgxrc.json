This is a v ery unique place\u2014one that balances on the twin foundations of Faith and Science. Being a student here will expose you to a group of faculty and staff who hav e chosen to be part of this experience w e call Loma Linda. They hav e chosen to work here because they share in the belief that this is a special place. We emphasize what w e call Mission-Focused Learning. This means that what w e offer centers on more than producing know ledgeable professionals, because w e believ e that who you are is ev en more important than what you know. To assist in this lifelong process, w e are encouraging the enculturation of our sev en core v alues, known by the acronym JCHIEFS. These v alues are Justice, Compassion, Humility, Integrity, Excellence, Freedom, and Self-Control/ Purity. I encourage each of you to search your own heart and find w ays to strengthen these virtues in ev erything you do. You also will find an incredible mixture of cultural div ersity on our campus. Rev el in our similarities and differences, and use each interaction to help you understand the issues that separate us. W ith understanding comes acceptance. And with acceptance come peace and fellowship. Use your time at Loma Linda to seek out those from other countries and cultures from whom you can learn and gain greater understanding. W e will all be better as w e tear down those barriers that often separate us. All this uniqueness is centered on the profound belief that God is here, activ e in the liv es and experiences of each of us. Through our w eekly Campus Worship, the pray ers of faculty in class, and the daily interchanges across campus, I invite you to join me in getting to know Him better. P lace your future in His hands. Hav e confidence in His leading. Seek out opportunities to fellowship and grow in His lov e. Thank you for joining our campus family. I hope it will become as special to you as it has for so many of our 42,000 alumni. Cordially yours, Richard H. Hart, M.D., Dr.P.H. President Loma Linda Univ ersity2 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGPrograms, Degrees, and Certificates The degree and certificate curricula at Loma Linda Univ ersity are under continuous review and are, therefore, subject to change and improv ement without prior notice, as the need occurs. The Univ ersity also offers nondegree and short courses throughout the United States and globally to meet the continuing education and extension program needs of alumni, health professionals, and lay persons in the church and in the community. Most degree courses are approv ed for continuing education credit. School-specific certificates are aw arded upon completion of organized programs of study at the postsecondary lev el. Students register for courses through the Office of Univ ersity Records, but the certificate is issued by the school, which maintains records of the certificate and its aw arding. Financial aid is not av ailable to students registered in school-specific programs. See school programs in each school for a listing of school-specific certificates av ailable. The Faculty of Graduate Studies ov ersees Ph.D. and research master's degrees, as w ell as combined degrees programs.

The Univ ersity's affirmativ e action policy is to provide equal access to admissions, educational programs and activities, financial aid, student services, and employment. In compliance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a griev ance procedure has been established to process student complaints alleging violation of these regulations or of the Univ ersity's policy of nondiscrimination based on gender or disability. Inquiries concerning Title IX may be directed to the affirmativ e action officer. Employment- related discrimination complaints, including those filed by student employ ees, are processed in conformity with the provisions outlined in existing staff personnel policies. Complaints related to discrimination in academic areas are review ed in conformity with the procedures established by the academic administration. Affirmativ e Action 9Accommodation for Disability Loma Linda Univ ersity is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as w ell as with local and state requirements. The Univ ersity is committed to providing education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applicants for whom such accommodation does not fundamentally alter the chosen program or create an undue burden. For information regarding accommodation for disability, the student should consult the office of the dean of the school to which application for admission is being made. Following acceptance, the student may be asked if he or she has a disability requiring accommodation. A student who desires accommodation for a disability (e.g., physical, learning, or psychological) identified after acceptance should consult the office of the dean regarding a request for accommodation. The accommodation request must be submitted in writing on the designated form. The completed form and the required supporting documentation will be ev aluated by appropriate Univ ersity entities to determine whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. All discussions will remain confidential.10 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGNondiscrimination Policy Loma Linda Univ ersity w as established by the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church as an integral part of its teaching ministry. The Univ ersity affirms that Christian principles are incompatible with v arious forms of discrimination that hav e divided societies, and that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and should be so regarded by all His people. Therefore, the Univ ersity is committed to equal education and employment opportunities for men and women of all races; and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissions policies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or any Univ ersity-administered program. To this end, the Univ ersity is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended; and is in substantial compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the V ietnam Era V eterans Adjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employ ees or applicants for employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled v eterans or veterans of the V ietnam era. In addition, the Univ ersity administers student programs without discrimination on the basis of age\u2014except in those programs where age is a bona fide academic qualification for admission\u2014in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The Univ ersity reserv es constitutional and statutory rights as a religious institution and employ er to give preference to Sev enth-day Adv entists in admissions and employment, including but not limited to 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e-1, 2000e-2; Sec. 6-15 Sec. 12926 (d)(1); Title II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the California Code of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and Article 1, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. The Univ ersity believ es that Title IX regulations are subject to constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entanglement with or infringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church. The Univ ersity expects students and employ ees to uphold biblical principles of morality and deportment as interpreted by the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church. The Univ ersity claims exemptions from the provisions of Title IX set forth in 11The Academic Calendar Academic dates for Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) and the Schools of : AH Allied Health

A Sev enth-day Adv entist health sciences institution22 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGUniv ersity Philosophy As implied by its motto, \"To make man whole,\" the Univ ersity affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the Creator and Sustainer of the univ erse. Mankind's fullest dev elopment entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious v alues, benefits the individual and society and adv ances the ministry of the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church. \"Wholeness means the lifelong, harmonious dev elopment of the physical, intellectual, emotional, relational, cultural and spiritual dimensions of a person's life, unified through a loving relationship with God and expressed in generous service to others.\" Quoted in \"The Grace of Wholeness\" by Gerald R. W inslow, Ph.D., SCOPE , Spring 1999. Also quoted as the adopted definition of wholeness in affirms these v alues as central to its view of education: COMP ASSION \u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and sufferings of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which Loma Linda Univ ersity has taken as a central symbol of its work. INTEGRITY \u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are w ell-considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. EXCELLENCE \u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. FREEDOM \u2014The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slav ery but to freedom. JUSTICE \u2014The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could be genuine only when it led the believ ers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" PURITY/SELF-CONTROL \u2014The commitment to be morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control ov er one's emotions, desires, and actions. HUMILITY \u2014The willingness to serv e others in a sacrificial manner, and the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance.24 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGStudent Learning Outcomes Loma Linda Univ ersity's student learning outcomes are in the process of being implemented throughout all degree programs within the Univ ersity. The Office of Assessment and Institutional Learning is working with programs to guide the assessment of these outcomes. All degree programs hav e articulated their learning outcomes, which will also reflect the Univ ersity's v alue of educational effectiv eness. Outcome 1 Students understand and apply the Univ ersity philosophy of wholeness in their personal and professional liv es. Outcome 2 Students understand the importance of integrating the Univ ersity's Christ-centered v alues in their personal and professional liv es. Outcome 3 Students demonstrate critical thinking. Outcome 4 Students dev elop a commitment to discov ery and lifelong learning. Outcome 5 Students demonstrate effectiv e communication skills in English. Outcome 6 Students demonstrate effectiv e use of technology appropriate to the discipline. Outcome 7 Students understand the importance of embracing and serving a div erse world. Outcome 8 Students demonstrate the importance of collaborating with others within and across disciplines.Student Learning Outcomes 25Univ ersity Mace, Coat of Arms, and Seal Traditionally the ceremonial mace represents the authority v ested in the highest officer of a gov erning body. In an educational institution, the authority symbolized by the mace deriv es from respect for the authority of know ledge and for the rights and v alue of the individual. Thus the leader of an academic community assumes the obligation and challenge to ensure for its members a climate conduciv e to growth in know ledge and grace. The construction of the ceremonial mace of Loma Linda Univ ersity evokes further ideas. Its two metals, bronze and aluminum, suggest the v alue of lessons both ancient and contemporary. Rather than lying prone, an instrument to be wielded, this mace stands upright in celebration of the human spirit. Its open construction implies free exposure to questions, ideas, and conflict. The eight v ertical supporting elements (at three points bound together as for strength and stability in unity) uphold a graceful ov al that points outw ard to the univ erse, the province of inquiry. Within the ov al, the Univ ersity seal appears to float unfettered. The basic design of the coat of arms and the seal of Loma Linda Univ ersity\u2014established in 1905 as the College of Medical Ev angelists\u2014is a contemporary modification of the shield, a heraldic device. Within the seal, the Christian cross\u2014a univ ersal symbol\u2014acknow ledges the role of Jesus Christ as Savior and Redeemer. The lighted torch\u2014part of our logo since 1959\u2014suggests the illuminating pow er of know ledge and the central role of the Holy Spirit in teaching and healing. It also references the institution's call to serv e as a light to the world. The ancient staff of Aesculapius, long associated with medicine\u2014and part of our logo since the 1920s\u2014represents in the modern and broad sense the combined services of all the healing arts and sciences. Across the base of the shield, the open book symbolizes the Word of God\u2014the foundation of all truth, the source of the Christ-centered commission, the inspiration for all endeavor of humanity for humanity. Framing the shield are, at the left, the branch of oak leav es and acorns, presented in ancient times to honor the civic contribution of one who had sav ed his brother-citizen's life; and, at the right, the laurel branch, presented to honor personal achiev ement. Shown together, the oak and laurel branches form a wreath\u2014suggesting that the life-saving and life-enhancing work of the health sciences brings with it an obligation to act honorably, courageously, and selflessly. The emblems of the seal imply that one who has the privilege of learning also has the obligation of valor and honor. On the scroll below the shield is the motto\u2014adopted in 1955 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniv ersary of this institution\u2014\"To Make Man Whole.\"26 Foundations HISTOR Y Loma of the Sev enth-day Adv entist system of higher education. In 1905, the Univ ersity (formerly College of Medical Ev angelists) w as founded\u2014through a series of divine providences\u2014at Loma Linda, California, by the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church. The School of Nursing began in 1905. In 1909, the College of Medical Ev angelists receiv ed its charter as a medical school with the express purpose of preparing physicians who could meet the needs of the whole person. Both schools emphasized the need for healthful living as a part of medical care, a revolutionary concept in 1905. The Univ ersity w as designated by the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church as a center for educating health professionals. The original schools\u2014Nursing and Medicine\u2014hav e been joined by Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Public Health, Science and T echnology, and Religion; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The curricula of the Univ ersity are approv ed by their respectiv e professional organizations. From its small beginnings, the Univ ersity has achiev ed widespread recognition, having sent more of its graduates into international service than has any other univ ersity. It remains committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. From 1918 to 1962, the Univ ersity operated within health facilities in two cities: Loma Linda and Los Angeles. In September 1962, all health-professional education w as consolidated at Loma Linda. In 1967, Loma Linda Univ ersity Medical Center opened in its new three-tow er facility\u2014a landmark clov erleaf structure. The medical center continues on the cutting edge of health care, providing excellent service for patients and expanding educational opportunities for students. In 1990, the Board of Trustees designated Loma Linda Univ ersity a health sciences univ ersity\u2014part of a complex comprised of Loma Linda Univ ersity Medical Center, faculty practice plans, and affiliated institutions. The Univ ersity is a leader in the field of health sciences education, research, and service. The most current campus census figures (March 2010) indicate that the core of the combined faculties consists of 1,450 full-time teachers. P art-time and voluntary teachers (1,364\u2014largely clinicians in the professional curricula) bring the total to 2,814. As of A utumn Quarter 2010, 723 students from 89 countries outside the United States are represented in the enrollment of 4,211.Univ ersity Foundations 27A CENTUR Y OF SER VICE Today the original 1905 property is part of an expanding health sciences campus, which includes: five medical facilities, licensed for approximately 940 beds\u2014 Loma licensed under LLUMC as Loma Linda Community Hospital; ersity Heart & Surgical Hospital (LLUHSH), 2009; an acute psychiatric care facility, licensed in 1991 for 89 beds\u2014the Loma Linda Univ ersity entist Health Sciences two LLUAHSC-related research centers, and v arious school-related research centers (see Learning Resources); and Loma Linda Univ ersity (on campus, distance education, and online degree programs through the Schools of Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, Religion, and Science and T echnology; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies.28 UNIVERSITY CA TALOG1905 School of Nursing 1909 The institution w as named College of Medical Ev angelists (CME) 1922 Department of Dietetics* 1937 School of Medical T echnology* 1941 School of Physical Therapy* 1945 Radiologic T echnology Program* 1948 School of Tropical and Prev entiv e Medicine (reorganized as School of Public Health, 1964) 1953 School of Dentistry 1954 Graduate School (restructured as Faculty of Graduate Studies, 2005) 1958 Dental Hygiene Program 1959 Occupational Therapy Program* 1963 Medical Records Administration Program* 1966 Schools/Programs (see * abov e) consolidated as the School of Allied Health Professions 1967 Loma Linda Univ ersity campus merges with La Sierra College 1968 Loma Linda Univ ersity Medical Center dedicated 1990 Loma Linda and La Sierra campuses become two separate univ ersities 1991 Loma Linda Univ ersity Loma Linda Univ ersity and Univ ersity Adv entist Health Sciences Center\u2014LLUAHSC) 2002 School of Pharmacy 2003 School of Science and T echnology 2007 School of ReligionUniv has alw ays combined a devotion to academic excellence with a concern for spiritual v alues and a high sense of mission. The motto of the Univ ersity, \"To make man whole,\" illustrates the sense of destiny felt in the Univ ersity community to act its part in God's ongoing plan for healing and restoring human beings to liv e with Him in wholeness, both now and in eternity. While Loma Linda Univ ersity has changed in many w ays since its beginning in 1905, the biblical principles that provide its foundation hav e remained unchanged. SEVENTH-DA Y ADVENTIST HERIT AGE Loma Linda Univ ersity is owned and operated by the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church and has deep commitment to respecting the rich div ersity of its student body. Students come from many different faiths, and respect and sensitivity for all people\u2014regardless of their culture and ethnicity\u2014are view ed as a part of true Christianity. This Univ ersity has a tradition of religious liberty, and it highly respects students' religious v alues that differ from those of this academic community. The v arious perspectiv es of spiritually committed students are considered to be enriching to this campus and its educational environment. OUR UNIQUE FEA TURES Two distinctiv e features of the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church, which are a part of the Loma Linda experience, become evident to first-time students. The first is the concept of the Sabbath rest, which reminds us of God as Creator. Adv entists realize this in part by celebrating Saturday as the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. During these hours, Univ ersity offices, laboratories, libraries, study halls, and recreation facilities are closed to giv e time for physical and spiritual renew al and worship.30 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGA second distinctiv e feature worth noting is the emphasis on health and w ellness. Students will be able to exercise in our recreation and w ellness center, a health-and-fitness complex that receiv ed a national award for excellence in utility and design. The cafeterias on campus feature w ell-prepared v egetarian meals. Note also that the Univ ersity holds that a drug-, alcohol-, and tobacco-free lifesty le is essential for achieving the goal of \"wholeness.\" This means that all students agree to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other \"recreational\" drugs while enrolled at the Univ ersity.A Unique Univ ersity 31Spiritual Life Worship experiences represent a critical dimension of the educational experience at Loma Linda Univ ersity and are av ailable to the student many times throughout the w eek. In addition to regular Friday ev ening and Saturday services, many class, school, club, and Univ ersity activities include a component of worship and praise to God. CHAPEL SER VICES In keeping with the commitment of our mission, Loma Linda Univ ersity students hav e special requirements, such as chapel service attendance each W ednesday morning in the Univ ersity Church. The chapel programs provide a v ariety of opportunities to integrate faith and learning. Undergraduates who live in the residence halls are also expected to attend worships in the residence halls each w eek. RELIGION CLASSES Classes in religion are part of the core curriculum in each of the Univ ersity's schools and programs. These classes deal with the study of the Bible, ethics, clinical ministry (which concentrates on w ays to understand and meet the spiritual needs of patients in a manner that is noninv asive and individually appropriate), and a v ariety of other issues related to the student's field of study and personal spiritual journey. All students who choose Loma Linda as their univ ersity make a commitment to conduct their liv es in a manner that reflects their sense of responsibility for the honor and integrity of the Univ ersity and of themselv es as members of its community.32 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGLearning Environment Loma Linda Univ ersity is dedicated to creating a learning environment that promotes the lifelong pursuit of know ledge, wisdom, and skills used for selfless service to mankind. Through intentional educational strategies, Loma Linda Univ ersity interw eaves its vision, mission, and core v alues with its student learning outcomes. The Univ ersity's mission of wholeness giv es focus to the learning environment that balances mind, body, and spirit (psycho-social-physical-spiritual) and giv es meaning to the motto of mission-focused learning. In this health care institution, critical and analytical thinking skills in the health, behavioral, and natural sciences are blended with a commitment to spiritual and moral development. Loma Linda Univ ersity pledges to students, staff, faculty, alumni, and the local and global communities its commitment to upholding integrity, v aluing div ersity, engaging with the community in service-learning scholarship, and honoring the process of ongoing self-assessment for the purpose of continuous quality improv ement. The Univ ersity and each of its schools, programs, and classes provide clearly defined student learning outcomes and measurable performance indicators to create a learning atmosphere that is clear and focused. The Univ ersity is engaged in systematic academic program review. Curricular maps are maintained for each program to assure alignment betw een student learning outcomes and planned academic activities. Program review follows carefully dev eloped schedules as outlined in school-specific assessment matrices. Loma Linda Univ ersity is committed to using assessment data to guide academic and fiscal master planning for the Univ ersity. The total resources of the Univ ersity offer a w ealth of opportunity to the student with initiativ e and willingness to dev elop individual capacity to the fullest extent. The academic resources, affiliated clinical facilities, and community agencies constitute a rich educational environment both in classroom instruction and in guided experience. Major facilities utilized for clinical affiliations and internships include the Univ ersity Medical Center; the Jerry L. P ettis Memorial V eterans Medical Center; and numerous other hospitals and agencies located in the Redlands, San Bernardino, Riv erside, and LosLearning Environment 33Angeles areas; as w ell as throughout the United States and abroad. In addition, students find v aried opportunities for service and learning in the immediate Univ ersity community, in clinical and research electiv es, and in div erse volunteer programs. UNIVERSITY STUDENT MISSION-FOCUSED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES Students for International Mission Service (SIMS) Students for International Mission Service (SIMS) is a Loma Linda Univ ersity program housed in the Global Health Institute program that exemplifies the Univ ersity's legacy and its commitment to global service.

Official final transcripts documenting completion of all course work taken betw een the time of application and matriculation must be receiv ed within the first quarter of enrollment. Applicants expecting an associate's degree to be aw arded before matriculation at Loma Linda Univ ersity must provide documentation (e.g., letter from registrar, school dean, or designee) showing expected degree completion. Otherwise, a high school transcript will be required for acceptance. Applicants to programs that require a bachelor's degree must submit documentation (e.g., letter from registrar, school dean, or designee) of completion of bachelor's degree prior to matriculation. Subsequent enrollment is contingent upon the previous submission of all official final transcripts. Applicants are required to furnish evidence (transcripts, GED, CHSPE, or equiv alent) of completion of high school in order to be granted admission to undergraduate programs of the Univ ersity. The final transcript must include the date of graduation. Students who hold an associate degree from a regionally accredited college/univ ersity upon admission do not need to furnish a high school transcript, unless required to v alidate specific course work. The Univ ersity accepts only official transcripts sent directly to Loma Linda Univ ersity from the college, univ ersity, or high school issuing it. Transcripts submitted by the student are not considered official.Admission Policies and Information 39Applicants who hav e attended international schools are required to submit official transcripts (mark sheets) in the original language, which conv ey the grade and credits earned in each subject; and an English translation of their transcripts, if not already in English. In accordance with the United States immigration regulations, international applicants can be ev aluated on the basis of a preview ed unofficial copy of their transcripts, on the condition that the Univ ersity receiv es official transcripts before the admission is finalized. Applicants to programs that require a bachelor's degree must submit documentation of completion of a bachelor's degree prior to matriculation. Official education transcripts (or mark sheets), degrees earned from international institutions, or professional credentials must be sent to an ev aluation center approv ed by Loma Linda Univ ersity. The center reports the ev aluation results directly to the Office of Univ ersity Admissions. Transcripts and ev aluation results receiv ed by the Univ ersity become the property of the Univ ersity and will not be released to the student or forw arded to any other institution. Outgoing The Univ ersity provides transcripts to other institutions or to the student or graduate only upon written request of the student or graduate. The Univ ersity reserv es the right to withhold all information concerning the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of accounts or other charges, including student loans. No transcripts will be issued until all of the student's financial obligations to the Univ ersity as defined in this CA TALOG hav e been met. CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT A student who has not enrolled for any classes, or paid the continuous registration fee for courses still in progress from a previous term, will be inactiv ated at the beginning of the second quarter of nonenrollment, unless s/he is on an approv ed leav e of absence (maximum of four academic quarters, including Summer Quarter ). (Example: A student who enrolled for A utumn Quarter, but who does not enroll for W inter Quarter, will be inactiv ated at the close of registration [two w eeks into the quarter ] for the subsequent Spring Quarter ). Inactiv ated or formally withdrawn students who wish to return to complete their degree program are required to reapply with sufficient time for adequate review of any new transcript credits and advisement of any new program requirements. The reapplication process also requires the submission of official transcripts from all colleges/ univ ersities attended since the student last attended this Univ ersity. Official transcripts from colleges/ univ ersities the student attended while enrolled at this Univ ersity must also be submitted if they w ere not submitted prior to inactiv ation. Students who reapply to a program are subject to the program requirements published in the Catalog in effect at the time of reentry. All graduates are expected to hav e documented current know ledge in their field of study as of the date of graduation (date on diploma). Leav e-of-absence status does not extend the student's fiv e-year (master's) or sev en-y ear (doctoral) time limit for completion of a degree program. If the reapplicant is within a y ear of his/her time limit at the time of reapplication, or if the time limit has expired and the reapplicant is requesting readmission and a time extension, then s/he must submit a quarter-by-quarter plan for meeting all degree requirements. The re-admission request will be ev aluated with the degree-completion time extension.40 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGSTUDY DEFERRAL Applicants are accepted for a specified entering date. If the applicant does not enter the program at the time stated for admission, the application will become inactiv e unless the school receiv es a written request to hold the application. Not all programs permit an applicant to defer an application; how ever, for those programs for which this is permitted, an application may not be deferred for more than one year. After one y ear, a new application must be submitted. Accepted applicants who wish to reactiv ate their acceptance at a later date must apply to the school for reactiv ation. Previous acceptance does not guarantee acceptance at a later time. Individuals must meet admission and graduation requirements that are in effect for the school y ear during which they first register.

Visas F-1 student visas Loma Linda Univ ersity is authorized by the United States Department of Homeland Security to issue F- visa applications (i.e., I-20 forms). The F-1 student visa is the visa of choice for most international students coming to Loma Linda Univ ersity. This visa allows some nondegree study (e.g., certificates, preceptorships, and English-as-a-second-language studies). Degree-earning students are subject to study load requirements and are allow ed limited on-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after a student: 1.has been accepted into a program and all official transcripts (mark sheets) hav e been receiv ed by the Univ ersity, 2.has paid the adv ance deposit, and 3.has documented his/her financial plan for the chosen program.

J-visa exchange program Loma Linda Univ ersity has an exchange vsitor program that is approv ed by the U.S. Department of State. This J-visa exchange program is authorized to sponsor/host degree-earning students, nondegree (continuing education) students, short-term scholars, visiting professors, and research scholars. The J-visa form, DS-2019, is issued after an exchange visitor has been accepted into a program, scholar position, or professor position; and has documented his/her financial plan (including health insurance for J-1 and J-2 dependents). Loma Linda Univ ersity also hosts exchange visitors who are sponsored by other organizations (e.g., Fulbright scholars). As a hosting institution, Loma Linda Univ ersity has limited authority ov er an exchange visitor since the authority resides in the sponsoring organization. Under current exchange visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allow ed to enroll part or full time at Loma Linda Univ ersity. Also, their credits earned can be either degree or nondegree applicable. J-1 exchange visitors are allow ed to work; but employment guidelines differ, depending on the exchange category.

LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY PHILOSOPHY OF GENERAL EDUCA TION As a Sev enth-day Adv entist Loma Linda Univ ersity seeks to exemplify a life of service and sensitivity beyond the requirements of academic excellence within a professional discipline. W ith its rich spiritual heritage, the Univ ersity places special emphasis on educating its students for a life of service in a global community. General education at Loma Linda Univ ersity consists of courses, lectures, programs, and activities coordinated with the intent to integrate faith and learning. In addition to the basics of cultural heritage and div ersity, scientific inquiry and analysis, communication, and w ellness, the curriculum emphasizes the Univ ersity's spiritual heritage; as w ell as moral and ethical decision making that is grounded in Christian principles. Thus, a general education is considered to be the cornerstone upon which students begin cultiv ating their abilities to: 1.Understand the fundamental Christian undergird Loma Linda moral and ethical decisions. 3.Incorporate critical-thinking skills into personal and professional experience.Division of General Studies 474.Value individuals with div erse capabilities and ideological, ethnic, gender, and generational perspectiv es. 5.Communicate effectiv ely. 6.Undertake scientific inquiry and analysis. 7.Appreciate the contributions of the arts and humanities to society. 8.Examine the historical basis of the health sciences professions. 9.Develop self-aw areness through balance of mental, physical, social, and spiritual aspects of daily living. 10. Model serv ant leadership in health care as exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The Loma Linda Univ ersity philosophy of general education creates a unique learning environment committed to the concept of human wholeness. Faculty are selected who embrace the spirit as w ell as the specifics of general education and who purpose to extend its goals into all aspects of univ ersity life\u2014from the residence hall programs to the core of professional studies\u2014thus adding an invisible curriculum to the required course offerings. It is this spirit in tandem with the specifics of a liberal arts education that inspires students to achiev e academic excellence, v alue div ersity, pursue lifelong learning, and liv e to bless others.

FROM UNIVERSITY TO STUDENT Loma Linda Univ ersity w as established to provide education in a distinctiv ely Christian environment. Students are expected to respect the standards and ideals of the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church. Prospectiv e students hav e the freedom to choose or reject Univ ersity or school standards, but the decision must be made before enrollment. Application to and enrollment in Loma Linda Univ ersity constitute the student's commitment to honor and abide by the academic and social practices and regulations stated in announcements, bulletins, handbooks, and other published materials; and to maintain a manner that is mature and compatible with the Univ ersity's function as a professional institution of higher learning. It is inevitable that the student will come under question if academic performance is below standard; student duties are neglected; social conduct is unbecoming; or attitudes demonstrate deficiencies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy, or other forms of immaturity. Procedures for ev aluation of academic and nonacademic performance\u2014as w ell as for the student to exercise his/her right of appeal\u2014are described in the current CA TALOG and in each school's section of theStudent Handbook. Griev ances regarding both academic and nonacademic matters must be processed according to these published griev ance procedures. After a student files an appeal or griev ance, the faculty assesses the student's fitness for a career in the chosen profession and recommends to the dean appropriate action regarding the student's continuance or discontinuance. Prospectiv e students who hav e questions concerning the Univ ersity's expectations should seek specific information prior to enrollment. 54 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGWHOLE PERSON HEAL TH The Univ ersity regards the student from a cosmopolitan and comprehensiv e point of view. It is cosmopolitan in that historically the Univ ersity's global mission has promoted bonds and opportunities in education and service without regard to gender, or to national, racial, or geographical origin. It is comprehensiv e in that the Univ ersity's concern for the w elfare of the student traditionally has been an integrated concern for assisting the student tow ard whole person health\u2014balanced dev elopment of spiritual, social, physical, and mental health.

Before one can experience whole person health, there must be a practical appreciation of the interdependent interaction of each part of the whole. Students from all schools of Loma Linda Univ ersity may congregate and participate in the multifaceted programs offered that involv e the holistic concept of social, intellectual, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellness. These programs support Loma Linda Univ ersity's motto, \"To make man whole.\" Spiritual health In addition to personal quiet times, opportunities for the student to further dev elop rich, personal spiritual resources are provided in scheduled religious exercises and activities and in informal association with others who cherish spiritual v alues. Religion classes as w ell as w eekly chapel services are part of the required curriculum. Social health Situated within easy access of the ocean, mountains, and desert, the Univ ersity provides numerous opportunities for students to complement their formal learning through participation in a wide v ariety of recreational, cultural, and other activities. A v ariety of Univ ersity-, school-, and group-sponsored ev ents encourages students to relax and become better acquainted with one another. Through these activities and ev ents, students can enrich their group interaction and leadership experiences, increase their enjoyment of and interest in fields outside their profession, dev elop their talents, enhance wholesome and memorable association with others, and cultiv ate supportiv e and lifelong social relationships. Mental health The Univ ersity promotes mental health by encouraging students to study and practice principles of sound psychological health and to access state-of-the-art counseling and mental health services, as needed. Physical health The Univ ersity promotes physical fitness by encouraging recreational interests and by providing courses in field exercises, body building, and health instruction.

ACADEMIC AUTHORITY The Office of the Dean of the school in which the student is enrolled is the final authority in all academic matters, with the exception of general education requirements, and is charged with the interpretation and enforcement of academic requirements. Any exceptions or changes in academic requirements, graduation requirements, or grades are not v alid unless approv ed by the dean. Any actions taken by individual faculty members with regard to these matters are advisory only and are not binding on the school or the Univ ersity unless approv ed by the dean. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The academically dishonest act considers that academic dishonesty intentionally violates the community of trust upon which all learning is based, intentionally compromises the orderly transfer of know ledge from teacher to student, and is inconsistent with good professional and moral behavior. Accordingly, the penalty for academic dishonesty is sev ere. Acts of dishonesty include but are not limited to: theft; falsifying or changing grades or other academic records; plagiarism or excessiv e paraphrasing of someone else's work; knowingly giving, obtaining, or falsifying information during examinations or other academic or professional practice assignments; using unauthorized aids during examinations; loud and disruptiv e behavior during lectures, demonstrations, or examinations; excessiv e unexcused absences from classes or from clinical assignments. \"Examinations\" are defined as regularly scheduled tests, quizzes (scheduled or unscheduled), final examinations, comprehensiv e assessments, take-home tests, open-book tests, and any other assignment given by an instructor or preceptor whether for a grade, points tow ard a grade, or for zero points (e.g., a learning exercise). Instructors and students are responsible for reporting instances of academic dishonesty for investigation. An instructor may take immediate action during an examination or other point-generating activity in order to maintain the integrity of the academic process. Substantiated violations are to be brought before the designated disciplinary body for action. Disciplinary action may include receiving a failing grade on the examination or assignment, receiving a failing grade in the course, suspension, or permanent dismissal from the program.64 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGCONDUCT Students are expected to conduct themselv es in a professional manner during didactic and clinical training. Professional conduct includes (but is not limited to) punctuality; and respect for other people, their property, and their right to learn. It also includes an appropriate respect for those in authority. Students of Loma Linda Univ ersity are expected to behav e in a manner that will not bring criticism upon themselv es, the program, the school, or the Univ ersity. Because students may be exposed to patients' relativ es and friends in any public place, and because their conv ersations and their attitudes hav e an effect on those around them, students are asked to observ e the following: Any information giv en to the student by a patient or contained in a medical record must be held in strict confidence. Therefore, the discussion of a patient's diagnosis and treatment or other clinically related topics should be extremely guarded. A patient's family and community people may be listening and may incorrectly interpret the things discussed. Careless talk may lead to malpractice litigation. A joking or casual attitude tow ard illness and medical treatment should not be display ed since it may seem uncaring and be disturbing to those who are ill and suffering, as w ell as to the family members. Student and staff behavior in professional situations may be the deciding influence for or against Christian beliefs, v alues, and a health-enhancing lifesty le. An in-depth description of the professional conduct expected of students is contained in the Loma Linda ances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the disabled shall be pursued in accordance with Univ ersity policies specifically relating to these items. Griev ances related to academic matters or other issues cov ered by specific policies shall be made pursuant to the policies of the school in which the student is enrolled. A student who questions whether the process provided by the school has follow ed the policy of the school in regard to his/her griev ance may request the Office of the Provost conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to his/her academic griev ance. Students who believ e that an error has been made or that they hav e been dealt with in an inappropriate manner by an office or nonacademic department of the Univ ersity such as records, student finance, student affairs, health services, Drayson Center, etc., may seek correction by the following steps: 1.The student may put his/her complaint in writing and provide it to the head of the department or office involv ed. The student may request an appointment and discuss this matter with the department head. The department head will make a decision and provide a written answ er to the student within fourteen days of receiving the student's written complaint or meeting with the student, whichev er is later. If the answ er is not satisfactory to the student, s/he may\u2014 2.Put the complaint in writing and send it to the dean of student affairs for review. The matter will be considered at the next meeting of the dean's council, and the student will be informed in writing of the council's response within sev en days of the council's consideration of the complaint.Student Life 65COPYRIGHT VIOLA TIONS The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, USC) gov erns the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material.

COMMUNICA TION DEVICES All communication devices must be set to \"off\" or \"vibrate\" during class, laboratory, clinic, or chapel. No cell phones, PDAs, calculators, laptops, or other electronic or communication items may be used in the classroom, testing facility, or laboratory unless specifically a part of that activity and approv ed by the faculty member in charge.66 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGAcademic Policies and Information Students of the Univ ersity are responsible for informing themselv es of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. In this section (Section II) are the Univ ersity regulations. See Section III for regulations that pertain to each school and program. REGISTRA TION Registration dates are published on the W eb at < llu.edu/ssw eb/registration.html >. The W eb should be checked for specific dates of registration, since these dates v ary during some quarters due to holiday schedules. Posted deadlines for registration and change of registration are in effect and binding. After consultation with their academic advisor, students register online. Registration procedure includes entering classes online and clearing finance. Students are advised to print the Request for Clearance Submitted form from the W eb in order to retain written documentation that they hav e requested financial clearance. Upon completion of registration, the student must obtain an ID card at the Univ ersity Office of Student Affairs (first quarter registration only). A late registration period of at least a w eek prior to the beginning of the quarter and extending to fiv e days after the quarter begins is provided, during which a late-registration fee of $50 will be charged, unless the course is offered as an intensiv e that requires registration before the end of the first day of class. Students may not attend class without being registered. No credit is granted for academic work performed during any quarter without registration. Change in registration A change in registration requires filing a Registration Change Request (Add/Drop) form with the Office of Univ ersity Records. Students receiv e written v erification each time a change of program is officially approv ed. Students are advised to retain this written v erification as documentation of their registration. A student may add courses that follow the general Univ ersity calendar during the first sev en calendar days of the quarter. Courses that follow the general Univ ersity calendar may be dropped during the first fourteen days of the quarter without academic penalty. Course changes after the fourteenth day of the quarter affect the permanent grade record. Students may withdraw from a course prior to the fourteen calendar days before the final examination w eek, after which time withdraw als are no longer permitted. Study load Usually an academic study load is defined in terms of credit units. A full undergraduate load is considered to be 12 or more units per quarter; a full graduate load is considered to be 8 units per quarter. The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at this or another institution, is 16 quarter units for an undergraduate student and 12 quarter units for a graduate student. Full-time study loads are those specified by the departments for each program. Students of exceptional ability may register for additional course work upon recommendation of the department and consent of the dean. A person who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is occupied in research, dissertation, or thesis, is classified as a student. By filing an Academic Load V alidation form ev ery quarter at registration, the academic load may be v alidated for loan deferment.Academic Policies and Information 67STUDENT LEVEL Students enrolled in a professional program in which they are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior will be classified according to the lev el of the course work they are taking (e.g., a student with a previous baccalaureate degree pursuing another baccalaureate degree would be classified as a sophomore while taking sophomore-lev el courses, etc.). Students enrolled in block programs are classified according to the lev el of the block in which they are enrolled (e.g., master's-1st, 2nd, or 3rd y ear; or freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, as is appropriate for the degree program; or PY1 [professional y ear 1]). COURSE NUMBERS Courses numbered as: 001-099 nondegree-applicable credit lower division 301-499 upper division graduate 601-699 graduate: seminar, research, thesis, or dissertation 701-899 professional or clinical 901-999 extension with credit; continuing education units, if preceded by letter prefix ending with \"CE\" (e.g., ASCE 916); without academic credit; or undergraduate certificate clinical affiliation/practicum courses 500-lev el course work may not apply tow ard a baccalaureate degree unless the instructor approv es it, and both deans (dean of the school offering the course and dean of the school in which the student is enrolled) giv e permission; and provided the credit does not apply tow ard both an undergraduate and a graduate degree. Approv al is not needed if the course is part of a coordinated program. No courses numbered in the 700s, 800s, or 900s may apply tow ard a baccalaureate degree. UNIT OF CREDIT Credit is recorded in quarter units. One unit represents a minimum of ten class hours in lecture or thirty hours in laboratory practice. ATTENDANCE Regular attendance at all appointments (class, clinic, laboratory, chapel) is required beginning with the first day of each term. A pattern of absence, excused and unexcused, will be referred to the school's designated academic authority for consideration and action. Excused absences are defined as follows: Illness, v erified by a physician's statement or official statement from Student Health Service submitted to the school's designated academic authority; Participation in an institution-sponsored activity (v erified by a written statement from a faculty sponsor ); Recognizable emergency approv ed by the school's designated academic authority. Tardiness is disruptiv e, distracting, and inconsistent with professional behavior. Students who arriv e after the beginning of class may be counted absent.68 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGInformation regarding the school's designated academic authority can be obtained from the Office of the Dean. COLLEGE LEVEL EXAMINA TION PROGRAM (CLEP) The College Lev el Examination Program (CLEP), a national program of credit by examination, offers persons of all ages and backgrounds new opportunities to obtain recognition for college-lev el achiev ement, no matter how acquired. As of July 2001, general examinations are no longer offered; how ever, the policy remains in effect for students who took general examinations prior to that date. No credit is granted for the CLEP general examinations in English composition, mathematics, or science courses requiring a laboratory. As of July 1, 2004, in order to receiv e Loma Linda Univ ersity credit, students must complete all examinations for CLEP credit within six months after having receiv ed their initial degree compliance report. A student will be allow ed to challenge a giv en course by examination only once. CLEP scores will be accepted at C or better until percentiles are av ailable from CLEP. Credit is granted for scores at or abov e the 50th percentile for the subject examinations, and at the 65th percentile for general examinations in the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences/history. CREDIT BY EXAMINA TION For certain courses offered by the Univ ersity, a student in an undergraduate degree program may earn credit by passing an equiv alency examination administered by the appropriate school and department. Such an examination is at least equal in scope and difficulty to a final examination in the course and may include materials supplied by CLEP or other agencies. A graduate program should be used to acquire new know ledge. Since the purpose of credit by examination is to v alidate prior know ledge, graduate credit may not be earned by examination. If a required course in the degree program is a repeat of prior learning, the student may request a w aiver, thus making it possible to take electiv e courses that would increase know ledge. A student currently enrolled in a degree program at this Univ ersity who desires credit by equiv alency examination petitions the dean of the school offering the course, and, upon approv al, pays a testing fee. See Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section for examination fee. Equiv alency examinations may not duplicate credit already earned through course work, including courses taken for audit. A grade of CR (Credit) is giv en only after the student has completed one quarter, or the equiv alent, at this Univ ersity; and has earned 12 units of credit with a grade point av erage of at least 2.0 in undergraduate courses. Units earned by equiv alency may not be used as part of the enrolled load. Equiv alency examinations must be taken before the final quarter of residency. The maximum amount of credit that may be earned by equiv alency examination is determined by each school but may not exceed a maximum of 20 percent of the units required for the degree or certificate. COURSE W AIVER Certain course requirements in a program may be w aived on the basis of previously completed course work, experience, or licensure. An examination for w aiver credit, if required, may be taken only once and must be taken before the last quarter of the program of study. W aiver of a specific course requirement does not reduce the number of units required for a program or residency. A w aiver examination does not carry academic credit and cannot be used to make up for a course in which an unsatisfactory grade w as receiv ed. For examination fee, see Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section.Academic Policies and Information 69Permission to w aive a course requirement in the School of Pharmacy requires prior approv al of the department chair and consent of the dean. INDEPENDENT STUDY Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair and/or the Office of the Dean. The student is responsible for completion of the Directed/Independent Study Title Request form in addition to the regular registration. Univ ersity policy limits directed study to 12 quarter units of undergraduate credit and 8 units of graduate credit in a degree program. Individual programs may further limit these units. The Office of the Dean should be consulted regarding limits on credit earned through independent study. Independent study is to be completed in adequate time before graduation to allow recording in the Office of Univ ersity Records. EXTENSION STUDY To be acceptable for credit, an extension course must be ev aluated as to its equiv alence to an accepted course. To assure that the course will transfer to Loma Linda Univ ersity, the student should contact the Office of Univ ersity Records prior to taking the course. Registration for extension study requires prior approv al of the department chair and consent of the dean. SCHOLASTIC ST ANDING Grades and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in this Univ ersity. Each course taught in the schools has been approv ed for either a letter grade and/or an S/U grade. A 4.0 Outstanding performance. A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 Very good performance for undergraduate credit; satisfactory performance for graduate credit. B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 Satisfactory performance for undergraduate credit. Minimum performance for which credit is granted tow ard a degree in the School of Nursing or the School of Allied Health Professions. C- 1.7 Minimum performance for which credit is granted tow ard a degree in the School of Dentistry, the School of Pharmacy, or the School of Public Health. D+ 1.370 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGD 1.0 Minimum performance for which undergraduate credit is granted, except as indicated abov e. F 0.0 Failure\u2014giv en for not meeting minimum performance. S none Satisfactory performance\u2014counted tow ard graduation. Equiv alent to a C grade or better in undergraduate courses, or a B grade or better in graduate courses. An S grade is not computed in the grade-point av erage. A student may request a grade of S in only a limited amount of course work as determined by the school. This is done by the student's filing with the Office of Univ ersity Records the appropriate form prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination w eek. Once filed, the grade is not subject to change. U none Unsatisfactory performance\u2014giv en only when performance for an S-specified course falls below a C grade lev el in an undergraduate course or a B grade lev el in a graduate course. Similar filing procedures as giv en for S grade abov e are required. The U grade is not computed in the grade-point av erage. S/N none Satisfactory performance in a clock hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the S grade giv en for a credit hour course. U/N none Unsatisfactory performance in a clock hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the U grade giv en for a credit hour course. CR none Credit for Credit by Examination. Counted tow ard graduation/units earned but not units attempted. Such credit cannot be counted for financial aid purposes. NC none No credit for Credit by Examination. Does not count for any purpose. W Withdraw al\u2014giv en for withdraw al from a course prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination w eek. W ithdraw als during the first fourteen calendar days of a quarter or the first sev en calendar days of a fiv e-week summer session are not recorded if the student files with the Office of Univ ersity Records the appropriate form prior to the cut-off date. Withdraw als outside this time frame, upon recommendation of the dean, may be remov ed at the discretion of the vice president for academic affairs. In the case of nontraditionally scheduled courses, a \"W\" notation will be giv en for withdraw al from a course prior to completion of 80 percent of the course, excluding the final examination period. Withdraw als during the first 20 percent of a course, excluding the final examination period, are not recorded if the student files with the Office of Univ ersity Records the appropriate form prior to the date when this 20 percent of the course is completed. A student may withdraw only once from a named cognate course that s/he is failing at the time of withdraw al.Academic Policies and Information 71UW Unofficial W ithdraw al\u2014indicates that the student discontinued class attendance after the close of registration but failed to withdraw officially. I Incomplete\u2014giv en when the majority of the course work has been completed and circumstances beyond a student's control result in the student being unable to complete the quarter. An \"I\" notation may be changed to a grade only by the instructor before the end of the following term (excluding the summer sessions for those not in attendance during that term). Incomplete units are not calculated in the grade-point av erage. By use of the petition form\u2014av ailable online at < llu.edu/central/ssw eb/ registration.page >\u2014the student requests an \"I\" notation from the instructor, stating the reason for the request and obtaining the signatures of the instructor, the department chair, and the associate dean. The form is left with the instructor. The instructor reports the I notation on the grade-report form, as w ell as the grade the student will receiv e if the deficiency is not remov ed within the time limit. The petition form is then filed with the Office of Univ ersity Records along with the grade report form. The notation \"I\" is not granted as a remedy for ov erload, failure on final examination, absence from final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. IP In Progress\u2014indicates that the course has a duration of more than a single term and will be completed by the student no later than the final term of the course, not to exceed fiv e quarters for independent study and research courses (original quarter of registration plus four additional quarters). The student's final grade will be reported on the instructor's grade report at the end of the term in which the course is completed. If the course work is not completed within the fiv e-quarter time limit, a grade of U will be giv en. AU Audit\u2014indicates registration for attendance only, with 80 percent class attendance considered a requirement. A request to change a credit course to audit or an audit course to credit may be made no later than the fourteenth calendar day after the beginning of a quarter, or the sev enth calendar day after the beginning of the fiv e- week summer session. (This does not apply to short summer courses lasting only a week or two.) AUW Audit W ithdraw al\u2014giv en for withdrawing from a course, or to indicate that the 80 percent class attendance requirement w as not met. ACADEMIC ST ANDING The following classifications are based on scholastic performance, as defined by each school within the Univ ersity: regular standing or academic probation.72 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGVETERANS BENEFITS Under Title 38 of the U.S. Code, Loma Linda Univ ersity is approv ed for the training of v eterans and other eligible persons. Information regarding eligibility for these programs may be obtained by calling 888/GIBILL1 or 888/442-4551. Application for benefits must be made directly to the V eterans Administration (V A) and may be done via the W eb. The Office of Univ ersity Records serv es as the certifying official for Loma Linda Univ ersity. Students should contact the certifying official prior to their first enrollment certification. Students receiving v eteran's benefits who fail for three consecutiv e quarters to maintain the cumulativ e grade point av erage (G.P.A.) required for graduation will hav e their benefits interrupted, and the V A office will be notified. School of Medicine students must maintain satisfactory grades for all required courses for the y ear in which they are currently enrolled. If a grade in a required course reflects unsatisfactory progress, the School of Medicine student will not be certified until his/her probationary status (usually one y ear) has been remov ed. For more information, open links to the V A W eb site (\"Students\" or \"Prospectiv e Students\") on the W eb page at < llu.edu >. PRIV ACY RIGHTS OF STUDENTS IN ACADEMIC RECORDS Under the Family Education Rights and Priv acy Act (FERP A), students hav e full rights of priv acy with regard to their academic records, including their grade reports. Grades are av ailable to the student online at <llu.edu/central/ssw eb>. The Office of Univ ersity Records sends one copy of the student grade report to the school. The campus is authorized under FERP A to release \"directory information\" concerning students. The Univ ersity has classified the following as student directory information which may be released: name, address (permanent and local), picture, marital status, birth date, school, program, class, previous college, and telephone number, unless the student specifically requests in writing that the information not be released. Directory information will only be released by the academic dean's office of the school in which the student is enrolled. All requests for directory information receiv ed by all other offices of the Univ ersity will be transferred to the appropriate school office. GRADE CHANGE Faculty members are responsible for ev aluating and assigning grades. A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in arriving at or recording a grade. Such changes are permissible up to the end of the succeeding term. The faculty member must obtain the dean's signature on the Change of Grade form after the initial grade has been entered. REPEA TING A COURSE Once grades hav e been posted for a course, a student wishing to improv e his/her grade must repeat the course. When repeating a course, the student must attend class and laboratory sessions as ordinarily required and take all regularly scheduled examinations. The amount of tuition paid for repeated courses is determined by the school. Both the original and the repeat grades will appear on the student's permanent record, but only the repeat grade is computed in the G.P.A. and included in the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program.Academic Policies and Information 73PERSONAL LEA VE OF ABSENCE A leav e of absence is defined as being aw ay from school for the remainder of the quarter, to a maximum of one y ear, without the intent to return. The appropriate program withdraw al form must be obtained from the Univ ersity W eb site and approv ed by the dean or his/her designee prior to the student's departure. Stipulations for re-entry are giv en to the student in writing. The student should consult the Office of the Dean regarding the possibility of maintaining health cov erage and continuous registration during the leav e period. WITHDRA WAL To withdraw from a course(s), the student must complete a Registration Change Request (Add/Drop) form. If a student finds it necessary to withdraw from a degree or certificate program, the dean (or his/her designee) must be notified in writing. The student then arranges for formal withdraw al from the program by filing a Program W ithdraw al form from the Univ ersity W eb site. The Change of Program form or the Registration Change Request (Add/Drop) form should be completed as soon as possible after the student determines that s/he cannot complete the quarter. These forms must be filed no later than fourteen days prior to the end of the quarter. Courses dropped during the first two w eeks of the term are not included in the student's permanent record. If a student is discontinuing the entire program, the date the Program W ithdraw al form is properly submitted to the Office of Univ ersity Records will be the date of withdraw al used to calculate tuition refunds. T uition is refunded according to the practice outlined in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG. Failure to file the Program W ithdraw al form may result in avoidable charges to the student's account. The tuition refund policy for off-campus students is listed under the applicable school in Section III of this CATALOG. ADMINISTRA TIVE WITHDRA WAL Students who fail to make arrangements for a leav e of absence or continuing registration may be administrativ ely withdrawn from school. After one quarter, if the student has not re-enrolled, s/he will be inactiv ated. FACILIT ATING THE TRANSFER OF CURRENTL Y REGISTERED STUDENTS The following steps apply to processing an application for a student who is currently registered at Loma Linda Univ ersity: 1.The student submits application (online or paper ) to a new program that is not part of a joint/ combined degree arrangement. 2.The Office of Univ ersity Records prominently flags the transcript as being from a currently registered student. 3.The flagged Univ ersity transcript is program for ev aluation. 4.The new program contacts a designated person in the home school/program to obtain relev ant information about the student without rev ealing that an application is under consideration. 5.If the new program decides to accept the student, the acceptance letter instructs the student to take one of the following actions\u2014 Send a letter/deposit accepting the offer of admission and process a Total W ithdraw al form or a Leav e of Absence form for the program s/he is leaving, or74 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGDecline the offer of admission. 6.The home program has an opportunity to speak with the student when s/he attempts to get an advisor's signature on the Total W ithdraw al form. 7.The Office of Univ ersity Records updates the student's program in Banner upon processing of the Total W ithdraw al form for the old program and the student's acceptance into the new program. ACADEMIC RESIDENCE A student must meet the residence requirements indicated for a particular degree or certificate. CATALOG IN EFFECT FOR DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Subject to department approv al, students may complete degree requirements outlined in any CATALOG in effect during the time they are enrolled as accepted students in a school. How ever, students who hav e been on leav e of absence for more than one y ear, or who failed to register without leav e of absence (consult Office of the Dean regarding number of quarters) may be required to re-enter the program under the CA TALOG in effect at the time of re-entry, with the exception of students who are on leave from a school to pursue a medical or dental degree at this Univ ersity. Such students may complete their program under their original CA TALOG. GRADUA TION The responsibility for meeting graduation requirements rests primarily upon the student. Therefore, students should read and understand the requirements as set forth in this CA TALOG and consult carefully with their advisor to plan a sequence of courses each term that fulfills these requirements. A student's program of study is gov erned by the requirements listed in the Univ ersity CA TALOG at the time of admission; how ever, when circumstances demand, the Univ ersity reserv es the right to make changes with reference to admission, registration, tuition and fees, attendance, curriculum requirements, conduct, academic standing, candidacy, and graduation. The undergraduate who plans to graduate must submit an Undergraduate Intent to Graduate form two quarters prior to graduation. The form is av ailable online at < llu.edu/ssw eb/documents/intgrad.pdf >. COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES The candidate completing requirements in the Spring Quarter is expected to be present at the commencement exercises and receiv e the diploma in person. P ermission for the degree to be conferred in absentia is contingent upon the recommendation of the dean to the provost and can be granted only by the provost. If a candidate has not satisfactorily fulfilled all requirements, the Univ ersity reserv es the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises. DIPLOMA When the profession is named in the degree title, or when the degree is indicated by the school name, no other designation is included on the official diploma issued to the graduate. When the profession or major is not named in the degree title, the profession or specialization is also indicated on the official diploma.Academic Policies and Information 75Financial Policies and Information The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cov er all expenses before the beginning of each school y ear. Accounts with other schools or with this Univ ersity must be settled before enrollment will be allow ed or services offered. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees for each term are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration periods for each academic y ear. T uition and fees may v ary from amounts shown. P lease refer to the Student Account Disclosure statement for additional student account financial information (< llu.edu/ assets/central/ssw eb/studentfinance/documents/disclosure.pdf >). STUDENT FEES Enrollment fees Students attending this Univ ersity will be charged an enrollment fee, based on the criteria indicated below. Neither the fee in total nor any portion of the fee will be w aived under any circumstances. Other school-specific charges\u2014such as technology fees, laboratory fees, etc.\u2014may also appear on the student account. The following criteria gov ern the enrollment fee: 1.Students who are accepted into a degree program and registered will be charged the enrollment fee, regardless of the number of units for which they are registered. 2.Students who are not accepted into a degree program but who are registered as nondegree students for more than four units will be charged the enrollment fee. 3.Students who are working on \"In Progress\" courses and who are not registered for any other units will be charged the enrollment fee. 4.A student who is charged the enrollment fee but who drops all units before the deadline for a full refund (generally one w eek after the first day of classes), will receiv e a full refund of the enrollment fee and will hav e no access to any Univ ersity benefits. P lease refer to the percent refund policy. 5.LLUAHSC employ ees who are \"full-time, benefit eligible\" will not be charged the enrollment fee, whether they are using their education benefit or not. Spouses of employ ees who are using the employ ee benefit will be charged the enrollment fee. 6.Students participating in an off-campus or online program will not be charged the enrollment fee unless the program specifically requires this fee. 7.Other school-specific fees will be charged independent of the enrollment fee. Note: The student enrollment fee includes health cov erage. Other fees Late registration fee $50 Late payment fee $50 Returned check fee $25 Lost withdraw al check reissue fee $15 Returned direct deposit fee $1576 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGGENERAL PRACTICES Tuition payments/refunds Students who hav e not paid the balance due for registration, or who hav e not been aw arded financial aid sufficient to cov er the balance\u2014will be charged a $50 late payment fee. T uition and fees are due and payable in full to complete registration each term. If a student withdraws from a per-unit course or program, or from a block program up to 60 percent into a term, tuition will be refunded on a pro rata basis. Students who drop a course from a block program of courses will not receiv e a refund (please refer to the quarterly registration and refund dates < llu.edu/ssw eb/0terms/regdates.html >). Monthly statement The amount of the monthly statement is due and pay able in full upon presentation of the statement. A student unable to meet this requirement must make proper arrangements with the director of student finance. An account that is more than thirty days past due is subject to a finance charge of .833 percent per month (10 percent per y ear). Failure to pay scheduled charges or to make proper arrangements will be reported to the respectiv e school and may cause the student to be considered absent, discontinued, or ineligible to take final examinations. Students may also request that monthly statements be sent to a parent or sponsor. Financial clearance The student is expected to keep a clear financial status at all times.

Zappia Astudent who has an interest in science, an inv estigativ e mind that enjoys the challenge of solving problems quickly and accurately, and a desire to help others should consider a career as a clinical laboratory scientist.118 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGClinical laboratory scientists examine and analyze body fluids, tissues, and cells. They look for bacteria, parasites, or other microorganisms; analyze the chemical content of fluids; match blood for transfusions; and test for drug lev els in the blood to show how a patient is responding to treatment. Clinical laboratory scientists perform complex chemical, biological, hematological, immunologic, microscopic, and bacteriologic tests. They use, maintain, and troubleshoot sophisticated laboratory equipment that is used to perform diagnostic tests. The clinical laboratory scientist possesses the scientific and diagnostic skills required for DNA and biomolecular technology and genetic engineering applications, analyzes these test results, and discusses them with the medical staff. OPPORTUNITIES Employment of clinical laboratory workers is expected to parallel the growth of other health care occupations through the y ear 2014, particularly as the volume of laboratory tests increases with population growth and with the dev elopment of new technology. Employment opportunities are excellent, with current v acancy rates of 16 percent. The tw enty-first century is offering clinical laboratory scientists new av enues for test dev elopment, experimental design, administration, and education. Clinical laboratory scientists work in hospitals or similar medical facilities, clinical and reference laboratories, home health diagnostics, transfusion services, physicians' offices, and priv ate medical clinics. Employment is also av ailable in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, health information systems, DNA technology and genetic engineering corporations, research laboratories, federal government agencies, forensics and crime inv estigation, v eterinary hospitals, U.S. Public Health Service facilities, areas of medical product dev elopment, and customer and patient education.

Heustis Claro Y . Masangcay Marlene M. Ota Margaret A. T avares Pamela J. W at Cytotechnology is a specialty within the broad field of clinical laboratory science. The cytotechnologist, working under the direction of a pathologist, detects cell changes caused by different disease processes and is able to differentiate betw een normal, atypical, and malignant cell changes. In recognizing microscopic abnormalities of cells and cellular patterns from v arious body sites, the cytotechnologist assists the pathologist in detecting cancer at its earliest and potentially most curable stage. As a result, physicians are able to diagnose and treat cancer long before discov ering its existence by alternate methods. OPPORTUNITIES Cytotechnologists work in hospitals, clinics, and independent pathology laboratories. The employment outlook for cytotechnologists is favorable, with the demand for trained workers exceeding the supply. Cytotechnologists can adv ance to supervisory positions, participate in research activities, or become teachers in the field. Adv ancement is based on experience, skill, and adv anced education. THE PROGRAM The Cytotechnology Program, based on the completion of two y ears of study at an accredited college or univ ersity, leads either to a certificate or to a certificate and a Bachelor of Science degree. The program of study begins with the A utumn Quarter. A certificate is aw arded at the completion of the fourth quarter of study, and those electing to continue are aw arded the Bachelor of Science degree upon completion of an additional two quarters of study. W ith the certificate in cytotechnology and the baccalaureate degree, the student is eligible to take a national examination and become a registered cytotechnologist. Registered cytotechnologists entering the program to receiv e the Bachelor of Science degree are considered to hav e completed, on the basis of registry, the equiv alent course work listed in the first four quarters of the program. A total of 64 quarter units is applied tow ard the graduation requirements, provided the course work in pathology is equiv alent to that offered in the certificate curriculum at this Univ ersity. Where credit in pathology is not equiv alent, the requirement may be met by taking AHCJ 402, 403 at this Univ ersity; or by completing a minimum of 8 quarter units of upper division course work in developmental biology or comparativ e animal physiology at an accredited college or univ ersity.142 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGA writing v alidation examination will be administered to all students.

A career in health information management is likely to appeal to a person who has organizational and leadership abilities and who is interested in and has aptitude for medical science, but whose talents are suited for participation other than physical involv ement in human illness. The health information administrator (formerly known as medical record administrator ) designs, develops, and maintains systems for storage, retriev al, and dissemination of information in accordance with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. This person works with the medical staff and other health professionals in research, administrativ e studies, functions relativ e to health information, and patient-care ev aluation. The health information administrator in a health care facility will provide management leadership in planning and organizing the department, motiv ating and ev aluating employ ees, and providing in-service programs for departmental employ ees or other personnel in the facility. In addition, strategic planning involv ement for health information systems is an important function. OPPORTUNITIES While many health information administrators are employ ed in v arious areas of acute care facilities, others work in alternativ e deliv ery health care systems, research facilities, quality assurance, softw are development companies, industrial establishments, gov ernment agencies, medical departments of insurance companies, accounting firms, or as consultants to skilled nursing and other facilities. The multiplicity of new technologies, the adv ent of electronic health records, the demand for health information, the emphasis on ev aluation of care, the surge in research, the emphasis on cost control, and other factors combine to require comprehensiv e know ledge and increased utilization of administrativ e talent and judgment.

Medical dosimetry is a dynamic, exciting field involving a combined know ledge of mathematics, physics, and the biological and medical sciences. Dosimetrists plan optimal isodose distributions and treatment dose calculations for a v ariety of external beam as w ell as brachytherapy treatments. Medical dosimetrists must possess excellent analytical skills, the ability to critically ev aluate data, and an aptitude for physics and mathematics. They must also be able to work closely as a team with physicists, physicians, radiation therapists, and other personnel. Due to a lack of training programs in medical dosimetry throughout the United States, there is a shortage of medical dosimetrists in many areas of the country. This program aims to provide a supply of well-trained dosimetrists who will be able to meet the needs of radiation oncology facilities in the local area and beyond. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES Upon completion of the program, the graduate should be qualified to: 1.Demonstrate ability to accurately complete dosimetric calculations and procedures as they pertain to all aspects of treatment planning for external beam and brachytherapy. 2.Develop and define critical-thinking skills to enhance ability to analyze and compute dosimetric data as they relate to all aspects of radiation therapy treatment. 3.Exhibit professional behavior, which includes ability to communicate with other professionals and work w ell, both individually and as a team member. 4.Manage patients in an empathetic manner and exhibit basic patient-care proficiencies. 5.Support the professional code of ethics and comply with the stated scope of practice. ADMISSION EDUCA TIONAL BACKGROUND Students will either need to hav e: Track 1 -ARRT registration in radiation therapy technology, with a minimum of two y ears postgraduate clinical experience; or170 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGTrack 2 -A baccalaureate degree in physics, mathematics, or equiv alent from an accredited univ ersity. PROGRAM DESIGN The program for both tracks is fiv e quarters in length. Instruction includes a mixture of lecture, laboratory, and clinical work. Students will be exposed to a variety of methodologies within dosimetry, including work with proton therapy treatment planning. All instruction will be conducted in the Radiation Medicine Department of Loma Linda Univ ersity Medical Center. The only exceptions to this will be a short clinical rotation to Long Beach Memorial and City of Hope medical centers. The program faculty consists of physicists and dosimetrists who are extremely experienced in their field\u2014many in both photon and proton therapy treatment planning. ACCREDIT ATION The American Association of Medical Dosimetrists (AAMD) strongly supports the concept of formal dosimetry training, which leads to board eligibility for the certificate in medical dosimetry. This qualification is considered to be the gold standard in dosimetry education. The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic T echnology ( JRCERT) accreditation of dosimetry programs became av ailable in 2003. The program is currently in the accreditation process.

A growing number of dietitians are employ ed in physicians' offices, clinics, home health care agencies, mass communication, and many other entrepreneurial roles. By successfully passing the registration examination for dietitians, practice opportunities as a specialist in medical nutrition therapy, administrativ e dietetics, nutrition education, community nutrition, or research are av ailable. There is increased recognition of the importance of nutrition in the fields of medicine, dentistry, and health promotion\u2014with emphasis on fitness and optimal w ell-being. This indicates that the dietitian's scope of practice is steadily broadening. The registered dietitian in medical nutrition therapy applies the science of nutrition to the care of people through health promotion and disease prev ention, and uses medical nutrition therapy in the treatment of disease. The effectiv e dietitian must be aw are of the cultural, social, economic, aesthetic, and psychological factors that affect eating patterns. As a member of the patient-care team, the registered dietitian (RD) is responsible for assessing, implementing, and monitoring the nutritional care of patients. In addition, the RD may serv e professionally as a nutrition practitioner in health care; a teacher in an educational institution; a research dietitian; or a nutrition consultant-educator in municipal, state, or federal departments of health. The RD in management is accountable for the food service system. In a health care institution, s/he is responsible for the effectiv e functioning of food service from the standpoint of patients, administration, medical staff, and personnel. The administrativ e RD may also teach; manage food systems in educational, public, or commercial facilities; serv e as a consultant to health care or educational institutions; or enter the field of research. Community registered dietitians practice in div erse settings, translating nutrition science into improv ed health status. Challenges may include forming partnerships with v arious organizations, mastering technology, enacting regulations and policies that protect and improv e the public's health, and creativ ely managing scarce resources. Dietitians working in the community exhibit high-quality leadership and planning skills, and many create positions that are entrepreneurial as w ell as financially rewarding.

Zimmerman The occupational therapist works with persons who find it difficult to cope with psychological or physiological dysfunction. The primary concern of the therapist is to stimulate those changes in behavior patterns that will increase the patient's personal independence and ability to work within his/her cultural and personal milieu. To accomplish this goal, the occupational therapist ev aluates the patient; sets up treatment goals;194 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGand works together with the occupational therapy assistant in selecting tasks from the gamut of normal daily self-care activities, using them to assist the patient in gaining independent living skills regardless of disability or handicap. Essential to the role of occupational therapy is an interest in the behavioral sciences and a concern for the individual's need to find proper adjustments to life's circumstances. A desire to teach and a background or interest in medical science are beneficial. Those inclined to mechanical or scientific techniques are suited to helping patients dev elop their capacities for employment. Others find that they can use their interests in creativ e arts, crafts, music, and teaching to work with disabled homemakers, children, and retired persons. OPPORTUNITIES Occupational therapists practice in general hospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric or psychiatric clinics, schools, skilled nursing facilities, home care, and outpatient community-centered programs (including hand rehabilitation, work ev aluation, and adult day care facilities). Occupational therapy professionals hav e a wide choice of positions (using v aried therapeutic skills with individuals of v arying age and disability) and opportunities for adv ancement.

TongRespiratory Care\u2014AH 253Respiratory care is an allied health profession that promotes health and improv ement in the cardiopulmonary function of people with heart and lung abnormalities and disease. Newborn, pediatric, adult, and elderly patients are treated for a wide range of problems\u2014infant respiratory distress syndrome; trauma; cardiopulmonary arrest; conditions brought on by shock; postoperativ e surgical complications; and respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. The respiratory care practitioner is a member of the health care team in medical centers, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient rehabilitation programs, physician offices, and in-home care. Many are involv ed in research and dev elopment of new and innov ative care and equipment. They are effectiv e communicators and compassionate caregiv ers, possessing an aw areness of cultural sensitivity and div ersity. They hav e leadership roles in patient education, w ellness interv ention, and dev elopment of respiratory care plans. Respiratory care professionals apply critical-thinking skills in cardiopulmonary diagnostics and patient assessment to optimize decision making and deliv ery of patient care. In a time of high technology, increasing growth of the elderly population, and increasing numbers of patients with asthma and chronic lung disease, there is a greater demand for educated and skilled respiratory care practitioners. PROFESSIONAL ACCREDIT ATION, LICENSURE, AND CREDENTIALING Respiratory Care Program accreditation is provided by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC). Standards and guidelines published by CoARC must be met, relev ant to general and respiratory care education and to ongoing program assessment and improv ement. Inquiries regarding CoARC can be directed to 1248 Harwood Road, Bedford, TX 76021-4244; telephone, 817/ 283-2835; or W eb site, < coarc.com >. The Respiratory Care Program at Loma Linda Univ ersity is CoARC accredited. Graduates of CoARC-accredited respiratory care programs must apply to the state of California Department of Consumer Affairs Respiratory Care Board (RCB) for a license to practice in the state. The RCB requires that graduates of respiratory care programs complete general and respiratory care education courses with grades of C or abov e, resulting in a minimum of an Associate in Science degree in respiratory care. Graduates must successfully complete an examination for licensure, declare felony convictions, and undergo fingerprinting. License denial may occur due to prior felony conviction(s).

The National Board for Respiratory Care, Inc. (NBRC), provides nationally recognized credentialing examinations for graduates of accredited respiratory care programs. Those who successfully complete the entry-lev el examination receiv e the certified respiratory therapist (CRT) credential. This examination is currently required by the state of California for licensure to practice respiratory care. Adv anced practitioner examinations are required for the registered respiratory therapist (RRT) credential, neonatal- pediatric specialist certification (NPS), and certified (CPFT) and registered (RPFT) pulmonary function technologist.

Dean, School of Dentistry278 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGSchool Foundations HISTOR Y A small but determined group of dentists met during the summer of 1943 in Grand Ledge, Michigan. Their purpose w as to establish an organization that would serv e as a catalyst, urging the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church to sponsor a dental school where young adults could learn the dental profession in an environment consistent with their religious beliefs. These men w ere the founders of the National Association of Sev enth-day Adv entist Dentists (NASDAD). Under the leadership of Dr. J. Russell Mitchell, the organization's first president, the goal of a Christian dental school began taking conceptual form. NASDAD expanded in membership and objectiv es through men such as Dr. C. C. Ray, who toured the country on his own time in search of fellow Sev enth-day Adv entist dentists who w ere willing to pursue NASDAD's goals. Dr. M. W ebster Prince serv ed as president of NASDAD in 1948 and 1949. A t a meeting in San Francisco in 1949, NASDAD members voted unanimously to support the dental school project. Later that y ear at a NASDAD session in Hinsdale, Illinois, the members pledged a strong financial base in support of their goals. The momentum of the effort became evident in the early 1950s. The General Conference of Sev enth-day Adv entists, under the guidance of President W . H. Branson, asked Dr. Prince to conduct a feasibility study. Official action w as taken in 1951 to authorize establishment of the School of Dentistry as a unit of Loma Linda Univ ersity's School of Medicine. Dr. Prince w as selected as the first dean of the School of Dentistry. His leadership in organizing and ev entually administering the new School of Dentistry w as facilitated by his prior experience as president of the Michigan Dental Association and as chair of the American Dental Association Council on Dental Education. Forty-two students comprised the inaugural class in the late fall of 1953. A dental hygiene curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree w as dev eloped in 1959 under the direction of Dr. Gerald A. Mitchell, chair of the Department of P eriodontics. V iolet Bates became chair of the new department, and the first class of ten dental hygienists graduated in 1961. In 1960, Dr. Charles T . Smith became dean. During this period, the school experienced positiv e growth in many areas. A dental assisting curriculum w as dev eloped in 1968 under the leadership of Betty Zendner. The first class graduated in 1969, receiving the Associate in Science degree. A dental auxiliary utilization (DAU) program w as initiated to provide enhanced learning for dental students. The Monument V alley Dental Clinic for Nav ajo Indians w as started in 1966, and Dean Smith succeeded in finding from public sources fiscal support for the clinic building and for faculty housing. New adv anced education (postdoctoral) programs w ere initiated in fiv e clinical disciplines: orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics, and oral pathology. During the 1970s, the School of Dentistry continued its evolution into one of the premier clinical programs in the United States. Dr. Judson Klooster became dean in 1971. One of his major contributions was the expansion of Prince Hall, which w as completed in May 1976. The new building more than doubled the number of clinical units; provided facilities for specialized areas of clinical instruction; and included eight new research laboratories, new classrooms, seminar rooms, amphitheaters, urgently needed teacher office space, and a commensurate expansion of support facilities and services. The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic w as remodeled, and an outpatient surgicenter w as dev eloped to meet the needs of patients requiring general anesthesia for dental treatment. The School of Dentistry became an important regional resource for providing dental care for developmentally disabled children and adults, many of whom require such a treatment setting. The Biomaterials Research Laboratory w as constructed; and new adv anced education programs w ere initiatedSchool Foundations 279in pediatric dentistry, implant dentistry, dental anesthesiology, and prosthodontics. A new program w as established in 1985 to provide a U.S. dental education for foreign-trained dentists. An increasing number of dental professionals from other countries w ere seeking an American education and the opportunity to practice dentistry in the United States or to gain adv anced know ledge to share in their own countries. The International Dentist Program continues to offer an intensiv e, tw enty-one-month course of study leading to a D.D.S. degree. The program has added a six-month certificate program limited to dental missionaries from other countries who sense the need for updated continuing education. In 2000, the first major expansion of the School of Dentistry in more than tw enty y ears added 15,000 square feet to Prince Hall on the east side and provided two new patient entrances. The expanded Special Care Dentistry Clinic and the enlarged P ediatric Dentistry Clinic w ere relocated to the ground floor. An additional student laboratory w as also included on that lev el. On the second floor, the new space allow ed for expansion of the predoctoral clinic, with thirty-six additional operatories. A preclinical laboratory w as remodeled into a simulation laboratory in 2008. The laboratory included flat-panel monitors with access to the substantial digital resource library created by faculty. In 2009, the Department of Orthodontics and the adv anced education program mov ed into new facilities designed as a model for providing student education and patient care in a digital world. The School of Dentistry continues to regularly expand the opportunities for enhanced student learning by improving physical facilities; making regular curricular modifications; and introducing new interactiv e, navigable, nonlinear digital UNIVERSITY CA TALOGOur Mission Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Dentistry seeks to further the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ wherein: Students learn to provide high-quality oral health care based on sound biologic principles.

The following college courses are required for entrance into the D.D.S. degree program: Humanities Freshman English (complete course sequence, two semesters or two quarters) to include composition and literature Natural Sciences A complete course sequence, two semesters or two quarters or equiv alent, is required in each science listed unless otherwise noted. General biology or zoology with laboratory General chemistry with laboratory General physics with laboratory Organic/inorganic chemistry with laboratory Biochemistry (one semester or a minimum of 4 units; two quarters or a minimum of 6 units) Electiv es (strongly recommended) Cell and molecular biology Genetics Gross anatomy Histology Immunology Microbiology Neuroscience Systems physiology Accounting Ceramics Management Nutrition Psychology292 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGStudents preparing for the predoctoral program are required to complete a minimum of three academic years with no few er than 96 semester or 144 quarter units in a college or univ ersity accredited by a regional accrediting association. Preference is giv en to applicants who hav e completed or will complete the requirements for a baccalaureate degree prior to admission. A maximum of 64 semester or 96 quarter units of credit may be accepted from an accredited junior or community college. A complete academic y ear of class work (8 semester or 12 quarter units) in general biology, general chemistry, organic and inorganic chemistry, and general physics is required. Also required is a complete sequence of freshman English that includes composition and literature (two semesters or two quarters). The biochemistry requirement is one semester or a minimum of 4 units or two quarters or a minimum of 6 units. All science prerequisites must be completed within fiv e years prior to admission, with a grade of C or abov e in each course. A minimum grade-point av erage of 2.7 in science subjects and in nonscience subjects, averaged separately, is required. The av erage grade-point av erage for accepted students is substantially higher. Students who are enrolled in another program in Loma Linda Univ ersity are not considered for admission until they hav e completed or hav e been released from the program. Prior to consideration for admission, the applicant must meet specific criteria related to past academic performance (G.P.A.), performance on the Dental Admission T est (DA T), and a personal interview. Applicants are expected to hav e taken the DA T within the previous two y ears, preferably not later than October of the y ear preceding expected matriculation. A t the applicant's request, test results are sent to the school by the testing service.

In order to be better prepared with specific vocabulary and understanding, the applicant should include science courses with content similar to courses offered during the first y ear of the professional curriculum. The applicant's purpose should be the pursuit of div erse know ledge, the cultiv ation of an inquiring mind, the practice of efficient methods of study, and the habit of thinking and reasoning independently. The choice of electiv es can broaden the applicant's view of the scope of know ledge. Being w ell-read will giv e a perspectiv e on the sw eep of human thought throughout the ages, and often this will be of assistance in written and v erbal communication and will improv e the individual's ability to think and express him-/herself w ell. Psychological, social, philosophical, and religious insights will help to dev elop basic resources for the solution of personal problems and the growth of self-understanding the student must hav e in order to understand and help associates. An applicant from a college or univ ersity outside the United States or Canada or from a nonaccredited college or univ ersity in the United States must complete a minimum of one full academic y ear (24 semester or 36 quarter credits) in competition with other preprofessional students in an accredited college or univ ersity in the United States. This includes the required specific core sciences in the areas of biology, organic and inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics (all sciences must include laboratories). A grade of C or abov e in each course completed is required. (A grade of C- will not be accepted.) Application procedure The school participates in the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS).

The application should be completed and returned to the W ashington address indicated on the application. AADSAS processes this application and sends copies to the schools of the applicant's choice. The School of Dentistry at Loma Linda Univ ersityGeneral Information 293recommends that applicants file their AADSAS application before A ugust 1 in order to be competitiv e. To be giv en consideration for the next entering class, the student's application deadline is December 1. The following is a step-by-step process for completing an application to Loma Linda Univ ersity (LLU). 1.AADSAS application. The Office of Admissions receiv es applications from AADSAS. 2.Supplementary application. The applicant then receiv es an email invitation from LLU to complete an electronic supplementary application. 3.Supplementary application deadline. The applicant must return the completed supplementary application and materials within thirty days. This includes an essay specific to Loma Linda Univ ersity, a w allet-sized photograph, and the application fee of $75. 4.Transcripts. Official transcripts must be sent to AADSAS. When an applicant becomes an accepted student, official transcripts\u2014mailed directly from all colleges/univ ersities to LLU\u2014are required in order for the student to be registered for the first quarter of classes. 5.References. The applicant is asked to supply a minimum of three personal references. It is recommended that these include an academic reference from a science instructor; a reference from an employ er; a character or religious reference, such as from a minister; and a reference from a friend in the dental profession. If the applicant has attended a college or univ ersity that has a preprofessional committee that prepares a preprofessional ev aluation, it is required that Loma Linda Univ ersity be sent a copy of this ev aluation from the committee. Members of the applicant's family are excluded from writing the required letters of reference, although letters will be accepted for the file in addition to those required. Recommendation letters must be sent to AADSAS and released then by AADSAS to Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Dentistry. 6.Dental Admission T est.The applicant is required to complete and meet specific criteria related to performance on the Dental Admission T est (DA T). Preference is giv en to applicants who hav e taken the test by October of the academic y ear preceding that for which admission is desired.

If the test has been taken more than one time, the most recent scores are used for admission criteria. The committee reviews all scores on the test. The DA T scores must be on file at Loma Linda Univ ersity before an acceptance to the school will be issued. T est results should be sent to Loma Linda Univ ersity, School of Dentistry, Office of Admissions. References may also be sent directly to Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Dentistry. 7.Interview. The applicant's records will be screened when the supplementary application, recommendations, and transcripts are on file. The applicant may then be invited to the school for a personal interview. An interview is required for admission. The interview provides an opportunity for ev aluation of noncognitiv e factors, including communication skills, personal v alues, motiv ation, and commitment to goals of the profession; as w ell as genuine concern for others in the service of dentistry. A t the time of the interview, a tour of the school will be giv en by a current student in the program. 8.Observ ation.

Students must possess the motor and sensory capabilities necessary to directly perform palpation, percussion, auscultation and other diagnostic maneuv ers, basic laboratory tests, and diagnostic procedures. Exercising these capabilities requires coordination of both gross and fine muscular mov ements, equilibrium, and functional tactile and visual senses. Students must be able to operate foot controls, utilizing fine mov ements; and to operate high- or low-speed dental instruments, accurately performing mov ements of less than one-half millimeter. Students must also hav e the capability to utilize dental hand instruments with tactile sense and precise control. Students must be able to perform basic life support (e.g., CPR), transfer and position disabled patients, and physically restrain patients who lack motor control. Additionally, they must be able to position or reposition themselv es around the patient and dental chair while sitting or standing. Behavioral and psychosocial skills Students must possess the emotional stability and resilience required for full utilization of their abilities in the context of a full and challenging education program. Success in the educational program requires use of good judgment; prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients; and dev elopment of mature, sensitiv e, and effectiv e relationships with patients, staff, and colleagues. It is also imperativ e that students be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectiv ely under stress. Students must be able to adapt to changing environments, must display flexibility, and must learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, cultural sensitivity, and motiv ation are personal qualities that will be assessed during the admissions and education process. Disabled applicants and students It is Loma Linda Univ ersity's policy to comply fully with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sect. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The school is committed to providing dental education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applicants who will be able to perform all technical standards with or without accommodations; and for whom such accommodation does not fundamentally alter the School of Dentistry courses or create an undue burden. During the application process, the school requests that an applicant disclose any disability for which an accommodation may be needed. The Admissions Committee requires written documentation of the disability, which they will review prior to making an assessment as to whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. A student who desires accommodation for any disability identified after admission must request the associate dean for student affairs for ev aluation with appropriate Univ ersity entities. Appropriate and reasonable accommodation will be provided, as necessary. POLICIES FOR THIS SCHOOL The information on student life contained in this CA TALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensiv ely addresses Univ ersity and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is av ailable to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselv es with the contents of the Student Handbook .Student Life 303PROFESSIONAL ETHICS The following core v alues are identified by the Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Dentistry to be of utmost importance in the life of students: Belief in God Spiritual principles Care for others Service to others Commitment to progressiv e excellence Critical thinking Respect for the individual Personal integrity Student focused Pursuit of know ledge Industry Effectiv e communication The School code of ethics expands and elaborates Loma Linda Univ ersity's standards of ethical conduct. Organized dentistry is proud of its reputation for honesty and integrity. These virtues are essential for each member of the profession, if dentistry is to continue to maintain its position of trust within society. The establishment of peer review committees, ethics committees, codes of ethics, and other regulatory and/or advisory processes and standards within the professions indicate a vital and continuing concern with maintaining high standards of integrity. The School of Dentistry is a place where the professionals are selected and trained in the dev elopment of professional and ethical attitudes consistent with the highest goals of the profession. For this purpose the School of Dentistry has dev eloped a code of ethics. This code is a means of educating and training the future dental professionals in ethics, and is a means of dev eloping an ethical and moral aw areness that will help the individual serv e the public and the professions in an enlightened manner. In addition, the school seeks to broaden students' ethical perceptions by including a religious perspectiv e not alw ays found in ethical codes. By adding a spiritual foundation to the professions' ethical frameworks, it is anticipated that the dental professionals' ethic will be more completely informed, and will not only reflect concern for his or her fellows, but also reflect an intimate relationship with the creator God. The code contains specific admonitions which are limited in number but comprehensiv e in nature. It is anticipated that v alues of honesty, integrity, and altruism will be enhanced by students during their professional training so that following graduation these virtues will be second nature in the professional service provided to patients. Thus, the relationship of trust betw een dental professional and patient can develop to benefit both the profession and the public. This is a goal the School feels it must meet as it seeks to train the dental professionals to become competent in all aspects of patient care. The School of Dentistry code of professional ethics applies to all students (dental hygiene, predoctoral, and international dentist students; as w ell as, graduate, certificate, residents, fellows, preceptors, research scholars, and exchange students). The School of Dentistry code of professional ethics with its specific guidelines is av ailable for review in the School of Dentistry section of the LLU Student Handbook .304 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGPROFESSIONAL PROCESSES AND ST ANDARDS Professional leadership For all leadership positions, students must maintain a minimum G.P.A. of 2.7 (for president or vice president) and a minimum G.P.A. of 2.5 for all other offices. Dental Student Association The primary student organization in the School of Dentistry is the Dental Student Association (DSA ). DSA purposes to foster service-learning activities, stimulate scientific research, facilitate professional development, involv e students in the gov ernance of the school, and encourage recreational and social experiences. All predoctoral dental and international dentistry students and dental hygiene students automatically become members of the DSA at matriculation. DSA officers are elected by ballot ev ery spring with their term beginning in summer. The officers include: president, vice president, social vice president, secretary, treasurer, and chaplain. Professional organizations Students are invited to represent the school in the relev ant professional organizations. The Office of Student Affairs facilitates the process to elect representativ es for the following organizations: Loma Linda Univ ersity Dental Student Association (DSA ) American Student Dental Association (ASDA ) American Dental Hygiene Association (ADHA ) California Dental Association (CDA ) American Dental Education Association (ADEA ) Class leadership Class leaders are elected annually during the Fall Quarter for the first y ear and summer quarters thereafter. Leaders are elected by class colleagues and voted into office by a confidential vote. The leaders work as a team to coordinate class ev ents\u2014including learning, spiritual, and social experiences. The leaders also facilitate communication betw een their class and school administration. Standing committees Students are invited to serv e on numerous standing committees for the school for each academic y ear. The Office of Student Affairs consults with DSA prior to nominating students to serv e on committees, including Academic Review Committee and Professional Standards Committee. The election process takes place during the Summer Quarter. SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES Conv entions The annual Alumni-Student Conv ention, sponsored since 1960 by the Alumni Association, giv es opportunity for students to meet alumni and listen to presentations by prominent guest lecturers in the dental profession. Students hav e the opportunity to research presentations in the form of table clinics. The winners are then invited to present their table clinics at state and national conv entions.Student Life 305Dedication service A dedication service is held during the conv ention, giving students an opportunity to dedicate their professional life to Christ. First-y ear students (D1) are presented with personalized Scriptures; graduating students are giv en personalized Loma Linda Univ ersity laboratory coats.306 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGAcademic Information GENERAL POLICIES Registration The student must register on or before the dates designated by the Office of Univ ersity Records. Early registration is encouraged. Registration procedures are completed electronically at the myLLU registration portal < ssweb.llu.edu/login >. Once at the portal, a student must clear registration holds (student health, transcript, housing) and finance. A t the beginning of the first quarter of attendance, a student is required to hav e a picture taken for the student identification badge. International students must also register with the International Student Affairs office each quarter. Late registration is permissible only in case of a compelling reason. A charge is applied if registration is not completed by the designated dates. The student may not attend class without being registered, and in no case may registration take place later than the first w eek of the term. A change in registration after the second w eek affects the grade record. A student may not concurrently register for courses in another school of the Univ ersity without permission from the executiv e associate dean. Attendance Regular attendance at lectures, clinics, and other assemblies is required of all students. All lectures and laboratories provide information essential for successful completion of the program. Each student is responsible for all material cov ered and assignments made. Absences in excess of 15 percent may be sufficient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Clinics and individual courses/instructors may hav e more stringent requirements. Length of academic residence To fulfill the requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, the student must be registered for a full course load at the Univ ersity for the entire senior y ear for the Bachelor of Science degree; and the entire third (D3) and fourth (D4) y ears for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Dean's list Outstanding academic performance will be rew arded by publication of the Dean's List each quarter. The eligibility requirements are: Complete at least 12 units of graded course work during the quarter; Achiev e a term grade-point av erage of at least 3.5 with no grade low er than a B-; Receiv e no incomplete grades on the grade report. Course w aiver A course requirement may be w aived if the applicant has previously taken the course and earned a grade of B or abov e, but no credit results. Ev aluation for w aiver of courses will be completed only after an applicant has been accepted to the program, and must be approv ed by the course director at this Univ ersity and the school's executiv e associate dean. T uition is not reduced if courses are w aived or if a student takes less than a full load.Academic Information 307Special examination It is the policy of the school that all students are expected to take examinations at the scheduled time. The only acceptable excuse for not taking an examination on time is major illness (documented by the Student Health Service and conv eyed to the course director and the Office of Student Affairs prior to the examination). The consequences of missing an examination under the circumstances of documented illness are determined by the course director. If a student appears late for an examination, s/he may be denied admission to the examination site. If a student arriv es late for an examination and is allow ed to take it, s/he will be required to finish the examination at the same time as students who arriv e on time. Repeating/Remediating a course (predoctoral, IDP, and dental hygiene programs) If a student receiv es an unsatisfactory or failing grade in a required course, it will be necessary for him/ her to do additional work. Based on the original grade earned by the student, and upon the recommendation of the Academic Review Committee, one of the following plans will be pursued: 1.For courses with unsatisfactory performance (D+/D/U grades) the student must reregister for the course, review the course work independently, repeat required assignments or quizzes, and take any or all course examinations as required by the course director. The highest grade allow ed for a remediated course is C. A t the discretion of the Academic Review Committee and course director, the student may be required to repeat the course at the next course offering. 2.For courses with failing performance (F grades), the student must reregister for the course, attend the class and/or laboratory, and take all course examinations at the next regular course offering. 3.Both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade units are computed in the grade-point av erage.

NATIONAL DENT AL BOARDS Successful completion of the National Board Examination, P arts I and II (NBE-I and NBE-II) is a requirement for graduation. The National Board examinations are designed to assess cognitiv e know ledge of the basic, behavioral, and clinical sciences. Eligibility to sit for either part of the National Board Examination is determined by successful completion of the curriculum leading up to the examination. In addition, students are required to pass a comprehensiv e examination that assesses mastery of the test specifications prior to each National Board Examination. The eligibility requirements and timetable for passing the National Board Examination are stated below: Part I First attempt Scheduled during June or July following completion of the second y ear. If a student fails the examination, s/he will hav e her/his scheduled clinic time substantially reduced. During this time, students will be required to study for a reexamination no later than December. Second attempt If a student does not successfully complete the second attempt of the P art I examination by the end of Autumn Quarter, s/he will be required to take a two-quarter leav e of absence to prepare for re- examination the succeeding Summer Quarter. Third attempt After taking the reexamination in the succeeding Summer Quarter, the student will be allow ed to work on the clinic until examination results are receiv ed. If the student successfully completes the P art I examination, s/he will continue to work on the clinic for the Summer and A utumn quarters and will begin didactic courses again during the W inter Quarter with the current third-y ear students. If the student does not successfully complete the National Board Examination, P art I on the third attempt, s/he will be discontinued from the program. Part II First attempt Scheduled in December of the fourth y ear. If the examination is not successfully completed, access to the clinic will be restricted in order to provide additional time for study. The student will be giv en an opportunity to retake the examination in the following Spring Quarter. National Board Examination policy requires subsequent attempts to be at least ninety days apart. If a student fails the P art II examination, s/he will not be permitted to participate in licensure examinations.Academic Information 311Second attempt A student who fails the P art II examination a second time will be required to take a leav e of absence to prepare for a re-examination. A candidate for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree must hav e successfully completed P arts I and II of the National Board Examination before being aw arded the D.D.S. degree. PROCEDURES FOR ACADEMIC REVIEW (PREDOCTORAL, IDP, AND DENT AL HYGIENE PROGRAMS) There are six academic review committees: D1, D2, D3, D4, IDP, and Dental Hygiene. Membership of each committee consists of the executiv e associate dean, the associate dean for student affairs, the associate dean for admissions, and the course directors of all courses required of the respectiv e class in the academic y ear. The associate dean for clinic administration and primary attending faculty are members of the D3/D4 academic review committees. In addition, each committee has two student members appointed by the dean in consultation with the DSA officers. Student committee members will be in the class one y ear ahead of the class being review ed. The academic review committees meet once per quarter to ev aluate student academic and clinical performance and progress records. Students whose performance does not meet the stated academic standards and students who are being considered for discontinuation may be scheduled for a hearing with the committee. The committee also recommends to the dean all appropriate candidates for promotion, academic probation, repeat, or other appropriate actions; as w ell as students who should receiv e special recognition for academic excellence. The process for ev aluation of academic performance is as follows: 1.The academic review committee\u2014by reviewing grades, reports, and other pertinent information\u2014identifies students whose academic and/or clinical performance is below acceptable levels. 2.The associate dean for student affairs notifies a student facing possible academic sanctions regarding the time and place for a hearing called for the purpose of allowing the student to appear before the committee to present reasons why action should not be taken. The academic review committee considers the student's presentation and all av ailable information before making a recommendation. 3.The dean may enforce one or more of four academic sanction options: Academic probation Remedial action Academic leav e of absence Academic discontinuation Please refer to the academic disciplinary policy for more specific descriptions regarding each academic sanction. 4.A student may appeal the decision of the academic review committee to the dean. Such appeals are not expected to be routine and should be considered only in circumstances where new and relev ant information exists that w as not av ailable for consideration by the academic review committee. The dean will review the matter and either render a decision or appoint a three- member ad hoc committee. Members of this committee will not hav e been involv ed in the academic review committee decision process. The ad hoc committee will determine whether the312 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGprocess w as appropriately follow ed, review new information, and judge whether the record supports the decision. They will report their findings and recommendation to the dean, who will decide if the appealing student will be permitted to continue participating in classes and/or clinical assignments during the appeal proceedings. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINAR Y POLICY (PREDOCTORAL, IDP, AND DENT AL HYGIENE PROGRAMS) Academic probation Academic probation is a specified period of time during which the student is giv en an opportunity to comply with specific academic standards. Such action must be confirmed by letter to the student. Criteria for placement on academic probation A student will be placed on academic probation if s/he meets one or more of the following conditions: 1.Term or cumulativ e 2.Failing or unsatisfactory (U/F/D+/D) grades in any course required for the degree. 3.Clinical performance below minimum expected for current academic lev el. 4.Social/behavioral/ethical problems that significantly impact academic and/or clinical performance. Level of academic probation The lev el of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulativ e academic deficiency. How ever, depending on the seriousness or nature of the academic deficiency, a student may be considered for academic leav e of absence or discontinuation at any lev el of probation. LevelI First term on academic probation. LevelII Second term on academic probation, consecutiv e or nonconsecutiv e. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term or failure to reregister in the succeeding quarter. LevelIII Third term on academic probation, consecutiv e or nonconsecutiv e. If a student is unable to remov e academic probationary status within the following term, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term or failure to reregister in the succeeding quarter. LevelIV If a student meets the criteria for academic probation for a fourth term, consecutiv e or nonconsecutiv e, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. Clinic probation (predoctoral program) Student in good clinic standing The student who meets attendance requirements, clinic point requirements, and requirements as defined by the clinical departments in the School of Dentistry shall receiv e a \"Satisfactory\" (S) grade for the quarter.Academic Information 313Clinic Probation Lev el I (CPI) A student who meets one or more of the following criteria: 1.Fails to meet the attendance requirement. 2.Fails to meet the published minimum clinic point requirement. 3.Fails to achiev e the standards of care expected in the quality of patient treatment. 4.Fails to meet the requirements defined by the clinical departments in the School of Dentistry. A student on CPI will receiv e a \"Marginal Satisfactory\" (MS) grade and may be required to attend Friday afternoon clinic sessions for the following quarter. The student on CPI will not be eligible for honors programs during the time s/he is on probation. The student is notified in writing of his/her probation status. If a student, while on CPI, meets the attendance requirements, achiev es the ov erall minimum clinic point requirement at the end of the remedial quarter, improv es the quality of patient treatment as needed, and completes all requirements as defined by the clinical departments, s/he returns to \"good standing\" status and will not be required to attend the Friday afternoon clinic sessions the following quarter. Clinic Probation Lev el II (CPII) A student who, while on Clinic Probation Lev el I, meets one or more of the following criteria: 1.Fails to meet the attendance requirement. 2.Falls more than 200 points below the minimum points required for the remedial quarter. 3.Fails to achiev e the standards of care expected in the quality of patient care. 4.Fails to complete requirements defined by the clinical departments in the School of Dentistry. A student on Clinical Probation Lev el II will receiv e an \"Unsatisfactory\" (U) grade, reregister for the SDCL course for which s/he receiv ed the \"U\" grade, and continue to attend Friday afternoon clinic sessions. A student on CPII will not be eligible for honors programs. The student on CPII will hav e one quarter to meet the attendance requirement, finish the quarter with few er than 200 points below the requirement, meet the standard of care expected in the quality of patient care, and complete all requirements as defined by the clinical departments in the School of Dentistry. If a student, while on CPII, meets the attendance requirement, improv es the quality of patient care, completes the requirements defined by the clinical departments of the School of Dentistry, and finishes the quarter with few er than 200 points below the minimum, s/he will return to CPI. The student can eventually work back to good standing. Clinic Probation Lev el III (CPIII) A student who, while on CPII, meets one or more of the following criteria: 1.Completes the remedial quarter more than 200 points below the minimum. 2.Fails to meet the attendance requirement. 3.Fails to achiev e the standards of care expected in the quality of patient care. 4.Fails to complete requirements defined by the clinical departments in the School of Dentistry during the remedial quarter.314 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGClinic Probation Lev el III requires the academic review committee to consider discontinuing the student or to require him/her to repeat one academic y ear. If the academic review committee votes to require a student to repeat a y ear, the student will join the next graduating class at that point in the academic calendar. The academic review committee will determine which courses (if any) the student must repeat. When a student is required to repeat one y ear, s/he immediately returns to \"good standing\" status. Restrictions for a student on academic probation A student on academic probation: 1.May not serv e as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2.May not take any electiv e courses. 3.May not participate in any electiv e off-campus service learning or mission activities. 4.Remains on academic probation until all the terms of the probation sanctions hav e been fulfilled, unless the student is discontinued. Remedial action or remediation As a condition for continued enrollment, remedial action for the student may consist of : 1.Counseling, tutoring, and/or repeating assignments or course work; or completing additional assignments or course work, possibly including repeating an academic y ear or portion thereof. 2.Other specified requirements. Academic leav e of absence Academic leav e of absence is a specified period of time during which the student is withdrawn from the academic program. Upon request to and approv al by the academic review committee, the student may return to the program at a y ear/term lev el specified by the committee. The student may be requested to fulfill specific requirements prior to re-entering the academic program. The following guidelines pertain to when an academic leav e of absence may be considered for a student who is in one or more of the following situations: Student has a serious academic deficit which cannot be remov ed while continuing with current course work. At the end of the academic y ear, student does not meet the criteria for promotion to the next academic y ear. Student has three consecutiv e quarters on academic probation. Student has not passed the National Board Examination on schedule after two attempts and needs full study time to prepare for the National Board Examination. Student fulfills criteria for academic discontinuation, y et shows promise for future success despite current deficiencies. Return from an academic leav e of absence requires that the student reapply for admission by written request to the executiv e associate dean. The student must meet the requirements for readmission specified by the academic review committee at the time the leav e of absence w as granted. The requirements for readmission may also be review ed by the academic review committee.Academic Information 315Academic discontinuation Guidelines for academic discontinuation are indicated below for predoctoral, IDP, and dental hygiene students: D1 Y ear Any term with one or more failing grades, regardless of term or cumulativ e G.P.A.

ACADEMIC DISCIPLINAR Y POLICY Academic probation Academic probation is a specified period of time during which the student is giv en an opportunity to comply with specific academic standards. Such action must be confirmed by memorandum to the student. For a postdoctoral student/resident, a grade of 3.0 (B) is considered satisfactory performance for graduate credit. Criteria for advisory notice of potential for academic probation (postdoctoral students and residents) A postdoctoral student/resident will be sent an advisory letter of the potential for placement on academic probation under the following conditions: 1.Term G.P.A. of 2.7 (B-). 2.One or more courses with grade of B-. 3.One or more courses with a grade of marginally satisfactory (MS). Criteria for placement on academic probation (postdoctoral students and residents) A postdoctoral student/resident will be placed on academic probation if s/he meets one or more of the following conditions: 1.Term G.P.A. of 2.3 (C+) or below. 2.One or more courses with B-, C+, or C grade; and an ov erall G.P.A. below 3.0. 3.Failing (F/U/D+/D/D-) or unsatisfactory (C-) grades in any course required for the specialty certificate, Master of Science (M.S.) degree, or Master of Science in Dentistry (M.S.D.) degree program. 4.Clinical performance below minimum expected for his/her y ear lev el. 5.Social/behavioral/ethical problems that significantly impact academic and/or clinical performance.Academic Information 319Level of academic probation (postdoctoral student and resident) The lev el of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulativ e academic deficiency. How ever, depending on the seriousness or nature of the academic deficiency, a student/resident may be considered for academic leav e of absence or discontinuation at any lev el of probation. Level I First term on academic probation. Level II Second term on academic probation, consecutiv e or nonconsecutiv e. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term. Level III Third term on academic probation, consecutiv e or nonconsecutiv e. If a student/resident is unable to remov e academic probationary status within the following term, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term. Level IV If a student/resident meets criteria for academic probation for a fourth term, consecutiv e or nonconsecutiv e, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. Restrictions for a student on academic probation A student/resident on academic probation: 1.May not serv e as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2.May not take any electiv e courses. 3.May not participate in any electiv e off-campus service learning or mission activities. 4.Remains on academic probation until all the terms of the probation sanctions hav e been fulfilled, unless the student/resident is discontinued. Remedial action (remediation) As a condition for continued enrollment, remedial action may consist of : 1.Counseling, tutoring, and/or repeating assignments or course work; or completing additional assignments or course work\u2014possibly including repeating an academic y ear or portion thereof. 2.Other specified requirements. DISCIPLINAR Y ACTIONS A student who is not performing up to expectations can receiv e the following: 1.Restriction of clinical privileges\u2014by program director. 2.Academic probation (Lev el I to III)\u2014by the associate dean for adv anced education or upon the recommendation of the program director.320 UNIVERSITY CA TALOG3.Behavioral probation (Lev el I to III)\u2014by the associate dean for adv anced education or upon the recommendation of the program director. 4.Clinical probation (Lev el I to III)\u2014by the associate dean for adv anced education or upon the recommendation of the program director. 5.Discontinuation\u2014by the associate dean for adv anced education or upon the recommendation of the program director recommended to the dean. Probation All recommendations to the associate dean for adv anced education must be supported by w ell- documented evidence of repeated counseling and other internal measures designed to point out deficiencies and take correctiv e action through a detailed remediation program. A remediation program must be specific in design, implemented, and monitored for any student/resident who is not performing up to a program's stated standards. It is important to hav e documentary evidence on record by multiple faculty members with detailed accounts of dates, times, explanations of counseling, discussions, and correctiv e measures. Written statements from support staff should also be included if they hav e direct contact or know ledge of a matter involving a postdoctoral student/resident. Postdoctoral students/residents may be placed on academic probation, behavioral probation, and/or clinical probation. Probation begins at Lev el I and may progress to Lev el III. Postdoctoral students/ residents should be placed on probation for a prescribed period of time: one quarter, two quarters, etc. This information should be conv eyed to a student/resident in writing (required) and also v erbally (recommended). Continuation Students who are not progressing as expected may be continued in their y ear group for as long as necessary before being promoted to the next y ear or discontinued. To exercise this option, the associate dean for adv anced education must inform Univ ersity Records of the decision to continue a student/ resident and state the anticipated length of that continuation. Program directors make the determination as to when to recommend continuing a student and when to recommend discontinuing a student/ resident and allowing him/her to graduate or continue his/her studies. Inv ariably, the length of the continuation period will determine when a student/resident actually completes his/her program. Discontinuation Students who do not make any measurable improv ement by the end of the prescribed remediation and counseling periods may be recommended for discontinuation by the associate dean for adv anced education or upon the recommendation of the respectiv e program director to the associate dean for advanced dental education. Recommendations to discontinue a student/resident are then sent to the dean (in writing) for action. Criteria for discontinuation Three or more unsatisfactory or failing grades within the academic y ear, regardless of term or cumulativ e G.P.A. Three consecutiv e quarters of academic probation. Failure to fulfill terms of academic probation within the specified time period. Failure to achiev e eligibility for aw ard of a certificate in the clinical specialty program within the standard number of full academic y ears.Academic Information 321SER VICE-LEARNING Service-learning at Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Dentistry continues the original purpose of the school\u2014to train dental health professionals to provide service to underserv ed populations, both locally and abroad. Field experience for students of dentistry and dental hygiene includes extramural opportunities within the U.S. and in foreign countries. In addition to providing clinical treatment, service-learning experiences include local health fairs and elementary school dental health presentations. Service experiences may last from one day to sev eral w eeks. All students are required to complete assigned service-learning rotations and minimum clock hours, as described in each program. Predoctoral dental students are required to complete a minimum of 120 service-learning hours. Forty hours must be completed doing local community service dentistry. Up to 30 of the remaining 80 hours may be completed doing nondental service. Dental hygiene students must complete 75 service-learning hours. Thirty-fiv e hours of local service are required, and up to 15 nondental service hours may be credited. International Dentist Program students must complete 60 hours of service. Of the 60 hours, 40 will be assigned by the program. Up to 10 hours of nondental service may be completed as part of the 60 hours total requirement. In addition, a didactic component is included within the service-learning program. Lectures are embedded within existing courses and occur throughout the curricula. Students are required to be in good and regular standing to be eligible to participate in electiv e international service-learning experiences. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT Because the study of dental sciences and arts is based on a foundation in essentially the same science subjects as are studied in medicine and allied health curricula, the School of Dentistry shares with the School of Medicine the facilities for teaching basic sciences. Classrooms, laboratories, student lounges, teachers' offices, and clinical facilities related solely to dentistry occupy the School of Dentistry building, named in honor of M. W ebster Prince, the first dean. Prince Hall is on the Univ ersity mall facing the Univ ersity Church and adjacent to the Medical Center. The facilities effectiv ely accommodate collaboration with the Medical Center in ongoing research and service programs. The total resources of the Univ ersity constitute a w ealth of opportunity for the student with initiativ e and willingness to dev elop individual capacity to the fullest extent. Students find v aried opportunities for serving and learning in the immediate Univ ersity community, in school-sponsored service-learning clinics, in clinical and research electiv es, and in div erse volunteer programs. BASIC SCIENCES The Loma Linda Univ ersity departments of basic sciences include anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, and physiology and pharmacology. The basic sciences serv e as the foundation for the dental sciences by leading tow ard an understanding of normal structure and function, as w ell as introducing the basis for pathology in the practice of dentistry. Subjects are taught in the first y ear of the dental hygiene and the first two y ears of the general dentistry curricula as part of three conceptually integrated sequences of courses\u2014sequences in physiology, in anatomy, and in applied science. Throughout the basic sciences, an appreciation of God's creation and His wisdom is reinforced through the study of human biology. Students are encouraged to extend their know ledge and apply it for their own w ell-being and for the w ell-being of their patients.322 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGThe purpose of the basic science curriculum is to provide a foundation of know ledge that is essential for the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene. The faculty are dedicated to providing students with tools that expand their thinking and challenge them to ask probing questions and to earnestly search for answ ers. Their aim is to prepare students to excel scientifically. The higher aim is, through the Christian atmosphere of this Univ ersity, to prepare students to become truly compassionate dentists.Academic Information 323Financial Information FINANCIAL POLICIES The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approv ed by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the Univ ersity unless approv ed by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic conditions w arrant. GENERAL FINANCIAL PRACTICES The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cov er all expenses before the beginning of each school y ear. Previous accounts with other schools or this Univ ersity must hav e been settled. Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (all programs) To be eligible for federal, state, and Univ ersity financial aid, students are required by the U.S. Department of Education and the State of California to maintain satisfactory progress tow ard their degree objectiv es. In compliance with prescribed regulations, the Univ ersity and School of Dentistry hav e established guidelines that are designed to ensure that students successfully complete courses to promote timely adv ancement tow ard a specific degree objectiv e. Definition of satisfactory academic progress The School of Dentistry defines satisfactory academic progress by the following three criteria: 1.Meeting a minimum grade-point av erage requirement. 2.Making y early progress by completing the academic requirements defined for a program. 3.Completing the degree objectiv e within the maximum time allow ed. Grade-point av erage requirement To maintain satisfactory academic progress, students in the dental and dental hygiene programs must maintain a minimum cumulativ e grade-point av erage of 2.0. In addition, dental hygiene students must achiev e no low er than a C- grade in all core courses. Yearly progress requirement Each student's academic progress is ev aluated by the Academic Review Committee at the end of each academic term, and a cumulativ e review is conducted to determine eligibility for promotion at the end of each academic y ear. The Office of Academic Affairs monitors the minimum grade-point av erage requirement. The Financial Aid Office monitors y early progress and the maximum time allow ance. Students whose academic standing or degree progress falls below the standard receiv e a financial aid warning during the next quarter of registration. If their academic standing or degree progress is not raised to the standard by the end of the quarter in which the financial aid w arning w as issued, all financial aid will be terminated for these students until the requirements hav e been met.324 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGReasonable degree progress It is expected that students will complete the requirements for a degree within the scheduled curriculum time for the degree. The Doctor of Dental Surgery degree is scheduled to be completed in four years and may not exceed six y ears. The Bachelor of Science degree in dental hygiene is scheduled to be completed in two y ears in the professional curriculum and may not exceed three y ears. The Bachelor of Science dental hygiene online degree completion program is scheduled to be completed in six quarters and may not exceed 12 quarters in the professional curriculum. The Associate of Science degree in dental hygiene is scheduled to be completed in sev en quarters and may not exceed 14 quarters in the professional curriculum. Certification of status The Office of Academic Affairs will certify the official status of each enrolled student at the end of each academic y ear to Univ ersity Records and to the Office of Financial Aid. Student financial aid Federal loans are av ailable only to United States citizens, green card holders, or those with permanent resident status. W ith good credit or a creditworthy cosigner, federal loans may be used to cov er the entire academic budget. For more information, contact the Office of Financial Aid by email: <finaid@univ.llu.edu >; or by telephone: 909/558-4509.

CHARLES J. GOODACRE, Dean, School of Dentistry The goal of the General Dentistry Program is to train practitioners in the deliv ery of high-quality dental care that is prev entiv e in purpose and comprehensiv e in scope, and that is based on sound biological principles. CURRICULUM Dentistry, like all health professions, exists to benefit society and, therefore, continually assesses its professional services to ascertain what measures, attitudes, and skills most effectiv ely serv e society. The School of Dentistry is committed to: Beginning the curriculum with a strong foundation in the sciences that are basic to know ledge of the structure and function of the human being in health and in sickness. Providing an educational environment that progressiv ely leads a student to mastery and correlation of clinical sciences and skills. Developing a frame of reference from which to mobilize the resources of dentists and associated professional personnel in both deliv ery of health care and contribution to community w ell-being by education for the prev ention of illness. These concepts include responsibility for contributing to the body of scientific know ledge by questioning, inv estigating, and teaching; for remaining sensitiv e and adaptiv e to the needs of humanity in ev er-changing conditions; and for maintaining consciousness of the individual obligation to liv e, practice, and striv e for the good of humanity. The curriculum in dentistry, organized to be completed in four academic y ears, fulfills requirements for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. OBJECTIVE The primary objectiv e of the dental curriculum is to graduate men and women who attest to the purpose of the Univ ersity and the goals of the School of Dentistry, which include adv ancing know ledge and understanding of health, disease, and w ays to improv e health and the dental health care deliv ery system through basic and applied research. ADMISSION Information and procedures for applying to the Doctor of Dental Surgery Program can be found under Application and Admissions in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CATALOG. REGULA TIONS The student is also subject to the conditions of registration, attendance, financial policy, gov erning practices, and graduation requirements outlined in Section II and in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CA TALOG.332 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGINSTRUMENTS, TEXTBOOKS, ADDITIONAL MA TERIALS The instruments, textbooks, and materials required for the study and practice of dentistry are prescribed by the School of Dentistry. The school issues dental instruments each quarter as needed in the program. Unauthorized or incomplete equipment is not acceptable. Adv ance administrativ e approv al must be obtained for any exception. EMPLOYMENT Because the dental program is v ery rigorous, first-y ear students in dentistry may not accept part-time employment during the first term. Such employment thereafter may be accepted by the student only upon receiving written permission from the executiv e associate dean. ACADEMIC INCENTIVE PROGRAM Detailed information on the Academic Incentiv e Program may be found under that heading in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CA TALOG. LICENSING Eligibility to take examinations giv en by the state and regional boards of dental examiners is based on essentially the same requirements as are stipulated by the School of Dentistry for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Information about the examinations of the respectiv e states is av ailable from the executiv e associate dean. Credentials from the National Board of Dental Examiners are accepted in lieu of the written portion of a state examination in most states. Many states require the National Board Examination and provide no alternativ e. (The national board does not include a clinical examination.) D.D.S. COMPETENCIES The curriculum is designed to ensure that by graduation all students will hav e the skills, attitudes, and competencies important to the successful practice of dentistry. Students must be competent in the following know ledge and skills, and are expected to be able to perform them independently.

Hurlbutt Shirley A. Lee Patricia M. Lennan Joni A. Stephens Kristi J. W ilkins Colleen A. Whitt Established in 1959, the Department of Dental Hygiene, the Bachelor of Science degree undergraduate curriculum of the School of Dentistry, is largely focused on prev entiv e oral health services and continuing care. Dental science courses, preclinical lectures and seminars, laboratory exercises, and clinical assignments hav e been dev eloped to provide training in the v ariety of procedures delegated to the dental hygienist within the dental practice setting. These experiences are sequenced in an organized manner that provides for continual growth and competency in performance of all traditional and expanded function procedures. The purpose of the program is to dev elop professionals prepared for the current practice of dental hygiene, as w ell as graduates who are additionally prepared to deal with future changes in dentistry. Courses that encourage critical thinking and problem-solving techniques and that enhance the ability to evaluate the latest in research are important adjuncts to clinical training. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be prepared to enter a v ariety of career options av ailable to a dental hygienist. The online B.S. degree in dental hygiene completion is designed for licensed dental hygienists who graduated from an Associate in Science degree program, or its equiv alent, and wish to complete the baccalaureate (B.S.) degree in dental hygiene. This curriculum is the equiv alent of one full academic y ear. In addition to the degree completion courses in either education or public health, the student will need to complete any remaining general education requirements needed to fulfill a baccalaureate degree. The B.S. degree in dental hygiene completion is designed to be completed primarily online, with a requisite teaching or public health component that may be accomplished in the geographical area of the student. This program offers the challenge and quality of a traditional classroom, y et provides the flexibility to fit education into the life of the busy dental professional. Students can study at their own356 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGconv enience, learn in small groups with expert faculty, and meet career goals at their own speed. Students who tend to be the most successful in this type of program are self-directed, computer literate, and self-motiv ated in their learning and study habits. Two areas of focus are included in this curriculum. The first is teaching and prepares the student to instruct in a dental hygiene program. The second is a public health focus, which will either allow graduates to work in a community/dental public health program or enable them to teach in a dental hygiene program. The Associate in Science (A.S.) degree in dental hygiene, established in 2010, is designed to be completed at the School of Dentistry off-campus location in P alm Desert, California. The goal of the A.S. degree is to offer a unique educational opportunity for students in the Coachella V alley. Applicants who live in the Coachella V alley and hav e completed prerequisite course work at the College of the Desert will be giv en priority review in the School of Dentistry admissions process. The purpose of the A.S. degree, modeled after the B.S. degree in dental hygiene established in 1959, is to increase access to care in an area underserv ed by prev entiv e oral health care providers. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be prepared to enter clinical practice under the general and direct supervision of a licensed dentist. The A.S. degree graduate will be encouraged to pursue the B.S. degree online completion curriculum, preparing them for a v ariety of career options, including teaching and public health opportunities.

PHILOSOPHY A profession in the health arts and sciences calls increasingly for persons of intelligence, integrity, responsibility, and depth of human understanding. Therefore, the program of instruction is planned on a strong liberal arts foundation. The student is encouraged to take electiv es that contribute to breadth of know ledge and quality of v alues. The choice of electiv es in early college work is important for many reasons. The School of Dentistry is interested in applicants with the potential to become hygienists who are well-read and caring persons prepared to communicate effectiv ely in professional and community relationships. They should be able to draw on know ledge of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease, applying resources based on Christian ideals and v alues to aid in the solution of personal problems. They should also be able to dev elop the attitudes and skills that will most effectiv ely serv e society. GOAL The goal of the Dental Hygiene Program is to educate competent, concerned, and activ e members of the dental hygiene profession who possess the ability to effectiv ely perform the expanding scope of practice of the dental hygienist. Loma Linda Univ ersity emphasizes Christian v alues and beliefs and the concept of whole person care. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellowship among faculty and students are interwov en into daily academic pursuits, clinical practice, and social interactions.Dental Hygiene\u2014SD 357The adv ancement of dental hygiene depends on an ev er-growing body of know ledge. Therefore, this program also places great importance on providing an atmosphere in which students can dev elop the skills necessary to objectiv ely assess new theories and trends in dentistry in light of scientific know ledge and principles. By combining Christian v alues with an appreciation for research and the scientific method, graduates will continually apply evidence-based principles to patient care and exhibit God's lov e in the quality of service they render. ADMISSION Information and procedures for applying to the Dental Hygiene Program can be found under the Application and Admissions section of the general information for the School of Dentistry in Section III. CURRICULUM Dental hygiene, a profession dating back to 1913, is largely concerned with prev entiv e health services. The hygienist works in association with the dentist in priv ate practice offices, industrial organizations, schools, hospitals, state or federal public health services, and the armed forces. The B.S. degree is organized as a four-y ear college curriculum. The freshman and sophomore y ears of largely prescribed, preprofessional study may be taken at any regionally accredited college. The professional curriculum begins with the junior y ear in the School of Dentistry. The curriculum is approv ed by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. The first class at this Univ ersity graduated in 1961. After completion of the required prerequisite course work, the A.S. degree dental hygiene student enters the sev en-quarter program leading to the Associate in Science degree in dental hygiene. The student will meet eligibility in the sixth quarter, after successful completion of course work, for the written Dental Hygiene National Board Examination. After successful completion of the sev enth quarter, the graduate will be eligible to sit for a state and/or regional clinical board examination. DENT AL HYGIENE\u2014A.S.

Trapp The Dental Anesthesiology, Adv anced Program is offered to dentists who desire to pursue a career in anesthesiology for dentistry. The educational design of this tw enty-four month program provides a strong clinical background in anesthesiology. The program is based in the Koppel Special Care Dentistry Center (KSCDC), an outpatient facility utilizing general anesthesia for dental care. The KSCDC is located in the School of Dentistry, where approximately 4,000 patients are treated on an annual basis. Additional training in structured rotations in cardiology, internal medicine, and anesthesiology is obtained at area hospitals. Didactic instruction is coordinated through the School of Dentistry's Department of Dental Anesthesiology. Residents attend an anesthesiology lecture series and w eekly grand rounds at Loma Linda Univ ersity Medical Center. In addition, regular meetings of the dental anesthesiology residents are held, during which a v ariety of contemporary topics are discussed\u2014including a review of the current literature. Residents also participate in teaching pain control in the predoctoral curriculum and present at the annual Dental Anesthesia Symposium at Loma Linda Univ ersity. Upon successful completion of the program, the dental anesthesiologist will be eligible to take the diplomate examination of the American Dental Board of Anesthesiology, and to apply for a general anesthesia permit in any state of the United States. Following enrollment into the program, residents may apply for acceptance to the Master of Science in Dentistry (M.S.D.) degree track, in addition to the specialty certificate.

OUR MISSION The mission of the School of Medicine is to continue the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ, \"To make man whole\" (Luke 9:6). Preparing the physician Our purpose is the formation of Christian physicians, providing whole person care to individuals, families, and communities. Fulfilling this responsibility requires\u2014 Education Creating an environment in which medical students, graduate students, and residents will acquire the know ledge, skills, v alues, and attitudes appropriate to Christian health professionals and scholars.402 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGResearch Cultiv ating an atmosphere of inquiry and discov ering new routes to wholeness through basic and clinical research. Service Providing timely access to cost-effectiv e, safe, comprehensiv e, whole person care for all patients, without regard for their circumstances or status. Developing the whole person The Christian view of wholeness holds that the needs of patients go beyond the healing of the body, and that the dev elopment of students involv es more than the training of the mind. W e are dedicated to promoting physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual growth in our faculty and our students; and to transforming our daily activities into personal ministries. Reaching the world Providing whole person care wherev er the opportunity arises, participating with the world community in the provision of local medical education, providing international physicians and scientists the opportunities for professional interaction and enrichment, sharing the good news of a loving God as demonstrated by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ\u2014these are the goals of the students, faculty, and graduates of Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Medicine.School Foundations 403General Regulations Students of the Univ ersity are responsible for informing themselv es of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III giv es the general setting for the programs of each school and outlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs.404 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGApplication and Admissions The program admissions committees of the Univ ersity intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this Univ ersity. The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, life experience, and significant qualities of character and personality. THE STUDY OF MEDICINE Preparing for a career in medicine, students should quest for a broad understanding in the major areas of know ledge\u2014the natural sciences, the behavioral sciences, and the humanities\u2014which assists them in the process of learning throughout their life. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine looks for applicants who are best suited to fulfill the mission of the school and to successfully practice medicine. The school desires students who demonstrate the ability to learn independently, to think critically, and to articulate clearly\u2014both orally and in written form\u2014their ideas and opinions. It is important that students in the School of Medicine demonstrate excellent interpersonal skills and show evidence of sensitivity to the needs of humanity. The Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine puts forth considerable effort to ensure that an applicant is qualified for medical school. The applicant's credentials are review ed to assess scholastic performance. The committee also looks for prerequisite qualities of character and personality, potential for self-direction and the use of discriminating judgment, and dedication to the ideal of service to society. GENERAL ENTRANCE INFORMA TION A total of 85 semester (128 quarter ) units of credit from an accredited college is required for acceptance by the School of Medicine. Preference is giv en, how ever, to college graduates. Credit must be presented for the following subjects:Application and Admissions 405Semester/Quarter hours General biology or zoology with laboratory-8/12 General or inorganic chemistry with laboratory-8/12 Organic chemistry with laboratory-8/12 Physics with laboratory-8/12 English equiv alent to satisfy baccalaureate degree requirement Religion as required by the college attended Required Keyboard and computer skills Recommended Introductory course in basic statistics Biochemistry, strongly recommended Science credits earned in professional schools (e.g., allied health professions, business, dentistry, nursing, or pharmacy) do not fulfill requirements for admission to medicine. CLEP and P ass/Fail performances are not acceptable for the required courses. The Medical College Admission T est (MCA T) is required. Scores older than three y ears will not be considered. APPLICA TION PROCEDURE AND ACCEPT ANCE It is important to know the specifics of the application process and to begin the application process w ell in adv ance of the date of anticipated (or desired) entrance to medical school. Where to write The School of Medicine is a member of the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Applications must be submitted through AMCAS. Their application is av ailable on the W eb at < aamc.org/ students/applying/amcas >. AMCAS deadline Application should be made directly to AMCAS betw een June 1 and Nov ember 1 for entry in A ugust of the following y ear. Fees The AMCAS fee is required each time an application is submitted. An additional fee to the School of Medicine is required with each supplementary application. Procedure The application procedure is as follows: 1.The applicant submits a formal application to AMCAS, with fee and requested transcripts. The applicant's v erified data are forw arded to the School of Medicine by AMCAS. 2.When the application is receiv ed from AMCAS, Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Medicine requests completion of an online supplementary application. The prospectiv e student should provide evidence of exposure to health care through personal involv ement or in other w ays, giving evidence of an informed decision confirming the applicant's decision to become a physician.406 UNIVERSITY CA TALOG3.After the supplementary application and letters of reference hav e been submitted and review ed, the applicant may be invited for an interview. 4.The information submitted by the applicant through AMCAS, the supplementary application, the letters of reference, and the interview reports are then ev aluated by the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine. This committee determines whether an applicant is accepted or rejected. All applicants are notified of the final decision of the Admissions Committee regarding their application. Acceptance notices are sent to regular applicants beginning December of the y ear preceding admission to the School of Medicine, continuing until the class is filled. 5.The accepted applicant sends a written acceptance of his/her offer of admission as a student, together with a $100 acceptance deposit, by the announced date (about thirty days after the notification of acceptance). This deposit is refundable until May 15 of the y ear in which the student has been accepted for entry. In summary, the Admissions Office requires the following: Verified AMCAS application. Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Medicine supplementary application and $75 application fee. Appraisal of the applicant's character, ability, and suitability for a medical career by persons know ledgeable about the applicant's past performance. A preprofessional recommendation packet, if av ailable, from the applicant's undergraduate college/univ ersity. Applicant's av ailability for interviews, should an offer for an interview be extended. Pre-entrance health requirement and health cov erage Exposure to patients takes place during y ear one of medical education. Because of this, it is necessary for students to hav e immunizations against certain infectious diseases. In order to complete registration for the first academic quarter, student must giv e evidence in the form of physician records or college health serv e records that they hav e met immunization requirements. Students without proper v erification will be required to receiv e immunizations, and the charges will be billed to the students' account. The pre-entrance requirements may be found at < llu.edu/ssw eb/documents/immunizations.pdf >. Please note: Tdap is now a requirement instead of T d. Students are also required to hav e certain injections and immunizations repeated at v arious interv als during their enrollment. These include an annual skin test for tuberculosis and influenza v accine. Medical students will be required to hav e flu shots on an annual basis in order to meet the requirements of clinical sites where students will be working. These will be giv en by the Student Health Center at the beginning of each flu season. In addition, students are expected to hav e routine dental and medical care and electiv e surgery attended to before registering for medical school. All School of Medicine students are provided with health cov erage through the Univ ersity's Department of Risk Management. The Student Health P lan remains in effect for students who are regularly enrolled, provided they register and pay tuition and fees on time each quarter. Since the maximum benefit of the plan (as of the time this CA TALOG w ent to press) is $100,000 and does not cov er preexisting illnesses or dental or optical care, students are encouraged to maintain a personal, current policy that cov ers preexisting illnesses and/or has a higher benefit. A student who does not hav e healthApplication and Admissions 407insurance cov erage for his/her spouse/children will need to purchase it through the Univ ersity's Department of Risk Management at the time of registration. Gov ernment regulations prohibit the use of student loan funds to provide medical insurance or services for a student's spouse or children. Students who wish to review a copy of the current student health plan or hav e further questions about the plan should call Risk Management (909/558-4386). Annual tuition also cov ers the cost of disability insurance. Details will be presented during orientation or upon request. EARL Y DECISION PROGRAM A highly qualified applicant to medical school may apply betw een June 1 and A ugust 1 and be guaranteed a decision by October 1. During that period of time, the applicant may not apply to any other medical school; and if the applicant is accepted at Loma Linda Univ ersity, s/he is committed to that decision. If the applicant is not accepted by October 1, s/he may apply to any school desired. An applicant not accepted by October 1 will be considered in the regular applicant pool. On the AMCAS application, the applicant indicates that s/he is an early decision applicant and agrees to comply with the constraints of that program.

Students are expected to familiarize themselv es with the contents of the Student Handbook and to abide by its policies. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the Univ ersity is av ailable from the respectiv e school. Students who hav e questions about the Student Handbook should contact the associate dean for student affairs. STUDENT ORGANIZA TIONS The purpose of the Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Medicine student organizations is to: 1.Create an av enue through which students may seek constructiv e solutions to problems and enhance their educational experience; 2.Develop w ays to further the mission of the School and add to the medical school experience by organizing social, spiritual, and service activities; 3.Engage students in issues related to medical education and health care through participation in regional and national professional organizations. At registration into the School of Medicine, students automatically become members of the Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Medicine Student Association (SMSA ). Student organizations that operate within the School of Medicine and that are represented on the School of Medicine Senate include the following: The American Medical Association-Medical Student Section (AMA-MSS), Loma Linda Univ ersity chapter (AMSA ), Loma Linda Univ ersity chapter Dental Association (CMDA ) Hands-On Wholeness (HOW) The Organization of Student Representativ es (OSR) to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Student National Medical Association, Loma Linda Univ ersity chapter Two additional student organizations are based in the School of Medicine but are not required to hav e representativ es at Senate meetings. These service-focused organizations, which involv e students from a number of schools within the Univ ersity, are as follows: the Healthy Neighborhoods Project the Mission Interest Group Loma Linda Univ ersity students are represented by peers at the San Bernardino County Medical Society, the California Medical Association, the American Medical Association, the American Medical Student Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Student National Medical Association.410 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGCurriculum WHOLE PERSON FORMA TION Personal and professional growth for the student in medicine is the focus of the disciplines in the school, the faculty in the School of Medicine, and the School of Religion. Courses and content are offered to emphasize biblical, ethical, and relational aspects of the physician's personal and professional development. The core for whole person formation\u201414 quarter units of religion and ethics\u2014is provided during the first three y ears of the medicine curriculum. LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR MEDICAL STUDENT EDUCA TION Outcome I Through the study of organ systems, students will dev elop a know ledge base in the basic sciences essential for adv ancement to the next phase of their medical education. Outcome II Students will dev elop the clinical skills that are integral to the safe and competent practice of medicine. Outcome III Students understand and apply the Univ ersity philosophy \"to make man whole\" into their personal and professional liv es. (Wholeness means the lifelong, harmonious dev elopment of the physical, intellectual, emotional, relational, cultural, and spiritual dimensions of a person's life\u2014unified through a loving relationship with God and expressed in generous service to others.) Outcomes IV Students will dev elop diagnostic reasoning and analytic problem-solving skills in order to assimilate information and establish appropriate diagnoses and treatment plans.Curriculum 411Outcome V Students will dev elop effectiv e interpersonal and communication skills, including sensitivity to those from div erse backgrounds (e.g., cultural, ethnicity, gender, generational, socioeconomic and religious). Outcome VI Students will dev elop professionalism in excellence and scholarship, accountability and responsibility, and altruistic behaviors. Outcome VII Students will integrate ethical and Christ-centered principles of conduct into their personal and professional liv es. Outcome VIII Students will integrate their know ledge, skills, and behaviors through a spectrum of activ e learning activities. Outcome IX Students will acquire the know ledge and skills needed to foster self-direction for lifelong learning.412 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGAcademic Information The academic progress of each student is monitored by the Academic Review Committee. Specific policies for handling misconduct (academic or nonacademic) are published in the Student Handbook 2009-2010 av ailable at < llu.edu/central/handbook >. COMMUNICA TIONS Communications to the medical student regarding academic and clinical assignments, scholarship opportunities, and other important information are routed through the Office of the Dean. The student mailboxes and bulletin board are located in the medical center. It is the responsibility of students to check their email and mailboxes and the bulletin board daily. REQUIRED SUPPLIES Microscope The student is expected to hav e access to a satisfactory compound microscope (usually one rented from the school) that meets the following requirements: The microscope shall be no older than fifteen y ears. The lenses shall be in good condition and shall include scanning and oil-immersion objectiv es. The equipment shall include an Abbe condenser with rack-and-pinion adjustment, an iris diaphragm, and a mechanical stage. Textbooks Students are required to purchase the textbooks adopted by the School of Medicine Curriculum Committee. Instruments Students are required to purchase the instruments adopted by the physical diagnosis course. PRACTICES AND REGULA TIONS Length of academic residence To fulfill the degree requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, it is the usual policy that the student must be registered full time for the Doctor of Medicine degree course work during the entire junior and senior academic y ears. Course exemptions Students who seek exemption from registering for courses that they took prior to entering the School of Medicine must qualify for the exemption by passing a comprehensiv e examination cov ering the course material in question. Should the student qualify, in lieu of the regular course, s/he will be required to participate in an advanced program that may include additional studies, research activities, and/or teaching. A written paper will be required from all students completing the adv anced program.Academic Information 413The course director, the senior associate dean of medical student education, and the student will work together to determine the content of the adv anced program. Full tuition, equiv alent to that of the regular program, will be charged. Examinations Students are required to take examinations at the scheduled time. Students who arriv e more than 15 minutes late to an examination will be denied entrance. Students who arriv e after any other student has left the examination for any reason will not be permitted to take the examination. For National Board subject examinations, students will be denied entrance once the examination has started. Examinations will not be extended beyond the announced termination time, ev en if a student arriv es late. Missed examinations Students who hav e an \"excused\" absence for one day of a three-day midterm examination will receiv e their two-day score, and the w eight of each missed examination will be added to the w eight of the cumulativ e final examination for each course. If the final examination for the course is an NBME Subject Examination, then the av erage of the in-house examinations for that course will be substituted for the missed examination. Students who miss two or three days of a three-day midterm examination are required to take a makeup examination within two w eeks of the missed examination dates at a date and time scheduled by the course director. Makeup examinations may differ in content and/or format from the missed examinations. In addition, course directors may require other remediation at their discretion. Should a student miss an in-house final examination because of an \"excused\" absence, arrangements must be made with the course directors to make up for the missed examinations. The course directors, at their discretion, may opt to hav e the student take an examination that is different in format, content or length from the final examination that w as administered to the class. Should a student miss a National Board Subject Examination because of an \"excused\" absence, the student will be allow ed one opportunity to take and pass the subject examination upon completing all other course work for that y ear at the end of the academic y ear. Arrangements for the make-up examination must be made through the Office of Medical Student Education. Conditions to be met for an \"excused\" absence In order to hav e an \"excused\" absence, the student must get a written excuse from the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education prior to the administration of the test in question. Students missing examinations for health reasons must provide written documentation of their illness from Student Health Center or another examining physician. Whether or not this documentation is an adequate excuse for missing a test will be left to the discretion of the senior associate dean for medical student education. Once a request for an examination excuse has been receiv ed, the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education will determine whether or not the student will be required to make up the examination at a later date (generally within a w eek of the missed examination) or hav e the final examination count an extra amount proportional to the missed examination. Under no circumstances are students allow ed to take examinations early. In the ev ent of a bona fide emergency, where prior approv al is not feasible, the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for the Medical Student Education (909/558-4255) must be contacted as soon as possible. Failure to do so will result in unexcused absence.414 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGStudents who miss examinations without prior approv al from the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education hav e an \"unexcused\" absence. As a result, the student will receiv e a zero for the missed examination(s). Missing more than one in examination in any course or combination of courses could result in a student having to repeat the course(s) during the next academic y ear. Grading policy Course directors submit grades at the end of the course, indicating the ov erall ev aluation of the student's performance in the course. The grade reflects the success or failure of the student in meeting the objectiv es of the course in terms of know ledge, skills, attitudes, and v alues. The grade will be recorded as SATISF ACTOR Y if the student exceeded the minimum requirements for ov erall performance. The grade assigned will be UNSA TISF ACTOR Y if the student did not meet the minimum requirements for ov erall performance. The grade assigned will be MARGINAL SA TISF ACTOR Y if the student met but did not exceed the minimum requirements for ov erall performance. Copies of complete promotion and retention policies are distributed to each class at orientation. Class standing Class standing is determined by the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education and is based on student performance on in-house, faculty-generated examinations and on NBME subject examinations. Promotion Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic performance. Both cognitiv e and noncognitiv e evaluations of academic performance\u2014as w ell as assessment of personal suitability to assume the responsibilities of the medical profession\u2014are utilized in making promotion decisions. The Academic Review Committee of the School of Medicine periodically reviews student performance and progress and recommends promotion, retention, or dismissal on the basis of the ov erall academic record. The Student Handbook contains additional details regarding the criteria used by the Academic Review Committee for promotion decisions. Decelerated program-freshman curriculum Students who experience academic difficulty during their first y ear of medical school may be assigned to a decelerated program with a reduced load. This reassignment will occur within the first two w eeks following the second midterm examination when, in the judgment of the dean's office, it appears the student will be unlikely to pass the y ear while carrying out a full load. Academic probation Students whose cumulativ e academic record at the end of any academic y ear is less than satisfactory are placed on academic probation. Withdraw al To withdraw from a course(s), the student must meet with the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education to determine educational appropriateness, and file a Change of Program form. To completely withdraw from school, the student must complete the online withdraw al form. These forms should be completed and submitted on the last day of class attendance. The date of withdraw al used in calculating tuition refunds will be the date on which the properly completed form is submitted to the Office of Univ ersity Records.Academic Information 415USMLE Steps I and II policy States v ary in the number of times a student can attempt USMLE examinations and still be eligible for licensure. A significant number of states allow no more than three attempts. The school has defined its own limits for number of attempts allow ed. School policy requires students enrolled in the Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Medicine to pass Step I in no more than three attempts. Students must complete the clinical course work required for graduation within three y ears of starting the clinical curriculum; they are permitted a maximum of four sequential attempts to pass Step II of the USMLE. The student's first attempt at passing Step II of the USMLE must take place only after s/he has satisfactorily passed all junior clerkships and prior to his/her completion of all required senior clinical course work. A student who has failed Step II but who has completed all course curriculum requirements must remain enrolled in the School of Medicine as a directed study student until s/he has either passed Step II of the USMLE or failed Step II of the USMLE for the fourth time. During this directed study, the student will be charged tuition. DOCTOR OF MEDICINE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The School of Medicine requires that a candidate for a degree or certificate from the school must hav e met the following requirements for the Doctor of Medicine degree: Completed all requirements for admission. Attended an accredited medical school for four academic y ears, the last two of which must hav e been spent at this school. Completed honorably all requirements of the curriculum, including specified attendance, lev el of scholarship, length of academic residence, and credit units. Completed additional special examinations cov ering any or all subjects of the medical curriculum, as may be required. Successfully completed USMLE examinations (Steps I and II), as specified\u2014both clinical skills and know ledge components. Given evidence of moral character, of due regard for Christian citizenship, and of consistent responsiv eness to the established aims of the Univ ersity and of the school. Discharged financial obligations to the Univ ersity. The candidate is required to participate in graduation exercises upon completion of the academic program. If the candidate is out of sequence with his/her current class but would like to participate in the commencement exercises, s/he must hav e completed a minimum of three months of the required senior clerkships, i.e., medicine, pediatrics, family medicine or surgery subinternship, prev entiv e and community medicine, intensiv e care and emergency medicine by April 1 of the y ear of graduation. Consent for the student to be absent, granted by the president of the Univ ersity, is contingent on the recommendation of the dean to the president. The families and friends of graduates are invited to be present at the official conferring of degrees service. DOCTOR OF MEDICINE/ORAL AND MAXILLOF ACIAL SURGER Y DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The Doctor of Medicine/Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Program (M.D./OMS) is designed to provide an opportunity for qualified dentists to obtain the Doctor of Medicine degree in a customized, three-y ear416 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGperiod. Clinical surgical health care deliv ery is emphasized. The content of the program conforms to the Standards of the Commission on Accreditation and is designed to prepare the oral surgeon for certification by the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Oral and maxillofacial surgery residents begin their residency program on the OMS service. They subsequently enter the second y ear at Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Medicine with adv anced standing. The residents then complete the second, third, and fourth y ears of medical school. The third y ear of the M.D./OMS curriculum consists of required clerkships in acute care, emergency medicine, a subinternship in ENT , and whole person care. An additional 30 units of electiv es, which include anesthesia and oral and maxillofacial surgery, complete the final y ear of the medical program. The graduate then enters a one-y ear general surgery internship, follow ed by two y ears of oral and maxillofacial surgery residency. GRADUA TE COMBINED DEGREES PROGRAMS Loma Linda Univ ersity is committed to fostering the inv estigativ e skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined degrees programs . Combined degrees (M.D./M.S. or M.D./Ph.D.)\u2014SM/GS The M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program is av ailable through the School of Medicine. It includes many of the features of the Medical Scientist Program. Students in the combined degrees program complete the first two y ears of the standard medical curriculum. This is follow ed by three or more y ears of graduate course work and research to qualify for a Ph.D. degree, or at least one y ear for an M.S. degree, before commencing the last two y ears of the medical school curriculum\u2014the clinical training\u2014or the Doctor of Medicine degree. Majors are offered in anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, physiology, and pharmacology. For the M.D./M.S. and M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees programs, the prerequisites and Graduate Record Examination requirements are similar to those described for the Medical Scientist Program, except that biochemistry is not required. Medical Scientist Program (M.D./Ph.D.) Loma Linda Univ ersity is committed to fostering the inv estigativ e skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in the Medical Scientist Program. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to dev elop a student's independence and competence as an investigativ e scientist and clinician. It provides students with a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and medically related research. The program is administered by the School of Medicine in cooperation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies. (See Medical Scientist Program in the combined degrees programs after the general information for the School of Medicine.) LICENSING EXAMINA TIONS National The graduate who holds credentials from the USMLE may be granted a license by endorsement of the examining board of most states. Additional requirements made by some states are giv en in a pamphlet that may be obtained from the Office of the Dean or from the Federation of State Medical Boards, 400 Fuller W iser Road, Suite 300, Euless, TX 76039-3855.Academic Linda Univ ersity Medical Center sponsors a v ariety of accredited residency programs. These include residencies in anesthesiology, pediatric anesthesiology, anesthesiology critical care medicine, adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology, dermatology, procedural dermatology, emergency medicine, pediatric emergency medicine, family medicine (including rural track and combined family medicine- prev entiv e medicine), internal medicine, rheumatology, neurology, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, orthopaedic surgery, otolaryngology, clinical and anatomic pathology, pediatrics, critical care pediatrics, neonatology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, pain management, plastic surgery, prev entiv e medicine, occupational medicine, psychiatry, and general v ascular surgery. Additional nonaccredited fellowships are av ailable. Graduate physicians wishing to apply for entrance into these programs should contact the director of the program. Graduate dentists who seek residencies in dental anesthesia, endodontics, oral implantology, orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontics, and prosthodontics should apply directly to the School of Dentistry. POSTGRADUA TE TRAINING In harmony with the needs of medicine today, the curriculum leading to the Doctor of Medicine degree is planned with the assumption that all students will take standard postgraduate training in one of the fields of medicine. This means serving as a resident for a minimum of three y ears in a hospital approv ed for this training by the Council of Medical Education and Hospitals of the American Medical Association. The Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education supplies information and assistance for the arrangement of residencies. Since the school participates in the National Residency Matching Program, selection through this means constitutes approv al by the School of Medicine. CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCA TION Recognizing the imperativ e of lifelong learning for professionals, the School of Medicine supports a program of continuing medical education for physicians beyond their formal postgraduate y ears. The Office of Continuing Medical Education is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide Category I continuing medical education credit for physicians.

Students interested in pursuing careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined degrees programs. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to dev elop a student's independence and competence as an investigativ e scientist and clinician. It provides students with a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and medically related research. The program is administered by the School of Medicine in cooperation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and w ant to contribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined degrees program through the graduate program. In the first y ear, students participate in a new and revised, scientifically integrated program that includes biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy. While in the first y ear, students also rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty members. In the second y ear, students increase their involv ement with individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete graduate course requirements. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for graduate or medical classes. Students pursuing the combined degrees will also be involv ed with joint basic science and clinical meetings and conferences with the aim of understanding the interrelationships betw een laboratory-based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory success, as indicated by completion of a first-author manuscript, the student will continue on to the traditional first two y ears of the medical school curriculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonstrate laboratory success will be two to three y ears. Successful students who hav e acquired essential laboratory skills should continue their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculum. Upon successful completion of the first two y ears of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE, students will begin a series of rotations betw een the clinical sciences and the research laboratory. During these later y ears, students will complete all of the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects. It is the intent of this program that students will acquire the requisite skills needed for a successful career at the interface of laboratory-based and clinical research. PROGRAM ADMISSION Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitiv e and requires evidence that the student is likely to dev elop into a successful medical scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each of these programs. The application package for the Ph.D. degree requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Both programs must accept the student's scores before s/he is admitted to the Medical Scientist Program. Students entering the M.D./Ph.D. combinedMedical Scientist\u2014SM 437degrees program who determine that a research career is inappropriate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree program who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program at a point after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; how ever, the standard medical school application process will be required at that point. FINANCIAL ASSIST ANCE Financial assistance to students in the Medical Scientist Program may provide: 1.Cost-of-living stipends during those periods in which students are most directly involv ed in graduate education. The amount of the stipend is equiv alent to that av ailable to Ph.D. degree students in the basic science graduate programs.* 2.Tuition w aivers for all graduate program course work. 3.Tuition deferment for the freshman and sophomore y ears of the M.D. degree curriculum. When a student completes an M.S. or Ph.D. degree, tuition deferred from the freshman and sophomore years is canceled. 4.Tuition w aiver for both the junior and senior y ears of the M.D. curriculum, upon completion of a Ph.D. degree. M.D./Ph.D. degree students are ordinarily expected to complete their Ph.D. degree before beginning the third y ear of medical school. Students who hav e not completed the Ph.D. degree may apply for a tuition deferment for their junior y ear of the medical curriculum, and, in unusual cases, for the first quarter of their senior y ear. Applications for tuition deferment beyond the first two y ears must be approv ed by the student's dissertation committee and signed by the dissertation advisor, the associate dean for basic sciences, and the dean of the School of Medicine. Under no circumstances will a student be granted a tuition deferment or be allow ed to register for the last two quarters of medical school until s/he has finished the requirements for the Ph.D degree. If a student withdraws from the Ph.D. degree program his/her tuition deferments will be conv erted to a loan. Completion of the M.D. degree terminates the student's participation in the Medical Scientist Program and ends the av ailability of tuition w aiver. Any tuition deferments then in force will conv ert to loan obligations at that time. * Stipends from the School of Medicine will be aw arded for the first two y ears of the graduate program, provided that the student makes satisfactory academic process and remains in good and regular standing. Stipends cov ering study beyond the first two y ears should ordinarily be obtained from the individual laboratories or departments in which the student conducts research.438 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGBiomedical Sciences\u2014SM Certificate (postbaccalaureate) KENNETH WRIGHT , Ph.D., Program Coordinator FACUL TY Students accepted into the postbaccalaureate certificate Biomedical Sciences Program enroll in basic science courses with first-y ear medical students. Faculty responsible for teaching students in the Biomedical Sciences Program will be those who teach these first-y ear basic science courses. The certificate program enables students to complete their studies with one academic y ear of full-time commitment. The program is intended to provide postbaccalaureate experience in the rapidly changing area of biomedical sciences. As such, it will either augment other career choices\u2014such as high school teaching, patent law, or biotechnology management\u2014or improv e the preparation for professional training in medicine. ADMISSION Applicants to the Biomedical Sciences Program must satisfy the same requirements as those applying to the medicine program at Loma Linda Univ ersity; that is, they will hav e completed a baccalaureate degree (or its equiv alent) with a course of study that includes a y ear each of general biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry and general physics. Applicants are required to take the Medical College Acceptance T est (MCA T) with no score less than 6 and an aggregate score greater than 20. COURSE OF STUDY Students are currently required to complete 36 units selected from courses indicated by the program coordinator. These courses will include 3 units of religion, with the remaining units selected from the first-y ear medical curriculum. The curriculum follow ed by the biomedical sciences certificate students will be dev eloped in consultation with the program director, and will typically include gross anatomy, physiology, and either cell structure and function or biochemistry and neuroscience. In addition, students are asked to enroll in a critical thinking course, and in one religion course. The total number of units for which students enroll during a school y ear is approximately 36. In special circumstances, students might be able to transfer course credits obtained in the Biomedical Sciences Program to a master's degree program in the basic sciences. In order to transfer credit to a master's degree program, the student must obtain a letter grade of B or better in a giv en course. Although sev eral of the courses may share lecture experience and tests with the Doctor of Medicine degree program, such courses will not be transferred to the M.D. degree program; and a student subsequently admitted to the M.D. degree program should expect to take, and pay for, the normal M.D. degree curriculum.Biomedical Sciences\u2014SM 439First Y ear, Summer Quarter Units ANA T550 Gross Anatomy/Embryology 1.0 BCHM 511 Medical Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Genetics I 1.0 MDCJ 504 Cell Structure and Function 2.0 PHSL 521 Medical Physiology GS I 1.0 STCJ 501 Critical Thinking 4.0 Totals 9.0 Autumn Quarter Units ANA T551 Medical Gross Anatomy/Embryology II 5.0 BCHM 512 Medical Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Genetics II 3.0 MDCJ 505 Cell Structure and Function 3.0 PHSL 522 Medical Physiology GS II 1.0 Totals 12.0 Winter Quarter Units ANA T552 Medical Gross Anatomy/Embryology III 2.0 MDCJ 506 Cell Structure and Function 2.0 PHSL 523 Medical Physiology GS III 5.0 Totals 9.0 Spring Quarter Units ANA T553 Medical Gross Anatomy/Embryology IV 1.0 MDCJ 507 Cell Structure and Function 2.0 PHSL 524 Medical Physiology GS IV 1.0 REL_ 5__ Graduate-lev el Religion 3.0 Totals 7.0 Overall Totals 37.0440 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGMedicine\u2014SM M.D. H. ROGER HADLEY , Dean, School of Medicine CURRICULUM The curriculum in medicine consists of four academic y ears. Instruction is on the quarter system. The first eight quarters are oriented to the sciences basic to the practice of medicine; the remaining two academic y ears are made up of clinically oriented core instruction and up to eighteen w eeks of clinical electiv es. THE FIRST YEAR of medical education will begin to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine\u2014with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of normal dev elopment, structure, and function\u2014including the normal changes of aging and the behavioral considerations that influence normal dev elopment. Course content will be organized around individual organ systems whenev er possible. The first y ear will also begin to dev elop the skills, v alues, attitudes, and professional behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and Christian practice of medicine both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide v ariety of pedagogical methods\u2014including but not limited to traditional lecture, small group, problem-based and case-based learning, personalized computer-based instruction, quantitativ e laboratory experiences, and patient care experiences. THE SECOND YEAR of medical education will continue to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine\u2014with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of abnormal structure and function, principles of therapy, and behavioral considerations that affect disease treatment and prev ention. Course content will be organized according to individual organ systems whenev er possible. The second y ear will continue to dev elop the skills, v alues, attitudes, and behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and Christian practice of medicine both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide v ariety of pedagogical methods, including but not limited to traditional lecture; small group, problem-based, and case-based learning; personalized computer-based instruction; quantitativ e laboratory experiences; and longitudinal patient care experiences. THE THIRD YEAR of medical education will establish a body of know ledge, skills, v alues, attitudes, and behaviors in sev en core clinical science disciplines to build a foundation for patient care in ambulatory and hospital-based settings. Students will attain this foundation through a process of self- directed learning, independent study, and guided supervision and teaching by house staff and faculty. Students will hav e ample opportunity to learn the v alue of honor, shared responsibility, and accountability by directly participating in patient care activities as junior colleagues on the health care team. The didactic program will emphasize: a) understanding the pathophysiology of disease; b) establishing diagnoses through interpretation of physical examination and diagnostic data; and c) applying management principles to patients with acute and chronic conditions. Recurring experiences in whole person care, medical ethics, laboratory medicine, health maintenance, and disease prev ention will be integrated into the sev en core disciplines. Students will hav e the opportunity to explore an area of interest during an electiv e experience for the purpose of beginning the process of choosing a career in medicine.Medicine\u2014SM 441THE FOURTH YEAR of medical education will require students to integrate the entirety of their medical know ledge, skills, v alues, and attitudes gained during the first three y ears and apply it more autonomously to patient care. Students will participate in supervised patient care experiences in emergency medicine, intensiv e care medicine, and a subintern-lev el experience in medicine, surgery, family medicine, or pediatrics. Although repetitiv e clinical duties during the fourth y ear are a necessary part of preparing students for the rigors of postgraduate training, students will still hav e ample opportunity to pursue individual interests during a minimum eighteen w eeks of electiv e rotations. To reestablish the importance of science in medical practice, at least one month of electiv e may be in the basic science discipline of the student's choosing. Students will hav e adequate v acation time to study for Step II of the USMLE and successfully participate in the residency selection process. Whole person formation Personal and professional growth for the student in medicine is the focus of the disciplines in the school, the faculty in the School of Medicine, and the School of Religion. Courses and content are offered to emphasize biblical, ethical, and relational aspects of the physician's personal and professional development. The core for whole person formation\u201414 quarter units of religion and ethics\u2014is provided during the first three y ears of the medicine curriculum.

In support of the philosophy, mission, and v alues of Loma Linda Univ ersity and the philosophy, mission, and v alues of the School of Nursing, the faculty affirms the following beliefs: Learning is an interactiv e process that involv es all of the learner's faculties. A learning environment nurtures the dev elopment of potential, promotes maturation of v alues, cultiv ates the ability to think critically and independently, and encourages a spirit of inquiry. Clinical experiences are essential to the dev elopment of professional and technical nursing competence. Students\u2014influenced by the effect of physiological, psychological, sociocultural, dev elopmental, and spiritual v ariables on their liv es\u2014learn in different w ays and bring different meanings to the learning experience.

STUDENT ORGANIZA TIONS The following student organizations enable students to participate in cultural, social, professional, and citizenship aspects of Univ ersity life. Associated Students of Nursing (ASN) The ASN is a student organization of the School of Nursing. This association comprises all the students of nursing and is administered by elected students and two faculty sponsors. The objectiv es of this organization are to serv e as a channel for communication betw een students and faculty, and to facilitate personal and professional growth by meaningful participation in all aspects of student life. Loma Linda Univ ersity Student Association (LLUSA ) The LLUSA has three purposes: to promote communication among students, to present students' views to the administration, and to assist in the programming of social and religious activities. The LLUSA provides opportunities to dev elop and refine a wide range of professional leadership and fellowship skills. The office is located in the Drayson Center. For more information, call 909/558-4978. Class organizations The members of the junior and senior classes elect officers and promote such projects and activities as constitute their major interests and concerns.522 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGHONOR SOCIETY: SIGMA THET A TAU INTERNA TIONAL In 1975, LLUSN became an official chapter of Sigma Theta T au International, the honor society for nursing. Students may be invited to become members if they meet the established criteria.Student Life 523Academic Policies and Practices UNDERGRADUA TE DEP ARTMENT Academic residence To qualify for an undergraduate degree from Loma Linda Univ ersity, the student must take a minimum of 45 units at Loma Linda Univ ersity; 32 of the units must be at the senior lev el. A minimum of three clinical nursing courses are required as part of these units. Nursing courses Nursing course grades Most nursing courses in the undergraduate curriculum are divided into approximately equal components of theory and clinical laboratory practice. A grade for a nursing course represents a combination of the theory and the clinical laboratory grades. In order to pass a nursing course, a student must receiv e a grade equiv alent to a C or abov e in both the theory and clinical laboratory sections of the course. To receiv e a passing grade in theory, the student must obtain a cumulativ e score of at least 76 percent on examinations within that course. A grade of C- or below places the student on provisional status and requires that the student repeat the course. Percentage breakdown for grading The undergraduate division of the School of Nursing uses the following percentages for computing grades: 95-100% A D Below 62% F Clinical experiences Clinical experiences are under the direction of the course coordinator. The student has supervised experience under a clinical instructor in the care of patients. T ardiness or unexcused absences from clinical laboratory is cause for failure. Students must make up for absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., personal illness or death in the family). A fee of $50 will be charged for make-up of clinical laboratory during nonclinical time. Nursing students are required to practice in client care settings under the supervision of a registered nurse. Each student will be expected to be able to apply basic theoretical concepts to clinical practice by assessing, planning, implementing nursing procedures; and ev aluating the care of individuals, families,524 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGand communities. In the performance of routine nursing care, all students will function within the policies of the clinical agency and demonstrate the professional behavior outlined in the Univ ersity CATALOG and the Univ ersity Student Handbook . Students are expected to be know ledgeable about clients and their problems and about the plans for care prior to actually giving care. They must come prepared for the clinical experience and must adequately assess a client, using the Neuman Systems Model. Students are expected to perform skills safely. Students whose performance is deemed unsafe may be dropped from the course. Licensure To be eligible to write the NCLEX-RN examination, the student must hav e completed all required nursing course work listed in this CA TALOG. Further, the student needs to be aw are that, under the laws of California, a candidate for the examination is required to report all misdemeanor and felony convictions. If a candidate has a criminal history, the California Board of Registered Nursing will determine the eligibility of that individual to write the licensing examination. Credit by examination Challenge/equiv alency examination An undergraduate student may meet academic requirements by passing an examination at least equal in scope and difficulty to examinations in the course. Undergraduate students with prior education in nursing or in another health care profession are eligible to challenge nursing courses required for California state licensure. The applicant's background in health care theory and clinical experience must be commensurate with the theory and skills required for the course. Challenge examinations in nursing courses include both a written examination cov ering theory and an examination of clinical competence. A fee is charged for a challenge examination. See the \"Schedule of Charges\" in this section for fees. Progression to the next lev el in the program is permissible only after successful completion of the challenge examination. A grade of S is recorded for challenge credit earned by examination only after the student has successfully completed a minimum of 12 units of credit at this Univ ersity with a G.P.A. of 2.0 or abov e. Adv anced placement program Credit tow ard graduation may be accepted by the school for an entering student who has passed one or more Adv anced P lacement (AP) examinations with a score of 3, 4, or 5. Records for AP courses must be sent directly from the College Board to Univ ersity Records. For specific policy and time limits regarding CLEP examinations, see \"Academic Policies\" in the Univ ersity section of the CA TALOG. Repeating a course A grade of C (2.0) is the minimum passing grade for nursing and required cognate courses. Required cognates include: epidemiology, ethics, nutrition, statistics, and writing. Any nursing or named cognate course taken while a student at Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Nursing in which the earned grade is C- or low er must be repeated before the student can progress to another course. A nursing course or required cognate may be repeated only once. When a student repeats a course, both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student's permanent record; but only the repeat grade and credit are computed in the grade-point av erage and included in the total units earned.Academic Policies and Practices 525Probation status Students whose cumulativ e G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than 2.0, or who hav e receiv ed a C- or below in a nursing course or named cognate, or who hav e withdrawn (W) due to failing are placed on academic probation. Students on probation status will be required to take NRSG 244 Skills for Academic Success and to communicate regularly with the academic advisor. Students on probation status may take only one clinical nursing course at a time and no more than 12 units. When the course work has been repeated successfully, the student is returned to regular status. Enrollment in the School of Nursing will be terminated if a student receiv es two grades of C- or below in nursing or required cognates. See Student Handbook for griev ance procedure.

C.Academic probation At the end of each quarter, student G.P.A.s will be review ed. Students will be placed on probationary status if the earned G.P.A. is less than 3.0 for the quarter, cumulativ ely, or in the nursing major. While on probation, a student: 1.May not take the clinical focus courses. 2.May not take the comprehensiv e examination.Academic Policies and Practices 527Academic probation may be remov ed: a.By raising the G.P.A. to 3.0 or higher the next quarter. b.By retaking the course in which a grade low er than B w as earned to raise the earned grade the next time the course is offered. c.If the low grade occurred in a clinical course, that course must be retaken and a grade of B or higher earned before proceeding in the clinical sequence. It will be necessary to w ait until the course is offered again and has space. D.Academic termination for students on academic probation Academic enrollment will be terminated if : a.The cumulativ e G.P.A. has not been raised to 3.0 or abov e. b.Any grade low er than B has not been raised within two quarters or the next time the course is offered. Clinical probation Clinical work must be ev aluated as satisfactory. Faculty may recommend that the student be placed on clinical probation. While on probation, the student must demonstrate satisfactory clinical work as stipulated by the faculty; or the student will be dismissed from the school. Application for candidacy A student in the master's degree program will apply for candidacy on Form A after completing at least 25 units of required graduate course work. A Ph.D. degree student will be adv anced to candidacy after successful defense of the dissertation proposal. A D.N.P. degree student will be adv anced to candidacy after successful defense of the project proposal. Time limits The time lapse from first enrollment in a graduate curriculum to the conferring of the master's degree may not exceed fiv e years. For the doctoral degrees, sev en years are allow ed after the date of admission. A student desiring reinstatement must reapply to the dean. This procedure implies a re-ev aluation of the student's total academic plan. Any credit transferred to the school or taken in residence and submitted tow ard a graduate degree is nullified sev en years from the date when the course w as completed. Scholastic standing Grade scale The graduate department in nursing uses the following percentages for determining grades: 95-100% A Below 62% F Practicum experiences Practicum experiences shall be individually structured to meet students' needs and program requirements. Practicum experiences are arranged by practicum faculty after consultation with advisors and appropriate agency personnel. Off-campus placement is formalized through written contract or letter of agreement. This process may take as long as six months. Students requesting practicum experiences at sites that will require additional costs\u2014such as faculty trav el, phone calls, or legal advice\u2014are responsible for this expense. Comprehensiv e examination A written, comprehensiv e examination is required of all students. The purpose of the comprehensiv e examination is to ev aluate the student's ability to apply adv anced clinical and theoretical know ledge to a selected problem in a selected area of specialization and to critique and synthesize research as it relates to that area. The student will plan to submit the comprehensiv e examination two (2) quarters before all requirements for the Master of Science degree are completed. Thesis and dissertation The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of his/her guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approv al of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approv al must be secured before petition is made for adv ancement to candidacy. Thesis is optional for the M.S. degree. Dissertation format Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies office is encouraged to help the student avoid formatting errors in the dissertation process that would require him/her to edit large sections of manuscript. The last day for submitting the final approv ed copy is determined by the Faculty of Graduate Studies office. (See FGS policies.) Portfolio A portfolio, dev eloped during the program of study is required of all students Graduation requirements A candidate for a degree shall hav e: 1.Completed all requirements for admission to the respectiv e curriculum. 2.Completed honorably all requirements of the curriculum, including required course work, specified attendance, lev el of scholarship, and length of residence. 3.Given evidence of moral character, of due regard for Christian citizenship, and of consistent responsiv eness to the established aims of the Univ ersity and of the respectiv e discipline. 4.Discharged financial obligations to the Univ ersity.Academic Policies and Practices 529It is the responsibility of the student to see that all requirements hav e been met. A student who completes the requirements for a degree at the end of the Spring Quarter is expected to be present at the Univ ersity's ceremony for conferring of degrees and the presenting of diplomas. Permission for the conferral of a degree in absentia is granted by the Univ ersity upon recommendation of the dean of the school. A student who completes the requirements for a degree at the end of the Summer, A utumn, or W inter Quarter is invited, but not required, to participate in the subsequent conferring of degrees. Degrees are conferred at graduations only. See Section II of the Academic Policies. The Univ ersity reserv es the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises by a candidate who has not satisfactorily complied with all requirements.530 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGFinancial Information The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies.

Zumw alt ADJUNCT F Undergraduate curricula ov erview The sections that follow describe the undergraduate curricula offered by the School of Nursing and list the courses each student must complete. Students are expected to operate under the general policies of the Univ ersity and school and the specific policies of the degree curriculum in which they are enrolled. The school reserv es the right to update and modify its curricula to keep current with trends in health care. B.S. degree The primary aim of the School of Nursing's baccalaureate degree nursing curriculum is to prepare competent practitioners who are committed to excellence in practice and to Christian principles. The faculty believ e that baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis for professional practice. The basic professional curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in nursing degree is consistent with the faculty belief that students should be broadly educated. The focus is on the synthesis of nursing know ledge and skills with know ledge and skills from the humanities and sciences. Preparation for practice includes experiences in primary, secondary, and tertiary health care with clients from v arious age and cultural groups and socioeconomic strata. The curriculum is based on the Neuman Systems Model, which addresses stressors to the client system.Nursing\u2014SN 537Undergraduate curriculum sequence The undergraduate curriculum begins with four quarters of preclinical work, which forms the general education and science base for nursing. These quarters may be completed at any accredited college or univ ersity. After completion of an additional eight quarters at Loma Linda Univ ersity, the student is eligible to receiv e the B.S. degree and is prepared for professional nursing practice at the baccalaureate level. The clinical experience dev elops the student's technical and theoretical capabilities in a progressiv e manner and within the context of the nursing process: assessment, analysis, planning, implementing, and evaluating. Most of the baccalaureate nursing major is in the upper division, where clinical experience is gained in a broad v ariety of settings. Integral components of upper division courses are leadership concepts and skills, research, health promotion, and activities that foster collaboration in planning health care with the family and all members of the health care team. Professional registration Satisfactory completion of the California Board of Registered Nursing required content prepares the student to sit for the NCLEX-RN examination. All states require that a nurse pass the NCLEX-RN examination for licensure to practice. California application forms and fees are submitted to the California Board of Registered Nursing, P.O. Box 944210, Sacramento, CA 94244-2100: W eb site: >. Three B.S. degree options 1.Standard (generic) B.S. degree curriculum Students must complete all prerequisite courses prior to starting clinical courses. 2.Returning RN (RN/B.S.) curriculum The returning RN may complete a baccalaureate degree in four quarters of full-time course work.

The nurse-scientist who completes this program should be committed to the generation of know ledge critical to dev elopment of nursing science and practice. Graduates join other nursing leaders in furthering the dev elopment of nursing science and improving health care deliv ery throughout the world. The curriculum The Ph.D. degree is offered as a summers-only program on campus at Loma Linda Univ ersity, with selected online courses during the academic y ear. Completion of dissertation will follow. This schedule is designed to accommodate the needs of adult learners who are either full-time students or part-time students with ongoing commitment to professional work during the academic y ear. The core courses of the program are taught during four summer intensiv e sessions. Concentration and electiv e courses may be taken at Loma Linda Univ ersity or through the *NEXus partnership; or a limited number of approv ed units may be transferred from another univ ersity. The doctoral degree program is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of know ledge development within the discipline of nursing through philosophical, theoretical, and scientific methods of inquiry. The core courses of the program emphasize these three areas. In addition to the core courses, each student is encouraged to select an individually focused area of concentration that will support the student's chosen area of expertise in nursing and that will focus her or his area of adv anced inquiry. The area of concentration may fit established research programs of School of Nursing faculty and may also take adv antage of graduate courses throughout the Univ ersity. The credit requirement is 90 quarter units beyond the Master of Science degree. Additionally, LLU Scholars Seminar is required during the academic y ear while aw ay from the Loma Linda Univ ersity campus. The seminar focus is to integrate concentration and electiv e courses in the foundation for a dissertation at the Univ ersity and to maintain momentum during the program. The program may be completed in four-to-sev en years. NEXus is a partnership among select W estern Institute of Nursing institutions to facilitate enrollment in doctoral courses not av ailable on the student's home campus. Through NEXus, the institutions hav e identified courses that are av ailable at a distance and open for enrollments from partner institutions. Progression criteria The following sequential elements are required for progression in the doctoral program: 1.Area of concentration dev eloped and approv al of student's proposed academic plan by the end of the first y ear of full-time study. 2.Written and oral qualifying examination after completion of all required course work. 3.Adv ancement to candidacy. 4.Successful defense of research proposal. 5.Successful defense of dissertation.

The faculty are entrusted with the responsibility of monitoring the maintenance of these standards. Students must be able to perform independently all of the described functions. A candidate for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree must hav e aptitude, abilities, and skills in the following areas: observ ation; communication, motor coordination and function; conceptual, integrativ e, and quantitativ e abilities; behavioral and social attributes; and ethical v alues. The School of Pharmacy will consider for admission any applicant who demonstrates the ability to perform or to learn to perform the skills listed in this document. Applicants are not required to disclose the nature of their disability(ies), if any, to the Admissions Committee. How ever, any applicant with questions about these technical standards is strongly encouraged to discuss his/her specific issue(s) with the assistant dean, Student Affairs and Admissions prior to the interview process. If appropriate, and upon the request of the applicant, reasonable accommodations will be provided. This commitment also holds for current students who experience changes in health or abilities while enrolled in the program. The School of Pharmacy recognizes that certain student disabilities can be accommodated without compromising the standards required by the Univ ersity and the integrity of the curriculum. Technological compensation can be made for some handicaps in these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The school is committed to the dev elopment of innov ative and creativ e ways of opening the curriculum to competitiv e and qualified disabled candidates while protecting the care of patients. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's pow er of selection and observ ation. Therefore, third parties cannot be used to assist students in accomplishing curricular requirements in the skill areas specified abov e. Observ ation Students must be able to observ e demonstrations and conduct exercises in a v ariety of areas related to contemporary pharmacy practice, including but not limited to monitoring of drug response and preparation of specialty dosage forms and experiments in the basic sciences. A student must be able to observ e a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand, noting nonv erbal as w ell as v erbal signals. The student must be able to observ e and interpret presented information. Specific vision-related requirements include, but are not limited to the following abilities: visualizing and discriminating findings on monitoring tests; reading written and illustrated material; observing demonstrations in the classroom or laboratory, including projected images; observing and differentiating changes in body mov ement; observing anatomic structures; discriminating numbers and patterns associated with diagnostic and monitoring instruments and tests; observing a patient's environment; and competently using instruments for monitoring drug response. Communication A student should be able to speak to, hear, and listen to patients in order to elicit information; describe changes in mood, activity, and posture; and perceiv e verbal as w ell as nonv erbal communications. Students must be able to relate effectiv ely and sensitiv ely with patients and their caregiv ers and or partners, and conv ey a sense of compassion and empathy. Students must be able to communicate effectiv ely and sensitiv ely with patients and faculty and staff in the School of Pharmacy. Communication574 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGincludes speech, reading, writing, hearing, and computer literacy. Students must be able to communicate quickly, effectiv ely, and efficiently in oral and written English with all members of the health care team. Specific requirements include but are not limited to the following abilities: communicating rapidly and clearly with members of the health care team individually and collectiv ely; eliciting a thorough medication and medical history; and communicating complex findings in appropriate terms that are understood by patients and their caregiv ers, partners, and v arious members of the health care team (fellow students, pharmacists, faculty and staff members, physicians, nurses, aides, therapists, social workers, and others). Students must be able to prepare and communicate concise but complete summaries of individual activities and decisions; as w ell as complex, prolonged encounters with patients. Students must be able to complete forms or appropriately document activities according to directions in a complete and timely fashion. Motor coordination and function Students should hav e sufficient motor function and skills necessary to perform basic tasks in the practice of pharmacy and to elicit information from patients by v arious screening maneuv ers. A student should be able to execute motor mov ements reasonably required to participate in the general care and emergency treatment of patients. They must be able to respond promptly to urgencies within the practice setting and must not hinder the ability of their co-workers to provide prompt care. Examples of such emergency treatment reasonably required of pharmacists include arriving quickly when called, administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, application of pressure to stop bleeding, participating in the initiation of appropriate procedures, rapidly and accurately preparing appropriate emergency medication, and the preparation of sterile intrav enous medications. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular mov ements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Students must hav e sufficient sensory and motor function to monitor drug responses and to prepare and or dispense pharmaceuticals. A candidate should be able to perform basic laboratory tests (e.g., blood glucose and lipid lev els); administer immunizations (intramuscular and subcutaneous); compound sterile and nonsterile dosage forms; use current technology for drug information ev aluation; and read EKGs, drug blood lev els, and other laboratory results. It is also necessary for the student to be able to access drug and disease information sources (both paper and electronic) within a reasonable time frame and record data correctly so that it is clearly understood by other health professionals. Intellectual, conceptual, integrativ e, and quantitativ e abilities A student should possess sufficient intellectual, conceptual, integrativ e, and quantitativ e abilities to complete a rigorous and intense didactic and experiential curriculum. These abilities include measurement, calculation, rational reasoning, problem analysis and solving, decision making, judgment, numerical recognition, information integration, and solution synthesis. In addition, the candidate should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and understand the spatial relations of structures. Especially important is the appropriate and rapid calculation of dosages for a v ariety of patient-specific conditions such as renal or hepatic failure, obesity, cardiac or respiratory arrest, etc. Additionally, calculations involving appropriate dilution or reconstitution of drug products, electrolytes, etc., must be made accurately and quickly. Problem solving and critical skills demanded of all pharmacists require all of the abov e-mentioned intellectual abilities and must be performed quickly, especially in emergency situations. The ability to incorporate new information from peers or teachers and to locate and ev aluate new information from the literature to be used appropriately in formulating assessments and pharmaceutical care plans is essential, as is good judgment in patient assessment and therapeutic planning for disease management. Students must be able to identify and acknow ledge the limits of theirGeneral Regulations 575know ledge to others when appropriate and must be able to recognize when the limits of their know ledge indicate further study or inv estigation is essential before participating in decision making. A student must be fully alert and attentiv e at all times in clinical settings. Behavioral and social attributes Empathy, integrity, honesty, concern for others, kindness, patience, good interpersonal skills, interest, and motiv ation are required personal qualities. Students must possess the emotional and mental health required for full use of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the screening and care of patients, and the dev elopment of mature, sensitiv e, and effectiv e relationships with patients of differing cultures and backgrounds. Students must also be able to dev elop mature, sensitiv e and effectiv e relationships with patients and their caregiv ers and partners, providing comfort and reassurance when appropriate. Students must possess adequate endurance to be able to tolerate physically, intellectually, and emotionally taxing workloads and to function effectiv ely under stress or with distractions. A t times, this requires the ability to be aw are of and appropriately react to one's own immediate emotional responses and environment. For example, students must maintain a professional demeanor and organization in the face of long hours and personal fatigue, dissatisfied patients, and tired colleagues. Students must dev elop the skills necessary to instruct and supervise technical personnel assisting with the deliv ery of pharmaceutical services. Students are expected to accept appropriate suggestions and criticism and, if necessary, respond quickly, appropriately, and cooperativ ely by modification of behavior. Empathy, patience, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, and motiv ation are personal qualities that should be assessed during the admission and education processes. Ethical v alues Students must demonstrate the highest lev el of professional demeanor and behavior and must perform in an ethical manner in all dealings with peers, faculty, staff, and patients. Students must also be able to develop professional relationships with patients and their caregiv ers and partners while protecting patient confidentiality. Students must also meet the expected ethical standards set forth by the pharmacy profession. Good moral character, decent v alues, and principled judgment are paramount attributes for being a professional. In order to participate in key components of the curriculum, a student must be able to obtain and maintain a v alid intern pharmacist license from the California Board of Pharmacy and pass requisite criminal background checks and random illegal drug screens required by the board or affiliated clinical institutions.

Consequently, all enrolled students must possess a v alid, nonprobationary intern pharmacist license to participate in the experiential components of the Pharm.D. program. Application for this license is part of the orientation program scheduled prior to the start of the PY1 y ear. Professional integrity Loma Linda Univ ersity seeks to educate ethical and proficient pharmacists in a Christian paradigm. Fundamental core v alues of compassion, integrity, freedom, excellence, justice, purity, and humility are expected of each student attending the School of Pharmacy. Integrity is important in upholding the standards of professional and personal conduct and is consistent with the oath that is taken upon graduation. It includes being accountable for one's own conduct, as w ell as assuming responsibility for the professional behavior of one's colleagues within the profession. Professionalism involv es treating others with courtesy and respect. It is expected that all School of Pharmacy students will exhibit conduct that shows respect to others at all times. CODE OF CONDUCT In harmony with the goals of Loma Linda Univ ersity, students are expected to demonstrate a pattern of personal discipline with lifesty le expectations that are consistent with those of the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church. Joining the Loma Linda Univ ersity family is an honor and requires each individual to uphold the policies, regulations, and guidelines established for all members of the Univ ersity team. The following are expected of each member of the Loma Linda Univ ersity family: To respect oneself. To respect the dignity, feelings, worth, and v alues of others. To respect the rights and property of others and to discourage v andalism and theft. To prohibit discrimination while striving to learn from differences in people, ideas, and opinions.

STUDENT ORGANIZA TIONS Professional dev elopment Participation in the professional dev elopment sequence each academic quarter is part of the curriculum for the School of Pharmacy. The purpose of professional dev elopment is to encourage student participation that dev elops leadership skills in student organizations, the School of Pharmacy, and Univ ersity activities.Student Life 579Professional organizations Involv ement in professional organizations is an integral part of the educational and professional experience within the School of Pharmacy. School of Pharmacy recognized student professional societies include: American Pharmacists Association (APhA-ASP) California Pharmacists Association (CPhA ) California Society of Health Systems Pharmacists (CSHP) American Society of Health System Pharmacists (ASHP) Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) Christian Pharmacist Fellowship International (CPFI) Student National Pharmaceutical Association (SNPhA ) Organization membership by invitation The School of Pharmacy endorses three organizations in which student membership is by invitation only. Membership in these organizations is seen as prestigious and indicativ e of superior academic achiev ement and leadership. California Pharmacy Student Leadership (CAPSLEAD) Rho Chi Pharmaceutical Honor Society (RX) Phi Lambda Sigma National Pharmacy Leadership Society (PLS) Class leadership Each class elects leaders to serv e as student representativ es to administration and to guide the class in addressing student-related issues. The Office of Student Affairs works closely with class leaders\u2014assisting with class issues, helping plan ev ents, and facilitating a strong communication link to and from students. Each class also elects a full-time faculty member to serv e as class advisor. The advisor's function is to serv e as mentor, keep abreast of class issues, and maintain an open communication link with the director of the Office of Student Affairs. ACADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Curriculum outcome objectiv es The Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Pharmacy student learning outcomes are to: Perform the functions necessary to provide patient-centered care. Perform the functions necessary to provide population-based care. Perform safe medication distribution and handling. Provide public health services. Apply the Loma Linda Univ ersity philosophy of wholeness in their personal and professional lives. Apply core biomedical know ledge to patient-centered care. Student progression The curriculum is designed to be follow ed in a stepwise, block manner. All prerequisites must be completed before a student can enroll in a course. Students must pass all of the professional courses for580 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGthe current y ear before enrolling in courses for the succeeding y ears. In addition, each student must pass the end-of-y ear comprehensiv e assessment examination. The academic standing of each student is review ed quarterly by the Office of Academic Affairs. Students who fail to meet the minimum standards will be notified, in writing, by the Office of Academic Affairs. A minimum grade of C- is required to pass all pharmacy courses and electiv es. Following a course failure, a student's progression will stop; and s/he will be placed on leav e-of-absence status for two academic quarters (not including summer ). Upon returning from the leav e of absence, the student must repeat the course(s) failed initially. A student will be permitted a cumulativ e total of 9 credit hours of unsatisfactory course work during the academic program. Exceeding 9 credit hours of unsatisfactory course work, whether accumulated in a single academic quarter or throughout the entire academic program, will result in dismissal from the program. A student will hav e a maximum of six calendar y ears from the initial date of matriculation to complete the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. End-of-y ear assessment examinations One of the requirements for progressing from one professional y ear to the next is passing a comprehensiv e, year-end, qualifying examination. These examinations are prepared by curricular y ear- specific teams of faculty members. The results of the end-of-y ear assessment examination will be communicated by the PY1, PY2, PY3 curricular y ear team chair to the Office of Academic Affairs for communication to individual students. Failure to pass these examinations will delay progression and enrollment in the subsequent y ear. Students who fail the end-of-y ear-assessment examination on the first attempt will retake a different, but similar in difficulty, examination as scheduled by the Assessment Committee. Students who fail the second attempt (first retake) must complete an oral examination (second retake) administered per the Assessment Committee's requirements. The oral examination will be conducted by the curricular y ear-specific team of faculty members. The oral examination will focus on establishing a student's competency in the subject matter for the PY1, PY2, PY3 curricular y ear as appropriate to the specific students. The results will be communicated in writing to the associate dean for academic affairs. Students who fail the third attempt (the oral examination) will notprogress to the next professional y ear. Grading system Grade and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in the School of Pharmacy. All courses taught are approv ed for letter grades only. The exceptions are forum and professional dev elopment, which will be graded on an S/U (satisfactory/unsatisfactory) basis. The grades and corresponding grade-point scales are: 4.0 B+ 3.3 B performance B- 2.7 77-79 C+ 2.3 73-76 C 2.0 70-72 1.7 Marginal 67-69 D+ 1.3 Unsatisfactory performance 60-66 D 1.0 <60 F 0.0 S 0.0 Satisfactory performance in pharmacy forum or professional dev elopment U 0.0 Unsatisfactory performance in pharmacy forum or professional dev elopment Incomplete grade The notation \"I\" (incomplete) in a course is giv en only for circumstances beyond a student's control. It will not be granted as a remedy for course ov erload, failure on a final examination, absence from a final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. In order to receiv e an incomplete, the student must initiate a request to receiv e a grade of \"I\" by completing a P etition to Receiv e Incomplete Grade form and stating the reason for the request. If this request is approv ed, the instructor will report an \"I\" as w ell as the grade the student will receiv e if the deficiency is not remov ed within the prescribed time limit. An \"I\" notation must be changed to an earned letter grade before the end of the following term (excluding summer sessions). Failure to complete course requirements will cause the incomplete work to be counted as a zero and factored in with the existing grade to calculate the final grade for the course. Grade changes A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in computing or recording. Such changes may be processed only up to the end of the following term. In order to satisfactorily complete a course for which a grade of less than C- has been earned, the student must repeat the course. This includes attending lecture and/or laboratory sessions as required, completing the assigned work, and taking any required examinations. Both the original and repeat course grades are entered on the permanent transcript record, but only the second (repeat) course grade is used to compute the grade-point av erage (G.P.A.). A course may be repeated only once.582 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGGrade appeals Every student has the right to receiv e a grade assigned upon a fair and unprejudiced ev aluation based on a method that is neither arbitrary nor capricious. Furthermore, instructors hav e the right to assign a grade based on any method that is professionally acceptable, communicated to all students in the course syllabus, and applied equally. Instructors hav e the responsibility to provide careful ev aluation and timely assignment of appropriate grades. Course and project grading methods should be explained to students at the beginning of the term. Academic integrity assumes that the instructor's judgment of record is authoritativ e and that the final grades assigned are correct. A grade appeal is confined to charges of unfair action tow ard an individual student and may not involv e a challenge of an instructor's grading standard. A student has the right to expect thoughtful and clearly defined approaches to grading, but it must be recognized that v aried standards and individual approaches to grading are v alid. The grade appeal considers whether a grade w as determined in a fair and appropriate manner; it does not attempt to grade or regrade individual assignments or projects. It is incumbent on the student to substantiate the claim that his or her final grade represents unfair treatment. Only the final grade in a course may be appealed. In the absence of compelling reasons\u2014such as clerical error, prejudice, or arbitrariness\u2014the grade assigned by the instructor of record is to be considered final. In a grade appeal, only arbitrariness, prejudice, and/or error will be considered as legitimate grounds for an appeal. Arbitrariness: The grade aw arded represents such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the instructor did not actually exercise professional judgment. Prejudice: The grade aw arded w as motiv ated by ill will and is not indicativ e of the student's academic performance. Error: The instructor made a mistake in fact. The grade appeal procedure applies only when a student initiates a grade appeal and not when the instructor decides to change a grade on his or her own initiativ e. This procedure does not cov er instances where students hav e been assigned grades based on academic dishonesty or academic misconduct. Also excluded from this procedure are grade appeals alleging discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in violation of Loma Linda Univ ersity's sexual harassment policy. The grade appeal procedure striv es to resolv e, in a collegial manner, a disagreement betw een student and instructor concerning the assignment of a grade. The intent is to provide a mechanism for the informal discussion of differences of opinion and for the formal adjudication by a grade appeal panel only when necessary. In all instances, students who believ e that an appropriate grade has not been assigned must first seek to resolv e the matter informally with the instructor of record. If the matter cannot be resolv ed informally, the student must proceed with a grade appeal in the procedure outlined below. The grade appeal process must be started within ten working days after the end of the academic quarter in which the disputed grade is receiv ed. Student grade-appeal process Step 1. A student who wishes to question a grade must discuss the matter first with the instructor within ten working days after the end of the academic quarter in which the disputed grade is receiv ed. In most cases, the discussion betw een the student and the instructor should suffice, and the matter will not need to be carried further. The student should be aw are that the only v alid basis for grade appeal beyond Step 1 is to establish that an instructor assigned a grade that w as arbitrary, prejudiced, or in error.Student Life 583Step 2. If the student's concerns remain unresolv ed after Step 1, the student may submit a written request to meet with the appropriate department chair within fiv e working days of speaking with the instructor. In situations where the instructor of record is a department chair or associate dean, then the dean will serv e as the appropriate department head in this step. The appropriate department chair will meet within fiv e working days with the student; and, if the department chair believ es that the complaint may hav e merit, s/he will meet with the instructor. After consultation with the department chair, the instructor may choose to let the grade remain or change it. The department head will then communicate the result to the student and instructor. Step 3. If the matter remains unresolv ed after Step 2, the student should submit to the dean within fiv e working days a written request that includes all supporting documents. The dean will appoint a grade appeal panel to review the request. The panel may require any or all individuals associated with the appeal to appear. The panel is charged with determining whether the grade w as assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, or whether clear and convincing evidence of unfair treatment\u2014such as arbitrariness, prejudice, and/or error\u2014might justify changing the grade. The panel will make its decisions based on a majority vote. If the panel concludes that the grade w as assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, it will report its conclusion in writing to the student and instructor, and the matter will be considered closed. If the panel determines that compelling reasons exist for changing the grade, it would request that the instructor make the change, providing the instructor with a written explanation of its reasons. Should the instructor decline, s/he must provide a written explanation for refusing. The panel, after considering the instructor's explanation and upon again concluding that it would be unjust to allow the original grade to stand, will then determine what grade is to be assigned. The new grade may be higher than, the same as, or low er than the original grade. Having made this determination, each panel member will sign the grade change form and transmit it to the Office of Univ ersity Records. The instructor and the student will be advised of the new grade. Under no circumstances may the grade be changed except by the original faculty member or the panel. Should the panel conclude that the instructor's written explanation justifies the original grade, the panel will report this in writing to the student and the instructor; and the matter will be closed. Class attendance Student attendance in classes is considered to be the cornerstone of professional behavior and is expected in all classes. Instructors may require attendance in class as a condition of passing a course or as part of the grade a student earns. Chapel In keeping with the commitment to the mission of the Univ ersity, all School of Pharmacy students are required to attend a w eekly chapel service. The chapel service is a core component of the wholeness curriculum at Loma Linda Univ ersity. Chapel services provide opportunities for members of the Univ ersity community to benefit from programming that integrates faith and learning. By setting aside time each w eek for a chapel program, the Univ ersity seeks to emphasize the v alue it places on spiritual development, corporate worship, and community. This also reaffirms the Univ ersity's commitment to the ideals upon which it w as founded. Regular attendance is required at the w eekly chapel services, as w ell as the daily services during the quarterly W eek of Devotion. Students are expected to fulfill this requirement as they would any other component of the curriculum.584 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGPharmacy forum Pharmacy forum is a scheduled time during which professors and students come together to discuss pertinent issues and address professional topics that enhance the student's academic and professional experience. This is considered part of the pharmacy curriculum, and each quarter students receiv e a Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory grade for forum. Attendance is required and is a component of the forum grade. Dean's list and honor roll The Office of Academic Affairs compiles a list of students who hav e demonstrated their academic excellence by achieving an outstanding grade-point av erage each quarter. A student who earns a 3.30-3.69 grade-point av erage with no incomplete grades during a term is giv en honor roll standing. A student who earns a 3.70 or better grade-point av erage, with no incomplete grades, is giv en Dean's List standing. Honors and aw ards The School of Pharmacy aw ards excellence in scholastic attainment and leadership abilities. Aw ards are available to students whose performance and attitudes reflect the mission and goals of Loma Linda Univ ersity and the School of Pharmacy. Students demonstrating excellence in scholarship, professionalism, and leadership ability may be nominated for recognition. Selection of students for the following aw ards is a function of the Honors and Aw ards Committee with input from the faculty. The PRESIDENT'S A WARD is giv en annually to a graduating student who has demonstrated excellence in scholarship and community service within the framework of commitment to the highest ideals of the Univ ersity. The DEAN'S A WARD is giv en annually to a graduating student who has demonstrated excellence in scholarship. The WIL ALEXANDER WHOLE PERSON CARE A WARD is giv en annually to a graduating student who has demonstrated superior commitment to helping others. DEAN'S SCHOLARSHIPS are giv en annually to the top three students academically in the first three years of the Doctor of Pharmacy program. In addition, the School of Pharmacy receiv es funding annually from a v ariety of organizations dedicated to assisting the School in helping students meet the financial obligations for their education. These funds are distributed to students who hav e demonstrated a strong commitment to their studies as well as a commitment to the v alues of the institution. Performance lev els Good academic standing To remain in good academic standing, pharmacy students must maintain a minimum cumulativ e grade-point av erage of 2.30. Failure to maintain good academic standing will result in action by the Office of Academic Affairs. In addition to the cumulativ e G.P.A., a grade of at least a C- must be earned in any course for which credit is to be applied tow ards completion of the requirements of the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Academic probation Each student's academic status will be review ed at the end of ev ery quarter, including cumulativ e G.P.A. as reported by the Office of Univ ersity Records. A student with a cumulativ e G.P.A. of less thanStudent Life 5852.30 will be placed on academic probation and will receiv e a letter from the Office of Academic Affairs. This written notice of academic probation will also include a notice that failure to reach the required G.P.A. by the end of the next two successiv e academic terms will result in the student being dismissed from the school. Academic probation will also result when a student receiv es less than a C- in any advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) during the PY4 y ear. Each student on academic probation is required to meet with his/her faculty advisor by the end of the second w eek of the probationary term to dev elop and agree to, in writing, an academic improv ement plan (AIP). The AIP may include mandatory study/advising sessions, mandatory class attendance, and/or other stipulations aimed at encouraging and supporting student academic success. A copy of a student's AIP will be maintained in his/her advising folder, and a copy of the AIP will also be forw arded to the Office of Academic Affairs. The faculty advisor is expected to inform the Office of Academic Affairs of the student's compliance with this policy and his/her academic progress. Failure by the student to seek appropriate assistance from his/her faculty advisor will not be accepted as a v alid reason to stop the imposition of the appropriate academic probationary or other status. Academic probation status will remain in effect for two consecutiv e academic quarters. Upon completion of each academic quarter, a student on academic probation will receiv e in writing from the Office of Academic Affairs a notice of his/her current standing. It is expected that students on probation will make progress tow ard good academic standing at the conclusion of each academic quarter. A t the conclusion of the second consecutiv e academic quarter, the student must hav e achiev ed good academic standing. Failure to do so will result in dismissal. Academic probation will be lifted when the student's cumulativ e G.P.A. rises abov e 2.30 or when the student successfully completes the type of APPE course previously failed. There is no appeal process associated with academic probation. Academic dismissal Since courses may not be attempted more than twice (i.e., a course may be repeated only once)\u2014including APPEs\u2014grades of D+, D, D-, F, and W are considered to be attempts to complete degree program courses. Failure to complete any course in the program within the limits of good academic standing will result in dismissal from the program. A dismissed student will receiv e written notification from the dean of the School of Pharmacy. The notice will include procedures for appeal; and notice of loss of registration, financial aid, housing, etc. It is the student's responsibility to arrange with the Office of Univ ersity Records for formal withdraw al within one w eek of receiving the written notification. Dismissed students are required to turn in any school or Univ ersity ID badges and v acate Univ ersity residence halls. The school will also notify the California State Board of Pharmacy for termination of the student's pharmacy intern license. Readmission of dismissed students A dismissed student may reapply and be considered for readmission. To be considered for readmission, the student must petition (in writing) the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee. P etitions are due in the dean's office by the designated date (following each term), as published and sent to each dismissed student. After review of the written appeal, the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee may uphold the dismissal or may recommend the student for readmission with or without conditions/stipulations. The Admissions Committee reviews each case separately and reserv es the right to determine the provisions/conditions for each individual situation. A student who has been dismissed twice is not eligible for readmission to the same degree program for a period of tw elve months, or until s/he demonstrates the ability to succeed through course work taken at586 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGanother institution. Following this tw elve-month period, a student may apply for readmission by following the abov e procedures. The dismissal decisions made by the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee may be appealed. All appeals must be in writing and submitted to the dean of the School of Pharmacy by the established/stated deadline. A student who questions whether the School of Pharmacy has follow ed prescribed process with regard to his/her griev ance may request the Office of the President to conduct a review. Withdraw al from the program It is the student's responsibility to begin the withdraw al process from a course or the curriculum in a timely manner. It is important for the student to seek counseling or guidance from his/her faculty advisor or other administrativ e persons regarding a situation that may negativ ely impact upon academic performance. Failure to seek appropriate assistance will not be accepted as a v alid reason to stop the imposition of the appropriate academic penalties. If a student finds it necessary to withdraw during the course of a quarter, the Office of Student Affairs must be notified in writing. Arrangements for formal withdraw al must then be made in the Office of Univ ersity Records by completing and submitting a W ithdraw al from the Program form. Courses dropped during the first two w eeks of the term are not included in the student's permanent record, and tuition is refunded. Refer to the Univ ersity's refund policy in the Financial Information section of the Student Handbook for information that applies after the first two w eeks of the quarter. An exit interview with the School of Pharmacy administration is required. Experiential education The School of Pharmacy participates in the California Board of Pharmacy's approv ed supervised experiential program. The school will certify 600 of the required 1,500 hours of supervised experience required to sit for the licensing examination. Successful completion of the School of Pharmacy's didactic and experiential programs, and passing scores on the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) and a law examination or equiv alent, are required in order to become a registered pharmacist (RPh) in the state(s) of choice. The experiential program consists of a v ariety of introductory and adv anced pharmacy practice experiences designed to provide the student with professional experience through the use of a structured and supervised program of study. Students participating in the experiential program will receiv e a Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Pharmacy Experiential Program Manual . Guidelines and policies are listed in this manual and must be adhered to in order to successfully complete the program. Didactic education is a systematic approach intended to conv ey instruction and information (classroom, laboratory, recitation, etc.). Experiential education is related to or deriv ed from providing experiences in real-life professional settings. In pharmacy education, the experiential component is designed to provide in-depth exposure to and activ e participation in selected pharmacy practice settings. Pharmacy students are exposed to prescription processing, compounding, documenting services, obtaining drug histories, drug therapy monitoring, counseling, ev aluating drug usage, drug distribution systems, and other relev ant pharmacy practice activities. Under the philosophy of pharmaceutical care, the School of Pharmacy offers introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) in the PY s 1-3 to enhance practice skills and prepare students to function as members of a health care team. The adv anced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) in the PY4 are designed to help students integrate and refine the skills learned in the first three y ears of pharmacy (didactic and experiential) course work.Student Life 587The purpose of the experiential education program is to apply didactic know ledge to pharmacy practice. The ultimate goal of the experiential program is to produce w ell-rounded, competent, caring, and responsible pharmacists who can deliv er exemplary pharmaceutical care, as w ell as communicate effectiv ely with div erse patients and other health care professionals. Experiential education requirements The majority of the student's time during experiential courses is spent on out-of-the-classroom activity under the direct supervision of a School of Pharmacy preceptor. When a student is off campus during an IPPE or APPE rotation, Loma Linda Univ ersity's code of conduct and the guidelines found in the School of Pharmacy Student Policies and Procedures Manual are still in effect throughout the completion of this experience. If experiential site regulations and policies differ from Univ ersity policies, the site policies supersede. In addition to the abov e-mentioned guidelines, the following items are to be follow ed by all professional pharmacy students assigned to experiential sites or rotations. Attendance is mandatory. Punctuality is expected, and excessiv e tardiness will not be tolerated. Students must maintain their Univ ersity email account and are required to check the account at least daily to keep apprised of important information or announcements. All experiential educational assignments are made through the Division of Experiential Education and are the responsibility of the directors of experiential education. No student is allow ed to change rotation sites. Students are not to function as an agent or employ ee of the site. They must identify themselv es as pharmacy students from Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Pharmacy. While participating in this graded experience, students shall not, under any circumstances, receiv e financial remuneration from the experiential site. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in suspension and remov al from the rotation and receipt of a failing grade in the course. All financial obligations associated with the student's pharmacy education are the responsibility of the student. These responsibilities include transportation, food, lodging, and any other incidental costs related to off-site assignments. Concurrent employment during the experiential experience does not exclude or excuse students from any responsibilities associated with course requirements. The student must possess a v alid driv er's license and is responsible for transportation to and from sites. Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Pharmacy students are required to dress and act professionally at all times. This expectation extends to experiential educational activities where the student is not physically on the campus but receiv es instruction and guidance through a School of Pharmacy preceptor. The Division of Experiential Education requires all students to adhere to the School of Pharmacy dress code and to w ear their Loma Linda Univ ersity identification card and short white laboratory coat at all times while at the experiential site. The laboratory coat must be white, clean, and freshly pressed/ironed. Students who attend out of dress code will be considered absent by the preceptor and sent home to fulfill dress code requirements prior to returning to the practice site. In addition to the general school requirements, other rules may apply for students who are off site. If the experiential site has special attire or dress code requirements, the more stringent of the dress code requirements prev ails, whether that of Loma Linda Univ ersity or of the off-site institution.588 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGPharmacy practice experience In order to complete the curriculum successfully, graduate from the School of Pharmacy, and become a licensed pharmacist, the student is required to complete a minimum of 1,500 hours of practice experience. The director of experiential education coordinates both introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE) and adv anced pharmacy practice experience (APPE). Introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE) The goals of the introductory pharmacy practice experience are to sharpen students' clinical skills through direct patient care activities in community, institutional, and ambulatory care settings; to introduce the student to different career opportunities in pharmacy; and to assist them in determining their career choices. Under the tutelage of a School of Pharmacy preceptor, who is also a licensed pharmacist, the student will be provided opportunities to apply didactic know ledge to patient care in community, institutional, and ambulatory care settings early on. These experiences will enhance communication, problem-solving, critical-thinking, and decision-making skills through direct patient care activities. Adv anced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) Students are required to complete a total of six adv anced pharmacy practice experiences in specific clinical areas. Four experiences (each lasting six w eeks) will be in required fields of hospital practice, ambulatory care, internal medicine, and clinical community practice. T wo experiences will be in electiv e fields (see curriculum section). Prerequisites for adv anced pharmacy practice experiences In order to progress to the adv anced pharmacy practice experiences, a student must meet the following requirements: Assessment examination: Students must pass the PY3 end-of-y ear comprehensiv e assessment examination.

Some sites may require this immunization. HIPAA certificate: All students are required to complete HIP AA training and obtain a certificate of completion annually. Tuberculosis screening: Students must be screened and cleared for tuberculosis (complete a one- or two-step PPD test, depending on the practice site requirement) during summer of PY4. A chest X-ray may also be required. Students shall follow specific instructions provided by the Division of Experiential Education. A record of tuberculosis screening clearance must be on file in the office of the director of experiential education. Background check: Facilities require a background check of all personnel, including students who are placed on site for experiential education. Some institutions may require the student to sign a confidentiality agreement or disclosure statement. Background checks are required for entry intoStudent Life 589the School of Pharmacy. P eriodic review and update may be required during the program. Additionally, an updated background check is required prior to starting APPE. Random drug screening : Random drug screening may be required for some practice settings. This screening may be abov e and beyond school-mandated screening. Intern license: Students must hold a v alid California pharmacist intern license throughout the advanced pharmacy practice experiences. CPR/First aid: Students must hold v alid certification in both CPR and first aid. Effectiv e dates must be current through PY4.

The Office of Student Affairs submits these applications to the California Board of Pharmacy. All students involv ed in introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) and adv anced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) must hold a current pharmacy intern license. Information about the pharmacy intern license can be found on the W eb site < pharmacy.ca.gov/forms/intern_app_pkt.pdf >. It is the student's responsibility to keep his/her pharmacy intern license current and v alid. The Board of Pharmacy must be notified of any address, student status, or name change. A photocopy of the student's valid pharmacy intern license must be on file in the school's Division of Experiential Education. Pharmacy intern hours The California State Board of Pharmacy requires each student to accrue 1,500 hours of acceptable intern experience. The School of Pharmacy's adv anced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) will fulfill 600 of these hours. The remaining 900 hours must consist of experience in a pharmacy under the immediate, direct, and personal supervision of a pharmacist. This experience must be predominantly related to preparing, processing, and dispensing prescription products; compounding prescriptions; keeping records; and making reports required by California and federal regulations. Graduation requirements A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Pharmacy at Loma Linda Univ ersity shall meet all of the following requirements: Satisfaction of all requirements for admission. Satisfactory completion of allrequirements of the curriculum, including\u2014 specified attendance at chapel and forum; the total number of credit units; all specified didactic and experiential course work; and all applicable qualifying and comprehensiv e assessment examinations successfully passed.590 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGA cumulativ e grade-point av erage of 2.3 or higher for the total degree program.

In 1964, plans w ere laid for faculty and facilities to meet the requirements of the Committee on Professional Education of the American Public Health Association (APHA ). Three y ears later, the School of Nutrition and Dietetics (established in 1922) and the Division of Public Health and Tropical Medicine w ere accredited by APHA and organized under the name Loma Linda Univ ersity School of Public Health. This name w as changed to School of Health in October 1970 to reflect more clearly the school's emphasis on lifesty le. In response to changing societal perceptions and definitions of \"public health,\" the original name, School of Public Health, w as readopted in A ugust 1987. The Center for Health Promotion, the Department of Prev entiv e Medicine, and the Prev entiv e Medicine Group w ere merged into the School of Public Health in 1990. The expanded resources realized by this merger stimulated further growth and dev elopment of the school to provide a dynamic learning and research environment for its students and faculty. ACCREDIT ATION The school has maintained continuous accreditation since it w as accredited at its inception in 1967 by the American Public Health Association. It is currently accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health, 800 Ey e Street NW , Suite 202, W ashington, DC 20001-3710. The school is also a member of the Association of Schools of Public Health.School Foundations 603General Regulations Students of the Univ ersity are responsible for informing themselv es of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation.

DEP ARTMENTS AND CENTERS The instructional, research, and service programs within the school are organized and administered by six academic departments and three centers. The departments The departments of the School of Public Health are as follows: Environmental and Occupational Health, Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Global Health, Health Policy and Management, Health Promotion and Education, and Nutrition. Department of Environmental and Occupational Health The protection of the human environment from natural and man-made hazardous conditions is a major issue of growing concern that affects the health and w elfare of people throughout the world. Environmental and occupational health professionals striv e to promote health and quality of life by prev enting and reducing illness, disability, and death from interactions betw een people and their environment ov er their entire life span. The science and practice of environmental health currently cov ers many new responsibilities\u2014such as responding to emergencies, educating and training v arious audiences, and dev eloping new standards and guidelines; or helping formulate public policy. The emergence of new issues and threats\u2014such as food security or natural, technological, humanitarian, and terrorism-related environmental emergencies\u2014establishes the need for an educated and w ell-prepared environmental and occupational health workforce. As environmental health professionals must be able to anticipate, recognize, and respond to traditional as w ell as emerging challenges, they also need to stay current on all of the latest information and technology tools av ailable. Environmental health practitioners are div erse in background, education, and function. Therefore, the department stresses an interdisciplinary approach to instruction and continually seeks to train individuals with a broad range of backgrounds, v alue systems, and perceptions of the world. The Environmental and Occupational Health Program provides a California state-approv ed professional program that leads to the Master of Public Health (M.P.H) degree in environmental and occupational health. In addition, certain individuals are offered the opportunity to obtain an M.P.H degree that is not designed to meet the eligibility certification requirements. The Department of Environmental andLearning Environment 605Occupational Health also makes av ailable to students interdisciplinary options that integrate epidemiologic research skills or modern geospatial information technology tools into the standard M.P.H degree program. The department also partners with the U.S. P eace Corps to offer a dual degree, the M.P.H./Master's International Program (M.P.H./M.I.P). Goals The Department of Environmental and Occupational Health endeavors to prepare distinguished environmental health professionals to serv e local, national, and international communities; and to train graduates who will demonstrate the following standards of excellence: Conduct themselv es in a professional and ethical manner. Commit to public health protection and environmental justice. Serv e communities as qualified, successful environmental health practitioners. Be prepared to enter into adv anced or doctoral degree programs. Programs The Department offers the following curricula: 1.Master of Public Health a.Environmental and occupational health specialist b.Environmental epidemiology 2.Certificate a.Health geoinformatics Outcomes The competency-based curriculum is built upon themes of environmental quality, stew ardship, and sustainability; and on a vocation for social justice. By the end of the program, graduates will be able to: 1.Understand the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of environmental and occupational hazards. 2.Assess environmental conditions that present actual or potential health hazards to employ ees and the general public; and recommend sustainable and cost-effectiv e, practical mitigation techniques and monitoring strategies. 3.Manage environmental health programs and professionals. 4.Conduct applied policy and technical research that expands the existing know ledge base in the field of environmental and occupational health sciences, both in the United States and international communities. 5.Provide environmental and occupational health-related consultation to local and national governments, international agencies, nongov ernmental organizations, industry, priv ate associations, labor organizations, and academic institutions. 6.Advocate for environmental justice and equity on behalf of vulnerable and disadv antaged subgroups of the population606 UNIVERSITY CA TALOG7.Meet the eligibility requirements to sit for the registered environmental health specialist (REHS) examination. Vision Statement Inspired by a high calling to environmental stew ardship and justice, the vision of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health is to prepare health professionals who, by helping to improv e the environment, can also help ensure not only better health for individuals, but also healthier communities. Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics Description Although the science of epidemiology began with the inv estigation of the infectious disease outbreaks, epidemiologists today consider the modern plagues of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and injuries to be a part of this relativ ely young discipline. Contemporary epidemiology builds upon the premise that disease or health is not randomly distributed within populations. Epidemiologists, therefore, apply a collection of investigativ e research methods that permeate all fields of public health in order to identify and isolate the underlying causes of disease and injury, as w ell as health. The emphasis placed upon the inv estigativ e process has inspired some to describe the epidemiologist as a medical detectiv e. The div ersity of this inv estigativ e science is illustrated by a number of research accomplishments ranging from identification of control and prev entiv e measures for AIDS and diabetes mellitus to etiologic processes important in the dev elopment of malignant neoplasms, cardiov ascular diseases, and infectious diseases. Other accomplishments of epidemiology include discov ery of social and biological mechanisms involv ed in the spread of measles, AIDS, and pertussis through human populations; and prev entiv e measures for surgical wound and other hospital-acquired infections. Contemporary epidemiologic inquiry ranges from inv estigation of the roles of prescription medications, nutrition, electromagnetic fields, and pesticides in human cancer; to identification of health benefits of cholesterol reduction, smoking cessation, and use of safety bindings on skis. The efficacy and confirmed success of epidemiology guarantee an exciting future for those who meet the challenges of this adv ancing science. Goals The Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics: 1.Trains students to become professionals in epidemiology and biostatistics. 2.Fosters a spirit of collaboration betw een students and faculty by including students in research projects and as teaching assistants. 3.Provides practical research experience\u2014including presentation of data\u2014through field practice in a public health department or other agency or on one of the research projects within the Univ ersity. 4.Conducts high-quality research, collaborates on research projects within the school and the Univ ersity, and dev elops research collaboration with other academic and research communities. 5.Provides consultation services regarding research design; and analyzes and interprets results to other groups within the Univ ersity, the community, and outside agencies.Learning Environment 607Programs The Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics offers the following degrees: M.P.H. (biostatistics) M.P.H.

Outcomes Critically review the epidemiologic literature and identify strengths and w eaknesses of design, analyses, and conclusions Participate in disease surv eillance as practiced in state and county health departments Apply know ledge of disease mechanisms and information from the biological disciplines to the interpretation of statistical findings in biomedical research Collaborate with health professionals by providing technical expertise with regard to literature review, study design, data analysis, and interpretation and reporting of results Vision statement The mission of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics is to prepare professionals to serv e local, national, and international communities as researchers and consultants qualified to provide an understanding of environmental, genetic, and social characteristics important in disease dev elopment and spread; as w ell as professionals qualified to select and apply appropriate statistical theories, strategies, and techniques to the solution of research problems. Department of Global Health Description Recent adv ances in science, technology, and communications hav e created a rapidly shrinking planet\u2014a v eritable global, interconnected village\u2014with unique opportunities and unparalleled challenges in health and dev elopment. Current global trends highlight increasingly ominous problems\u2014escalating threats of conflict, violence and disasters, chronic and infectious disease (old and emerging), deteriorating maternal, perinatal, and child health indices, endemic pov erty, political instability, social injustice and human rights violations, uncontrolled urbanization, environmental hazards and a fragile ecosystem, societal disintegration, and widespread substance abuse\u2014all of which combine to amplify the stark inequities and shocking disparities in health and dev elopment that exist around the world. On the other hand, remarkable progress is being made through multisectoral efforts directed tow ard prev enting disease, disability, and death; promoting health, safety and w ellbeing; improving education608 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGand socioeconomic status, and ensuring improv ed standards of living. The av ailability of and access to simple, cost-effectiv e, appropriate strategies is further reinforced by a heightened aw areness of the underlying complex array of determinants, forces, processes, and systems (social, political, economic, epidemiological, religious, and cultural) that dynamically interact to impact health and dev elopment. The Department of Global Health (GLBH) prepares committed professionals who are both technically competent and cross-culturally skilled in creating and facilitating sustainable health and dev elopment programs in div erse settings and populations. Utilizing an experiential, evidence-based model of learning, the department's program enables graduates to contribute tow ards a better quality of life for all people, and especially those who are vulnerable, underserv ed, marginalized, and disadv antaged. The department's extensiv e network of global and local resources affords a broad spectrum of options for students to learn and practice the \"art and science\" of this exciting discipline. The department prepares career professionals who qualify for entry-lev el positions in nongov ernmental organizations; faith-based and other and national health departments; priv ate foundations; public health practice organizations; and in the nonprofit relief and dev elopment sector. Graduates also find positions in government and transnational organizations such as the World Health Organization, UNICEF, the World Bank, Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention, and national assistance organizations like the United States Agency for International Dev elopment. Further academic training is also an option for graduates interested in teaching and research. Graduates with field experience (including students who add the M.P.H. degree in global health to a previous clinical or academic degree) will qualify for managerial positions in program planning and ev aluation, contracting, technical assistance, grant writing, and advocacy. Department goal The goal of the Department of Global Health is rooted in the Christian v alues of lov e for and service to humanity, and stew ardship of the earth's resources. The department aims to educate competent, ethical, and compassionate individuals who engage communities\u2014especially the poor and underserv ed\u2014to help them achiev e an optimal lev el of health and dev elopment.

P ettis V A Medical Center, Patton State Hospital, Kaiser P ermanente Medical Center in Fontana, San Bernardino County Department of Public Health, and the Inland Empire Health P lan. A wide v ariety of interv ention programs to reduce health risks and promote healthful living practices are integrated into the second- and third-y ear rotations; and an international health emphasis is av ailable for interested residents, including involv ement with international projects in dev eloping countries. Under the guidance of the residency and faculty members at the School of Public Health, each resident conducts a research project on a topic of choice during the senior y ear. Family and prev entiv e medicine residency The Family and Prev entiv e Medicine Residency Program combines curricular elements of a three-y ear family medicine residency and a three-y ear prev entiv e medicine residency into an efficient training program of four y ears. During the first y ear, residents complete a family medicine internship but also set aside time to begin course work tow ards their Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) degree. The second y ear remains family medicine-centered but also includes a prev entiv e medicine rotation and further M.P.H. degree course work. During the third and fourth y ears, there is an equal mix of family and prev entiv e medicine rotations and M.P.H. degree course work, as w ell as electiv e time. Residents may select one of two tracks: (a) global health or (b) lifesty le medicine. In each track, residents are exposed to new models of clinical care and also spend extra time emphasizing natural, nonpharmaceutical approaches to health and healing. Electiv e time during the third and fourth y ears can be used to pursue one of the specific tracks summarized abov e or for additional learning in other areas of interest and v alue to the resident.Academic Policies and General Regulations 623Occupational medicine residency Physicians who hav e completed an internship (PGY-1) y ear are eligible to apply for the two-y ear occupational medicine program, which involv es an integrated academic and practicum phase.

Global Epidemiology specialization PRAMIL N. SINGH, Director Program description In schools of public health, a traditional domain of the M.P.H. degree in epidemiology has been the training in population-based surv ey research. Three recent trends in population health are noteworthy:1) the emergence of multinational surv ey research teams working in the environments of academia (i.e., Fogarty/NIH model of univ ersities in high-income and low-income regions collaborating), nongov ernmental organizations, and policy institutes; 2) the emergence of a chronic disease epidemic in developing regions in which public health in such nations as India and China is facing the challenge of obesity co-existing with malnutrition; and 3) the need for v alid surv ey data from large samples for immediate use in program planning and health policy relativ e to exposure and disease. In light of theseGlobal Health\u2014PH 665global trends, the global epidemiology M.P.H. degree student will complete the same formal training in epidemiologic research methods as other epidemiology majors\u2014but will integrate this training with the global health know ledge base, specific global health skills (qualitativ e research methods, alternativ e sampling strategies, alternativ e surv ey design approaches, and spatial data analysis), and global health worldview. The training will enable graduates to plan, design, and implement surv eys of hard-to-access, vulnerable populations in global and community-based settings. After the first y ear of intensiv e course work on the core know ledge and skills of global health and epidemiology, the global epidemiology major will be engaged in a summer of integrated community dev elopment, research, and field practicum activities in community and/or global settings. This specialization is designed to educate global health professionals who will be capable of : 1.Planning, designing, and implementing epidemiologic studies that serv e research and program planning needs in global and community settings. 2.Planning, designing, and implementing a \"mixed methods\" (quantitativ e and qualitativ e components) study that serv es research and program planning needs in global and community settings. 3.Analyzing and interpreting data from a wide range of methodologies (quantitativ e, qualitativ e, GIS) to serv e research, program planning, and health policy initiativ es in global and community settings. 4.Incorporating the know ledge base (i.e., primary health care, health disparities, millennium development goals, culture/behavior-social context of health, child health and surviv al, public health systems and gov ernment micro-enterprise/pov erty alleviation/social economics, complex health emergencies and preparedness, nutrition and food security, health education, injury/ violence prev ention and control), skills, and world view of global health training into their planning, design, and implementation of epidemiologic studies. 5.Writing grant proposals to fund global epidemiology and global health research and programs. Educational effectiv eness Educational effectiv eness will be determined through reading assignments and reports, research papers, oral presentations, group work on proposals, community engagement projects and research, laboratory exercises, case studies, tests, quizzes, field practicum, and exit interview.

In addition, this specialization will be appropriate for students from div erse cultural backgrounds, with a keen interest in working in careers that serv e the research and program planning needs of their global communities. Research and field practicum The global epidemiology specialization has designated international sites where faculty hav e activ e projects (funded by grants, by collaboration with NGO). These sites hav e been chosen as research and field practicum sites for the global epidemiology majors due to the av ailability of data and in-country supervision of activities. During the first two quarters of enrollment, students should meet with the program director to obtain approv al for the site and topic of their EPDM 699 and GLBH 699 course work. A practical option is to choose to complete the on-site activities of GLBH 545, EPDM 699, and GLBH 699 at the same site or at sites within the same region. Research (EPDM 699 and GLBH 699) This comprehensiv e, research-based project typically requires at least six w eeks of continuous engagement in a global community setting. The on-site research objectiv es will be met by students completing an epidemiology research project in the global community setting under the mentorship of faculty from global health and epidemiology. Field practicum Students will complete a field practicum in a global community setting that partners them with an organization outside the Univ ersity (gov ernmental, nongov ernmental, community-based partnership, humanitarian assistance). This experience will provide students an opportunity to activ ely participate in and observ e the organization's practice of global epidemiology. Since the field activities of GLBH 545 and EPDM 699/GLBH 699 often include collaboration with external organizations (i.e., NGO, gov ernment ministries) a practical option is for a student to remain onsite after these activities and work on a field practicum. Global Maternal and Child Health specialization RONALD H. MA TAYA, Director Description In its comprehensiv e definition, the term maternal and child health (MCH), a major subfield of public health, encompasses women, infants, children of all ages, adolescents, and families (Association of Teachers in Maternal and Child Health 2001). Therefore, the goal of MCH programs is to improv e the health of women, children, adolescents, and families. Against the backdrop of the Healthy P eople 2010 document, which highlights the importance of their health, this goal emerges out of a clear recognition that women and children are the most vulnerable, least pow erful and often neglected members of societies around the world; that women and children form a major segment of the population, particularly in dev eloping countries; that the health of mothers and children is closely interrelated; that a significant part of MCH morbidity, disability, and mortality stems from prev entable causes; and that women, infants, children of all ages, adolescemts, and families deserv e special services in order to assure their future health and dev elopment and that of the communities in which they liv e.Global Health\u2014PH 667Building on its strong foundation of know ledge, skills, and worldview of community health and development, the Global Health Department will incorporate the recommended competencies throughout the two-y ear MCH curriculum. The program will utilize family and community-centered interdisciplinary approaches with special emphases on cultural competency and empow erment. Graduates of this program will be able to effectiv ely apply their MCH skills and know ledge both in the developed and dev eloping world context. This concentration is designed to educate global public health professionals who will be capable of : 1.Planning, implementing, monitoring, and ev aluating maternal and child health programs nationally and globally. 2.Understanding, promoting, dev eloping, and applying national and international health policies and programs that impact maternal and child health issues. 3.Advocating for public health policies and programs to improv e maternal and child health. 4.Writing grant proposals to fund maternal and child health programs locally and internationally. 5.Preparing behavioral change communications materials in maternal and child health. 6.Conducting research on maternal and child health. Educational effectiv eness Educational effectiv eness will be determined through reading assignments and reports, research papers, oral presentations, group work on proposals, community engagement projects and research, laboratory exercises, case studies, tests, quizzes, field practicum, and exit interview.

They may be part of an ongoing research or policy project at the Univ ersity or in the community. Faculty maintains a research agenda and invites participants to join them in ongoing projects. It is anticipated that the research conducted by the program participants would coincide with the research interests of one or more faculty. Individuals who may benefit from the program Participants will be drawn primarily from public health; but they also will be drawn from health care, higher education, community-based organizations, and those working in public policy. This program is specifically designed for individuals interested in multidisciplinary approaches to problem solving and creating a healthier future. HEAL TH POLICY AND LEADERSHIP\u2014DR.P.H. DAVID S. PENNER, Program Director General description The current, rapidly changing leadership arena demands a div ersity of leadership talents to respond to the v aried challenges posed by the global community. Moreov er, creativ e approaches are needed to meet these challenges. The Doctor of Public Health degree in health policy and management at Loma Linda Univ ersity is a unique and wonderful opportunity to serv e at the v ery heart of leadership dev elopment. The primary focus of this program is to enhance the skills and abilities of those in positions of leadership; to add to the body of know ledge about leadership through observ ation, reflection, and research; and to bring together leaders who desire to learn, mentor, and model good leadership. This program, in part, meets the great need for leaders of integrity and understanding in both research and practice. Leadership talents cannot be taught, but they can be dev eloped and strengthened. The design of the program is to help individuals discov er their talents and strengths, imagine how they can be dev eloped, and then devise plans to increase and extend their skills and know ledge around those unique strengths. Description of the curriculum components Orientation Prior to admission to the doctoral program, each participant completes the orientation for leadership (12 units). Composed of three courses, this orientation includes time for assessing individual leadership strengths and academic potential, understanding personal leadership sty les and skills, exploring areas of future leadership dev elopment, and preparing academic plans. Admission to the orientation is limited to thirty per cohort. Admission to the degree is limited to nine-to-tw elve individuals per cohort. Admission to the orientation for leadership is not admission to the doctoral degree program. Academic plan During the orientation for leadership, each participant creates an individualized academic plan. This plan outlines the specific details for the participant's degree program. It includes elements such as a statement of goals, a record of past experience, the result of v arious leadership tests and assessments, a personal statement of vision of achiev ement by the end of the program (and beyond), and a specific plan of how the participant will demonstrate the eight areas of leadership competency. For each of the areas ofHealth Policy and Leadership\u2014PH 687competency, the participant indicates how that particular competency is to be achiev ed\u2014listing specific courses, strategic experiences, directed research, past experience, and/or other evidence to be presented as part of his/her portfolio. A request is also submitted at this time for academic advisors and research supervisors. The completed academic plan is presented as part of the application for admission to the doctoral program and must be approv ed by the program faculty before the participant is admitted to the doctoral program. Changes in the academic plan may be made during the program with approv al of the program faculty. Portfolio Achiev ement of competency is found in the evidence contained in the portfolio, not in attendance records or simply the completion of required course work. Based on the academic plan approv ed at the time of admission to the doctoral program, the participant assembles the portfolio throughout the program. The completed portfolio is presented at the end of the program as evidence that all areas of competency hav e been met and the requirements of the program satisfied. Academic courses Depending on specific needs outlined in the academic plan, participants choose from a v ariety of courses and mentored activities. Courses are av ailable in traditional classroom settings, online, or through directed study and mentored activities. Research project Throughout their program of study, participants are involv ed in research at v arious lev els. They may be part of an ongoing research project at the Univ ersity or elsewhere. The doctoral dissertation is an integrated part of the degree. Support Given the nature of the program and the discipline, interaction with many other persons is paramount. Leadership cannot be studied in isolation; collaboration is encouraged and modeled throughout the program. Since support and advisement is so critical, special emphasis is placed on academic support. Three examples follow. Faculty advisors and professional mentors. All participants hav e a primary academic advisor assigned from the core health policy and leadership faculty. In addition, participants may choose additional mentor(s) from beyond the department or Univ ersity. These mentors provide support and encouragement, as w ell as depth and expertise. Learning and study support groups. There are at least two specifically designed study groups. One group of fellow participants (three to fiv e) serv es as a creativ e force and idea exchange. The group meets on a regular basis to keep members of the group focused on completing the degree. Another group, created by each participant and formed of individuals primarily outside the program (fiv e to eight) creates an extended learning environment and helps to create/provide opportunities in which the participants can improv e and demonstrate their leadership skills. These learning groups include mentors, work colleagues, professional associates, and friends. Although not technically part of the health policy and leadership faculty, these groups nonetheless become extensions of the ethos and mission of the program. Yearly conferences. As professionals, all participants attend an annual health policy and leadership conference until the completion of their programs and may continue to do so afterw ard. These open conferences provide students opportunities to discuss current health policy and leadership issues, present688 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGscholarly papers, consult with academic advisors, report on their progress in the program, and meet with fellow participants for collaborativ e and networking activities. The first three conferences are taken for academic credit. Learning outcomes In addition to the eight Univ ersity learning outcomes, the Health Policy and Leadership Program has chosen fiv e additional learning outcomes. 1.Leadership: Participants understand a broad range of leadership issues and participate in future- oriented planning and change processes. 2.Health policy: Participants understand that health policy is a multidisciplinary field of inquiry and practice concerned with the deliv ery, quality, and costs of health and health care for individuals and populations. 3.Ethics: Participants demonstrate ethical choices, v alues, and professional practices implicit in their discipline and personal ethics. 4.Reflection: Participants model reflectiv e leadership. 5.Scholarship: Participants dev elop skills in reading, ev aluating, conducting, and reporting research. Areas of leadership competency and underlying themes In order to more clearly define the range of meaning and expectations for this program, eight areas of leadership competency and two underlying themes hav e been identified and elaborated. These form the framework in which the academic plan is dev eloped and the portfolio ev aluated. 1.Policy dev elopment and strategy: Participants understand the framework for policy dev elopment and explain how strategy is essential to achieving outcomes. 2.Systems thinking: Participants explore the dynamic interactions among human and social systems and seek to improv e the interrelated and interdependent relationships among individuals, groups, organizations, and communities. 3.Community building: Participants, in P eter Block's words, \"create hospitable space, invite collectiv e attention to what is important and make the group's intelligence visible to itself.\" 4.Understanding div ersity: Participants utilize leadership skills in bringing together a v ariety of persons, including those who are different from themselv es (age, gender, religion, work ethics, mind sty les, etc.) in a w ay that strengthens organizations/communities. 5.Leading change: In creating a supportiv e environment for the change, participants encourage creativity and innov ation and help bring about both individual and organizational change. 6.Effectiv e communication: Participants accept responsibility for and respond to finding appropriate avenues to communicate with a v ariety of audiences. 7.Conflict resolution : Participants, through careful deliberation, good listening and understanding, interest-based negotiation, and mutually beneficial collaboration, practice the fragile process of addressing conflict. 8.Management and gov ernance: Participants observ e, participate in, ev aluate the v arious sty les of management and gov ernance, and explore management strategies and gov ernance structures for the future.Health Policy and Leadership\u2014PH 689Integrated themes Wov en throughout the eight areas of competency, two themes elev ate the dev elopmental process and increase the v alue of the discussion within each area. While the areas of leadership competency are broadly found in many similar programs, the emphasis on ethics and scholarship makes this program particularly v aluable to those seeking to model leadership characterized by integrity and understanding. 1.Ethics\u2014V irtue and obligation: Participants demonstrate ethical choices, v alues, and professional practices implicit in their discipline and personal ethics. 2.Scholarship\u2014Research and reflection: Participants practice reflectiv e leadership and dev elop skills in reading, ev aluating, conducting, and reporting research. Educational effectiv eness Initial assessment The orientation for leadership begins with intense ev aluation and feedback as participants discov er and evaluate their talents, skills, and strengths. Each participant works closely with a program advisor to prepare an academic plan. This plan is ev aluated at the end of the orientation and must be approv ed by the program faculty before admission to the program. Annual progress reports and portfolio reviews Yearly progress reports and portfolio reviews are scheduled at the time of the annual conferences. The program advisor and other program faculty (two or three) meet with the participant to review the progress of the portfolio, consider any changes and/or additions to the academic plan, answ er questions, and giv e advice as necessary. These y early ev aluations should not be seen as isolated conv ersations but more as markers along the w ay in an ongoing dialogue with the program faculty. If unsatisfactory progress is being made, a letter of w arning is giv en following the review. Failure to achiev e satisfactory progress will result in the termination of the participant or in a hold being placed on his/her registration until the necessary progress is made. In all cases, a summary of the review will be included in the participant's portfolio. Faculty involv ement in learning groups The academic advisor meets regularly with the participant's mentors and support group to ev aluate portfolio progress and opportunities to enhance the learning experience. The frequency of these meetings will v ary, depending on the specific activities related to the demonstration of competency. It is anticipated that much of this will be done in the first three or four y ears of the degree. Notes on these meetings will be included in the participant's portfolio. Progress through dissertation Involv ement in research and reflection is encouraged throughout the program. Already included in the academic plan is an outline of such activities to be completed during the degree program. It is anticipated that the academic advisor and participant will discuss the progress of topic dev elopment and formulation of dissertation proposal ev en within the first y ear. Research courses taken early in the program will also provide feedback on satisfactory progression in this area. Building on the existing School of Public Health's Dr.P.H. Handbook , a clear set of guidelines will be further dev eloped to apprise both the advisor690 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGand the participant of the steps required in taking the dissertation from topic to proposal, approv al, research, writing, and defense. The dissertation committee will ov ersee the progress of the dissertation to the point of satisfactory defense.

As a result, many courses contain a significant component of field application. Some courses consist of field practicum. But more importantly, the program is designed around \"taking learning to the workplace.\" As such, participants are expected to dev elop a learning environment at their place of work. The work in these learning groups will be ev aluated by the local work supervisor and the Univ ersity advisor and will be included in the final portfolio. Culminating experience Besides the dissertation defense, which is itself a major culminating experience, participants will present their portfolios at the end of the program. The portfolios are based on the academic plan and the eight areas of leadership competency, supported by evidence and v alidated as sections are completed, and assessed at the end of the program as the participants present them in the culminating degree activity. Research Throughout their program of study, participants are involv ed in research at v arious lev els. They may be part of an ongoing research project at the Univ ersity or elsewhere. The doctoral dissertation is an integrated part of the degree from the beginning of the degree program. Leadership faculty maintains a research agenda and invites participants to join them in ongoing projects. It is anticipated that the research conducted by the program participants will coincide with the research interests of one or more faculty. To support and encourage research, the program includes a faculty member whose task is to coordinate the research efforts of those enrolled in the program. Underscoring the importance of research, one of the underlying themes supporting the leadership competencies is scholarship. As such, participants will practice reflectiv e leadership; dev elop skills in reading, ev aluating, conducting, and reporting research; dev elop a habit for and practice in reflectiv e thinking and critical self-ev aluation in all areas of competency; analyze and ev aluate research published in professional journals in both qualitativ e and quantitativ e traditions in four or more areas of competency; present posters, professional papers and/or research findings at one or more professional conferences in two or more areas of competency; demonstrate the ability to conduct independent research at an adv anced lev el, from problem definition to research and oral defense, in at least one research tradition while addressing issues in one or more areas of competency; and participate in the dialogue of the discipline by submitting at least two articles for publication. Individuals who may benefit from the program Given the context of Loma Linda Univ ersity, participants will be drawn primarily from public health; but they will also be drawn from health care, higher education, NGOs, and faith-based CBOs that hav eHealth Policy and Leadership\u2014PH 693developed health initiativ es, and other related groups. T wo important requirements are that those admitted to the program will hav e had sufficient experience in the workplace (normally fiv e years or more) and that they are currently employ ed in an organization that is supportiv e of their degree program and unique requirements to dev elop a \"learning environment\" at TONST AD, Program Director LIFESTYLE MEDICINE\u2014M.P.H. In the Lifesty le Medicine Program, health professionals with relev ant clinical health professional degrees are empow ered to provide lifesty le change interv entions and promote healthy behaviors for patients with chronic diseases or patients at risk of chronic diseases, while understanding the population determinants of w ellness, health, and disease. The curriculum emphasizes interv entions based on scientific data and established behavioral and learning theories that promote individual and public health through the processes of education, health behavior change, and health promotion. It emphasizes that health professionals who are not physicians are not enabled to practice medicine when aw arded this degree. The curriculum focuses on teaching public health practice classes that are needed to possess core skills in public health, in ev aluating the scientific literature, and in understanding and applying the science of disease prev ention in the context of mind-body interaction. More practice-oriented classes teach the scientific basis and applications of exercise prescriptions, nutrition counseling, tobacco cessation and health behavior change techniques. Graduates may use their skills acquired in the program to enhance their current clinical know ledge and skills in medicine, nursing, clinical psychology, osteopathy, pharmacy, or other health professions. They are academically prepared to apply prev entiv e methodologies to chronic diseases and risk factors; conduct individual health assessments; provide medical lifesty le counseling; properly ev aluate and apply lifesty le medicine-related research findings, and lead and ev aluate health promotion projects. Course work for the Lifesty le Medicine program is currently offered as a 60-unit, predominantly on- campus program. Almost one-half of the total course work (up to 30 units) may be completed online. Students who hold a clinical health professional degree may apply to the program. Learner outcomes Graduates of the program in lifesty le medicine will: Possess a core field of know ledge of public health, with emphasis on the application of prev entiv e methodologies to chronic diseases. Accurately assess lifesty le-related risk factors for chronic diseases. Provide appropriate interv entions in regard to these risk factors, e.g., medical behavioral counseling in exercise, nutrition, and tobacco dependence. Evaluate and properly apply lifesty le medicine-related research findings. Provide leadership for and ev aluate community-based health-promotion projects.

SINGH, Program Director Tobacco consumption continues to be a major public health challenge, both globally and in the U.S.A. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 4.2 million deaths are attributable to tobacco use annually. In the U.S.A., more than 400,000 individuals (30 percent of cancer mortality) die from tobacco-related causes ev ery y ear. Although a v ariety of strategies are being used to address the tobacco use problem, there is a dearth of academic-based programs to educate health professionals who will function as effectiv e practitioners and researchers in tobacco-use prev ention and treatment. The program is offered as a combination of online courses, on-campus courses, and a mentored research project. The online course work on tobacco control epidemiology, prev ention and treatment is made possible through a grant from the Association of Schools of Public Health and the American Legacy Foundation. LEARNER OUTCOMES Upon completion of this certificate program, participants should be able to: 1.Design a surv ey with population-based v ariables pertinent to tobacco policy that measures prev alence of tobacco use, know ledge and attitudes about tobacco use, and health behaviors associated with tobacco use. 2.Conduct qualitativ e studies with population-based v ariables pertinent to tobacco policy that assess tobacco use; know ledge and attitudes about tobacco use, and health behaviors associated with tobacco use. 3.Design research programs to establish a national and regional baseline and subsequent compliance with conditions set forth by the Framework Conv ention on Tobacco Control Treaty (WHO) and NPOWER initiativ e (WHO). 4.Interpret the findings from qualitativ e and quantitativ e research on tobacco use for the purpose of planning tobacco prev ention and cessation programs. 5.Write focused grant proposals for tobacco control research. 6.Prepare reports of original research in tobacco control research. 7.Be familiar with the authoritativ e sources of national and global tobacco control data on the Internet and in the published literature (scientific, policy, gov ernmental). EDUCA TIONAL EFFECTIVENESS Educational effectiv eness will be determined through reading assignments and reports, research papers, oral presentations, group work on proposals, community engagement projects and research, laboratory exercises, case studies, tests, quizzes, field practicum, and exit interview.

The School of Religion has three degree programs that associate areas in the sciences with religion. But the major task of the School of Religion remains enriching programs in the other sev en schools of the Univ ersity with a faith-based, wholistic approach to the health sciences. So, in whatev er program you hav e enrolled, you will come in contact with School of Religion offerings that hav e been uniquely designed to help you prepare for wholistic ministry within your chosen profession. Studying at Loma Linda Univ ersity is about more than just careers and professions; it is about mission and purpose for all of life. The School of Religion is pleased to hav e an important role in helping to prepare you for the most fulfilling life and career possible. Detailed information about our three master's degrees in religion is contained in this section of the Catalog. These programs hav e been designed to specifically equip graduates with skills in clinical ministry, bioethics, and religion and the sciences. How ever, within the framework of our academic programs, w e also offer a unique opportunity for LLU students in other professional programs to apply for dual enrollment in either bioethics or clinical ministry. Students enrolled in dentistry (D.D.S.), marital and family therapy (M.S.), medicine (M.D.), nursing (M.S.), psychology (Psy.D. or Ph.D.), and social policy and social research (M.A.) are eligible to apply for admission to the master's degree in either the Bioethics or Clinical Ministry program. P lease refer to The Combined Degrees Programs of the Univ ersity section to learn more about our dual enrollment degree programs. On behalf of the faculty and staff of the School of Religion, let me personally invite you to seriously consider the courses and the programs that w e offer. W e can help strengthen your faith; broaden your spiritual and academic horizons; enhance your ability to serv e; and prepare you not only for this life, but also for eternity. May God enrich your studies, Jon P aulien, Ph.D. Dean, School of ReligionDean's W elcome 735School Foundations Y In the configuration of Loma Linda Univ ersity as a health sciences univ ersity, the role of religion as integrativ e in each of the programs of the Univ ersity is mandated and continuously affirmed by the Univ ersity administration and the Board of Trustees. In July of 1990, the Faculty of Religion (now the School of Religion) w as established to assist in this integration. PHILOSOPHY As implied by its motto, \"To make man whole,\" the Univ ersity affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the Creator and Sustainer of the univ erse. Mankind's fullest dev elopment entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious v alues, benefits the individual and society and adv ances the ministry of the Sev enth-day Adv entist Church. MISSION ST ATEMENT The School of Religion is committed to the following four tasks, as informed by the teachings and practice of the Sev enth-day Adv entist heritage and mission: 1.To promote Christian wholeness for faculty and students in their personal and professional liv es and witness. 2.To provide a religion curriculum with the following emphases: Theological studies (biblical, historical, doctrinal, mission, and philosophical). Ethical studies. Relational studies (applied theology, clinical ministry, and psychology of religion). 3.To foster and support research in theological, ethical, and relational disciplines. 4.To serv e the Univ ersity, the church, and the larger world community by personal involv ement in fostering deeper spirituality, theological integrity, and social justice.736 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGGeneral Regulations Students of the Univ ersity are responsible for informing themselv es of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation.

Scholars in the natural sciences, the human sciences, and numerous applied sciences recognize the importance of examining religion from their particular perspectiv es. And religion scholars appreciate the importance of the questions that the methods and conclusions of the sciences raise for religious belief and practice. As a Sev enth-day Adv entist health sciences univ ersity, Loma Linda Univ rests on the conviction that there is a positiv e relation betw een religion and the sciences. Its commitment to a v ariety of health professional programs reflects the belief that the natural world is God's good creation, and that human beings are inherently part of the physical order of things. Its commitment to higher education, including various av enues of graduate study, expresses the belief that all truth is God's truth; and that the acquisition of truth calls for the diligent application of all our pow ers. These convictions support the attempt to bring scientific know ledge within the ov erarching perspectiv e of Christian faith. The Master of Arts degree in religion and the sciences is designed for sev eral types of students: those who w ant a degree in religion and science before pursuing further graduate work in one or the other of these areas; graduate students in the natural and social sciences who would like to combine their other academic interests with a serious study of religion; students in professional programs who also hav e an interest in the area of religion and science; and individuals who wish to explore the interface of religion and the sciences within the context of serious academic work. The Religion and the Sciences Program is administered by the School of Religion. It draws on resources from v arious sectors of the campus, including the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences faculty of the School of Science and T echnology; the Department of Psychology faculty of the School of Science and Technology; and other faculties in the Univ ersity, as w ell as other scholars and professors with expertise in the area. Upon completion of the Religion and the Sciences Program, students will demonstrate: 1.A know ledge of the research methods of religious studies and at least one branch of the natural and human sciences. 2.An understanding of the contrasting and complementary aspects of scientific inquiry and religion experience. 3.The ability to bring into critical conv ersation the theoretical foundations of science and philosophical perspectiv es on religion. 4.Critical thinking in the areas of religious and scientific inquiry. 5.The ability to contribute to the field of religion and the sciences in the areas of research and writing. 6.An understanding of the relation of wholeness and v alues to one's scholarship in the area of religion and the sciences.750 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGADMISSION In addition to meeting admission requirements for the School of Religion, the applicant to the Religion and the Sciences Program must: 1.Propose clear personal and professional goals and w ays in which the Religion and the Sciences Program may facilitate the realization of those goals. 2.Persuade the Admissions Committee, by previous accomplishments, that s/he is able and willing to reach these goals and to make a significant contribution to the field.

HYMAN, Program Director HEAL TH CARE HUMANITIES: The humanities encourage an anthropological dig into that which explains, depicts, shapes, and calls on us to be human. They are our histories; our stories \"liv ed\"; our cultural, social, religious identities. The humanities define us \"human.\" For more than fifty y ears, Loma Linda Univ ersity has officially prized \"wholeness.\" Because of the specialized nature of Loma Linda Univ ersity's curricula, a humanities component of the health-related professional programs is important to realize the univ ersity's motto, \"To make man whole.\" Health care and research are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, and only a breadth of integrated know ledge adequately prepares tomorrow's leaders. Loma Linda Univ ersity alumni will influence and be influenced by a complex society; a disciplined study of the humanities is no luxury. In light of the foregoing considerations, the Board of Trustees voted in December 2006 to establish a Humanities Program within the School of Religion. The goal is to establish a core of humanities scholars, beginning with one professor each in literature and in history, who will teach humanities courses and develop innov ative means to enhance the humanities ethos on campus. Loma Linda Univ ersity's Humanities Program has two emphases: undergraduate and professional education. Undergraduate. The Humanities Program for undergraduates largely builds on the humanities course work that students bring from prior college enrollment. Additionally, the Univ ersity is now searching for the ideal w ay to meaningfully embed the humanities within students' ongoing professional studies. Ideas that are being explored include: (a) a new capstone academic course in which students examine their personal and professional v alues; (b) a wholeness portfolio that requires students to explore the integration of personal v alues, societal needs, and professional aspirations; and (c) a medical humanities certificate. The Humanities Program furthers Loma Linda Univ ersity's educational objectiv es: Values-based education Critical thinking skills Effectiv e communication Contribution of the humanities and the arts to society Lifelong learning Human wholeness Professional. The impact of the Humanities Program on professional education is largely outside the classroom\u2014lectures, workshops, film discussions, and brown bag sessions. These experiences are important in themselv es, and the humanities faculty will greatly strengthen this aspect of campus life. The Univ ersity also envisions honors programs that will require instructor-led integrativ e discussions\u2014often supplemented with assigned reading. Discussion has begun with v arious schools of the Univ ersity regarding the dev elopment of honors programs that focus on demonstrated excellence in one's specialized field of study, as w ell as integration of that know ledge with at least one humanities discipline (e.g., history, literature, religion).Division of Humanities 753School of Science and T echnology Dean's W elcome School Foundations Philosophy Objectiv es Application and Admissions Application and acceptance Application procedure Acceptance procedure Admission requirements Scholarship Graduate Record Examination Re-entrance English competence From master's to Ph.D. degree Bypassing master's degree Second master's degree Concurrent admission Combined degrees Certificate programs MASTER OF ARTS/MASTER OF SCIENCE/ MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK Advisor and guidance committee Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Study plan Time limit Residence Minimum required grade-point average Professional performance probation Comprehensiv e and final examinations Research competence Thesis Candidacy Specific program requirements Religion requirement Combined degrees programs THESIS AND DISSERT ATION Format guide BindingDOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Advisor and guidance committee Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Study plan Time limit Residence Minimum required grade-point average Clinical probation Scholarly competence Comprehensiv e examinations The final oral examination Project Dissertation Candidacy Specific program requirements Religion requirement COMBINED DEGREES PROGRAMS Student Life Academic Information Conditions of registration, residence, attendance Academic residence Transfer credits Academic probation Financial information Schedule of charges (2011-2012) Programs, Degrees, and Certificates Offered Biology Case Management Child Life Specialist Clinical Mediation Counseling Criminal Justice Drug and Alcohol Counseling Earth Science Environmental Sciences Family Counseling Family Life Education754 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGFamily Studies Geology Gerontology Health Professions Education Marital and Family Therapy Natural SciencesProgram Ev aluation and Research Psychology School Counseling Social Policy and Social Research Social Work Social Work, ClinicalSchool of Science and T echnology 755Dean's W elcome We're glad you hav e chosen to consider Loma Linda Univ ersity's School of Science and T echnology as you make plans to continue your educational goals. This Catalog describes who w e are and what w e hav e to offer. It will familiarize you with the philosophy and structure of our programs, and will provide you with a listing of the participating faculty. Loma Linda is a religious, nonprofit institution that w elcomes students and staff from a broad spectrum of religious persuasions while reserving the right to give preference to qualified members of its sponsoring denomination. As stated in its nondiscrimination policy, the institution \"affirms that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and they should so be regarded by all people.\" Since sev eral of the professions\u2014for which programs within the School of Science and T echnology (SST) prepare students\u2014hav e a tradition of advocacy for oppressed peoples, it is important that the institution, faculty, and staff demonstrate their acceptance of and willingness to assist those in our society who are less privileged. The Univ ersity activ ely sponsors sev eral programs that mov e the institutional health care personnel resources and expertise into the local, national, and international communities to work with otherwise underserv ed populations. This component of service is an integral part of the statement of mission and a message intended to be captured in the Good Samaritan sculpture that occupies a central position on the campus. The School of Science and T echnology, as part of the Univ ersity, has expectations of students, faculty, and staff in the areas of conduct and behavior while they are on campus or involv ed in school or Univ ersity activities. The school does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, age, ethnic or national origin, or handicap. Enrollment of students in SST programs is not conditioned on their political or sexual orientation; in these areas, the school's policy is directed tow ards conduct or disruptiv e behavior, not orientation. In support of this position, w e expect our students, faculty, and staff to demonstrate unw avering respect for the div ersity of others and to interact with integrity\u2014nev er forgetting the standards that guide professional actions. Further, w e expect our programs through their faculty to dev elop competent, compassionate, ethical professionals who possess the know ledge, skills, and v alues to equip them for a life dedicated to service to all those in need\u2014regardless of their lifesty les. You will find vigorous academic programs that will stretch your mind as you take time to make new discov eries, get to understand our world, and apply Christ-centered v alues to your life and profession. Our administrators, faculty, and staff are here to work with you and help you prepare for your future as a caring, Christian professional in the world of service to mankind.

Dean, School of Science and T echnology756 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGSchool Foundations The School of Science and T echnology (SST)\u2014one of Loma Linda Univ ersity's new est schools\u2014includes the Departments of Earth and Biological Sciences, Counseling and Family Sciences, Psychology, and Social Work and Social Ecology. Many of the programs offered hav e matured on campus for a decade or more; one program w as established half a century ago. The school offers degree programs through the doctoral lev el and postdegree certificates, as w ell as courses that meet the Univ ersity's general education requirements. T echnology programs, such as e-Health T echnology, are currently being developed by the school. PHILOSOPHY The School of Science and T echnology is mission driv en and academically incorporates the Univ ersity's commitment to the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ, which produces wholeness within transformed liv es. Transformation is a lifelong faith-and-learning process\u2014a process committed to pursuit of the highest lev els of scholarship, professionalism, and spiritual w ell-being. This pursuit seeks to understand and promote healthy minds, communities, social systems, families, and the environment. Wholeness for self and for others is central to a balance betw een mind, body, and spirit. Such wholeness manifests itself in a life of service to humanity, to the environment, and to God. The School of Science and T echnology v alues the time-honored and separate traditions in higher education for \"academic\" and \"professional\" programs; and it advocates the integration of know ledge and research, blending the \"pure\" with the \"applied\" sciences.School Foundations 757In the School of Science and T echnology of Loma Linda Univ ersity, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this quest is serv ed by know ledge, graduate students are obliged to achiev e both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which know ledge is created and transformed into wisdom. OBJECTIVES The School of Science and T echnology attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of know ledge and meaning by: 1.Making av ailable to graduate students who wish to study in a Sev enth-day Adv entist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2.Encouraging dev elopment of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3.Relating intellectual achiev ement to the service of humankind.758 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGApplication and Admissions APPLICA TION AND ACCEPT ANCE Application procedure 1.The application instructions, av ailable on the W eb at < llu.edu/central/apply >, allow students to apply online and begin an application.

UNDERGRADUA TE PROGRAMS Admission requirements High school graduation requirement Students applying to Loma Linda Univ ersity after finishing high school are required to furnish an official transcript as evidence of completion of high school. A high school G.P.A. of at least 2.5 (on a 4-point scale) is expected for admission to Loma Linda Univ ersity undergraduate programs. Students transferring to Loma Linda Univ ersity after completing some course work at another college or univ ersity are also required to furnish transcripts for all of these courses. A minimum grade of C (2.0) is required for all college transfer courses, unless otherwise specified in specific program requirements. An ov erall college G.P.A. of at least 2.5 to 3.0 is expected, depending on the program to which the student applies.Application and Admissions 759Transcripts Transcripts are accepted only when sent directly to the Univ ersity Records office by the issuing institution. Transcripts receiv ed by LLU become the property of the Univ ersity and will not be released to the student or forw arded to any other institution upon request of the student. Undergraduate degree requirements The requirements for an undergraduate degree consist of (1) general studies courses\u201468 units, a portion of which may be met by the student's major; (2) the courses required for the specific undergraduate major or degree program; and (3) general electiv e courses. General studies requirements Domain 1: Spiritual and Cultural Heritage (28-32 quarter units) Spiritual Heritage (16) A minimum of 4 units for each y ear the student is enrolled in a Sev enth-day Adv entist college or univ ersity.

Domain 5: General Studies Electiv es Electiv es from the foregoing subjects may be chosen to complete the 68 units.760 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGMajor field and cognate requirements These requirements are described under each program in this CA TALOG. They consist of the courses in the major field, as w ell as cognates\u2014which are supporting courses in a different field that are required for the degree. Minor field A minor is an area outside of the student's major field, in which the student takes enough courses to acquire a basic introduction to the subject. Each program defines the minor subjects requirements. Minimum required grades The minimum required grade is C for courses that apply tow ards the undergraduate degree. GRADUA TE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Admission requirements A four-y ear baccalaureate degree (or its equiv alent) from an accredited college or univ ersity is a prerequisite for admission to the School of Science and T echnology's graduate programs. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some v ariation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the applicant should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies may be fulfilled while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to matriculation. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade point av erage of B (3.0) or better in the ov erall program and in the major field. Depending on program-specific criteria, some students with an ov erall grade-point av erage betw een 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades of the junior and senior y ears are superior or there is other evidence of capability. Graduate Record Examination Scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required with application for admission to many degree programs. New test scores are needed if it has been more than fiv e years since the last test w as taken. Applicants are advised to request information specific to their proposed program of study. For complete information about the GRE, please visit their W eb site at < ets.org/gre >; or write to Educational T esting Service, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, CA 94701 (for the W est); and P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541 (for the East). For GRE publications (including study materials), call 800/537-3160. Programs that do not require the GRE must submit one additional measure of a candidate's preparation for graduate study. This may be either an ev aluation of critical essay-writing skills, the Miller Analogies T est, the results of a structured interview, or other specified program criteria. Re-entrance Students who are currently enrolled in the School of Science and T echnology may request transfer to a different program or a more adv anced degree lev el by contacting the School of Science and T echnology Admissions Office for information on an abbreviated application and instructions for submitting the appropriate supporting documents. Transcripts on file with the Univ ersity are acceptable.Application and Admissions 761English-language competence All international students are encouraged (particularly those who do not hav e an adequate score on TOEFL or MTELP or other evidence of English proficiency) to attend an intensiv e American Language Institute prior to entering their program, because further study of English may be required to assure academic progress. FROM MASTER'S TO PH.D. DEGREE Bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this Univ ersity may proceed first to a master's degree. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this intention should be declared ev en if the first objectiv e is a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree program a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree, an abbreviated application should be completed and submitted, along with appropriate supporting documents, to the School of Science and T echnology Admissions Office. If the aw ard of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embarking on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that hav e been completed in the appropriate field and are of equiv alent quality and scope to his/ her doctoral program. Second master's degree A student who wishes to qualify for an additional master's degree in a different discipline may apply. The dean of the School of Science and T echnology and the faculty of the program the student wishes to enter will consider such a request on its individual merits. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Science and T echnology program while admitted to another program at this Univ ersity or elsewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined degrees programs discussed in the next paragraph. Combined degrees Students may not be admitted to a School of Science and T echnology program while admitted to another program at this Univ ersity or elsewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined degrees programs. CERTIFICA TE PROGRAMS The School of Science and T echnology offers sev eral postbaccalaureate certificate programs. Students accepted into such programs will be assigned to an advisor who will work with them as they fulfill the program requirements. Students will be required to maintain a B- (2.7) grade point av erage, with no course grade below C (2.0). All certificate students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course (numbered betw een 500 and 600).762 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGMASTER OF ARTS/MASTER OF SCIENCE/MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK Advisor and guidance committee Each student accepted into a degree program is assigned an advisor who helps arrange the program of study to meet Univ ersity requirements; subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. This committee is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging courses, screening thesis topics (where applicable), guiding research, administering final written and/or oral examinations, ev aluating the thesis and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receiv e the degree, and ultimately recommending the student for graduation. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achiev ement will be identified by subject and classified either as prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking certain subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the master's degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda Univ ersity or elsewhere) and acceptable grades are reported. How ever, subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but these must be remov ed as specified by the advisor or dean, usually during the first full quarter of study at this Univ ersity. Study plan The student's advisor should dev elop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This will serv e as a guide to both the student and the advisor as w ell as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of all required courses. Time limit The time allow ed from admission to the School of Science and T echnology to conferring of the master's degree may not exceed fiv e years. Some consideration may be giv en to a short extension of time if, in the dean's opinion, such is merited. Course credit allow ed tow ard the master's degree is nullified sev en years from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may be rev alidated, upon successful petition, through reading, conferences, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. Residence Students must meet the residence requirements indicated for their particular program (nev er less than one academic quarter ). The master's degree candidate must complete one quarter of full-time study at the Univ ersity or perform the thesis research at the Univ ersity. Although the number of units students take varies by program, students are expected to work closely with their advisors to assure that their course loads are consistent with program requirements, as w ell as degree completion options and timelines. Minimum required grade point av erage The required minimum grade point av erage is B (3.0) on all work for the master's degree. This av erage must be maintained in formal courses and in research, computed separately. A student submittingApplication and Admissions 763transfer credits must earn a B grade on all work accepted for transfer and on all work taken at this Univ ersity, computed separately. In some cases, programs hav e specified higher or additional requirements. Students should consult with their particular program of study. Professional performance probation Applied professional programs may recommend that the student be placed on professional performance probation. Details are contained in program guides for the programs concerned. Comprehensiv e and final examinations The student must take the written, oral, and final examinations prescribed by the program on or before the published dates. If a candidate fails to pass the oral or written examination for a graduate degree, the committee files a written analysis of the candidate's status with the dean, with recommendations regarding the student's future relation to the school. The student receiv es a copy of the committee's recommendation. Research competence Student skills required in research, language, inv estigation, and computation are specified in each program description in this CA TALOG. Thesis Students writing a thesis must register for at least 1 unit of thesis credit. The research and thesis preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approv al of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approv al must be secured before petition is made for candidacy. The student must register and pay tuition for thesis credit, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been adv anced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and thesis, continuous registration is to be maintained until the manuscript has been accepted. This involv es a quarterly enrollment fee paid at the beginning of each quarter. Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and T echnology or designation of regular graduate standing does not constitute admission of the student to candidacy for a graduate degree. After achieving regular status, admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Science and T echnology Form A ) from the student to the dean, on recommendation of the student's advisor and the program coordinator or department chair. Students petitioning the School of Science and T echnology for candidacy for the master's degree must present a satisfactory grade record, include a statement of the proposed thesis or dissertation topic (where applicable) that has been approv ed by the student's guidance committee, and note any other qualification prescribed by the program. Students are usually adv anced to candidacy during the third quarter after entering their course of study tow ard a degree in the School of Science and T echnology. Specific program requirements In addition to the foregoing, the student is subject to the requirements stated in the section of the CATALOG gov erning the specific program chosen.764 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGReligion requirement All master's degree students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course (courses numbered betw een 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specific guidelines. Combined degrees programs A number of combined degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide more comprehensiv e preparation in clinical applications and the biomedical sciences. Concurrent admission to two programs in the School of Science and T echnology or to a program in the School of Science and T echnology and to a professional school in the Univ ersity is required. These curricula are described in greater detail under the heading \"Combined Degrees Programs\" in this section of the CA TALOG. THESIS AND DISSERT ATION The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approv al of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approv al must be secured before petition is made for adv ancement to candidacy. Format guide Instructions for the preparation and format of the publishable paper, thesis, or dissertation are in the \"Thesis and Dissertation Format Guide,\" av ailable through the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor. Consultation with the dissertation editor can help the student avoid formatting errors that would require him/her to retype large sections of manuscript. The last day for submitting copies to the school office in final approv ed form is published in the ev ents calendar (av ailable from the academic dean's office). Binding The cost of binding copies of the thesis or dissertation to be deposited in the Univ ersity library and appropriate department or school collection will be paid for by the student's department. The student will be responsible for paying the cost of binding additional personal copies. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy degree is aw arded for evidence of mature scholarship, productiv e promise; and activ e aw areness of the history, resources, and demands of a specialized field. Advisor and guidance committee Each student, upon acceptance into a degree program, is assigned an advisor who helps arrange the study program. Subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. The School of Science and T echnology requires advisors for Doctor of Philosophy degree candidates to hav e demonstrated scholarship productivity in their chosen disciplines. Each program maintains a list of qualified doctoral degree mentors. The guidance committee, usually chaired by the advisor, is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging course sequences, screening dissertation topics, recommending candidacy, guiding research, administering written and oral examinations, ev aluating the dissertation/project and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receiv e the degree, and recommending the student for graduation.Application and Admissions 765Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achiev ement will be identified by subjects and classified as either prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the Ph.D. degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda Univ ersity or elsewhere) with acceptable grades. Subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but they must be remov ed as specified by the advisor or dean, usually at the beginning of the graduate experience at this Univ ersity. Study plan The student's advisor should dev elop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This serv es as a guide to both the student and the advisor, as w ell as to members of the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of required courses. Time limit Completion of the graduate experience signals currency and competence in the discipline. The dynamic nature of the biological sciences makes dilatory or ev en leisurely pursuit of the degree unacceptable. Seven years are allow ed for completion after admission to the Ph.D. degree program. Extension of time may be granted on petition if recommended by the guidance committee to the dean of the School of Science and T echnology. Course credit allow ed tow ard the doctorate is nullified eight y ears from the date of course completion. To assure currency in the content, nullified courses may be rev alidated\u2014upon successful petition\u2014through reading, conference, written reports, or examination. Residence The School of Science and T echnology requires two y ears of residency for the doctoral degrees\u2014D.M.F.T , Psy.D., Ph.D.\u2014spent on the campus of the Univ ersity after enrollment in a doctoral degree program. During residence, students devote full time to graduate activity in courses, research, or a combination of these. A full load of courses is 8 or more units each quarter; 36 or more clock hours per week is full time in research. Students may be advised to pursue studies for limited periods at special facilities not av ailable at Loma Linda Univ ersity. Such time may be considered residence if the arrangement is approv ed in adv ance by the dean of the School of Science and T echnology. The spirit and demands of doctoral degree study require full-time devotion to courses, research, reading, and reflection. But neither the passage of time nor preoccupation with study assures success. Evidence of high scholarship and original contribution to the field or professional competence form the basis for determining the aw arding of the degree. Minimum required grade point av erage Students must maintain a grade point av erage of at least a B (3.0) to continue in regular standing toward the doctorate. This av erage is to be computed separately for courses and research. Courses in which a student earns a grade betw een C (2.0) and B (3.0) may or may not apply tow ard the degree, at the discretion of the guidance committee. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B av erage on all work accepted for transfer credit and on all work taken at this Univ ersity, computed separately.766 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGProfessional performance probation Applied professional programs may recommend that the student be placed on professional performance probation. Details are contained in the program guides for the programs concerned. Scholarly competence Doctoral degree students demonstrate competency in scholarship along with research and professional development. Expectations and standards of achiev ement with the tools of inv estigation, natural and synthetic languages, and computers are specified in this section of the CA TALOG for each program. Comprehensiv e examinations The doctoral degree candidate is required to take comprehensiv e written and oral examinations ov er the principal areas of study to ascertain capacity for independent, productiv e, scientific work; and to determine whether further courses are required before the final y ear of preparation for the doctorate is undertaken. The program coordinator is responsible for arranging preparation and administration of the examination, as w ell as its ev aluation and subsequent reports of results. Success in the comprehensiv e examination is a prerequisite to candidacy (see below). Students cannot be admitted to the examination until they hav e: Demonstrated reading know ledge of one foreign language, if applicable; Completed the majority of units required beyond the master's degree or its equiv alent. The final oral examination After completion of the dissertation and not later than a month before the date of graduation, the doctoral degree candidate is required to appear before an examining committee for the final oral examination. If a candidate fails to pass this final examination for a graduate degree, the examining committee files a written analysis of the candidate's status with the dean, with recommendations about the student's future relation to the school. The student receiv es a copy of the committee's recommendation. Project (required for the Doctor of Psychology and Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy degrees) All Doctor of Psychology degree students must register for at least 1 unit of project credit. This should be done at the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and project preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approv al of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approv al must be secured before petition is made for adv ancement to candidacy. If the student has been adv anced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and project, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involv es a quarterly fee of $75 (2010-2011) to be paid during registration each quarter. A similar continuing registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Dissertation (required for the Doctor of Philosophy degree) All doctoral students must register for at least 1 unit of research credit. This should be done at the last quarter of registration prior to completion.Application and Admissions 767The research and dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approv al of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approv al must be secured before petition is made for adv ancement to candidacy. Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor can prev ent the student from committing formatting errors that would require retyping large sections of the manuscript. Students register and pay tuition for the dissertation, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student has been adv anced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and dissertation, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involv es a quarterly fee of $75 (2010-2011), to be paid during registration each quarter. A similar continuing registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Doctoral dissertations are reported to Univ ersity Microfilms International and to the National Opinion Research Center. The Faculty of Graduate Studies provides appropriate information and forms. Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and T echnology does not constitute candidacy for a graduate degree. Admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Science and T echnology Form A) from the student to the dean, with support from the student's advisor and the program chair. The student's petition for candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy degree will include confirmation that comprehensiv e written and oral examinations hav e been passed. Students expecting the aw ard of the doctorate at a June graduation should hav e achiev ed candidacy no later than the previous Nov ember 15. One full quarter must be allow ed betw een the achiev ement of candidacy and the quarter of completion. Specific program requirements Doctoral programs differ from each other. The unique program requirements appear in the programs section of this CA TALOG (Section III) and in the program guides av ailable from specific departments. Religion requirement All doctoral students should take at least three 3-unit religion courses (numbered betw een 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specific guidelines. COMBINED DEGREES PROGRAMS A number of combined degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide additional preparation in clinical, professional, or basic areas related to the student's field of interest. All require concurrent admission to the School of Science and T echnology and a professional school in the Univ ersity. The combined degrees programs provide opportunity for especially w ell-qualified and motiv ated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or inv estigation of problems of health and disease in man. For admission to a combined-degrees program, the student must hav e a baccalaureate degree; must qualify for admission to the School of Science and T echnology; and must already be admitted to the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, the School of Religion, or the School of Public Health. Application may be made at any point in the student's progress in the professional school, though it is usually made during the sophomore y ear. Students in this curriculum study tow ard the M.A., M.S., M.S.W ., Psy.D., or Ph.D. degree.768 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGStudents may be required to interrupt their professional study for two or more y ears (as needed) for courses and research for the graduate degree sought.

DEP ARTMENT The Child Life Specialist Program is housed in the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences\u2014along with the Counseling Program, the Family Studies Program, and the doctoral program in marital and family therapy. Mission statement Loma Linda Univ ersity's mission of whole person health care guides the faculty in working collaborativ ely with the purpose of transforming liv es through education, research, clinical training, and community service. Students are invited to join with faculty and staff in supporting the Univ ersity's values of compassion, integrity, excellence, freedom, justice, purity, and humility. These attributes are depicted by the Good Samaritan statue centrally located on the campus, which contrasts human indifference and ethnic pride with empathy and service. Amid the rich cultural heritage of this academic community, degrees offered in the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences are the foundation upon which to dev elop new and more nurturing w ays of being with others. Accreditation Loma Linda Univ ersity's academic programs are accredited by the W estern Association of Schools and Colleges (W ASC). THE CHILD LIFE PROFESSION Child life specialists are experts in the field of child dev elopment. They promote effectiv e coping through play, preparation, education, and self-expression activities. Child life specialists provide emotional support for families and encourage optimum dev elopment of children facing a broad range of challenging experiences, particularly those related to health care and hospitalization. Understanding that782 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGa child's w ell-being depends on the support of the family, child life specialists provide information, support, and guidance to parents, siblings, and other family members. They also play a vital role in educating caregiv ers, administrators, and the general public about the needs of children under stress (Child Life Council < childlife.org >). THE PROGRAM Certification for the child life profession Through the Child Life Council, the certified child life specialist (CCLS) credential w as dev eloped to increase the proficiency of child life professionals by identifying a body of know ledge, uniform and improv ed standards of practice, and ethical conduct while enhancing the status and credibility of the profession. The requirements for certification are based on academic and internship experience and successful completion of an examination process (Child Life Council < childlife.org >). Learning outcomes Upon graduation, students will: Demonstrate the ability to represent and communicate child life practice and psychosocial issues of infants, children, youth, and families. Be know ledgeable of child dev elopment and family systems theory. Demonstrate the ability to work collaborativ ely in div erse settings. Be eligible to obtain the certified child life specialist (CCLS) credential administered by the Child Life Council. Be know ledgeable of legal and ethical standards of the profession. Professional experience Students will participate in supervised clinical training at Loma Linda Univ ersity Children's Hospital and v arious hospitals located in California. A 100-hour practicum and 500-hour internship are required to complete the master's degree or certificate. These experiences will provide an opportunity to help students build on course work and put theory into practice.

FROYLANA HEREDIA-MILLER, Program Director FACUL TY A complete list of all part-time and voluntary faculty can be view ed on the department W eb site. Crime disrupts personal and community relationships, endangers public health and safety, and threatens the moral contours of ev eryday social life. Loma Linda Univ man whole,\" provides a pow erful and much-needed context in which criminal justice can be addressed on the basis of healing and restoration. The principles of restorativ e justice elev ate the dimensions of justice that promote the acceptance of responsibility, promote the fulfillment of obligations, embrace reconciliation, and culminate in the restoration of personal and social relationships. This multidisciplinary approach to deviance and the administration of justice takes into consideration the social, physical, and spiritual w ell-being of victims, offenders, and communities; and provides a deeper understanding of crime and the struggle of the modern criminal justice system. CRIMINAL JUSTICE\u2014M.S. Mission The mission of the Criminal Justice Program is to prepare students to think critically and analytically about the problems of crime and social control in contemporary society. Program objectiv es Students will demonstrate: The ability to integrate and utilize know ledge of social science and criminological theory in the application to problems of criminal justice. An understanding of the dimensions and causes of crime and delinquency. An understanding of the structure of the American criminal justice system. An understanding of the ethical principles that guide the concepts of justice and fairness within professional criminal justice practice. The ability to use empirically based research to analyze and critically ev aluate practice and criminal justice policy in order to effect system change. An understanding of div erse people and cultures as these interact with the criminal justice system. An understanding of the differences betw een retributiv e and restorativ e justice approaches in addressing the effects of crime. General ov erview The 48-quarter unit program begins with 26 units of core course work required for all students. Course work during the first y ear of study is divided into three professional areas of study, which include: criminal justice, religion, ethics, and social research methods. A t the end of the first y ear, students select their concentration area of policy, planning, and administration or forensic mental health\u2014each requiring 6 units of course work, plus 6 units of concentration-specific selectiv es.Criminal Justice\u2014ST 793To complete the program, the student has two options: 1.Nonthesis: Professional practica (540 hours of integrated practicum and seminar ), 1 unit of practica orientation, and 9 units of didactic selectiv es; OR 2.Thesis: 6 units of academic thesis and 4 units of didactic selectiv es. Concentration descriptions Policy and administration\u2014Students opting for the policy, planning, and administration concentration gain know ledge and skills in the public administration, planning, and coordination of gov ernmentally operated criminal and/or juv enile justice systems. Students acquire an appreciation for working with community entities to dev elop, coordinate, and ev aluate these systems in response to community needs. In addition, students dev elop an understanding of the policy-planning process and the role that criminal or juv enile justice planning councils perform in consensually revising or creating policies aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiv eness of criminal and juv enile justice systems. Forensic mental health\u2014Forensic mental health is a specialized branch of professional practice in which the clinical and criminal justice worlds ov erlap. Students choosing this area focus on the needs of individuals in the criminal or juv enile justice systems who hav e serious emotional disorders and/or severe mental illness, and may also present with co-occurring substance abuse. Students gain know ledge and skills in treatment programming within a forensic mental health framework. In addition, this context prepares students to assess and provide expert testimony regarding continued institutionalization v ersus readiness for outpatient psychosocial rehabilitation, including the dev elopment and implementation of assertiv e community treatment plans. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection about issues in criminal justice that will provide students with a deeper understanding of the logic influencing policy, administration, and practice issues affecting the field.

Leroy Leggitt Samuel Soret Seth W iafe The Department of Earth and Biological Sciences (EBS) in the School of Science and T echnology offers a program leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in environmental sciences (ENVS). This program builds upon a strong interdisciplinary breadth in natural, physical, and earth systems sciences to help understand the effect of human activities on environmental sustainability and management. In addition, since understanding the environment has become highly dependent on adv anced technology, students will learn to use marketable geospatial applications, such as: geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, computer systems modeling, and global positioning systems (GPS). These tools will help students address environmental problems, such as: climate change, biodiv ersity decline, groundw ater and soil contamination, use of natural resources, w aste management, sustainable dev elopment, and air and noise pollution. Students hav e a choice of adv anced expertise in one of the following concentration areas: conserv ation biology and biodiv ersity, environmental geology, or health geographics. Lastly, this program will encourage students to dev elop critical thinking skills, healthy lifesty les, and service- oriented attitudes that are necessary to dev elop effectiv e and ethical solutions to environmental problems on a local and global scale. LEARNING OUTCOMES Demonstrate breadth and depth of know ledge of earth's environment by understanding the dynamic and interdependent nature of each of earth's component systems (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere).806 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGDemonstrate the ability to critically ev aluate the relation of science and faith within an environmental context. Demonstrate written, technical, oral, and problem-solving skills necessary to collect, analyze, and share environmental data with scientific and public communities. Demonstrate aw areness of the professional and academic opportunities in the environmental science field, as w ell as know ledge of concurrent environmental science research. Obtain an understanding of the human and natural causes to some of Earth's environmental problems and learn how the environmental scientist addresses them. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS The B.S. degree student in the Environmental Sciences (ENVS) Program will generally take the first two years of required corequisite course work (96-105 units) at any accredited community college or univ ersity, and the last two y ears of the ENVS curriculum at Loma Linda Univ ersity. Also, students may obtain early entrance with the approv al of the Earth and Biological Sciences Department after completing at least 48 quarter units of corequisites at a college of their choice. Students accepted early will concurrently take course work at a nearby community college in order to complete their outstanding corequisite requirements. All students seeking admission into the Environmental Sciences Program must have a 2.5 G.P.A. and three letters of recommendation from faculty members at the institutions previously attended. SEMINAR A TTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS All students must register for and attend seminars each quarter while at Loma Linda Univ ersity. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES Career options in the field of environmental sciences are div erse and abundant. The Environmental Sciences Program prepares students for entry-lev el jobs in environmental sciences or GIS fields. Graduates may pursue jobs in the public sector through local, state, and federal agencies such as U.S. Fish and W ildlife Service, U.S. Geological Surv ey, and Department of Fish and Game. In the priv ate sector, graduates may seek jobs in environmental consulting firms, foundations, and organizations. Some examples of career paths that environmental science graduates pursue include environmental engineering, science and social policy; a wide v ariety of natural resources management fields, such as soil science, forestry, agriculture, w atershed science, range management, wildlife conserv ation, recreation resources, land management, and ecology; landscape architecture, conserv ation science, geographic information science (GIS), climatology, div erse health sciences; as w ell as public policy, law, or planning careers.

CARRIE ESKA Y, Program Director FACUL TY A complete list of part-time and voluntary faculty can be view ed on the department's W eb site. The population explosion of older adults has generated increasing interest in the field of gerontology. Gerontology is the multidisciplinary-multidimensional study of aging and aging processes. It combines the study of physical, mental, social, and spiritual changes that affect individuals as they age. Emphasis is placed on the know ledge and skills required for competent practice, with considerable attention giv en to understanding the social, cultural, and economic factors that affect services for this population. MISSION The mission of the Gerontology Program is to provide graduate lev el education for future and current professionals in gerontology who are dedicated to enhancing the liv es of older adults through adv anced interv entions at the micro, macro, and mezzo lev els of practice. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES Students will demonstrate the ability to integrate human behavior and dev elopmental theories of aging, incorporating a biopsychosocial-spiritual orientation to geriatric practice. Students will demonstrate the ability to use research in ev aluating the effectiv eness of practice and programs in achieving intended outcomes for older adults. Students will demonstrate the ability to integrate into practice an understanding of the life experiences and unique needs of older adults belonging to specific racial, ethnic, socioeconomic groups; of men and women; and of those with different sexual orientations. Students will demonstrate know ledge of professional ethics to assist older adults who hav e div erse cultural, spiritual, and ethnic v alues and beliefs. Students will demonstrate the ability to complete a comprehensiv e assessment of biopsychosocial- spiritual factors that affect older adults' w ell-being. Students will demonstrate know ledge of the policies that shape and regulate the continuum of care and services av ailable to older adults. Students will demonstrate know ledge of the importance of the current issues in gerontology and the importance of the relationship of gerontology to other disciplines and professions, such as social work, psychology, medicine, nursing, and public health. GENERAL OVER VIEW The 48-unit program begins with 26 units of core course work required for all students. Courses during the first y ear of study are divided into four professional areas: social science theory, religion and ethics, practice, and research methods. A t the end of the first y ear, the student selects a concentration area (policy, planning, and administration; or clinical services) requiring 14 units of concentration-specific course work.836 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGRegardless of the concentration students choose, they are giv en the option of either a thesis or a nonthesis (professional practicum). 1.Thesis: Students who choose the thesis option complete 6 research-related units and 4 units of selectiv es. 2.Nonthesis: Students choosing the internship option complete 1 unit of practical orientation, 540 hours of integrated practicum and seminar, and 9 units of didactic selectiv es. CONCENTRA TION DESCRIPTION Policy, planning, and administration : Students opting for the policy, planning, and administration concentration gain know ledge and skills in the public administration, planning, and coordination of services for older adults. Students acquire an appreciation for the unique policy and systems structure influencing the deliv ery of services to older adults. W ithin this framework, students dev elop an understanding of the issues and challenges in creating and sustaining responsiv e systems of care for older adults and their families. Clinical services : Students opting for the clinical services concentration dev elop know ledge and skills in locating and providing resources, services, and opportunities for older adults and their families; as w ell as acquiring know ledge that supports enhancing the problem-solving and coping skills of older adults and their caregiv ers. Students gain an appreciation for the social support factors and community systems that create opportunities or exacerbate problems in daily living. Students dev elop an understanding of the issues that impact the creation of effectiv e systems of care and responsiv e social policies. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection about the multidimensional issues in gerontology that will provide students with a deeper understanding of policy, administration, and practice issues affecting the field. PREREQUISTE A balance of course work in three liberal arts areas: Humanities (e.g., history, philosophy, literature, art, music, etc.) 20.0-24.0 English and Communication Skills (e.g., oral and written communication media, etc.) 9.0-13.0 Natural and Social Sciences (e.g., mathematics, human biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, human dev elopment, ethnic studies, economics, political science or government, etc.)24.0-32.0 Students not meeting the minimum number of units in any of the foregoing areas are required to complete additional course work prior to enrolling in the related M.S.W . degree classes.

DEP ARTMENT The Ph.D. degree in marital and family therapy and the D.M.F.T . (Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy) degree are two of the three doctoral degrees housed in the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences. The department also offers a Ph.D. degree in family studies; along with master's degrees in family therapy, child life, family studies, and counseling. Mission statement The Ph.D. degree curriculum in marital and family therapy and the D.M.F.T . degree curriculum are consistent with Loma Linda Univ ersity's vision of transforming liv es through whole person health care. The mission of these curricula is to bring health, healing, wholeness, and hope to individuals, families, and communities through education, research, clinical training, and community service. The Ph.D. degree curriculum accomplishes this by preparing scientist-practitioners who will adv ance the body of know ledge through which marital and family therapists promote the health and w ell-being of individuals, couples, families, and communities. The D.M.F.T . degree curriculum accomplishes this by focusing on dev eloping, ev aluating, and administering interv ention programs that benefit individuals, couples, families, and communities. The marriage and family therapy profession Marriage and family therapy is a distinct mental health profession based on the premise that relationships are fundamental to the health and w ell-being of individuals, families, and communities.

Child Life Specialist Certificate Clinical Mediation Certificate Drug and Alcohol Counseling Certificate Family Counseling Certificate Family Life Education Certificate Medical Family Therapy Certificate School Counseling Certificate: California Pupil P ersonnel Services Credential (PPS) (open to counseling and MFT students only) Core ideas guiding the marriage and family therapy doctoral programs Relational systems : People are best understood within the cultural, spiritual, and relational systems in which they are embedded. Change, therefore, occurs in the context of family, community, and interpersonal relationships. This program focuses on both the structured relational patterns of communication and interaction and on the systems of meaning that define and shape these patterns. Wholeness : The program encourages wholeness by attending to the physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of human experience. These dimensions reciprocally interact at ev ery lev el.850 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGSocial forces : The program is guided by a belief that social contexts and processes influence meanings, values, and people's understandings of self, family, and others. P articular emphasis is placed on: research focusing on social forces relev ant to the distinctiv e multicultural mix of families in the southern California region; the interrelationship betw een faith and family relationships throughout the world, and the effects of the changing health care system and of medical technology; as w ell as collaboration among education, family, work, and legal systems. Healing pow er of relationships : As people become more connected to each other and their communities, the potential for growth and healing are enhanced and the opportunity for making positiv e contributions maximized. Students are encouraged to dev elop their therapeutic relationship and community involv ement skills such that they can cocreate an environment of safety, respect, compassion, openness, and community participation. Diversity : Congruent with an appreciation of the importance of social forces is an interest in and respect for the div erse experiences and perceptions of human beings. Different social contexts\u2014such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and socioeconomic status\u2014result in a wide v ariety of meanings and behavior patterns in marriages, families, and intimate relationships. The program seeks to create a div erse mix of students and faculty, and to challenge all who are involv ed to learn from the richness of multiple perspectiv es. Empirical process : The program encourages clinical work and theory dev elopment grounded in an empirical understanding of human experience. Students are offered the opportunity to dev elop their capacities to utilize inductiv e and deductiv e reasoning; as w ell as objectivity, subjectivity, and intersubjectivity in therapy, program dev elopment, and ev aluation, and research. Education and prev ention : Connections at family, school, and community lev els are important components of resilience. The program emphasizes helping individuals and families access their relational competencies as an important part of prev ention, as w ell as the resolution of their current difficulties. Spirituality : This program sees spirituality as central to wholeness and healing. Students are encouraged to integrate their practices of faith with their professional work. The program places strong emphasis on activ e demonstration of moral and ethical principles as exemplified by, but not limited to, Judeo-Christian teachings. Worldwide focus : The mission of the program reaches beyond the local and national community to the international community. This includes collaboration with people from other nations and cultures to promote mutual understanding, resolv e problems, and strengthen families. MARIT AL AND F AMIL Y THERAPY\u2014PH.D.

Y acoub A complete list of part-time and voluntary faculty can be view ed on the department W eb site. The profession of social work centers on the improv ement of the quality of life for people and the enhancement of human potential for full, productiv e participation in society. W ith this philosophy at its core, the master's degree offered by the Social Work Program (M.S.W .) in the School of Science and Technology emphasizes an ecological perspectiv e that focuses on the interaction of a person or system in relation to his/her environment. Reflecting this stance is Loma Linda Univ ersity's motto, \"To make man whole\"; and its heritage as an international leader in the deliv ery of services in health care and related facilities. It is the combination of these influences that has guided the dev elopment of the foundation curriculum, professional concentrations, and selection of practicum sites for the Social Work Program. MISSION The mission of the Social Work program at Loma Linda Univ ersity is to provide graduate-lev el education that prepares competent, ethical, and compassionate social work professionals who possess the know ledge, v alues, attitudes, and skills necessary for a life dedicated to whole person care in adv anced practice and to leadership in behavioral health institutions and agencies. GOALS The goals of the Social Work Program (M.S.W . degree) are to: Provide a graduate curriculum that infuses the know ledge, ethics, v alues, and skills expected of professional social work practitioners.

ACCREDIT ATION The Social Work Program (M.S.W . degree) is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education to provide graduate-lev el social work education.Social Work\u2014ST 887PREREQUISITE A balance of course work in three liberal arts areas: Humanities (e.g., history, philosophy, literature, art, music, etc.) 20.0-24.0 English and Communication Skills (e.g., oral and written communication media, etc.) 9.0-13.0 Natural and Social Sciences (e.g., mathematics, human biology, physiology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, human dev elopment, ethnic studies, economics, political science or government, etc.)24.0-32.0 Students not meeting the minimum number of units in any of the foregoing areas are required to complete additional course work prior to enrolling in the related M.S.W . degree classes. Please note: All prerequisite requirements must be completed before adv ancement to candidacy (prior to beginning the adv anced curriculum). ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS Following are the admission requirements for the Social Work Program: Applicants must hav e a bachelor's degree from an accredited univ ersity or college (official transcripts are evidence of courses completed). The department assesses the liberal arts preparation of each of its applicants in the balance of course work, in three liberal arts (see Prerequisites). Applicants must submit a completed application\u2014including a personal statement, application fee, all college and/or univ ersity transcripts, and at least three letters of recommendation (one from an academic source and one from a work supervisor ). Applicants must meet the minimum academic and professional compatibility criteria established by the program. Applicants must hav e a cumulativ e grade point av erage of 3.0 or abov e (on a 4.0 scale). Special consideration may be giv en to applicants with grade point av erages as low as 2.85 if the last part of their college work shows significant improv ement. Applicants whose cumulativ e grade point average does not meet the minimum requirements stated abov e may receiv e further consideration for admission to the Social Work Program by providing a satisfactory GRE score, or two y ears of related employment and/or volunteer experiences. Work and volunteer experiences must be verified by employ er/supervisor statements on official agency stationery. Further consideration will also be giv en to individuals who provide evidence of additional certifications and/or training that illustrate commitment to a career in social work. Anyone who is admitted to the Social Work Program with a cumulativ e G.P.A. below 3.0 will be required to participate in individualized academic assessment and a targeted learning assistance program. Applicants must show evidence of professional compatibility, personal qualifications, and motiv ation to complete a graduate program by obtaining a passing score on the admissions interview with the department's admissions committee. Ev aluation criteria for the interview include: verbal communication skills, critical thinking ability, values congruent with the social work profession, appreciation of human div ersity,888 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGevidence of reflectiv e learning; and comportment. No academic credit is giv en for life experience or previous work experience for any part for the Social Work Program. CURRICULUM The 78-unit curriculum of the Social Work Program provides the mix of academic, experiential, and research experiences essential for M.S.W . degree students. Students must maintain a program grade point average of 3.0 (or a letter grade of B on a 4.0 scale) and meet the know ledge, skills, and professional performance competencies outlined by the program. The minimum acceptable grade for all courses is a B- (2.7). Courses with grades falling below the standards set for required and selectiv e courses must be repeated. Students are financially responsible for the cost of repeating courses in which grades obtained do not meet the minimum standards. GENERAL OVER VIEW The program begins with the professional foundation content (first-y ear courses) common to all graduate social work education. Courses during the first y ear of study are divided into fiv e professional areas: human behavior in a cross-cultural environment, social w elfare policy and services, practice theory and skills, social research, and field practicum. These fiv e areas are strengthened by the integration of social work v alues and ethics, as w ell as know ledge of special populations (i.e., issues of gender, race, class, disability, and oppression). The adv anced curriculum of the program is divided into four subdivisions: 1.Conjoining curriculum and processes\u2014further integrating the foundational first the program's adv anced curriculum; 2.Adv anced second-y ear students; 3.Core courses of the two concentrations\u2014clinical practice and policy, planning, and administration; and 4.Culminating curriculum and processes\u2014a capstone academic experience that facilitates the final stage of reflection and review in the dev elopment of the scholar-practitioner. Each of these four curricular subdivisions articulates through the progressiv e presentation and integration of know ledge, practice roles, and interv ention modes to dev elop the depth and breadth of proficiency expected in adv anced practice within health and mental health. PROGRAM OPTIONS Alternate program options hav e been designed to address the v arying needs of students. As such, the program offers a full-time, two-y ear option; a three-y four-y ear, AL TRANSFERS AND PRACTICUM ADV ANCED STANDING FOR B.S.W . STUDENTS Students who hav e receiv ed a B.S.W . degree from a CSWE-accredited program within the past fiv e years are supported in eliminating possible areas of redundancy in their education through (a) eligibility to transfer foundation course work and (b) consideration for practicum adv anced standing.Social Work\u2014ST 889These additional options for B.S.W . degree students recognize the accomplishments in know ledge and skills that individuals receiving a baccalaureate degree from an accredited social work program possess. As such, students are not admitted into the M.S.W . degree program with pre-approv al of course transfers or practicum adv anced standing. Instead, once students are accepted into either the full-time or one of the part-time options, those students meeting the designated degree requirements may apply for course transfers and ev aluation of their practicum adv anced standing. Receipt of course transfers and ev aluation of practice maturity are treated as separate processes, as described below. Students should contact the department for more information. TRANSFER STUDENTS Individuals transferring from other accredited M.S.W . degree programs may transfer units for didactic course work in accordance with Univ ersity policy and program guidelines. Field practicum experiences are nontransferable. PROFESSIONAL CONCENTRA TIONS IN BEHA VIORAL HEAL TH The Social Work Program offers two concentrations for professional practice, which are the focus of the second-y ear study: clinical practice; and policy, planning, and administration. Clinical practice concentration The clinical practice concentration requires mastery of adv anced practice roles, modalities of interv ention, and methods used in clinical social work. Study is required regarding the integration of advanced practice theories, diagnostic assessment, problem-solving skills and techniques; as w ell as the impact of policy upon the av ailability of treatment, treatment modalities, and expectation of outcomes. Students' experiences and know ledge are expanded through the selection of practicum sites and selectiv es. Policy, planning, and administration concentration The policy, planning, and administration concentration represents a specialized study designed to prepare students for administrativ e roles in behavioral health organizations and institutions. As such, this concentration focuses on giving students understanding and skills in establishing and maintaining systems of care to assist individuals, families, and groups managing health and illness in context of the life cycle, promoting social change in public systems of care, policy analysis, program planning and implementation, program ev aluation, and human resources management. Students' experiences and know ledge are expanded through the selection of practicum sites and selectiv es. CENTRAL ACADEMIC PROCESSES AND COGNA TES Professional practica Professional practica experiences (field practica) are regarded as an integral part of the Social Work Program because these offer students opportunities to integrate and apply theoretical and research know ledge with social work practice and interv ention skills in institutional or agency settings. Practica are designed (and selected) to provide maximum learning opportunities under the supervision of a qualified field instructor. As such, experiences are patterned to build upon one another\u2014presenting the increasing challenges present in the continuum of generalist to adv anced social work practice. Students complete 1,080 hours of field work in a qualified setting and 120 hours of concurrent integrated seminar for a total of 1,200 hours.890 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGThe emphasis of SOWK 757A,B,C Professional Foundation Practicum and Seminar (480 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar ) is on achieving generalist social work know ledge, v alues, and skills\u2014including dev eloping rapport with agency personnel and clients, acquiring interviewing skills, and obtaining beginning-lev el psychosocial assessment and interv ention capabilities. The content of the concurrent seminar further supports this perspectiv e as it provides students with opportunities to integrate their practicum experiences with their dev eloping professional identity. The emphasis of SOWK 787A,B,C Adv anced Professional Practicum and Seminar (600 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar ) reflects students' choice of concentration and provides the depth and breadth of learning opportunities that underpin the acquisition of adv anced practice capabilities. More specifically, adv anced professional practica experiences are expected to promote increased insight and understanding of agency and/or client systems as these build on the professional foundation skills achiev ed during the first y ear of study. Research The program includes completion of course work in applied research. An individually authored thesis option is av ailable for students meeting program criteria. These study options aim to dev elop know ledge for the adv ancement of social work practice and provide guided experiences in the conduct of research applicable to a v ariety of professional and academic settings. Guidelines for these options are provided by the program. PROFESSIONAL PROCESSES AND COGNA TES Three academic review processes take place during the first y ear of the Social Work Program. These are: 1.M.S.W an initial predictor used for gatekeeping. The first 12 units completed tow ard the M.S.W . degree, including units acquired during nonmatriculation, must be completed with a G.P.A. of 3.0. Students who fail to achiev e at this lev el may be dismissed from school. Students receiv e orientation to the process and requirements of the M.S.W . degree adv ancement G.P.A. during the student orientation conducted prior to the Fall Quarter. 2.Qualifying review When all foundation course work is completed, students are required to pass the program's qualifying review. The intent of this process is to: assist faculty and students in assessment of strengths and areas for improv ement, provide feedback, foster an environment of self-ev aluation, and encourage heightened participation in individualized academic dev elopment. Ultimately, the results of this review help both the student and faculty to dev elop learning objectiv es for the concentration y ear. A specific orientation is held to explain the expectations, format, and scheduling of the qualifying review process. 3.Wholeness portfolio All students complete a wholeness portfolio during the professional practicum and seminar experience. This review of the student's individualized objectiv es and professional dev elopmentSocial Work\u2014ST 891begins during the first y ear of study and culminates during the second y ear of study as the student completes the final quarter of SOWK 787A,B,C. This experience emphasizes the student's plans for employment, lifelong learning, and integration of the core v alues of Loma Linda Univ ersity; and is seen as a capstone academic experience that facilitates closure and the final stage of reflection and review in the dev elopment of the transitioning professional.

Director FACUL TY See Social Work M.S.W . The School of Science and T echnology's Department of Social Work and Social Ecology is an interdisciplinary academic unit committed to the Univ ersity's mission of human wholeness and to the belief that one's fullest dev elopment is achiev ed when all aspects of an individual's life are in balance. Both conceptually and pragmatically, the programs in the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology are guided by an ov erarching ecological (bio-psycho-social-spiritual) perspectiv e that employs scientific methods of problem analysis and program design. A key component in this framework is the importance of considering the relationships among behavioral, sociopolitical, economic, and environmental problems. The result is an interdisciplinary teaching, learning, and practice environment designed to create interv entions that will improv e the functions of individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. As such, priority has been giv en to creating an academic milieu favorable to educating competent, ethical, and compassionate professionals and scholars who are capable of respecting and addressing the needs of div erse populations. MISSION AND OBJECTIVES This doctoral program aims to provide social workers with adv anced know ledge to become researchers, educators, and clinicians capable of applying this know ledge to ev ery practice context in professional clinical social work. It purposefully instills a high appreciation for know ledge dev elopment and dissemination; and demonstrates respect and appreciation for the needs and issues inherent in human div ersity, promotion of social and economic justice, and at-risk clinical populations. LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1.Students will be able to apply multiple theoretical frameworks to explain intrapersonal and interpersonal factors underpinning the diagnosis and treatment of persons with sev ere mental illness and/or serious emotional disorders. 2.Students will demonstrate a comprehensiv e understanding of the assessment process and diagnostic schemata involving intrapersonal and interpersonal factors, cultural div ersity, and environmental influences on client systems and treatment. 3.Students will be able to demonstrate the use of theory to dev elop research questions and hypotheses for empirical testing, and will possess an understanding of the conceptual nature of theory and the w ays theory can be applied to the dev elopment of know ledge in clinical social work. 4.Students will be able to articulate the implications of empirical research findings within a theoretical framework, as w ell as the ability to discuss the implications of empirical research findings on theoretical relationships. 5.Students will demonstrate the ability to design and conduct a systematic, empirical, objectiv e, public, and critical inv estigation of a clinical practice issue or problem.896 UNIVERSITY CA TALOG6.Students will demonstrate a comprehensiv e understanding of how people learn and be able to translate this understanding into constructing and deliv ering appropriate didactic, interactiv e, and experiential teaching strategies used to teach adv anced clinical practice and human behavior concepts. 7.Students will demonstrate current know ledge of the context of social work education (know ledge, values, and skills); and be able to articulate this information into an educational program design, curriculum dev elopment, and the delineation and assessment of student educational objectiv es for both undergraduate and graduate social work programs. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS The Clinical Social Work Program is open to students who demonstrate leadership and scholarly potential. Admission to the program is gov erned by the policies and procedures established by the School of Science and T echnology.

Anthony J. Zuccarelli Dean, Faculty of Graduate StudiesDean's W elcome 901Foundations of Graduate Study Recognizing the need to provide adv anced education, the College of Medical Ev angelists (CME) organized its School of Graduate Studies in 1954. The new school conferred a Ph.D. degree in 1958, the first Ph.D. to be aw arded by a Sev enth-day Adv entist institution of higher education. In 1961 when CME became Loma Linda Univ ersity, the Univ ersity assumed ov ersight of the graduate education conducted by La Sierra College in Riv erside, California. By 1963, the School of Graduate Studies had been renamed the Graduate School\u2014with a home in a new building, named Frederick Griggs Hall in honor of a former department chair. The two campuses comprising Loma Linda Univ ersity\u2014La Sierra and Loma Linda\u2014w ere separated in 1990. In 2005, the Graduate School w as restructured as the Faculty of Graduate Studies. It continues to provide ov ersight of graduate programs, supported by other schools of the Univ ersity; promotes and encourages independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication; and relates intellectual achiev ements to the service of humankind. PHILOSOPHY In the Faculty of Graduate Studies of Loma Linda Univ ersity, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this quest is serv ed by know ledge, graduate students are obliged to achiev e both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which know ledge is augmented. OBJECTIVES The Faculty of Graduate Studies attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of know ledge and meaning by: 1.Making av ailable to graduate students who wish to study in a Sev enth-day Adv entist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2.Encouraging dev elopment of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3.Relating intellectual achiev ement to the service of humankind.902 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGGeneral Regulations Students of the Univ ersity are responsible for informing themselv es of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III giv es the general setting for the programs of each school. The subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs are also outlined in this section. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs (Section II). APPLICA TION AND ADMISSIONS The program admissions committees of the Univ ersity intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this Univ ersity. The admissions committees of the schools accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. SCHOLARSHIP Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade point av erage of B (3.0) or better in the ov erall program and in the major field. Some students with an ov erall grade point av erage betw een 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades during the junior and senior y ears are superior or other evidence of capability is av ailable. Foreign applicants are not eligible for provisional admission. FROM MASTER'S TO PH.D. DEGREE Bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this Univ ersity may proceed first to a master's degree program. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree program, this intention should be declared ev en if the first objectiv e is to earn a master's degree. If after admission to the master's degree program a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree program, an application form should be submitted, along with letters of reference, to the dean(s) of the respectiv e school(s). If the aw ard of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embarking on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that hav e been completed in the appropriate field, and that are of equiv alent quality and scope, to his/her doctoral program.General Regulations 903Student Life The information on student life contained in this CA TALOG is brief.

The Program The combined degrees program in Bioethics with Dentistry is designed to fit the schedule of D.D.S. students. Ethics in dentistry is w ell-established at Loma Linda Univ ersity. Loma Linda Univ ersity's School of Dentistry is one of a select few in the nation known for their expertise in ethical issues. How many additional course work units would an M.A./D.D.S. student take beyond the standard D.D.S. (262 units)? Answ er: 36 units. An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requres 48 units. How ever, the M.A./D.D.S. combined degrees student is able to accumulate 12 units in the following manner: 1.Eight (8) units from four courses in the dental curriculum are counted for bioethics M.A. degree credit: a) RELR 717: Div ersity and the Christian Health b) DNES 794: Public Health Dentistry, c) RELR 715: Christian Dentist in the Community, and d) DNES 851: The Dentist and the Law. Acceptance of these 2-unit courses for M.A. degree credit requires an integrativ e, supplemental eight-page paper that relates the courses' content to bioethics. 2.Four (4) units come from a) the deletion of RELE 734: Christian Ethics for Dentists from the combined degrees student's curriculum because its content is substantiv ely duplicated in the Bioethics Program, and b) the dental curriculum lists one 2-unit \"religion selectiv e\" that will now be taken in the bioethics selectiv es. How much course work would the M.A./D.D.S. combined degrees student take in the regular bioethics curriculum? Answ er: 40 units. Eight (8) units (from four 2-unit courses) are purely double counted. These four courses (named abov e) have sufficiently similar content to bioethics that they w arrant being applied to both the D.D.S. and the bioethics M.A. degrees, once the supplemental papers are approv ed. These short papers integrate professional course work with bioethics content. How much course work is taken in the regular D.D.S. curriculum? Answ er: 258 units (four few er than the standard 262 units). Four units are deleted because their content is more than duplicated in the M.A. dergee curriculum.910 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGHow will D.D.S. students be selected for this program? Students are selected through a competitiv e process, led by the School of Dentistry, in conjunction with the Bioethics Program.

The program The M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees program is designed to fit the schedule of Pharm.D. students. Loma Linda Univ ersity has been a leader in bioethics education for health care professionals for nearly half a century. The Univ esity's School of Pharmacy places a high premium on moral v alues and is a pioneer as the only pharmacy school in the nation to offer an M.A./Pharm.D combined degrees program. How many additional course work units would a M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees student take beyond the required 183 units for a Pharm.D.? Answ er: 22 units. An M.A. degree in bioethics taken as a stand-alone degree requires 48 units in bioethics courses. But the M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees student is able to accumulate 26 of the needed 48 units as follows: 1.Nine (9) units come from three courses in the pharmacy curriculum that are counted for M.A. degree in bioethics credit: a) RXSA 545 Public Health and Lifesty les, RXSA 547 Pharmacy Law, and c) RXSA 751 Social-Behavioral Aspects of Pharmacy Practice Prev entativ e Medicine. Acceptance of these 2-unit courses for M.A. degree credit requires an integrativ e, supplemental eight-page paper that relates the courses' content to bioethics. 2.Eight (8) units come from the deletion of three School of Religion courses because their content is duplicated by the Bioethics Program content. 3.Nine (9) units of additional credit come from three electiv es in bioethics taken by Pharm.D. students. How much course work would the M.A./Pharm.D. combined degrees student take in the regular bioethics curriculum? Answ er: 39 units. Nine units are simply double counted\u2014the three pharmacy courses noted abov e. How much course work is taken in the regular pharmacy curriculum? Answ er: 175 units (rather than the standard 183). Eight units of the standard Pharm.D. program that are duplicated by content in the bioethics curriculum are deleted from the 183 units of the regular Pharm.D. degree total. What is the additional tuition cost for a Pharm.D. degree student who takes the M.A./ Pharm.D. combined degrees program? Answ er: Nothing. There is no additional cost to the student because the School of Pharmacy and the School of Religion provide a scholarship for the 39 units of the M.A. degree in bioethics curriculum. Currently, this amounts to a $25,000 scholarship.918 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGHow will Pharm.D. degree students be selected for this program?

Purpose of the program The purpose of the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees Bioethics with Social Policy and Social Research Program is to facilitate an integrated and more efficient completion of two graduate degrees for students with strong interests in both bioethics and social policy. Students who complete this combined degrees program will be prepared to make significant interdisciplinary contributions to the field of social policy and ethics. Individuals working in the area of social policy must be able to undertake and publish research on social problems. This requires the ability to apply ethical theory to real-world policy scenarios. Graduates will be able to provide leadership to the social policy arena by conducting interdisciplinary research on v arious issues and agendas that hav e significant moral implications. Course work requirements To enter the proposed program, students must gain separate acceptance to both graduate programs. To the extent possible, research projects in both programs focus on the interface of ethics and social policy. How many additional course work units would an M.A./Ph.D degree student take beyond the required 105 Social Policy and Social Research Program units? Answ er: 16 units. If an M.A. degree in bioethics is taken as a stand-alone degree, the requirement is 48 units. How ever, the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees student is able to accumulate 32 of the needed 48 units as follows: 1.Sixteen (16) units from four courses in the social policy curriculum count tow ard the M.A. degree in bioethics requirements because of their similarity to ethics-type courses. Those courses are a) SPOL 613 and SPOL 614: Social Science Concepts I and II, b) SPOL 655: Research Methods II, c) SPOL 615: Economic Theory and Social Policy. 2.Twelve (12) units from electiv es in the social policy curriculum are taken in the master's degree curriculum in boethics. 3.Four (4) units come from one required bioethics course in the social policy curriculum that is already require: RELE 588: Explorers of the Moral Life.922 UNIVERSITY CA TALOGHow much course work would the M.A./Ph.D. combined degrees student take in the regular bioethics curriculum? Answ er: 32 units. Sixteen (16) units (from four 4-unit courses) are simply double counted. These four courses hav e sufficiently similar content to bioethics that they w arrant being applied to both the bioethics M.A. degree curriculum and the Social Policy Ph.D. degree curriculum. How much course work is taken in the regular 105-unit Ph.D. degree curriculum? Answ er: All 105 units are taken. How will social policy curriculum Ph.D. degree students be selected for this program?

(See \"Combined degrees\" programs in the School of Dentistry.) MEDICAL SCIENTIST\u2014SM (M.D. WITH PH.D.) The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and w ant to contribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined degrees program through the Integrated Biomedical Graduate Studies (IGBS) graduate programs (anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology and molecular genetics, pharmacology and physiology). In the first y ear, students participate in a scientifically integrated program that includes biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy. While in the first y ear, students also rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty members. In the second y ear, students increase their involv ement in individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete graduate course requirements. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for graduate or medical classes. Students pursuing the combined degrees may also be involv ed with joint basic science and clinical meetings and conferences with the aim of understanding the interrelationships betw een laboratory-based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory success, as indicated by completion of a first-author manuscript, the student will continue on to the traditional first two y ears of the medical school curriculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonstrate laboratory success will be two-to-three y ears. Successful students who hav e acquired essential laboratory skills should continue their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculum. Upon successful completion of the first two y ears of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE examination, students will begin a series of rotations betw een the clinical sciences and the researchThe Combined Degrees Programs of the Univ ersity 933laboratory. During these later y ears, students will complete all the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects. It is the intent of this program that students will acquire the requisite skills needed for a successful career at the interface of laboratory-based and clinical research. Program admission Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitiv e and requires evidence that the student is likely to dev elop into a successful medical scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each of these programs. The application package for the Ph.D. degree program requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Both programs must accept a student before he or she is admitted to the Medical Scientist Program. Students entering the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program who determine that a research career is inappropriate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree program who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees program at a point after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; how ever, the standard medical school application process will be required at that point.
