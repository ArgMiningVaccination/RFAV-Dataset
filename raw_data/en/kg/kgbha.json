The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended immunization schedule splits vaccines into a series of doses spread out during early childhood. Six-month vaccines commonly include hepatitis B, pneumonia, polio, rotavirus, and diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DTap). This article provides an overview of the 6-month vaccines. It also explains how to comfort your baby after getting shots and how to treat mild side effects. Verywell / Danie Drankwalter 6-Month Vaccination Schedule Vaccinations are given to children on a schedule recommended by the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). They help a baby boost their immune system to prevent harmful diseases. Alternate Names for Vaccinations Vaccinations may also be called:Injections or shotsVaccinesImmunizationsInoculation Most likely, your baby has already received a few vaccinations at birth and their 2- and 4-month check-ups. The following may be recommended at their 6-month check-up: Hepatitis B (HepB)Rotavirus (RV)Diphtheria, PCV15)Polio (IPV)COVID-19Influenza Most vaccinations are given as a shot. However, the rotavirus (RV) vaccine is given by mouth through liquid drops. Which Vaccines Are Mandatory? Vaccine requirements vary by state. For the most part, vaccines are only mandatory for children attending daycare or school. If you are uncomfortable with the number of scheduled vaccinations, talk to your child's pediatrician about what you can safely hold off on. Delaying any of the 6-month immunizations may mean your child will need to catch up before starting school. Diphtheria, Tetanus, Acellular Pertussis (DTaP) The second of five doses of DTaP is given at 6 months old. The fifth dose is usually given around 4 to 6 years old. Immunity may start to wear off around 11 to 12 years old. A booster called the Tdap is generally given at that time or later in life as needed. This vaccine helps prevent: Diphtheria Tetanus Pertussis (whooping cough) Pertussis or Whooping Cough? Pertussis is a respiratory disease that can cause severe coughing. It is commonly called whooping cough because of the sound you make when trying to catch your breath after coughing. Haemophilus Influenzae Type B (Hib) Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) is a bacteria that can cause: Meningitis (inflammation of the fluid and membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord) Pneumonia (lung infection) Sepsis (bloodstream infection) Epiglottitis (swelling in the upper airway or windpipe) Hib is rare in the United States due to routine vaccination. However, if contracted, it can be severe and sometimes fatal. At 6 months old, your baby is most likely receiving the third out of four doses. The last is given around 12 to 18 months. Because of its name, Hib is often confused with seasonal influenza (flu). However, these are two different diseases. Hib is a bacteria, while the flu is a virus. Polio Vaccine (IPV) Polio is a disease that causes symptoms that range from a sore throat to paralysis. It was very feared during the late 1940s before the vaccination program began, and infections in the U.S. decreased dramatically. Children in the U.S. get a shot called an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Other countries may still use an oral polio vaccine (OPV). IPV is given over four doses. At 6 months, your baby is most likely receiving the third dose in the series. Worldwide Polio Cases Efforts to eliminate polio worldwide increased in 1988. Since then, the yearly number of cases (about 350,000) has declined by more than 99.9%. It is estimated that 18 million currently healthy people would have been paralyzed by polio without this response. Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) Streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus are bacteria that cause pneumococcal disease. The PCV is given to protect against pneumococcal disease, which can cause: Ear infections (otitis media, or inflammation and fluid in the middle ear, is common) Acute bronchitis Sinus infections Meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord) Pneumonia (lung infection) The CDC recommends four doses of PCV to be given at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and 12 to 15 months of age. Rotavirus (RV) Rotavirus causes stomach pain, severe vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration (fluid loss). The RV vaccination is given as drops by mouth rather than as a shot. Two brands of the rotavirus vaccine are given in the United States. RotaTeq (RV 5) is given in three doses at 2, 4, and 6 months old. The other brand, Rotarix (RV1), does not include the third dose. Hepatitis B (HBV) Hepatitis B is a viral infection passed through body fluids and damages the liver. Babies are vaccinated against hepatitis B in three doses. The first HBV dose is usually given within 12 hours of an infant's life. This is done in case their mother unknowingly passed Hepatitis B to them at birth. The final dose of HBV is given between 6 and 18 months. Do You Know How Viral Hepatitis Is Really Spread? Influenza (Flu) Influenza, or the seasonal flu, is a virus that causes respiratory infection. At 6 months old, your baby is due for their first vaccination. Because this is their first flu shot, they usually receive two doses at least four weeks apart. After that, it can be given once yearly during flu season, which typically begins in October and goes through May. Injection or Nasal Spray While the influenza vaccine is available as an injection (shot) or nasal (nose) spray, the nasal spray is only approved for children 2 years or older. COVID-19 In 2023, the CDC added COVID-19 vaccination to the immunization schedules for children and adults. At 6 months, your baby is eligible to receive an mRNA vaccine from either Pfizer or Moderna. Updated, or bivalent, vaccines that protect against both the original virus and the Omicron variant are also available. The Pfizer vaccine is given in three doses, and the third dose is a bivalent vaccine. The Moderna primary series is given in two doses, and an updated booster is recommended at least two months after the second dose. Vaccine Side Effects The most common vaccination side effects are tenderness, redness, or swelling at the shot site or a low-grade fever (101 degrees or lower). Occasionally the following mild side effects may occur: FussinessLoss of appetiteChillsDiarrhea or vomitingAchiness Severe Side Effects Are Rare Severe side effects or allergic reactions from vaccinations are rare. Those that do occur usually begin 20 minutes to two hours after giving the vaccine. Talk to your healthcare provider before your appointment if you are concerned about rare side effects or allergic reactions. What to Do if Your Baby Has Side Effects If your baby experiences mild side effects or reactions, you can use the following techniques at home to help them: Place a cool cloth at the shot site to reduce redness, tenderness, or swelling. Give them a room-temperature sponge bath for low-grade fevers. Try feeding your baby more often to increase their fluids. Give Tylenol (acetaminophen) or Motrin/Advil (ibuprofen). Medications to Reduce Fever and Discomfort Motrin/Advil and Tylenol are safe for 6 months and older. Children should not receive aspirin unless directed by their healthcare provider. When to Contact the Pediatrician If your baby has any of the following symptoms, contact their healthcare provider: Temperature (fever) greater than 104 degreesFever lasting more than three days Redness at the shot site larger than 1 inch or lasting longer than three daysHigh-pitched crying lasting over one hourNonstop crying for more than three hours Fussiness for more than three days Severe vomiting or diarrhea When to Call 9-1-1 If you think your infant is having a life-threatening emergency or any of the following rare reactions, call 9-1-1 immediately: Trouble breathingTrouble swallowingLethargy (not moving or very weak)Not waking upSeizures Allergic Reactions to a Baby Vaccination Summary Vaccinations are given to help prevent serious diseases. The CDC and AAP recommend a schedule for children that includes eight vaccines covering 10 diseases given around 6 months old. Side effects or reactions are generally mild and can be treated at home. A Word From Verywell Parents are often concerned about comforting their babies during vaccinations.
