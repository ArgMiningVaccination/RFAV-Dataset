Sleep is absolutely essential to our health and wellbeing and a lack of it can seriously impact your mental health, your ability to concentrate, and your physical health. Climbing into bed every night and knowing you are going to struggle to fall asleep is torture. To make it worse, many people report that their doctors are not taking the issue seriously, and lots of people who have insomnia want a natural way to cure their sleep deprivation. In this article, we'll discuss 5 natural remedies to help you beat insomnia. We know that mindfulness and meditation are cited as cures for all sorts of things these days and perhaps you think it is a fad, but the reason they are suggested so often is because they do actually work. Mindfulness is the art of living in the present moment, and it can be very helpful, especially if your insomnia is caused by stress. Mindfulness would have you focus on exactly what you are doing right now, rather than things that might be causing you stress and anxiety. Meditation is a practice that requires you to dedicate a small amount of time every day to switching off your mind. You'll focus instead on a sound or a chime, and force your brain to stop worrying or dwelling, which in turn relaxes it. People report huge improvements in their mood and productivity by adding just a few minutes of meditation to their routine every day. The best time to do it is in the morning when you wake up, before the stresses and pressures of the day are weighing on your mind. If you're not sure where to start, there are apps that can help you, or you might find there is a local meditation class somewhere near you. Sticking with ancient practices, yoga is an age old cure for many ailments, including insomnia. It's been proven to have a positive effect on sleep quality. It also alleviates stress and improves cognitive function. You might be tempted to tie dedicated yoga time in with calorie burning, but this isn't a good idea if you are stressed. There are many types of yoga, and you should choose one that focuses on meditation and breathwork if you have insomnia. Twenty minutes of yoga in the evening can seriously help with issues sleeping. Exercise not only boosts your overall health, it can enhance your mood and help you with other issues, like weight gain. People who exercise for 150 minutes a week for six months experience significantly fewer symptoms of insomnia, as well as less depression. Exercise for twenty minutes a day in whatever way you want to. This will only work if you choose to do something you like. You might need to test exercising several times a day to find which time slot works best to help you sleep. Magnesium is a naturally occurring mineral proven to reduce insomnia and improve sleep patterns. You can take it as a pill, or you can buy magnesium flakes and add them to your bath. This way, the magnesium is absorbed through your skin. You should note that some people struggle with stomach issues if they take too much magnesium, so add it to your diet in small doses and work your way up. Never take more than the recommended dose, and make sure you take a break from taking it every few weeks. If you have any doubts, speak to your doctor. Lavender is a gorgeous smelling oil that improves mood, reduces pain, and, essentially, promotes sleep. You can incorporate lavender into your life by buying a plant, or putting lavender oil in your bath or on your pillow. You can also buy lavender in tea form. Taking lavender orally is also beneficial, especially if you are depressed. Lavender has been shown to improve sleep patterns in those with depression when taken alongside an antidepressant. Don't go overboard, though. Too much lavender can cause headache, constipation or nausea. In this world of manufacturing, it makes sense to go natural as much as you can. That's because mother nature has given us all we need to lead healthy and happy lives. We'd definitely recommend researching natural remedies for sickness before you visit a doctor, so long as you are not putting yourself in danger. If your insomnia is causing extreme depression or anxiety, it is important you seek medical intervention right away, as these can worsen over time. If your insomnia is mild, there is no harm in trying to solve the issue yourself. We hope our five favourite natural insomnia cures will help you.
