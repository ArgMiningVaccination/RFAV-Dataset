NEW ART OF COOKING HOLISTIC APPROACH TO COOKING Main Characteristics of the New Art of Cooking The Art of Cooking as a Social Art THE ALCHEMY OF COOKING Twofold Effects of the Use of Fire in the Kitchen The Essential Nature of the Warmth THE SPIRITUAL BACKGROUND OF FOOD STORAGE Supersensible Bodies Combat the Processes of Decay inside Living Beings The Task of Storage: Preservation of Vitality and Nourishing Forces BALANCING WITH THE THREEFOLD PLANT The Spiritual Archetype of a Threefold Plant Man as 'Inverted Threefold Plant' Conscious Balancing of the Three Main Systems of the Human Organism BALANCING WITH SEVEN GRAINS Seven Members of 'Inner Cosmic System' Seven Grains and Seven Planets The Astral Rhythm of the Seven Days General Nutritional Guidelines HOW TO CREATE A HEALTHY MEAL The Role of Nutritional Guidelines Nine Aspects of a Healthy Meal THE CHOICE OF INGREDIENTS Holistic Food 'Pyramid' HOW TO PREPARE A BALANCED MEAL Archetype of a Balanced Meal Examples of Balanced Meals Principle of Threefold Plant Three Groups of Vegetables Further Stage of Threefold Principle Three Subgroups of Dried Herbs & Spices Archetype of a Grain Weekly Rhythm of Seven Grains BURNING QUESTIONS OF HEALTH & DISEASE CORONA PANDEMIC 2020/21 HOW TO ARRIVE AT A PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SOCIAL PHENOMENON OF THE CORONA PANDEMIC The First Basic Condition Is to Take Into Account All Possible Aspects and Objections The Second Basic Condition Is the Need to Know the Methods of Research The Basic Principles of Spiritual-Scientific Approach to Research Spiritual Science Enables Us to Become Capable to Criticise the Work of the Experts FROM SYMPTOMS TO REAL INSIGHTS INTO THE SOCIAL BACKGROUNDS OF THE CORONA PANDEMIC Free Development of Ethical Individualism as the Key Impulse of the Present Age The Widespread Faith in Authority and the Infallibility of Scientific Materialism The Dominance of Orthodox Medical Approach and the Industrialisation of Medical Care THE GLOBAL 'EPIDEMIC' OF DISEASES OF MODERN CIVILISATION The Reality of the Apocalyptic Scope of the Increasing Number of Diseases The Artificially Increased Mortality Rate Due to 'Coronavirus' The Need for Cultivation of the Inner Sense for Reality by Means of Spiritual Science THREE MAIN CULPRITS FOR THE PRESENT WORLDWIDE HEALTH CRISIS Materialistic Intellectual Education as the First Culprit for an Increase of Diseases Mechanistic Medical Industry as the Second Culprit for an Increase of Diseases 'Dead' Mineralised Food as the Third Culprit for an Increase of Diseases The Need to Distinguish between Illusions and Realities in Regard to Human Health and Disease THREE ROOT CAUSES BEHIND THE RESPONSES OF THE PUBLIC TO THE CORONA PANDEMIC One-Sided Materialistic View of Origins of Diseases The Negative Impacts of Fear in the Case of Epidemics The Prevalent Faith in Medical-Scientific Authorities The Need to Transform Our Actions into Real Healing by Means of Wisdom ARE VIRUSES AND MICROBES THE REAL CULPRITS IN THE EMERGENCE OF DEADLY EPIDEMICS? We Are Surrounded Outside and Inside Us with Vast Number of Microorganisms and Viruses We are 'Swimming' in the Ever-Changing Stream of Activities of Microscopic Beings Parasitic Forms of Microscopic Life as the Great Benefactors of Natural Ecosystems Each Specific Kind of Germ Will Multiply in Excess Only under Favourable Internal Conditions In Reality We Can Get Infected Only on the Soul-Spiritual Level A SPIRITUAL SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE ON THE ORIGIN OF VIRUSES AND THE NATURE OF VIRAL DISEASES Was Steiner Really Not Able to Differentiate between Bacteria and Viruses? The Deceptive Illusion of Extremely Enlarged Microscopic Images There Is No Scientific Evidence That the Foreign Viruses Are Causing 'Viral Diseases' Viruses Are Mineral Poisons Which Serve as Nourishment for the Supersensible Bodies MATERIALISTIC VERSUS SPIRITUAL SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION OF THE ORIGIN OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES The Simplistic Materialistic Formula: Infectious Agent = Infection = Disease The Imbalances of Our Internal Environment as the Primary Causes of Infectious Diseases On the Dangers of Over-Medicalisation from a Spiritual Scientific Perspective THE ROLE OF NUTRITION IN THE OCCURRENCES AND TREATMENT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES Organic Disease as the Result of the Loss of an Inner Capacity for Tasting Nutritional Impacts on the Biochemical Balance via Subconscious Activity of the Astral Body The Role of a Dietary Intervention in the Case of Acute-Inflammatory-Infectious Diseases THE GRAND DELUSION OF THE MATERIALISTIC APPROACH TO ARTIFICIAL IMMUNIZATION Where Are the 'Organs' of Our 'Immune System'? The Spiritual-Scientific Explanation of the Nature and Working of the Human Immunity The Key Errors of Materialistic Explanations of the Impacts of Artificial Inoculation WHY IS ANTHROPOSOPHIC MEDICINE TAKING AN OFFICIAL PRO-VACCINATION STANCE? PART ONE: ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS Where is anthroposophic evidence for the existence of a new disease? Why is anthroposophic medicine not supporting anti-vaccine movements? Are the new vaccines really safe enough to go forward with them? Why are anthroposophic medical experts endorsing genetically modified vaccines? How is anthroposophic medicine intending to overcome the present social polarization? PART TWO: IN THE SEARCH OF GOOD ANSWERS Nobody can ban anthroposophic medicine if it has the support of enough people One-sided support of vaccination is not contributing to the development of civil society We have an absolute right to criticise the medical experts, including the anthroposophic ones Anthroposophic medical experts are not committed to self-critical questioning of their own approach The damage to anthroposophy that results from the members themselves HAS STEINER REALLY ENDORSED THE PRESENT GLOBAL VACCINATION CAMPAIGN? The Social Aspect: Do Not Be Fanatical in the Matter of Vaccination Anthroposophic Pro-Vaccine Statements as Modern 'Papal Bulls' Shall One Imitate Steiner, Quote Him, or Understand the Issue of Vaccination? THE SPIRITUAL IMPACTS OF VACCINES AND MINERAL DRUGS ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMANITY Our Health as a Continual Balancing Between the Luciferic Forces of Dissolution and the Ahrimanic Forces of Hardening The Spiritual Impact of Vaccines: Driving out the Human Soul and Spirit Vaccination Campaigns as an Important Part of the Preparations for the Incarnation of Ahriman THE REFUTATION OF AN ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY COVID VACCINATION ON THE BASIS OF 'OCCULT' ARGUMENTS The Medley of Confusing Contradictions - From 'There Is Nothing to Protect against Soratic Infection' to 'Vaccine Is the Only Protection' Are Really All Diseases and Deaths Already Decided by Past Personal, Individual, or Karmic Causes, Regardless of a Person's Present Actions? The Being of Sorat According to Roessner Is Not the Same as the Being of Sorath According to Steiner Roessner's Occult ResearchDoesn't Fulfil the Basic Demand of Our Age: The Use of Logical Thinking in Investigation and in Explanations of Its Results CHRIST AS THE SOURCE OF FORCES THAT ARE LEADING TOWARDS TRUE HEALING OF HUMAN DISEASES The Primordial Spiritual Causes for the Emergence of Human Suffering and Illnesses The Inner Disposition to Illnesses as Karmic Consequences of Moral Errors in Previous Lives Christ as a Source of Power that Enables the Control of Luciferic and Ahrimanic Influences in the Domain of Human Health GOOD VERSUS BAD FOOD REAL VERSUS 'PSEUDO' GRAINS Are Grains Really Dangerous to Our Health? ORGANIC JUNK FOOD Is Refined "}
