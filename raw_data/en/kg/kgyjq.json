INTRODUCTION Recent advan ces in life sciences and biotechnology offer enormous p otential for improving health. Biotechnology has led to major breakthroughs and produced new biologically derived treatments for many types of cancer, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and other debilitating or life -threatening diseases.1 These treatments, referred to as \"biologics,\" are drugs that are created using biotechnological processes derived from living organisms and will continue to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry.2 Biologics include medicines like the breast cancer drug Herceptin and the arthritis drug Humira, as well as vaccines such as those that prevent HPV and cervical cancer.3 However, the potential for biologics is curbed by their prohibitive costs. 4 Because biologics are significantly larger and more complex molecules than small -molecule pharmaceuticals, they are much more costly to develop.5 * Juris Doctor Candidate, Loyola University Chicago School of Law, Class of 2011.

Patients and healthcare payers and providers pick up this cost - and it is a considerable cost. For example, the cost for 171 Annals of Health Law Advance Directive [Vol. 20, 2011] THE BIOLOGICS ACT an aver age biologic is more than 20 times that of a small -molecule drug.6 Many biologics cost thou sands of dollars for a course of treatment that can last months or years - costs that are far in excess of those for small -molecule pharmaceuticals.7 These costs average between $10,000 to $20,000 or more per patient, per year.8 Still, biologics are gaining ground in the pharmaceutical market. In 2008, biologics accounted for about thirty percent of sales of pharmaceut ical products and are expected to account for fifty percent of all pharmaceut ical sales by 2014.9 As biologics continue to grow, lower -cost alternatives to biologic therapies are necessary. After more than a decade of debate and mounting demand for lower -cost \"generic\" versions of biotechnology products, Co ngress passed the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (Biologics Act). 10 The Biologics Act is included as Title VII of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.11 Biologics \"represent the cutting -edge of biomedical research.\" The Biologics Act creates a streamlined FDA approval pathway for gene ric versions of already -marketed biologic drug products. The purpose of the Biologics Act is to encourage innovation while making generic biologic drugs (biosimilars) accessible and less cost -prohibitive to the public. While the Biologics Act's impact on innovation and access remains to be seen, it may nonetheless encourage innovation of new biologics. These innovative biologics may not be the intended ou tcome of the Act, which are more competition in the form of introduction of generic biologics. Inste ad, it will encourage investment and development of new innovative drugs. II. BACKGROUND a. Biologics 12 6.Ian Evans, Follow -on Biologics: A New Play for Big Pharma , 83 YALE J.

Biolo gics are markedly different from small -molecule pharmaceuticals in various ways. While small -172 Annals of Health Law Advance Directive [Vol. 20, 2011] THE BIOLOGICS ACT molecule pharmaceuticals are composed of chemicals, biologics are composed of sugars, proteins, nucleic acids or complex com binations of these substances.13 Biologics are created using biotechnolog ical processes that stimulate biological molecu les, often in living entities such as cells and tissues, as opposed to small -molecule drugs that are synthesized with chemicals.14 Most biologics are complex mixtures that are not easily identified or characterized. The process of manufacture for b iologic s differs extensively from small -molecule compounds.15 Synthesis of biologics requires living organisms such as bacteria or cell culture and r equires hundreds of isolation and purification steps.16 Due to the complexity of biologics, an exact copy of a biol ogic is im possible, since changes to the compound itself occur during the manufactur ing process. 17 Thus, generic biologics are not identical to the innovator drug, in contrast with small -molecule generic drugs, which must be chem ically identical to the inn ovator drug. Instead, generic biologics are often called \"follow -on biologics\" or \"biosimilars.\"18 Generic pharmaceuti cals are a cheaper alternative for consumers. Sim ilarly, generic biologics have been proposed as a possible solution for the continuing skyrocketing pharmaceutical costs. U.S. confidence in and a cceptance of this idea is the basis for the fact that approval of generic drugs has been allowed for over twenty -five years. The Hatch -Waxman Act of 1984 This name underscores the fact that follow -on biologics are similar, but not identical to the innovator, biological product. b. Generics 19 aimed to strike a balance between incentives for drug innovation and the need for lower drug prices through increased competition.20 The Hatch -Waxman Act creat ed a growth in the generic industry as a response to the increased demand for lower -cost pharmaceuticals.21 13.

Generic alternatives facilitated by 173 Annals of Health Law Advance Directive [Vol. 20, 2011] THE BIOLOGICS ACT the Hatch -Waxman Act saved consumers billions of dollars in retail pharmacies alone on prescription drugs by pur chasing generic drugs instead of brand name drugs.22 As a compromise to competing interests from brand name drug manufacturers, new generic pharmaceutical comp anies and the need for public access to affordable medication, the Hatch -Waxman Act specifically authorizes \"Abbreviated New Drug Applications\" (ANDAs).23 ANDAs allow a manufacturer that produces \"a generic version of a patented drug to bypass the FDA's requirement of proving that the drug is safe and effective,\" so long as the formula is identical to the brand- name drug. 24 Similar to ANDAs, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosim ilars exists in the Biologics Act and is expected to reduce drug costs. 25 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the federal government could save $5.9 billion over ten years by establishing an abbreviated pat hway for the FDA approval of biosimilars, not counting the savings to pr ivate purchasers.26 Additionally, it is estimated that an abbreviated pathway will reduce total expenditures on biologics in the U.S. by about $25 billion over the same period. 27 Similar to the Hatch -Waxman act, the Biologics Act provides an exp edited FDA approval procedure and is intended to promote the development of lower -cost alternatives to bi ologics. III. IMPACT OF THE BIOLOGICS ACT 28 The Hatch -Waxman Act facil itated the introduction of generics and has succeeded in creating access to significantly lower cost generic drugs for the consumer.29 22.

The Biologic s Act is substantially identical to the S.1695 Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2007, a biosimilars bill intr oduced in the 110th Congress. See Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2007, S. 1695, 110th Cong. (2007). 26. CONG. BUDGET OFFICE , supra note 25, at 1. 27. Id. 28. Corbitt, supra note 13, at 366. 29. Id. at 371. Similarly, the Biologics Act attempts to encourage the introduction of biosimilars b y 174 Annals of Health Law Advance Directive [Vol. 20, 2011] THE BIOLOGICS ACT providing innovator biologics manufacturers with market exclusivity.30 The real impact of the Biologics Act on the development of biologics and biosimilars is still uncertain. One possible outcome is the development of more biosimilars, which the Act intended to spur. The Biologics Act will serve its intended purpose and encourage a new market of biosimilars, akin to the Hatch -Waxman Act. Incentivizing the development of biosimilars by creating an abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars will allow f or the development of more biologics in the form of biosimilars. The develo pment of more biosimilars in the market will likely create discounted costs for biologics. As a result, there will be savings in both the private and public expenditures of drugs. 31 Furthermore, more biosimilars will continue to increase because invest ment and production of biosimilars is attractive for pharmaceutica l comp anies. In other words, both commercial and gover nment payers will save money by reducing their spending on specialty drugs. 32 Biosimilars still have the potential of bringing in a large profit for pharmaceutical companies, despite the drop in price due to the generic cla ssification.33 Additionally, because they are just copies of pioneer drugs, the development of biosimilars poses a lower risk than developing an innovator biologic.34 Another possible outcome of the Biologics Act could actually be slowing the development of biosimilars and biologics. The Biologics Act incorp orates some high hurdles that biosimilars m ust overcome in order to obtain FDA approval. 35 Because of the high costs and high standards for generic biologics, manufacturers may be slower to develop biosimilars compared to generic small -molecule drugs.36 Biologics have also not been subject to generi c competition because they are more complex than chemical drugs, making it much more difficult, and expensive, to prove 30.

Yet another possible outcome is that the Biologics Act may encourage research and development of innovator biologics i nstead of biosimilars. Since replicating an innovator biologic may be too costly and may take a long period of time to enter the market, a biologic manufacturer may instead develop its own innovative biologic. By potentially discouraging ge neric competit ion, the Biologics Act may encourage the development of new biologic products. Rather than assuming costs of replicating biologics already in the market, manufacturers may be more willing to develop new products that target different diseases, resulting i n more treatment options. 40 Innovators have a lot to gain from developing new biologics. For e xample, innovator biologics manufacturers are 'rewarded' for their research and development with a twelve- year FDA exclusivity period.41 This excl usivity period is much longer than the exclusivity period allowed by the Hatch -Waxman Act, which allows five years of mark et exclusivity.42 The exclusivity period will certainly enhance investment incentives and innov ation.43 The twelve- year data exclusivity period for new biologics is an a ppropriate approach to balance innovation and lower costs of biosimilars.44 Even if the innovator biologic is not granted patent protection, the Act provides a separate way to obtain market exclusivity for twelve years. 45 37.

Considering the long wait period required to obtain a patent and the unce rtainty of the patent protection, the 176 Annals of Health Law Advance Directive [Vol. 20, 2011] THE BIOLOGICS ACT guaranteed exclusivity period provides an incentive to research and development, since investors will be sure that the costs of development will be recovered due to the FDA approval of the bi ologic and its resulting exclusivity period.46 45. Id. 46. Addison, supra note 41. Thus, the FDA exclusivity peri od granted by the Biologics Act offers a major opportunity to develop more biologics. The exclusivity period favors innovation rather than copying pioneer drugs to create biosimilars. The opportunities and economic value for innovative biologic manufactu res may incentivize the development of innovator biologics, rather than biosimilars as was intended in the Biologics Act. IV. CONCLUSION The Biologics Act's impact on innovation and access to biosimilars r emains to be seen, and much debate about its potential impact continues. While the purpose of the Act to encourage generic competition is yet to be determined, the Act may in fact serve as a catalyst for innovation of new biologics. The costs of biologics may not be reduced as soon as expected, but the promise of new biologics therapies that target a variety of diseases will at least provide the availability of more life- saving treatments.
