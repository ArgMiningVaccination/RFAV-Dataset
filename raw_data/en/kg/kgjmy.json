The fast-growing cancerous tumor originates in the brain or spinal cord and has traditionally been treated with surgery to remove the tumor followed by radiation and chemotherapy. The prospective therapy which comprises of copper ions and [Disulfiram](https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682602.html) (DSF-Cu++), paves the way toward a successful treatment that can be used alone or in conjunction with traditional therapy. \"Disulfiram, [is] a medication that's been used for nearly 70 years to treat chronic alcoholism,\" explains Betty Tyler, the study's senior author and associate professor of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins. \"It has great promise being 'repurposed' as an anticancer agent, especially when it is complexed with metal ions such as copper.\" The researchers tested the anticancer activity of DSF-Cu++ and, in their attempts to define what it targeted at the molecular level to achieve these effects, were able to highlight [four key findings](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0251957#sec018). First, the team of researchers found that DSF-Cu++ blocks two biological pathways in medulloblastomas that the cancer cells need in order to remove proteins threatening their survival. With these pathways blocked, these proteins accumulate in the tumor and cause the malignant cells to die, leaving them to eventually be removed by the body's own immune system. Second, the researchers discovered that just a few hours of exposure to DSF-Cu++ not only kills medulloblastoma cells but can also effectively reduce the cancer stem cells responsible for their creation. The third finding in the study revealed that DSF-CU++ keeps cancer cells from recovering. By impairing the ability of medulloblastoma cells to repair the damage done to their DNA, DSF-CU++ enhances the cell killing power of the treatment. Lastly, the promising combo of DSF-CU++ demonstrated significant increases in prolonging survival days of mice whose brains were implanted with two "}
