A New Kind of Health Care Clinic The Healing Sanctuary is a New Kind of Health Care Clinic, a clinic built from the ground up to deliver excellent outcomes-based care. As the US health care system continues to search for answers, we start from day one in the delivery of care as suggested by forward-looking experts. Providing Integrated, Integrative, and Functional Medicine Combining these three approaches to health care provides a vastly superior experience over traditional U.S. health care practices, all centered on a unique, customized experience for each and every patient. Integrated Care The intentional collaboration of all caregivers for a patient with each other in a treatment team, surrounding a patient with multiple perspectives, providing built-in second and third opinions. Integrative Care The use of evidence-based treatments from across the spectrum of medical traditions from Western medicine, Eastern medicine, Natural medicine, Mind-Body therapies, and others, preferring the natural first. Functional Care The purposeful detective work performed to tease out and treat root causes instead of just manifesting symptoms, aiming at reversal and restoration. Mission Statement It is our mission to serve, empower and partner with our patients and our community on the path to wellness, transformation and wholeness. We will serve as a model for the new paradigm of patient-centered health care dedicated to furthering evidence-based research and education in integrative and functional medicine.
