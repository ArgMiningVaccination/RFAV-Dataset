Rucker and Myles J. Watts March 24 , 2014 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 An Evaluation of the Costs Associated with Implementing Management Interventions for Control of Brucella abortus in Yellowstone Bison and E lk Problem Statement Brucellosis is a reproductive disease, causing abortion, stillbirths, infertility , and reproductive lesions in 1998; Rhyan disease, bovine brucellosis, is common to bison and elk of the Greater Yellowstone A rea (GYA) (Cheville et al. 1998). Cattle are susceptible to brucellosis, and there is potential for transmission between wildlife and cattle grazing within the GYA (Higgins et al. 2012). Transmission occurs primarily through ingestion of the disease agent Brucella abortus from aborted fetuses, birth placenta, and associated birth fluids and secretions (Cheville et al. 1998; Carvalho -Neta et al. 2010). Historically , brucellosis was endemic in U.S. cattle; n ational herd prevalence was estimated to be 7% and within herd prevalence 11-12% (Wright 1937). In 1934, the United States implemented a federal - state -cooperative brucellosis program (Cheville et al. 1998). Test and slaughter and depopulation efforts by this program have since reduced brucellosis to 0.0001% of all cattle herds ( USDA 2010). Today, b rucellosis is considered a local problem. Cattle herds bordering the GYA in regions of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming are at the greatest risk of contracting brucellosis from bison or elk. From 2002-2012, there were thirteen domestic livestock herds identified with brucellosis in the GYA , all of which were traced back to elk (Rhyan et al. 2013b). The enzootic natu re of b rucellosis in bison and the increasing sero prevalence of brucell osis in elk (Cross et al. 2010) support the notion that the disease will only be eradicated in cattle when it is controlled in wildlife. Until then, brucellosis will continue to pose a threat to the cattle economy. Some have proposed adaptive managem ent of b rucellosis in wildlife, enabling multiple management strategies with varying levels of efficacy to be selected under different scenarios (White et al. 2013). Management strategies that show the greatest prom ise for reducing prevalence of b rucellosis in bis on include vaccination, sterilization, and test and slaughter (Ebinger et al. 2011; Treanor et al. 2010). The proposed project will evaluate the costs of bison m anagement strategies designed to reduce disease prevalence and risk of transmission to cattle. Disease transmission dynamics between cattle, bison, and elk will be considered. Costs of responding to a brucellosis outbre ak in cattle will be included in the assessment , as will estimates of the costs of suppression strategies. Recent research suggests that a significant redu ction in the proportion of brucellosis -positive bison can be achieved through intensive vaccination (Treanor et al. 2010). However, a substantial reduction of wildlife disease prevalence may not be feasible with the tools (i.e. , vaccine, and vaccine delivery methods) that are currently available. For t his reason we will also estimate the costs of developing a more effective vaccine against brucellosis infection in domestic livestock and wildlife. Page 1 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 Background Brucellosis is a global disease, affecting both humans and animals . The disease is caused by the bacterial genus Brucella and has been thought to date back to Egyptian times (Pappas and Papadimitriou 2007). Many na mes have been used to describe b rucellosis infection; Bang's disease, Malta fever, and Undulant f ever. Brucella species are potential agents for bioterrorism . The Center for Disease Control currently lists Brucella bacteria as category B bioterrorism agent s, a result of their infectiousness and transmissibility via aerosol means (Seleem et al. 2010). Global Distribution Animal abortus, Brucella melitensis, Brucella suis, and primary disease causing agents of brucellos is in livestock, although in the United States the disease is limited to B. abortus and B. suis (Godfroid et al. 2013). Livestock production systems that rely on pastoralism are particularly prone to high rates of brucellosis infection (Racloz et al. 2013). In other regions such as the GYA, wildlife brucellosis is important, and is epidemiologically linked with brucellosis in livestock (Godfroid et al. 2013). Brucella abortus is found predominately in cattle but also in wildlife reservoirs in North America (Godfroid et al. 2013) and buffalo in Africa (Alexander et al. 2012). In many developed countries bovine Brucella abortus has been eradicated or it exists at low levels due to continued control and surveillance (Seleem et al. 2010). Brucella melitensis affects small ruminants and has historically been a problem in European countries (Godfroid et al. 2013). Brucella ovis is common to sheep and is reportedly prevalent in major sheep producing countries (Xavier et al. 2010). Brucella suis is found mainly in boars, hares, reindeer, and caribou (Godfroid et al. 2013). Exposure to B. suis often occurs through contact with feral swine found in regions of North America and Australia, and wild boar in Europe (CDC 2009; Godfroid et al. 2013). Global Distribution and Transmission of Human Infection Annually an estimated 500,000 people become ill with brucellosis worldwide , with rates ranging per country from 0.09 to 1603 cases per 1 million people (Pappas et al. 2006). In regions of Mexico, South America, the Mediterranean Basin, the Balkan Peninsula, Asia, and Africa, infection s by the genus Brucella are a major human health risk (Pappas et al. 2006). Syr ia in particular faces the highest rates of human infection, with the number of cases doubling in recent years (Pappas et al. 2006 ). Distribution of the disease has chang ed considerably over time . Levels of infection have fallen in France, Israel, and Latin America and have risen in Central Asia (Pappas et al. 2006). Countries currently considered free of human brucellosis infection are Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom (Seleem et al. 2010). Page 2 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 Human brucellosis is considered a minimal public health threat in the United States, although it is a nationally notifiable disease (CDC 2014). Seventy nine human c ases were reported in 2011 (CDC 2011), and these were likely contracted from out-of-country sources (Pappas et al. 2006). These numbers are down dramatically due to implementation of the national bovine eradication program (Pappas et al. 2006) and with advancements in milk pasteurization (Young and Corbel 1989). In 1947 a total of 6321 human cases were reported in the United States , caused mainly by Brucella abortus in cattle (Wise 1980). Within states encompassing the GYA , two human cases of brucellosis were reported in Idaho and no c ases were reported in Wyoming and Montana for the year 2011 (CDC 2011). Infection in humans is primarily a result of the maintenance of brucellosis in animals (Godfroid et al. 2013). Transmission of brucellosis to humans occurs through consumption of contaminated meat and milk products, inhalation of infectious aerosols, or directly through contact with infective secretions o r tissues (Young and Corbel 1989). Most human cases are attributed to Brucella melitensis , from consumption of contaminated goat or sheep milk, while c ases due to Brucella abortus and Brucella suis are generally occupationally related (Seleem et al. 2010). Individuals classified as hunters, health professionals, laboratory personnel, and abattoir workers are at a higher risk of exposure to brucellosis and thus infection (Young 1995; Young and C orbel 1989). In the United States, the leading cause of human infection is Brucella melitensis, often acquired through travel or from consumption of imported contaminated food (Pappas et al. 2006). Brucellosis is a systemic disease, with symptoms appearing in humans within 2 -3 weeks of infection (Young 1995). C linical symptoms include signs of fever, weight loss, chills, drenching sweats, swelling of the liver and spleen (Al Dahouk et al. 2013), and in rare instances death (US GAO 2008 ). Successful treatment of brucellosis patients is possible through the appropriate selection of antibiotics, taken for the prescribed length of time (WHO 2006 ). Resistance of Brucella abortus to antibiotics does not appear to be common in human patients but has been reported in some instances (De Rautlin de la Roy et al. 1986). Widespread u se of similar antibiotics in animals could increase the risk of treatment failure in humans, and thus is not recommended (WHO 2006). Patients may relapse or be characterized as chronic, if clinical symptoms persist more than 12 months (WHO 2006). Brucellosis in the Greater Yellowstone Area In the United States Brucella abortus still remains enzootic in the free -ranging elk and bison of the Greater Yellowstone A rea. Through serology , the di sease was first detected in 1917 in Yellowstone bison (Mohler 1917) and was believed to have originated from the introduction of cattle to the continent (Meagher and Meyer 1994). By 1930, the disease had been discovered in elk at the National Elk Refuge (Murie 1951). T oday about 40-60% of the Yellowstone bison are seropositive for b rucellosis (Treanor 2013). In GYA e lk, seroprevalence levels have historically been greater for those with access to feedgrounds versus those that are free -ranging (Cross et al. Page 3 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 2010). Between 1993-2009, ongoing surveillance in Wyoming indicated annual herd seroprevalence levels ranged from 3 -59% for elk attending feedgrounds , and 0-7.4% for free - ranging elk (Scurlock and Edwards 2010). More recently data have suggested se roprevalence in free-ranging elk herds has been increasing to levels similar to feedground elk within the GYA (Cross et al. 2010) . An increase from 0 -7% to 8 -20% was reported for four free -ranging elk - herds surveyed in 1991-1992 to 2006-2007, indicating brucellosis may be capable of self - maintenance in some elk populations (Cross et al. 2010). Brucella a bortus Reservoirs Bison, elk, and cattle are the primary hosts of Brucella abortus in North America . Other wild ungulates such as deer , pronghorn, moose, and bighorn sheep do not appear to be important reservoirs (McCorquodale and DiGiacomo 1985). Moose have been found naturally infected with b rucellosis, where the disease was severe to fatal (Fenstermacher and Olse n 1942; Jellison et al 1953; Corner and Connell 1958). In horses, Brucella abortus may cause a diseas e known as fistulous withers (Cohen et al. 1992; Johnston 1945). Opossums, raccoon, coyotes , foxes, and wolves may also carry Brucella abortus but do not appear to be important in maintenance of the disease (Schnurrenberger et al. 1985; Davis et al. 1979; pathogenesis by bovine Brucella abortus has been reviewed by others and is discussed briefly below (Carvahlo Neta et al. 2010; Xavier et al. 2010). Brucella abortus is considered an intracellular pathogen because it can su rvive and replicate in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells (Ko and Splitter 2003; Xavier et al. 2010). Invasion of the host usually occurs through the gastrointestinal tract (Payne 1959), after being ingested or inhaled (Ko and Splitter 2003) . Once inside, the bacteria is spr ead through the lymph nodes (Ko and Splitter 2003). Virulence factors aid the bacteria in surviving long periods of time within macrophages ( He 2012). Eventually the uteru s, genitals, and mammary gland may become infected as a result of the dissemination of Brucella abortus throughout the blood (Ko and Splitter 2003; Carvahlo Neta et al. 2010). Following acute infection, bacteria may persist in lymphatic tissue, leading to a chronic condition (Xavier et al. 2010). Brucellosis Symptoms in Animals Brucello sis is a reproductive disease of livestock , leading to abortions, stillbirths, reproductive lesions, and infertility (Cheville et al. 1998). Abortions are most common in first calf heifers (Morgan 1969; Davis et al. 1991; Rhyan 2013a ) in the last trimester ( Rhyan 2013a ). Abortions are a result of inflammation of the placenta, due to the pathogens tropism for trophoblastic tissue (Payne 1959; Smith 1919). Infected dams that do not abort may produce calves that are normal, weak, or still born, and Brucella abortus may still be shed in live birth material (Rhyan et al. 2009). Page 4 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 Lesions of the male genital organs are common to cattle, bison, and elk infected with brucellosis (Rhyan et al. 1997; Lambert et al. 1963; Rankin 1965; Rhyan 2013a), although lesions in male elk may be less severe (Rhyan 2013a) . Females rarely exhibit lesions of the mammary organs but inflammation due to mastitis has been reported in cattle (Payne 1959; Xavier et al. 2009). Breeding soundness exams have indicated reproductive efficiency may be lower in bulls infected with Brucella abortus (Frey et al. 2013). Sources and Transmission of Brucellosis in Animals Oral i ngestion of the pathogen is the primary mea ns for an ungulate to contract brucellosis (Meagher and Meyer 1994). Ingestion occurs from direct or indirect contact with infected animals or environmental sources of the pathogen. The most significant source of Brucella abortus is contaminated placenta, fetuses, and birth material (Cheville et al. 1998; Carvalho -Neta et al. 2010). Brucellosis is also known to persist in vaginal secretions (Lambert et al. 1961; Manthei and Carter 1950 ; Rhyan et al. 2009 ), milk (R hyan 2013a; Nicoletti 1980), and in male's semen (Robison et al. 1998; Lambert et al. 1963). Venereal transmission of Brucella abortus appears to be unlikely in both cattle and bison (Rob ison et al. 1998; Rankin 1965; Thomsen 1943), as opposed to other Brucella species where the disease is transmi tted via this route (Enright 1990; Wanke 2004). A possible explanation for the low likelihood of venereal transmission by bulls is the l ow levels of infective bacteria present in the semen (Frey et al. 2013). Compared to natural service, artificial insemination has been shown to pose a risk for Brucella abortus transmission (Manthei et al. 1950; Cheville et al. 1998). In studies where semen was placed directly i nto the uterus, Brucella abortus was shown to be transmitted (Manthei et al. 1950; Uhrig et al. 2013) . Bacterial uptake mechanisms have been proposed to aid in Brucella abortus surviving within the uterine epithelial compared to the vaginal epithelial (Cheville et al. 1998). Milk is a source of Bruce lla abortus because bacteria replicate in high numbers in mammary glands ( Cheville et al. 1998 ). Consequently, calves suckling from infected mothers are at risk of contracting b rucellosis through the milk. Actual rates of transmission from mothe r to calf via milk are unknown. Maternal antibodies do not appear to play a significant role in protection of the calf from b rucellosis (Rhyan et al. 2009). Brucellosis Prevalence in Yellowstone Bison Recent research suggest s female bison become infected with brucellosis at a young age but recover with increasing age (Treanor et al. 2011). Tissue culture results of female bison have indicated the average age of infection is three years old (Treanor et al. 2011). Susceptibility of young females to brucellosis may be a result of their poor nutritional status (Treanor 2013). Additionally, newborn calves and juveniles are highly susceptible and become infected as a result of their association with diseased females (Treanor 2013). Although positive test reactions in calves may be a result of passive transfer of antibodies from mothers to calves during nursing, Page 5 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 once the calves reach five months of age these antibodies begin to wane and the calf becomes seronegative (Rhyan et al. 2009). Population Density Population density may play a role in brucellosis persistence in free -ranging elk (Cross et al. 2010). Higher rates of seroprevalen ce in elk found outside of feedgrounds have recently been attributed to the increased density of these animals on winter pastures accompanied by abortion events (Cross et al. 2010). In bison, brucello sis has been shown to be more persistent in bison herds of 200 head or more (Dobson and Meagher 1996). Inter- Species Transmission Much remains to be learned about the rates of disease transmission between wildlife and domestic livestock. Bruc ellosis cases in GYA cattle appear to be a direct result of the spatial overlap with infected GYA w ildlife. Research suggests that h arsh winter conditions, lack of available forage, and increasing populations cause elk and bison to migrate onto grazing lands to later be occupied by cattle ( Craighead 1972; Cheville et al. et al. 2011; Schumaker 2013). Hunting and predation also contribute to elk migration onto private lands (Proffitt et al. 2009). Yellowstone National Park elk and bison normally calve between April and June, with brucellosis abortion events occurring at late gestation (Cheville et al. 1998; Jones et al. 2010; Schumaker 2010).Co -occupation of habitat by cattle and wildlife during infectious births or abortions is a concern for brucellosis transmission (Jones et al. 2010; Schumaker 2013). Recent ly, th e National Park Service has maintain ed spatial separation of bison and cattle to reduce the likelihood of transmission events (Schumaker 2010; Kilpatrick et al. 2009). In addition, there has not been a documented case of brucellosis in cattle from GYA bison (Kilpatrick et al. 2009). Instead, c urrent research identifies elk as a likely source of transmission to cattle via spatial overlap (Proffit et al. 2011; Schumaker et al. 2013). These data are further supported, by recent brucellosis outbreaks in domestic livestock herds traced to elk sources (Rhyan 2013b ). Many have speculated that the high seroprev alence of brucellosis in elk is a result of transmission events with bison (Cheville et al. 1998; Schumaker 2013). A study assessing seroprevalence of elk sharin g winter range with bison however reported similar seroprevalence rates to those populations not sharing winter range with bison, 3% versus 0-1%, respectively (Ferrari a nd Garrott 2002). Only recently have data supported self- maintenance of brucellosis in elk herds ( Cross et al. 2010). Brucellosis seroprevalence was shown to increase from 0-7% in 1991-1992, to 8-20% in 2006-2007 for four out of six GYA elk units not aggregating on feedgrounds (Cross et al. 2010). In the other two elk units there was no statistically significant change in brucellosis herd seroprevalence. T he low likelihood of a transmission event between bison and elk was further indicated by a risk assessment using spatial overlap data (Proffitt e t al. 2010). Self -maintenance of brucellosis in free- ranging elk herd s is believed to be a result of Page 6 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 population size and aggregation of elk during the abortion period (Proffitt et al. 2010; Cross et al. 2010). Contact with environmental sources of Brucella abortus from infectious births and abortions is a transmission risk to cattle and wildlife. Brucella abortus has been shown to persist in the environment after parturition events, although ultraviolet light and scavengers may limit the pathogen's persistence in the environment (Cook et al. 2004; Aune et al. 2012). In one report Brucella abortus field strain persisted up to 43 days a t natural birth and abortion site s in the GYA (Aune et al. 2012). The pathogen was also capable of surviving longer on birth material in February versus May due to differences in sunlight and temperature (Aune et al. 2012). Cook et al. (2004) reported scavengers were capable of consuming 90% of fetuses within 2.9-5.9 days in regions of Wyoming 's National Elk Refuge, state f eedgrounds, and Grand Teton National Park . Diagnostic Testing Brucellosis is detected in dis eased livestock through serological testing, although these tests are not perfect. T here is a risk of falsely identifying animals as brucellosis positive or brucellos is negative. Infection by brucellosis is often confirmed through tissue culture and bacterial isolation , although it is possible for the pathogen to be missed in sampled tissue . Serological tests have played an important role in directing eradicat ion efforts by identifying brucellosis positive animals and herds . The first test to be used was the standard tube agglutination assay in cattle (Ragan 2002). The preferred test today is the fluorescence polarization assay , which is cheaper and more efficient than conventional assays (Gall and Nielsen 2004), such as the ring test . These diagnostic tests are important for surveillance and federal requirement s for states to maintain disease free status (USDA 2010). For instance, domestic livestock transported out of the designated surveillance areas of th e GYA are requi red to be tested and confirmed brucellosis free. Goals Goal I: Cost -Assessment of responding to a brucellosis outbreak among cattle in Montana using the APHIS inte rim rule Background: A brucellosis outbreak in cattle can impose substantial costs on the affected producer and may also result in a considerable burden on taxpayers. Economic losses result from poor reproductive efficiency, reduced access to markets, and the federal requirement to control the disease through culling and quarantine. D esignated surveillance zones have recently been created in the regions bordering the GYA. Within these regions the re is mandatory identification and female calfhood vaccination. It is believed that the creation of these zones reduces the spread of brucellosis infection and thus economic losses (MDOL 2011). The benefit from creating these zones has been estimated at 5.5 to 11.5 million dollars per year by the Montana Department of Livestock (MDOL 2011). C alfhood vaccination of cattle wi th RB51may provide protection against abortions and fetal infection, but its ability to prevent brucellosis inf ection i n cattle is Page 7 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 limited (Olsen 2000). In all recent domestic livestock outbreaks, animals were believed to have been vaccinated for b rucellosis (Rhyan 2013b). One of the objectives of this proposal is to asse ss the costs associated with a b rucellosis outbreak in Montana cattle herds. Past research has indicated the economic losses of a b rucellosis outbreak to a 400 head cow- calf operation may be substantial, $40,181 for depopulation beyond the government indemnity payment and $134,818 for quarantine over a one year period (Wilson 2011). Total costs incurred at the federal, state, local, and producer level for a b rucellosis outbreak in livestock have not been estimated . Prior to 2010, a s tate's disease free status was revoked either if more than two brucellosis positive herds were detected in a two year period , or if a s ingle b rucellosis positive herd was detected and not depopulated within 60 days ( USDA 2010). In 2010 these provisions were modified. Since then, when a state's disease free status is at risk, test and removal and approved management strategies have been used to contain the disease, rather than requiring whole herd depopulation. This new approach has been in effect for almost four years during which Montana has had four domestic livestock herds infected by brucellosis (USDA 2013). Thus, an important component of this cost- assessment will be to determine the total costs associated with responding to an outbreak in domestic livestock under the current regulations at the federal, state, local, and producer level . This assessment will consider all activities associated with the epidemiological investigation and herd quarantine process including trace back of reactors, surveillance of adjacent herds, investigation of sources of infection, implementation of agreed upon herd plans, test and removal, and assurance testing. Goal II: Cost Assessment of Disease Management Interventions Objective 1: Compare the costs associated with specific mana gement strategies to eradicate b rucellosis in Yellowstone bison and elk. Objective 2: Compare the costs associated with various m anagement strategies to reduce brucellosis in bison and elk. Objective 3: Compare the costs of different spatial-temporal interventions to reduce transmission of brucellosis from bison to cattle (including via elk). Management Interventions Background: Brucellosis control or prevention strategies in either cattle or wildlife include: 1) methods to reduce Brucella abortus infection within the animal, 2) biocontainment activities that target positive animals within a herd , or 3) management activities that prevent transmission between animals. The m ost commonly discussed management strategies are whole-herd depopulation, vaccination, test and removal, hazing, hunting, fertility control, and habitat expansion. Whole herd depopulation is the method of destroying all animals in a herd to eliminate any possible reservoirs of infection. During the Great Depression whole cattle herd depopulation was common both to remove brucellosis and to reduce cattle numbers (Ragan 2002). Until the changes in 2010, depopulation of positive cow herds was also important for a state to maintain disease free status. Page 8 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 Brucella abortus vaccination acts to provide acquired immunity, and to reduce abortions and fetal infection in bison (Olsen et al. 2003; Olsen et al. 1998). Test and removal is the process whereby animals are quarantined, tested for exposure to Brucella abortus antibodies , and then slaughtered if found to be positive. A recent study by the Montana Fish , Wildlife, and Parks verified that brucellosis can be cleared from an infected group of juvenile bison within a quarantine facility through repeated testing and removal of pos itive reactors (MFWP 2010). Hazing allows for the spatial and temporal separation of bison and cattle on grazing land. Bison that migrate out of the park in the winter are encouraged to retreat back to the park each spring through hazing. In the winter, bison may also be hunted by licensed hunters and A merican Indian treaty hunters, a recent amendment to the Interagency Bison Management Plan (White et al. 2011; NPS 2005). Sterilization, estrus suppression products, or immunocontraceptives prevent pregnancy and are not currently used in bison. Habitat expansion involves allowing bison to graze public and private lands , which may require purchase of grazing rights or easements . At present , hazing and test and removal are the primary means of controlling the brucellosis infected Yellowstone bison population. V accination may play a greater role in the future. Suppression Effectiveness: There have been a number of studies that have assessed the effectiveness of various brucellosis management strategies in wildlife (Peterson et al. 1991; Dobson and Meagher 1996; Treanor et al. 2010; Ebinger et al. 2011; Hobbs et al. 2013). One result that is common to these studies is the substantial amount of time and resources required for current management strategies to reduce brucell osis infections in GYA wildlife. In one of the earlier models, researchers assessed S19 vaccination of Grand Teton bison when: 1) females were vaccinated at calfhood, 2) females of all ages were vaccinated, and 3) seropositive bison were removed and females were vaccinated (Peterson et al. 1991). Researchers simulated model uncertainty surrounding vaccine efficacy using S19 field data from Texas A&M. Vaccine efficacy estimates r anged from 24 %-90% for calfhood vaccination and 65%-81% for vaccination of females of all ages. The proportion of animals contracting brucellosis was modeled using a fixed transmission risk assumption, where interspecies transmission dynamics did not play a role. Under all three management scenarios, the reduction of brucellosis seroprevalence below 20% after 20 years was shown to be unsuccessful. To reduce seroprevalence levels below 10%, a sensitivity analysis indicated the transmission rate wou ld need to be lowered below 5% (Peterson et al. 1991). Dobson and Meagher (1996) developed a frequency and density- dependent brucellosis transmission model, to assess the relationship among the annual cull rate and brucellosis prevalence in Yellowstone bis on. Historic data from Yellowstone bison were used and included: recruitments, removals, population size, prevalence and culling intensity. Bison- to-bison transmission rates were scaled by body weight for both density and frequency-dependent scenarios . Using these transmission values it was determined that the bison would have to be eradicated before a successful reduction in brucellosis prevalence could be achieved, unless there Page 9 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 was a way of identifying and removing infected animals (Dobson and Meagher 1996). This analysis did not incorporate interspecies transmission of brucellosis from elk. Other researchers developed an individual -based simulation model, to determine the effect of boundary and remote vaccination of female Yellowstone bison on brucellosis seroprevalence (Treanor et al. 2010). This model was developed to align with guidelines of the Interagency Bison Management Plan, which suggested the implementation of a remote bison vaccination program. Captured in the model were yearly processes that controlled population demographics and vaccination status of Yellowstone bison, as well as daily processes influencing individual bison exposure to Brucella abortus . Transmission of brucellosis from elk to bison was accounted for and occurred at a rate of 0.01. Of interest was the resulting 66% reduction in brucellosis seroprevalence under the scenario where 29% of female bison were vaccinated remotely , or at boundary capture, with a 50% efficacious vaccin e over 30 years. A less successful reduction in brucellosis seroprevalence was indicated when vaccination was limited to calves and yearling females that were captured at the boundary upon leaving the park, or were vaccinated remotely when found within the park. To prevent reversing the desired effectiveness of the vaccine, researchers concluded that a long term vaccination effort would be required to effectively mitigate brucellosis infection in Yellowstone bison (Treanor et al. 2010). Using similar transmission dynamics as the models discussed above by Treanor et al. 2010, researchers simulated the effect of sterilization, vaccination, and test and removal on brucellosis seroprevalence of Yellowstone bison (Ebinger et al. 2011). An advancement of this mode l was the application of both selective and non- selective treatments to female bison . For test and removal and sterilization, selective referred to the application of treatment to young, pre-reproductive, and seropositive animals, while non- selective referred to the application of treatment to seropositive animals of any age. In the case of vaccination, selective referred to vaccinating only seronegative female calves, while non- selective referred to vaccinating all female calves at the boundary with no serological test. To simplify the model, researchers modeled e fficacy of sterilization and vaccination at 100% . All brucellosis control strategies were assessed under scenarios where a target number of animals (50-100) were given the treatment annually. Selective s terilization and test and removal were found to be most effective at reducing brucellosis, but they also required additional effort to identify seropositive animals. Eradication of brucellosis was shown to be possible in less than 35 years when sterilization was implemented non-selectively to 75 -100 head per year. Due to the targeting of seropositive animals, 3% to 13% of sterilization and test and slaughter simulations exhibited an initial de crease followed by a substantial increase in brucellos is seroprevalence. The authors suggested this increase may have been an effect of reduced herd immunity (Ebinger et al. 2011). Vaccination was the least successful at reducing brucellosis in bison. Although when vaccination of seronegative bison was combined with non- selective sterilization of approximately 5% of seropositive bison, it was capable of reducing brucellosis seroprevalence to 15 -25%, at the 100 head target level. This model was useful in demonstrating the effect of: 1) various management scenarios at reducing Page 10 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 brucellosis in Yellowstone bison; and 2) the effectiveness of selective management practices aimed at potentially infe ctious female Yellowstone bison. More recently, a Bayesian state- space model was developed in conjunction with monitoring data to forecast population dynamics and the usefulness of brucellosis management strategies of Yellowstone bison (Hobbs et al. 2013). Brucellosis control strategies were evaluated based on a strategy's ability to meet management's goals , such as cutting transmission probability by 50% annually and reducing seroprevalence levels below 40% for adult females. Control strategies targeted 200 animals per year for up to five years , and were the following : 1) no action, 2) removing seropositive females, 3) removing seronegative animals, 4) harvesting animals at the boundary, and 5) vaccination. Results indicated by the fifth year there was a 19 fold increase in the probability of reducing brucellosis seroprevalence below 40%, when seropositive females were removed compared to a no action strategy. For vaccination , there was a two -fold increase in the probability of reducing seroprevalence below 40% compared to a no action strategy . Despite these r esults , the chances of reducing brucellosis seroprevalence approximately 10% in five years through culling of seropositives and vaccination were only 42% and 5% , respectively . These estimates were even lower when more uncertainty was included in the model, such as movement of animals to boundary locations where they could be vaccinated or selectively removed. Management Costs: The primary goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the cost- effectiveness of various management strategies for control of b rucellosis in bison. Brucellosis mitigation strategies in wildlife are a requirement to maintain c lass f ree disease s tatus a nd were part of the 2010 APHIS Interim Rule and Montana's Interage ncy Bison Management Plan (USDA 2010; U SDI 2008). Most of the brucellosis control efforts in Yellowston e bison have focused on spatial and temporal separation from cattle, culling withou t testing, and in rare occasion s, vaccination at capture facilities (White et al. 2011). While these efforts have been successful in preventing brucellosis transmission between bison and cattle (Kilpatrick et al. 2009), they have not been successful in reducing prevalence of the disease in Yellowstone bison (White et al. 2011). The inability to reduce brucellosis prevalence in Yellowstone bison is complicate d by other wildlife sources of brucellosis, availability of resources, effectiveness of management strategies, and consistency in implementation of management strategies. In addition, it has been suggested through a Bayesian model that mana gement efforts proposed by the Interagency B ison M anagement P lan will increase the number of bison exiting the park in the future (Geremia et al., 2011). Several studies have estimated the effectiveness of various management strateg ies in reducing brucellosis in bison (Dobson and Meagher 1996; Ebinger et al. Hobbs et al. 2013; Peterson et al. 1991; Treanor et al. 2010). N o known literature exists on the cost -effectiveness of these strategies in Yellowstone bison. One recent assessment focused on the costs and benefits to society of controlling brucellosis in elk through vaccination, test and slaughter, or the use of feed grounds to reduce economic losses associated with cattle outbreaks. Results of the study Page 11 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 indicated costs exceeded benefits for each activity \u2014with elk feed grounds having the least net negative benefit (Kauffman et al. 2011). Another assessment calculated the cost of brucellosis prevention activities to a 400 head cow- calf operati on using a whole farm a nd partial budge ting scheme (Roberts et al. 2012). Researchers determined the cost to the producer for hazing elk by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department was cheapest ($0), followed by fencing a haystack ($103), adult booster vaccination of cattle ($797), spaying heifers ($2365), hiring a rider ($14,194), and delayed grazing ($15,189) (Roberts et al. 2012). These numbers did not include the costs borne by the Wyoming Fish and Game. This report also indicated producers would be more likely to pay for costly prevention ac tivities if the risk for brucellosis transmission were substantially higher , for instance greater than 50% . The costs of management strategies in bison are expected to vary from that of elk and cattle. Thus, the purpose of this study plan will be to develop a modeling strategy that determines the cost effectiveness of management strategies in bison after accounting for biological efficacy , transmission dynamics between wildlife and cattle , and the ability to implement those strategies in Yellowstone bison . Goal III: Cost Assessment of developing an effective domestic livestock vaccine Vaccination Background: In the United States control and prevention of b rucellosis in domestic cattle herds has relied heavily on vaccination (Ragan 2002). Ea rly eradication efforts used the vaccine Brucella abortus strain 19 (S19) in cattle, but due to its cross reactivity on serological tests, and high abortifacient effects it was replaced by the vaccine Brucella abortus strain 51 (RB51). Vaccine RB51 was an improvement over S19 because it was less of an abortifacient (Palmer et al. 1996). In addition, vaccinated animals remained seronegative on standard diagnostic te sts which prevented vaccinated animals from being removed during test and removal procedures (Stevens et al. 1995). Currently RB51 calfhood vaccination is mandatory in female domestic cattle residing in the designated surveillance area, to preve nt potential spillover from brucellosis endemic wildlife. Despite this preventative measure, seven confirmed cases of brucellosis have been reported in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho since 2011 (USDA 2013). Detection of b rucellosis positive cattle herds will likely continue until brucellosis is controlled in GYA wildlife or a more effective b rucellosis vaccine is developed. Livestock and Wildlife Vaccination: The literature on livestock and wildlife vaccination is extensive. The following brief discussion is not an exhaus tive review of the literature. Both simulation and challenge studies have indicated the current vaccine is not sufficient to eliminate brucellosis in wildlife reservoirs ( Kreeger et al. al. 2011; Hobbs et al. 2013; Olsen and Johnson 2012) or to provide complete protection to cattle (Olsen 2000; Poester et al. 2006). In most efficacy studies , RB51 vaccines have been shown to be more effective at reducing abortion rates rather than infe ction rates (Olsen 2000; Olsen et al. 2003; Olsen and Johnson 2012). For cattle, a high dosage of RB51 reduced the incidence of abortion by ~75% but only reduced the heifer infection rate by ~31% (Olsen 2000). Cumulative studies in bison have indicated RB51 was effecti ve at lowering abortion rates by 55% and uterine infection s by 45% (Olsen and Johnson 2012) . However, rates of recovery of the challenge strain Page 12 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 were 80 -100% in bison calves given either a single calfhood vaccine or yearling booster shot, which indicated the vaccine did not prevent infection of individual animals (Olsen and Johnson 2013). Failure of RB51 in elk was not only limited to the inability to block the establishment of infection but also abo rtion prevention (Kreeger et al. 2002; Cook et al. 2002). Vaccine efficacy estimates for reducing abortion rates in elk vaccinated with RB51 ranged from 0-25% ( Kreeger et al. 2002; Cook et al. 2002). Collectively these studies confirm t here is a need for a vaccine capable of protecting both cattle and wildlife from establishment of Brucella abortus infection. Considerations for development of a new vaccine should include protection from infection, detectability on serological tests, immunological indicators that correlate with immune protection, reduced abortive effects, and cross -species protection. The method of vaccine delivery , dose-regimen, and timing of vaccination is also important. O ral and remote vaccine delivery systems have been assessed and compared to manual vaccination in experimental studies of bison, cattle, and elk and may have an advantage for use in free- ranging animals (Elzer 1998; Davis et al. 1991; Cook et al. 2002; Olsen and Johnson 2012). Booster vaccination also shows promis e over single calfhood vaccination. A recent assessment indicated yearling bison boostered with RB51 had lower abortion and uterine infection rates, as well as tissue colonization by bacteria , compared to yearling bison given a single calfhood shot (Olsen and Johnson 2012). One potential vaccine candidate on the horizon is the DNA vaccine containing Brucella bp26 and trigger factor genes ( Yang et al. 2005; Clapp et al. 2011). Brucella is an intracellular pathogen, where cell mediated immunity has been shown to be important in providing host- protection against Brucella invasion (Oliveira et al. 1998). One of the potential benefits of a DNA vaccine is the stimulation of both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses ( WHO 2013), a feature that is l acking with current commercial brucellosis vaccines. The ability of the DNA vaccine to elicit a Th -1 cell -mediated response was recently shown using eight bison challenged with b rucellosis ( Clapp et al. 2011). While the results of this study were encouraging, future field studies are needed to determine if this vaccine is capable of reducing b rucellosis colonization in ruminants. Other vaccines that may be of interest are those that have been tested by the Russian Federation: B. abortus 82, B. abortus 82-PS, an d B. abortus 75/79- AB. Brucella abortus 82 has been used since 1974 in Russian cattle herds and is believed to have played a significant role in reducing rates of b rucellosis infection (Salmakov et al. 2010). There is a need however, for large scale compar ative fie ld studies to determine if the Russian vaccines are more efficacious than RB51 at reducing brucellosis infection rates in domestic cattle populations. Vaccine Cost Assessment : The final goal of this study is to assess the costs associated with developing a brucellosis livestock vaccine. The ideal vaccine should demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness at reducing the brucellosis abortion rate, maternal infection rate, and fe tal infection rate in both wildlife and cattle. Previous studies have assessed the costs and benefit s of vaccination in cattle in terms of a reduction in human health risk (Roth et al. 2003), cow infection rates (Xie and Horan 2009), and cow -calf economic losses (Roberts et al. 2012). A Page 13 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 recent report assessed the total cost, annual cost, and break- even level of effectiveness of vaccination using a specific herd example under two different adult booster vaccination strategies (Roberts et al. 2012). Results of this study were particularly useful for producers weighing the costs and benefits of different vaccination strategies, although the costs were assessed in terms of the producer and not society. This cost-assessment also did not determine the financial burden associated with developing and implementing a new vaccine. Thus, one of our objectives will be to estimate the costs associated with developing a commercial vaccine that has the potential to successfully reduce b rucellosis in domestic livestock and wildlife. Analytical Approach A primary objective of this study is to e valuate the effectiveness and cos ts of management strategies of b rucellosis in Yellowstone bison with a particular focus on the impacts of these strategies on infection rates in domesticated cattle in the GYA. Evaluating the benefits of management strategi es is contentious because of the controversial nature of bison leaving the park and the differing public views about the value of free- ranging bison versus the sanctity of private property rights and the potential for cattle infection. The approach taken here is to estimate the costs using typical cost management estimation methods. We will also evaluate the biological outcomes of the management strategies, but we will not attempt to monetize the wildlife benefit of those outcomes. Placing monetary values on the wildlife outcomes is prohibitively controversial and would require so much speculation that it would not productively contribute to the discussion. The analytical model will be constructed in a manner that it will be useful over an extended period to such interested parties as National Park Service personnel, other researchers, and public interest groups. The model will be sufficiently transparent to be understandable and easily updated as new information becomes available. Written materials as well as discussion s will be offered so that the model can be widely used beyond this study. All models are abstraction from reality, as is this effort. The model will be designed to capture the important elements of brucellosis management and to abstract fro m those of less importance. If the model is to be widely used it must be sophisticated enough to capture the essential elements of concern , but simple a nd transparent enough to be accessible to interested parties. A central focus of the management outcome s of the model requires capturing the dynamics of brucellosis infection across bison, elk, and cattle. Different management strategies will affect the dynamics of the brucellosis infection and thereby the costs. Suppression and Outbreak Costs Costs will be estimated using traditional budgeting approaches that identify each activity required in the management process and then budg et the costs of each activity. While some of the cost information is readily available, other information will be developed through interviews Page 14 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 with knowledgeable personnel such as National Park S ervice personnel, ranchers, and veterinarians. The management costs will be incurred over an extended period of time and so the analysis will include the timing of costs and will be summarized as present value s. Dynamic Brucellosis Model The dynamic nature of brucellosis will require an explicitly dynamic model. While there are multiple approaches to this problem, the approach that appears to best capture the dynamics as well as provide the desired information on outcomes is a Markov Chain model (s ee any edition of Hillier and Lieberman for an introductory discussion of Markov Chains or Howard (1971) for a more advanced treatment ). A Markov Chain type of model can capture the stochastic nature of infections , as well as the dynamics of changing levels of infections (Longini et al. 1999; Zipkin et al. 2010; Yaesoubi and Cohen 2011). The mathematical appendix to the study plan contains a simple discussion of the basic elements of a Markov Chain model . While the Markov Chain model appears to be the most appropriate approach at this time, further investig ation may reveal a preferred alternative . (Any m ajor change in the mo deling approach will be discussed with the National Park Service.) Because of the limits on the way probabilistic outcomes can be accommodated in a continuous Markov Chain model, a stochastic discrete model will likel y be chosen . States of nature will be identified that describe different possible situations. A state of nature could include the brucellosis infection level in each species, age composition of each species, population of each species, and so forth. Multiple states are defined so that the multitude of possible outcomes is reasonably approximate d. The next step is to develop estimates of the probabilities of moving between states over a single time period. These transition probabilities depend not only on the leaving and entering state but also on the management strategy employed. Given that we know the current state and the transition probabilities , the probability of being in any state after a chosen number of periods can be calculated. This approach then allows the probabi listic prediction of outcomes given an initial state , a management strategy, and the associated transition probabilities. The development of state transition probabilities requires a large amount of information. The information required includes infection rates between and within species by age composition, changing age composition by species, changing population by species, and effects of management strategy on infection rates. To the extent possible the necessar y information used in the modeling will be based upon the published literature or estimated from available data. In instances where required information is not available, we will call on experts with substantial knowledge and experience to help develop the required information. Of course , we will be especially concerned about sensitivity of the outcomes to the opinion based information. Parameter uncertainty (e.g. vaccine efficacy) can be either explicitly modeled in the transition probability process or by sensitivity analysis either in the underlying parameters or the transition Page 15 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 probabilities. Explicitly modeling the parameter uncertainty requires knowledge of the probability distribution of the parameters. The approach to evaluating parameter uncertainty will depend on the available information and the importance of the parameters to the outcome. Use of Markov Chain models is particularly subject to criticism because the outcomes are difficult to validate. These models are often used to predict long term e ffects , and usually there are not long term data sets that can be used to validate the model \u2014if long term robust data sets existed another approach would likely be taken. E very effort will be made to validate the model to the extent possible. For example, the Monte Carlo Markov Chain model approach (Brooks 1998; Hobbs et al. 2013) has potential to assist in the validation process. In the current context, the Markov Chain approach allows the forecast of changes in brucellosis infection levels over time for a p articular strategy. A n adaptive management approach can be incorporated by changing the management strategy, leading to an adjustment in the transition probabilities, as infection rate levels or other variables reach designated thresholds. It is unlike ly that it is possible to eradicate a disease in the sense that the probability of a future infection is absolutely zero . From a practical modeling perspective, some small probability of future infection with no current infection could be defined as eradication. In this practical sense of eradication, the model output provides the desired information on eradication. Furthermore, the model can be used to provide a probability distribution for the time it will take to reach eradication. Management strat egies to be investigated will be developed jointly by National Park Service personnel, National Park Service appointees, and the principal investigators. In a similar manner, an expert Advisory Group will assist in developing the necessary information for development of the state transition probabilities that is unavailable from existing published sources or cannot be estimated due to lack of data. In some cases the analysis will identify critical pieces of missin g information. While those missing elements will initially be determined by expert opinions, as more rigorously developed information becomes available it can be incorporated into the model. One of the benefits of this approach is that it force s the recognition of important information and it does not mask the need for that information with opaque model structure or inflexibilities. After the management strategies are identified, costs ar e estimated, and the probabilities of cattle infection are estimated with the Markov chain model, both costs of suppression and outbreak can be calculated for each management strategy. The example appendix provides an illustrative example of a hypothetical Markov chain model that calculates the effectiveness of brucellosis management strategies in cattle and wildlife. Cost Estimator for Brucellosis Management Strategies A user -friendly computer ized cost estimator program will be made available to the National Park Service to assist in the selection of a cost -effective brucellosis management strategy. Below is a simplified representation of the program , which will be based on the Markov Chain process. Page 16 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 Figure 1: Computerized C ost Estimator for Brucellosis Management Strategies Program users will select model parameter values through a drop down menu or form. Model parameter values will be selected for those variables to be identified in the proposed project as influential in the transmission and prevalence dynamics of brucellosis in bison, elk, and cattle herds. E fficacy estimates associated with the management strategies to be compared will also be chosen . After the model parameter values are selected by the user, the M atrix G enerator will produce the corresponding transition probability matrix. A baseline scenario will be specified for compar ison to the management strategy of interest . For the user -specified number of periods (or iterations ), the Markov Chain Calculator will generate transition probabilities for brucellosis infection in the baseline and management strategy scenarios. Cost estimates will be combined with the probabilities from the Markov Chain Calculator to obtain expected future costs. The cost estimates will reflect the federal, state, local, and ranch -level costs associated with each scenario under consideration. The output generated for the user will describe the efficacy of the management strategy and will also compar e the present value of the expected cost estimate s associated with the baseline and management strategy scenarios . Vaccine Costs Cost of developing drugs or vaccines vary widely depending on a broad range of factors, many of which are stochastic. We have retained the services of Dr. Winship, who has been involved in several drug and vacci ne development efforts. Costs will be estimated for each step in the development and approval process. This approach will ease the difficulty of estimating the remaining cost of vaccines that are currently partially developed. It is important to recognize that the estimates to be developed in this portion of the project may be considerably higher or lower than the actual costs of the vaccines under consideration. Many vaccines are not successfully Page 17 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 commercialized even though they may be technically feasible. S ome vaccines that appear to have high potential initially are later abandoned for a variety of reasons. The vaccine development process will be described, cost estimates developed, and the probability of success discussed. Summary, Future Work, and Expected Outcomes In the proposed project, the primary focus of our efforts will be the following: - Develop estimates of the costs of b rucellosis outbreaks in Montana cattle. The costs of such an outbreak will depend on the protocol or management strategy i n effect for responding to the outbreak. The calculations in this portion of our analysis will be made using the provisions of the 2010 APHIS Interim Rule . Relevant cost categories for federal, state, and private entities that will be considered include (but will not necessarily be limited to) identification costs, costs associated with extended quarantine of infected herds, expenses incurred from slaughtering and disposing of infected animals, and the costs of tracing back infected animals to their herd of origin to determine if those are infected with brucellosis. The costs of an outbreak will depend on such factors as the size of the infected herd, the history of the breeding animals in the herd, market prices of cattle at the time of the infection, the d uration of the quarantine period, and so forth. Information to develop the cost estimates in this portion of the project will be gathered from the existing literature, veterinarians who have dealt with b rucellosis outbreaks, APHIS experts, and cattle producers. - Develop a framework for estimating the impacts/effectiveness and costs of specified bison brucellosis management activities. At present, the possible management tools to be considered include vaccination, test and removal, hazing, hunting, and ferti lity control. The objectives to be assessed include eradication of brucellosis (if possible), reductions in the prevalence of infection, and managing the costs of reducing transmission of brucellosis between bison (or elk) and cattle by maintaining or increasing separation. The actual management strategies to be evaluated will be developed with input from the National Park Service and their nominees. At this point in time, the most appropriate approach for assessing the effectiveness and costs of specified management activities appears to be to develop a Markov Chain model. We believe that this will be the first model of this type that includes multiple species. Single species models such as Hobbs et al. (2013) will provide a valuable foundation. - Estimate the costs of developing an effective vaccine for domestic cattle that may also be effective in bison and elk. The vaccine development process will be described, cost estimates will be developed for each step in the development and approval process and the probability of success will be discussed. It is important to note that\u2014while we have retained the services of an individual who has substantial experience in estimating the costs of drug development\u2014any such estimates may be considerably larger or smaller than the actual costs of developing any given drug. Page 18 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 - Provide documentation and training to National Park Service personnel on the use of the computer model . This training will allow the National Park Service to assess the variety of scenarios that will be of interest to parties involved in the policy discussions regarding management of bison and the methods that might be used to address the problems associated with brucellosis. The output from this project will include a report to the National Park Service that assesses the cost and efficacy of various management strategies and a computer model that will be accessible to individuals with modest expertise in modeling. Page 19 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 Example Appendix Although Markov Chains are well known within the field of operations research, the tool may not be familiar to those without an operations research background. In this appendix, we present and develop three examples designed to illustrate the use of the Markov Chain in the context of Brucellosis management. The examples are highly simplified, but do get progressively more complex. All parameter values in the examples are strictly hypothetical and are not intended to be accurate representations of reality. The model to be developed in the proposed project would be much larger and more complex than the examples. Example 1: The first example considers infection probabilities in a single species. Uncertainty regarding current and future infection is modeled as being dichotomous, with the species either being infected (State 1, or S 1) or not infected (State 2, or S 2) as reflected in the table below. State Status S1 Infected S2 Not Infected The Markov Chain approach requires the specification of a transition probability matrix, which provides the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another between the current period and the next period. For this example, suppose the transition probability matrix is (1) 12 1 2 S .8 .2 .1 .9S SPS= The first entry in the 2x2 matrix (.8) is interpreted as the probability that if a species is infected in the current period (that is, it is in S 1) it will also be infected next period (it is in S 1 again). The second value in the first row indicates that there is a 20 percent probability that if the species is infected in the current period, it will not be infected in the next period. Note that because the species must either be infected or not infected in the next period, the two values in the first row (and each of the other rows as well ) must sum to 1.0. The first entry in the second row (.1) indicates that if the species is not infected in the initial period, there is a 10 percent probability that it will be infected in the ensuing period. And the second entry in the second row (.9) suggests that if the species is not infected initially , then the probability that it will not be infected in the next period is 90 percent. 1 1 It may be helpful to note that the rows in the 2x2 matrix above represent the state of the process in the current period and the columns represent the state in the future period of interest. In the matrix in e xpression (1), the columns represent the state of the process in the next period. In the matrixes to follow, the columns sometimes represent the state of the process further into the future. Page 20 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 The Markov Chain approach can be used to provide information on (i ) the state of infection in the species after any given number o f periods and (ii) the very long- term (or steady state) likelihood of infection. Figure 1 is a \"tree\" diagram that provides a visual depiction of the initial steps in the Markov Chain process. In the diagram \"I\" indicates the state of the world in which the species is infected, and \"N\" indicates the state wherein the species is not infected. The interpretation of the first two columns in the tree diagram is the same as in the 2x2 matrix above. The very first column in the diagram indicates that, initially, the species may be either infected or not infected. In moving from the first column to the second column (or from period 0 to period 1), we see by looking at the top portion of the tree, that i f the species is infected in period 0, then there is an 80 percent probability that it will also be infected in period 1 and a 20 percent chance it will not be infected in period 1. From the bottom portion of the tree, if the species is not infected in period 0 then there is a 10 percent probability it will be infected in period 1 and a 90 percent chance it will not be infected in period 1. The third column in the tree diagram can be used to determine the t ransition probabilities between the current period ( period 0) and two periods in the future (period 2). An important underlying assumption (in all three examples and, in general for Markov Chains) is that the transition probabilities between any two contiguous periods are constant. In other words, to this point in the discussion, the matrix in expression (1) represents the transition probabilities between the current period and the next period. It can also, however, represent the transition probabilities between, say periods 3 and 4, periods 8 and 9, and, in general , periods t and t+1. Consider first the top-most branch in the tree. Here, the species is infected in all three periods. The probability that if the species is infected in the initial period, it will also be infected in each of the next two periods is the probability of going from the infected state to the infected state twice, or 0.8x0.8 = (0.8) 2 = 0.64 (or 64 percent). The next highest branch in the tree can be used to determine the probability that if the species is infected in period 0, it will then be infected in period 1 and will not being infected in period 2. This probability is 0.8x0.2 = 0.16 (or 16 percent). The interpretation of the other branches is exactly analogous. For example, the bottom branch (on the bottom portion of the tree) can be used to determine the probability that if the species is not infected in period 0, then it will not be infected in either period 1 or period 2. This probability is the probability of going from not infected in period 0 to not infected in period 1 and then to not infected again in period 2, or 0.9x0.9 = 0.81. 2 A question of interest is \"I f the spec ies in the example is infected today (period 0), then what is the probability that it will also be infected two periods in the future?\" From the top portion of the tree diagram, it can be seen that there are two ways for that to happen \u2014the species could be infected in all three periods, or the species could be infected in period 0, not infected in period 1, and then infected again in period 2. The probability of the first of these is 0.8x0.8 = 0.64, and 2 It is important to note that the information in the transition probability matrix does not provide any in formation on the probability that the species is initially infected (or not infected). Page 21 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 the probability of the second is 0.2x0.1 = 0.02. The sum of these two \u20140.64 + 0.02 = 0.66 (or 66 percent) is the answer to the question posed above. S imilarly, the probability that if a species is infected today, it will not be infected two periods in the future is 0.8x0.2 + 0.2x0.9 = 0.34. Note that the sum of these two probabilities is 1.0, which is intuitive because if the species is infected today, it must be either infected or not infected two periods into the future. The tree diagram could be expanded to include additional periods, but would quickly have too many branches to display conveniently on one page\u2014Period 3 would have 16 nodes, Period 4 would have 32 and so forth. Fortunately, matrix algebra methods provide a much more space-efficient method of displaying the results of interest for this problem. 3 It can be shown that if the 2x2 matrix in expression (1) above is multiplied by itself, the result is (2) PxP =.8 .2 .1 .9 .8 .2 .1 .9 = P2 =12 1 2 S S .66 .34 .17 .83S S The value of the first entry in the first row of the P2 matrix represents the probability that if the species is infected in the current period, it will also be infected two periods later in period 2. This value, 0.66 (or 66 percent), is the same as the value obtained from the tree diagram in the discussion above. The value of the second entry in the first row is the probability that if the species is infected in the current period, it will not be infected two periods later. This value\u20140.34\u2014is also the same as the value obtained from the tree diagram above. The matrix multiplication approach can be used to determine the probability of being in a particular state \u2014infected or not infected \u2014after T periods by going through analogous calculations as those above. Below are results for T=4, 8, 32, and 64. (3) 4 2 2 8 32 64 .49 .51 .37 .63 .33 .67 .33 .67 .25 .75 .31 .69 .33 .67 .33 .67P PP P P P = = = = = The interpretation is exactly analogous to the interpretation of the P2 matrix. For example, if the current population is infected, the probability of no infection after four periods is 0.51, or 51 percent. Similarly, if the current population is not infected, the probability of infection after eight periods is 0.31, or 31 percent. Note that in each of these matrices, every row sums to 1.00. This is because if, e.g., the species is currently infected, it must be either infected or not infected after T periods. It is noteworthy that ( i) in both P 32 and P64 the first and second rows are identical, and ( ii) the values in the P32 and P64 matrices are exactly the same. These two observations demonstrate two important properties of well-behaved Markov transitional probability matrices. The first 3 For a primer on matrix multiplication see Math is Fun, Advanced at http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix - multiplying.html. Page 22 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 observation indicates that r egardless of whether the species is initially infected or not infected, after an extended period of time the probability of infection is 33 percent, and the probability of not being infected is 67 percent. In other words, if the process goes on for many periods, the initial state becomes irrelevant. The second observation suggests that after a point, more time can pass and the probabilities do not change. That is, a steady state has been attained. In this example, the steady state is represented by th e 1x2 matrix (4) ( ) .33 .67 Steady State = The interpretation of this steady state matrix is that in the long term about 33 percent of the time the species will be infected and about 67 percent of the time there will be no infection. Example 2: In thi s example, there are two species \u2014wildlife and cattle, each of which may be infected or not infected. The table below shows the four possible infection combinations in any given period for this example. Status State Wildlife Cattle S1 Infected Infected S2 Infected Not Infected S3 Not Infected Infected S4 Not Infected Not Infected Assume the transition probability matrix for this example is (5) 1234 1 2 34 .80 .17 .02 .01 .40 .57 .02 .01.20 .20 .20 .40 .01 .01 .01 .97SSSS S SPS S = The interpretation s of the values in this matrix are analogous to the first example. For example, the first value in the first row indicates that if both wildlife and cattle are currently infected, then there is an 80 percent probability that both will be infected in the ne xt period. As another example, the fourth entry in the third row suggests that if wildlife are not infected and cattle are infected in the initial period, then the probability is 40 percent that neither species will be infected in the next period. As in the previous example, the four values in each row sum to 1.00, indicating again that whatever the state of the two species in a given period, one period later the species must be in one of the four possible states. Page 23 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 Again, the matrix multiplication approach provides a concise framework to determine the probability of being in each of the four states after T periods (given a starting state). T he probability transition matrices after , e.g., T=2, 8, and 32 periods are (6) 2 8 32.712 .237 .024 .027 .594 .258 .023 .126 .449 .198 .020 .333 .552 .397 .024 .027 .593 .258 .023 .126 .449 .198 .020 .333 .284 .192 .052 .0472 .349 .157 .019 .476 .36.024 .019 .012 .945 .108 .057 .014 .822P PP= = = 8 .164 .019 .449 .288 .131 .017 .564 Note again that the sum of every row in every one of the transition probability matrices above is 1.000. This reflects the fact that regardless of the status of the two species initially, after any arbitrary number of periods, the status of the two species must be one of the four specified in the table. To demonstrate the interpretation of the values in the above matrices, consider two examples. If neither species is currently infected (S 4), the probability that both will be infected after eight periods (S 1) is 10 .8 percent. Alternatively, i f neither species is currently infected (S4), the probability that neither will be infected after 32 periods (S 4 again) is 56.4 percent. Because all the values in each column of the P32 matrix are not identical, we know that after 32 periods the system has not yet converged to a steady state. Using methods discussed in the Mathematical Appendix that follows , the steady state for this example is (7) ( ) .377 .168 .019 .436 Steady State = This steady state matrix tells us that\u2014regardless of the initial infection status of the two species in this example \u2014in the long term the probability that both will be infected is about 38 percent, whereas the probability that neither species will be infected is about 44 percent. Further, note that wildlif e are infected in either state S 1 or state S 2. This suggests that the probability wildlife will be infected in the long -run is 0.377 + 0.168 = 0.545, or 54.5 percent. Similarly, noting that livestock are infected in either S 1 or S 3, the long-run probabil ity that livestock will be infected is 0.377 + 0.019 = 0.396, or 39.6 percent. A primary purpose of the proposed project is to estimate the costs of various brucellosis management plans. The Markov Chain approach described to this point provides information on how infections will evolve over time , given a transition probability matrix. To illustrate how the costs and benefits of different management plans will be estimated, suppose the transition probability matrix discussed to this point in the second example represents the situation in which the management plan currently in place involves no vaccination of cattle. Further, suppose there are 1,000 head of cattle in the herd and that if the cattle become infected, they are slaughtered, disposed of, and a replaced by a new (identical) herd at a to tal cost of $1 million (an average value of $1,000 per animal). Page 24 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 Now, consider a management plan in which a moderately effective vaccine is administered to the cattle every period. Suppose the cost of administering the vaccine is $10 per animal, or $10,000 per year for the herd. For this example, assume this cost includes the costs of the vaccine, veterinarian services, and the rancher's costs. Assume also, that as under the previous plan, if the cattle are infected, they are slaughtered and replaced at a cost of $1,000,000. Assume that the revised transition probability matrix associated with this new management plan is (8) .10 .87 .02 .01 .05 .92 .02 .01 .15 .20 .2 .45 .01 .01 .01 .97PR = The primary changes in the transition probability matrix are in the four values in the northwest corner of the matrix. What is the interpretation of these changes? Regarding the change in the first value in the first row (from 0.80 to 0.10), with the new management strategy, the probability of transitioning from the state in which both species are infected in the current period (S 1) to that same state in the ensuing period is greatly reduced. This reduction is largely offset by an increase in the likelihood of being in the state where wildlife are infected and cattle are not infected (S 2). The substantial reduction in the value of the first element in the second row (from 0.40 to 0.05) indicates that the likelihood of going from the state in which the wildlife are infected and the livestock are not infected (S 2) in period 0 to the state in period 1 in which both the cattle and the livestock are infected (S 1) is greatly reduced by the application of the vaccine. At the same time, as indicated by the increased value of the second entry in the second row (from 0.57 to 0.92), the probability of going from the state in which the wildlife are infected and the livestock are not infected (S 2) to that same state one period later is increased. The steady state for this rev ised matrix is (9) ( ) .035 .489 .019 .457 Steady StateR = Note that in the long run, the probability of cattle being infected is now 0.035 + 0.019 = 0.054. Thus, this probability has fallen from almost 40 percent to 5.4 percent. Note also that the long- run probability of wildlife being infected has fallen from 54.5 to 52.4 percent. In this particular example, the drop in the probability of infection was much larger in cattle, as would be expected given the focus of the management plan considered. Of course, the management focus could be on both species or just on wildlife. Either of these can be accommodated by the approach we propose to employ. What are the costs and benefits of the revised management plan? In this example, the costs are the vaccination costs of $10,000, which are incurred every period. The benefits take the form of Page 25 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 a reduced probability of livestock infection, which means livestock producers (and/or taxpayers) will less frequently incur the costs associated with slaughter. How might the dollar value of these benefits be calculated? Suppose we know the initial state of infection of the two species. If we are initially in S 1 (both wildlife and cattle are infected), then the probability of livestock being infected in period 1 has fallen from 0.82 (= 0.80 + 0.02) to 0.12 (= 0.10 + 0.02) and the expected costs of infection fall from 0.82x$1,000,000 = $820,000 to 0.12x$1,000,000 = $120,000, a cost reduction of $700,000. Similarly, if we are initially in S 2 (wildlife infected, cattle not infected) in period 0, then the expected costs of cattle infection fall from 0.42x$1,000,000 = $420,000 to 0.07x$1,000,000 = $70,000, which represents a cost reduction of $350,000. If we are currently in S 3, the cost reduction is $230,000 (= $400,000 - $170,000). There are no changes in the probabilities in the fourth row of the transition matrix, so there a re no cost reductions if neither species is initially infected. The expected benefits for the second period are obtained by finding the difference (for each initial state) between the probability of livestock infection from the P2 matrix in expression (6) above, and the corresponding probability from the analogous PR2 matrix (not shown). This difference can be calculated for each future period. The present value of all these future financial flows (both costs and benefits) will then be summed to calculate the total net present value of the of the revised management plan. Example 3: This example also includes a wildlife species and cattle but wildlife now has three levels of infection \u2014None, Low, and H igh. The six possible states in this example are defined in the table below. State Wildlife Cattle S 1 No Infection Not Infected S2 Low Infection Not Infected S3 High Infection Not Infected S4 No Infection Infected S5 Low Infection Infected S6 High Infection Infected Assume that the transition probability matrix for this example is (10) .900 .040 .030 .015 .010 .005 .300 .400 .100 .060 .100 .040.050 .200 .300 .050 .100 .300.400 .200 .100 .100 .100 .100.100 .100 .100 .200 .300 .200.100 .100 .200 .200 .200 .200P = Page 26 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 The steady state probabilities for this example are (11) ( ) State .657 .104 .075 .048 .058 .057 Steady = As can be seen, going from a specification of the \"infected\" state for wildlife as dichotomous to allowing for three levels of infection increases the dimensions of the probability transition matrix. Inclusion of more than two species, indicators of the population size, the age and gender distribution of each species, or any of a number of other important variables w ill rapidly increase the size of the matrix. Modern computer s have the capacity to make the computations necessary to accommodate the complex ity of many variables included at different levels.

Choice of a final model approach will depend on discussions with the National Park Service and other designated parties. The f ollowing is a simple example offered for illustration. The approach is a Markov Chain. The first step is to define the states of nature. A state of nature is a situation described by a vector of variables. The variables could include the level of brucellosis infection, population level, and gender/age composition for all species. Mathematically sx Where s is a kx 1 vector and s i designates the ith state which is d escribed by a vector xi. To illustrate, consider a simple example with two species (A and B) each of which is either not infected or infected, and has low or high population. Then ,,, ,[,, , ]A Inf B Inf A Pop B Pop x zzz z= where the variable notation is apparent, with 0 designating no infection and 1 designating infection, 0 designating low population and 1 high population. If the situation is no infection and low population in both species for state 1 then 1[0, 0, 0, 0]s And if state 4 was no infection in A and infection in B, low population in A and high population in B then 4[0,1, 0,1]s To better approximate continuous variables there may be several levels of population or infection rates considered and the model expanded accordingly. The conditional (or transition) probability of moving from state i to state j is denoted as Pr( )= ij i jp ss must be developed for all i and j combinations. These probabilities have all the usual probability properties. Alternatively , Pr( | )= ij i jp s sC where C is a vector of control or management variables. Management variables may include whether to vaccinate, to implement a separation program, to test and remove, etc. Usually the transition probabilities are presented as a square matrix as P age 29 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 P=pij If P is constant over time then after T periods, PTprovides the probability of beginning in state i and endin g in state j after T periods. This approach allows estimation of the probabilistic outcomes for any initial state. The number of periods can easily be adjusted so that the time path of adjustments could be viewed. For example if a vaccination program was implemented, the change in infection rates over time could be calculated. The process can include adaptive management if C is constructed as a matrix so that the control or management strategy is dependent on the leaving state in any period. Given that t he P matrix has certain properties, steady state probabilities can be calculated. These are the probabilities of being in each state after a l ong period of time (convergence as T ). As PT, the matrix becomes monodesmic where each row vector becomes identical and equal to the steady state vector, . This means that the steady state vector is independent of the starting state. The steady state vector is reproducible meaning that P= = (PI )0 This system is underidentified , so a unique cannot be found. The identification problem is solved by recognizing the elements of sum to 1. The last column of PI is replaced with 1s and designated M and also the last element in the 0 vector is replaced with a 1 and designated 0. The steady state vector can then be calculated as M=0 =0M1 The steady state vector as well as the path to that vector is the management outcome information useful for evaluating different management strategies. Much other information can be obtained from this type of analysis. For example, the expected time until the next infection occurrence for a species (expected first passage time) can be calculated. The difficult challenge is developing the transition probabilities. There are several possible approaches. To the extent possible these probabilities will be obtained from the literature. The probabilities could also be developed from existing data using a variety of statistical techniques. The techniques include choosing a multivariate distributional form (e.g., Normal, Lognormal, Logistic, Dirichlet, Copula type) with the parameters usually found by moment matching. An alternative approach is the numerically intensive bootstrapping method. Another approach is the direct estimation of the probabilities by nonlinear estimation techniques using available data. There w ill be transition probabilities that are unavailable from the literature and for which there are insufficient data for estimation. These probabilities are likely to be based on the judgment of experts until better estimates become available at some future time. Page 30 of 40 Study Plan: 2 4-Mar -2014 References Al Dahouk, S., L.

Development and Modification of Insurance Rating Methodology for RMA-USDA Developed orthogonal decomposition methods to incorporate information from disparate sources and over different time intervals into premium rates. (Adopted in pilot areas/crops and under consideration by RMA.) Developed statistical indexing procedures that improve efficiency of crop insurance liability establishment procedures. (Adopted in pilot areas/crops and under consideration by RMA for expanded adoption .) Developed spatial statistical catastrophic loading/smoothing procedures. (Adopted in pilot areas/crops and under consideration by RMA for expanded adoption .) Developed several crop insurance products currently offered by RMA-USDA. Procedures adapted or under consideration by private insurance and reinsurance entities. Identification of Potential Waste, Fraud, and Abuse Developed statistical procedures (with corresponding computer code) to screen al l U.S. purchasers of crop insurance for potential yield switching fraud. RMA-USDA has applied procedure and code to all crop insurees. Identified potential waste, fraud, and abuse of provisions of RMA crop insurance products. Recommended corrective actions. RMA-USDA has implemented some recommendations and is considering others. Timothy W. T.

(MMD), Kansas City, MO Managed the global clinical development of Oncology/Anti-Infectives products Participated in the thorough examination and reorganization of the development program to reduce the time to registration of products The strategy was a minimalist approach to do only the minimum number of trials and patient numbers consistent with good medical practice and necessary for registration of a single indication for a compound No trials which did not support the primary indication would be done prior to submission Following submission, while the regulatory review process was ongoing, additional trials to support other indications and other needs would be started Time to registration was shortened, and the compound would bring in revenue while other indications were being studied Revised the oncology development program and shortened the clinical time down to 3.5- 4 years Chaired an ad-hoc task force to examine career development in the clinical research department Critical skill sets in clinical development were defined for the CRA level to Vice-President level Plans were instituted to increase each individual 's skills to the next higher level Other departments within MMD adopted these skill sets and criteria for career development and advancement for their personnel. Specifications for central laboratory selection were drawn saving company about $600,000 per year As part of an appointed 3 member team, assembled the results of an extensive internal assessment of the research capabilities within MMD Integrated these with the current market desires of the commercial department Provided focus to the strategic direction of the various therapeutic areas, Identified compounds and areas necessary for licensing-in, acquisition, and/or collaboration In 1995, appointed to the Faculty at Kansas University Medical School, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine. 1992 -1994 IMMUNOMEDICS, Inc., Morris Plains, N.J.
