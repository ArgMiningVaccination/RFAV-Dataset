Introducing the POD, a revolutionary breakthrough in technology that utilizes the many health benefits of infrared technology. What is far-infrared radiant heat? Far-infrared radiant (FIR) heat is a form of naturally occurring energy that heats objects by direct light conversion (DLC). All life requires FIR heat from the sun. FIR heat produces the same useful energy as the sun without the harmful ultraviolet rays or electromagnetic field radiation. [ FIR hea](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3699878/)t is not ultraviolet radiation but a narrow band of energy that penetrates 1.5 - 2 deep into the body to increase circulation and nourish damaged tissue. It warms our body from the inside out, stimulates our immune system and eliminates waste material through skin pores (the body eliminates toxins naturally by sweating) and promotes blood circulation. The deep heat of the POD helps peripheral blood vessels dilate, bringing relief and healing to muscle and soft tissue injuries. Increased blood circulation carries off metabolic waste products and delivers oxygen-rich blood to oxygen-depleted muscles, speeding healing time. What are the benefits of FIR heat? The benefits of FIR heat include: Detoxification, Lymphatic Massage, Oxygen Therapy, Vibratory Massage, Aromatherapy, and Weight Loss. Detoxification: Increased blood circulation stimulates sweat glands releasing built up toxins and waste. The profuse sweating brought on by being in the POD carries off deeply embedded impurities and dead skin cells and brings skin's own natural nutrients to the surface. Daily sweating detoxifies the body as it rids itself of the accumulation of heavy metals, alcohol, nicotine, sodium, mercury, sulfuric acid and cholesterol. Lymphatic Massage: As you lie in the POD, FIR helps loosen and relax muscles in conjunction with vibratory massage of the upper and lower body. A stagnant lymphatic system can reduce the body's ability to cleanse bacteria, viruses and cancer cells. In addition, lymphatic blockage can lead to frequent cold and flu systems, joint pain, headaches, GI issues, acne, cellulite, allergy and food sensitivities, breast disorders, menstrual cramps and moodiness. In summary, the intermingling of these two modalities (FIR and vibratory massage) will facilitate optimal lymphatic flow. Oxygen Therapy: Oxygen therapy can be delivered by mask or nasal cannula. It can also flow freely through the POD chamber where it mixes with the FIR to enhance its effectiveness. Oxygen serves to temporarily increase the body's white blood cell (WBC) count. Because WBC's are the natural antagonist of toxins and infection, the oxygen serves to enhance the immune system by boosting cellular immunity as well as further detoxifying the body. Vibratory Massage: The benefits of massage are widely known. Based upon individual preferences the user can vary the amount of vibratory massage to be administered to the upper and lower body. Aromatherapy: Aromatherapy is a form of healing that utilizes the properties and aromas of essential plant oils. These oils have been used for thousands of years to facilitate healing because of the influence over the mind, body and soul. Essential oils are absorbed into the body through the skin and the nose. When inhaled, these oils reach the brain in less than two seconds. They are also absorbed through the skin pores. By either means they enter into the blood stream bringing oxygen and nutrition and helping to remove carbon dioxide and other waste products. Weight Loss: As you relax in the POD, listening to your favorite music your body is hard at work, producing sweat, pumping blood and burning calories. Studies have shown that a single thirty minute FIR session burns approximately 200 calories. As the body heats up (the POD can reach temperatures of 180 F) it begins to perspire. This process increases the overall metabolic rate. To do so, huge amounts of energy are necessary which in turn reduces the body's excess salt and subcutaneous fat. Fat becomes water soluble at 100 F thereby permitting it to be eliminated along with toxins during the sweating process. What to expect of a POD session Each basic session consists of FIR, lymphatic massage and vibratory massage. We offer half sessions (20 minutes) and full sessions (40 minutes). We can, however, customize the length of the session. Using advanced state of the art computerized technology we are able to tailor each session to the individual's needs: weight loss, detoxification, etc. We recommend that you wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing, such as you might wear to the gym, and bring a towel, as you will be doing a lot of sweating. Feel free to bring your favorite CD to take advantage of the POD's incredible sound system. Everyone begins with a 20 minute session so as not to detoxify too quickly. Subsequent sessions will be 40 minutes. Adjustments in temperature and length of session can be made during the detoxification process. The average adult detoxification will take 6 to 8 full sessions and should be followed by a maintenance program. "}
