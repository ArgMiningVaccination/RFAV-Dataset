Whorton Ed Note: Dr. James C. Whorton is one of America's most distinguished medical historians. As a faculty member in the medical school at the University of Washington in Seattle, his researchover the past two decades has pri- marily focussed on the often antag- onistic relations between theworlds of alternative medicine, physical culture, and traditionalmedicine. In addition to his latestbook\u2014 Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002)\u2014many IGH readers would find Dr. Whorton's earlier book,Crusaders for Fitness, of great interest. Published in 1982, Crusaders for Fitness details the history of the pioneers of fit- ness and includes discussions of such major figures as Bernarr Macfadden, Sylvester Gra- ham, William Alcott and others. Much of the research for Nature Cures was done here at the Phys- ical Culture Collection at the University of Texas, Austin; we were delighted to be able to assist Dr. Whorton.Benedict Lust in 1911.one consider s that the notio n of complemen - tarines s that has blossome d so profusel y over the last decad e is one that has per- vade d naturopathi c though t from the profession' s beginnings .

Strictl y speaking , of course , naturopath y mean s \"natura l dis- ease, \" not \"natura l healing, \" and from the beginnin g the term was criticized , even by naturopaths , as misleading . Nevertheless bedroc k naturo - pathi c etiolog y was that indee d \"natura l disease \" is the roo t of all illness , becaus e bodil y dysfunctio n can invari - ably be trace d to violation s of nature' s rules of righ t living . Thi s view was graphicall y presente d in a \"tre e of dis- ease\" draw n by naturopat lahr in the 1910s . Ther e one was show n the full rang e of huma n infirmities , from colds to cancer , growin g out of a trun k impaire d by wha t was labele d \"Accu - mulatio n of Morbi d Matte r in The Sys- tem.\" The soil from whic h the trun k of physica l impurit y rises is that of \"Viola - tion of Nature' s Laws \" of diet, exercise , and othe r com - ponent s of hygiene , violation s occurrin g becaus e of humanity' s ignorance , self-control , and self-indulgence . Wher e allopathi c doctor s blame d diseas e on insult s to the body from outside , particularl y infectio n with microbes , early naturopath s saw all sick - ness originatin g withi n the bod y (\"Germs \" appea r amon g the tree' s branches , but they are labele d as a dis- ease, not a cause) . Rathe r than bein g the innocen t victi m of some alien pathologi c entity , each perso n was respon - sible for attackin g his own body with unnatura l habit s of life; illnes s was nature' s punishment for the self-abuse . From that perspective , \"natura l disease \" was an apt interpretatio n of naturopathy.2 Still, the preferre d translatio n was \"natura l heal - ing.\" Naturopathy, as Lust defined it, was an approach to healing that utilized \"the beneficent agency of Nature' s forces. \" Thos e force s coul d be administere d in every form from wate r and herb s to electricit y and sun- light, but in ever y case operate d the sam e way , by assist - ing natur e to remov e the \"Accumulatio n of Morbi d Mat- ter\" in the body . As Lust define d it in 1903 , naturopath y was a syste m of \"Pathologica l Monis m and Therapeuti c Universalism\"; it recognized only one disease\u2014inhibi-Benedict Lust began the Yungborn Nature Cure in 1896 on 60 acres in the Ramapo Mountains near Butler, New Jersey.

Indeed , the final goal of natura l treatments , as Lus t saw it, was not the eliminatio n of physica l disease , but the restoratio n of huma n beings ' appreciatio n of their prope r plac e in the natural order of the cosmos. The \"principal object\" of naturopathy , he asserted , was \"to h the unio n of man' s body , brain , hear t and all bodil y functions \u2014 with nature. \" Advocatin g wha t a later generatio n woul d call holisti c healin g and ecologica l medicine , Lus t require d matriculant s at his American Schoo l of Natur - opath y to stud y not only herbalism and hydrotherapy , but also such subject s as Self-Culture , Menta As the cours e on God-Consciousnes s suggests , early naturopath y was energize d nearl y as muc h by reli- gious current s as medica l ones . Prerequisit e for the ide- al of unio n of body , brain , and hear t with natur e was the awarenes s that peopl e are being s withi n a univers e cre- ated and governe d by a beneficen t God , and that the laws 23October 2003 Iron Game Historyof healt h are divin e commandment s whos e honorin g earns favo r from the Creato r and whos e violatio n bring s deserve d punishment . Lus t looke d all the way back to the Garde n of Ede n to fram e his physica l theology . There , he sermonized , \"man did not suffe r from sick - ness, \" but lived in perfec t healt h on \"wha t mothe r Eart h produced. \" The n cam e the Fall , an act of disobedienc e whic h involved , after all, \"a forbidde n meal, \" an act of unnatura l hygiene . Ada m and Eve wer e expelled , and \"man no mor e remaine d in direc t connectio n with the earth....I n the sam e measur e as man grew mor e unnatu - ral and sinful , sicknes s and all miser y arose.\"5 The unnatura l and the sinfu l wer e linke d in the naturopathi c worldvie w by practitioners ' commitmen t to vitalism , the belie f that life derive s from and is sustaine d by som e powe r or spiri t that transcend s the chemica l and physica l force s that gover n the phenomen a of the inor - ganic world . Natura l method s worke d becaus e they act- ed upo n the vita l forc e residen t withi n ever y huma n being , stimulatin g it to restor e the bod y to wholeness . But that force , naturopath s proclaimed , was not merel y vital; it was in fact divin e spirit , ever y livin g thing' s parce l of \"the Omnipoten t Power , whic h create d the uni- verse. \" It was Therapeuti c Universalis m indeed!6 If the vita l forc e wer e the sam e as omnipote nt power , it followe d that the miser y generate d by unnatu - ral livin g coul d as readil y be spiritua l as physical . In one naturopath' s telling , \"transgressio n of natura l law \" was responsibl e not jus t for all bodil y bu t \"all...poverty , misery , worry , vice and crime \" as well . And by the sam e token , the perfectio n attainabl e throug h living in accor d with natur e was spiritua l and not just physical .

Ma y Thes e Thing s Be!\"7 Natur e cure , in short , was, as Lust put it, \"a grea t sociologica l movement, \" a movemen t that \"fall s in line with Christ's petition, Thy kingdom come!'\" In the kingdo m to be create d by natur e cure , one woul d find \"the new man , the new woman , the new citize n of the coming era, the era of peace and good will to all mankind.\" The naturopath, another practitioner testi-fied, \"believe s in his syste m not only as a scienc e and an art, but as a religion that will, if followed, lead humani- ty to the heave n of healt h and happiness. \" In that context , it was possibl e for naturopath s to propos e in complet e seriousnes s that the first and still the greates t adheren t of the art was non e othe r than Christ ; Jesus , one asserted , was \"a mos t proficien t Naturopath. \" Imaginin g that sort of pedigree , it mad e sens e for Lust to set fort h the revolutionar y impor t of his syste m by observin g that a grea t spiritua l upheava l had occurre d in Western civilization approximately every 500 years, beginnin g with Chris t and followe d by Muhammad , the Crusades , the Reformation\u2014an d now naturopathy .8 Naturopath y expecte d to achiev e wha t earlie r religiou s movement s had vainl y attempte d to do by recruitin g erran t humanit y to wha t Lus t calle d the \"Regeneratio n Cure, \" a regime n of righ t livin g that restore d physica l strengt h and energ y whil e also bring - ing abou t a state of \"spiritual...rejuvenation. \" Towar d that end of regeneratio n of body and soul , naturopathy' s founde r establishe d in rural New Jerse y a natur e cam p of sorts that he calle d the Yungborn , or fountai n of youth .

Early to bed, early to rise, eat no meat , and exercis e is a prescriptio n for physica l well-bein g in any location . Nor is there any doub t as to Lust' s good intentions ; all that he wrote and all that was writte n abou t him attes t to his sin- cerity in wantin g peopl e to achiev e the highes t vitalit y and in believin g that his natur e cure was the sures t path to that end.

Worse was the willingness to accept into the naturopathi c fold any therapeuti c modalit y pre- sented as \"natural,\" no matter how outlandish themetho d or questionabl e the motivatio n of its proponent . A quick thumbing-through of any volume of The Natur- opath and Herald of Health, the field's chief journal, corroborate s the opinio n of D. D. Palmer , the founde r of chiropractic , that the naturopath y of his day was \"a pick up of anythin g and everythin g that thei r author s find lying aroun d loose. \" For a period , for example , the jour- nal had a \"Phrenologica l Section. \" The pseudo-scienc e of readin g characte r by the shap e of the skul l had been popula r for a perio d durin g the nineteent h century , but had bee n discredite d and largel y abandone d by the beginnin g of the twentieth .

Alternativ e medicine in the early 1900s was disordered by internecin e conflict . Chiropractor s and osteopaths , for example , despise d one anothe r as muc h as they did allopaths , and each of thos e system s was also rive n by faction s within . But naturopathy , governe d by a philo - l inclinatio n to presum e healin g powe r in ever y realm of nature , was mor e dispose d towar d cooperatio n than competition .
