It uses specially prepared, highly diluted substances with the aim of triggering the body's own healing mechanisms*. Homeopathy is based on the principle of \"like treats like\" - that is, a substance which can cause symptoms when taken in large doses, can be used in small amounts to support similar symptoms. For example, drinking too much coffee can cause sleeplessness and agitation, so according to this principle, when made into a homeopathic tincture, it could be used to support people suffering from sleeplessness and agitation. The principle of treating \"like with like\" dates back to Hippocrates (460-377BC) but in its current form, homeopathy has been widely used worldwide for more than 200 years. It was discovered by German doctor Samuel Hahnemann when he was looking for a way to reduce the damaging side effects associated with the medical treatment of his day.
