Design: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multicentre study. Setting: Four general practices and a hospital ear, nose, and throat outpatient department. Participants: 51 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. Intervention: Random assignment to an oral 30c homoeopathic preparation of principal inhalant allergen or to placebo. Main outcome measures: Changes from baseline in nasal inspiratory peak flow and symptom visual analogue scale score over third and fourth weeks after randomisation. Results: Fifty patients completed the study. The homoeopathy group had a significant objective improvement in nasal airflow compared with the placebo group (mean difference 19.8 l/min, 95% confidence interval 10.4 to 29.1, P=0.0001). Both groups reported improvement in symptoms, with patients taking homoeopathy reporting more improvement in all but one of the centres, which had more patients with aggravations. On average no significant difference between the groups was seen on visual analogue scale scores. Initial aggravations of rhinitis symptoms were more common with homoeopathy than placebo (7 (30%) v 2 (7%), P=0.04). Addition of these results to those of three previous trials (n=253) showed a mean symptom reduction on visual analogue scores of 28% (10.9 mm) for homoeopathy compared with 3% (1.1 mm) for placebo (95% confidence interval 4.2 to 15.4, P=0.0007). Conclusion: The objective results reinforce earlier evidence that homoeopathic dilutions differ from placebo. # Randomised controlled trial of homoeopathy versus placebo in perennial allergic rhinitis with overview of four trial series {#article-title-2} Objective: To test the hypothesis that homoeopathy is a placebo by examining its effect in patients with allergic rhinitis and so contest the evidence from three previous trials in this series.

Competing interests: I regularly consume water, the particles of which may have come into contact with all sorts of things in the past million years or so, a powerful drug indeed. No effect on me so far, but perhaps the antidotes have balanced out the poisons? Competing interests: No competing interests I am an administrator and though not clinically trained, I have a personal interest in this topic. To say \"It is not enough for trials to be made bigger, tighter, or whatever: those who seek to advance the cause of homoeopathy must come up with a reasonable notion of how the treatment might operate at molecular level\" is akin to saying \"You must prove to me that the world is round before I will believe it\". This was an understandable position hundreds of years ago, but even before it was proved, the world was still round. Competing interests: No competing interests Does nasal eosinophilia alone constitute allergic rhinitis? What about NARES? Suggest use of presence of specific IgE antibodies (in vitro or in vivo) in context of history and exam rather than eos. Refer to Crobach in Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care, 1998, vol 16, pp 16-30 Competing interests: No competing interests The responses to Taylor's paper on the homeopathical allergic rhinitis is a fascinating portrayal of the controversy surrounding homeopathy in the medical community. As someone who has spent almost a decade funded by NIH doing cancer research and a co-founder of the Center for Vitamins and Cancer Research at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in the early 1980's, I have had a continuing interest in experimentation with complementary medicine for over two decades. Since I am now in the information technology area of healthcare, my clinical research program has to be self funded, and on my own time. However, it has led to some significant insights that might be persued effectively by funded researchers. In fact, I am looking for a partner with a good microbiology lab as I write. After completely eliminating my chronic severe allergies with homeopathy to the point where regular allergy testing produced no response (to the consternation of clinicians), I have moved on to comparing electromagnetic instruments to homeopathic effects. Many allergic responses can be terminated within two minutes by zapping the allergens with the right freqency. Homeopathy can then be used to prevent recurrence. As another example, I can induce the same effect with Candida 100C as I can with treatment at the resonant frequency of Candida (usually in the 386KHZ range). This can be objectively measured by scanning with an FSCAN, an approved medical device in Europe, that pulses the body with various frequencies and listens for a resonant response. So, treating with Candida 100C eliminates resonant frequencies with the FSCAN. Treating with the FSCAN at the resonant frequency produces exactly the same result. This is true for many other infections. In recent years, I have specialized in the detection and treatment of parasites and always use homeopathy as an adjuvant treatment since it immediately, and consistently improves repeatable results. I believe these experiments can easily be replicated in any laboratory and could shed some light on the homeopathic response. So I am constantly amazed at the armchair philosophy expoused by researchers who have never done the experiments themselves to prove or disprove what they are saying. If there is anyone with a microbiology lab with a capacity to view results of treatments with homeopathy vs. frequency generators under a microscope, I would be interested in working together to resolve some of this ongoing debate. Simple experiments could be done in vitro to demonstrate consistent effects. The research program could then move on to in vivo studies. Standard drug treatment could be tested against control groups treated with homeopathy, electronic devices, and a placebo. With a Ph.D. in Biometrics, I could help design the trial. My thesis advisor was John Bailar, M.D., Ph.D., the New England Journal of Medicine biostatistican for more than a decade. He might even give us some help if we had a convincing proposal. Competing interests: No competing interests I have been taking homeopathic 6x nat mur (sodium chloride) to treat allergic rhinitis and house dust allergies for 24+ years. It is interesting to see that a drug was administered in a homeopathic form for this experiment. I have been interested in tissue salts for 24+ years. According to tissue salt theory there are 12 mineral salts which are all taken in homeopathic form which treat many ailments from rheumatism, gout, asthma, headaches, mental states and so on. There are two interesting things to note here. Firstly, that many disease conditions are actually mineral deficiency symptoms and secondly, that homeopathic dilutions of the minerals can be used to treat the deficiency symptoms. Note also that milligram doses have the same effect of treating the symptoms, except in the case of sodium chloride deficiency symptoms which must have the homeopathic form of the mineral to have any effect in treating deficiency symptoms. See my website at http://members.dynamite.com.au/hubbca Competing interests: No competing interests As a statistician I would be very interested in seeing data on the individual responses of the patients in the study. Did all or most patients respond favorably to homoeopathy? Was there a group who did not respond? If one had the full data set available, then one could make other analyses of the data that might throw further light on them. In general I think data from published studies should be made available to readers. Another statistical question: How do Bayesian statisticians react to this study? It might be an interesting excercise to see whether the results of Taylor et al are strong enough to override a highly sceptical prior distribution. Are there any Bayesians who would like to comment on this? Competing interests: No competing interests I was wrong to think that the prior probability that homeopathy works is obviously zero. Many of the responses suggest that it is obviously one. Is this the defining characteristic of a magical idea - the complete disagreement over prior probability? Competing interests: No competing interests Dear authors, it is very interesting that you give place in your magazine for homeopathy. I would like to say to the respectable members of the group who organized the research, that what they have done is not actually homeopathy, but something similar, and the astonishing thing is that even though it works! The real and original homeopathy doesnot give for treatmnet of the allergic rhinitis the allergen which mainly causes the problem in a potentized form! The real homeopathy gives the similimum ie the homeopathic medicine which is similar to the whole, to the constitution of the patient. We define as a constitution the totality of both the physical and the psychomental symptoms and characteristics of a patient. This medicine may be different in each patient and has nothing to do with the allergen \"causing\" the rhinitis. Only this medicine when is found after a careful analysis of the case from the MD, can show realy great results, end even cure the problem permanently. So I would suggest to do researches using the homeopathy in the right way, otherwise we cannot see the real therapeutical results can have in many cases of diseases. The Medical Institute for Homeopathic Research and Application, in Athens, is searching for scientist who are eager to work in this spirit, for collaboration. Yours sincerely Dr Christos Hadjicostas MD President of the Cyprus Medical Homeopathic Association. Competing interests: No competing interests Fallacious arguments Those who wish to be honest, scientifically speaking, should try to ban fallacious arguments from their \"reasoning\". Unfortunately, some doctors, while pretending to reason scientifically, did not hesitate to use fallacious arguments during the controversy that ensued the recent publication in the BMJ of an homeopathy trial [1]. Thus, these doctors more or less tried to [2-11]: - attack their opponents instead of attacking their opponents' arguments; - attack caricatured versions of their opponents' positions; - use the arguments that support their own positions, but ignore or even deny the arguments against; - assume that there were only two alternatives when in fact there were more; - discredit the sources used by their opponents; - use emotionally loaded words to sway the audience's sentiments instead of their minds; - etc. Do we have to conclude that Peter Morrell was right in writing that these doctors should not be called scientists in the sense of being original thinkers and experimentalists, but rather 'science believers' [10].
