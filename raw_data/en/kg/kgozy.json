Accreditation ensures schools are providing a standards-based education that combines traditional natural health knowledge with modern medical training. Schools are required to meet certain standards before being accredited and must be reaccredited at least every seven years. The complete list of Accredited naturopathic schools can be found under the Resources tab on the above menu bar.
