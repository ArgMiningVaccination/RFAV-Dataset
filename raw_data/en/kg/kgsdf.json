In the present study, we extracted polysaccharides from O. polyacantha and used size-exclusion chromatography to fractionate the crude as polysaccharides C-IV). The average Mrof fractions C-I through C-IV was estimated to be 733, 550, 310, and 168 kDa, respectively, and sugar composition analysisrevealed that Opuntia polysaccharides of galactose, galacturonic acid, rhamnose. Analysis of of Opuntia polysaccharides on human and murine macrophages demonstrated that all four fractions had potent immunomodulatoryactivity, inducing production of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor , and interleukin 6. Furthermore, modulation of macrophage function by Opuntia polysaccharides was mediated, at least in part, through activation of nuclear factor B. Together , our results provide a molecular basis to explain a portion of the beneficial therapeutic properties of extractsfrom O. polyacantha and support the concept of using Opuntia polysaccharides as an immunotherapeutic adjuvant. \u00a9 2008 Nitric oxide;Cytokines Stimulation of the innate immune system with immunomodu- lators can increase host resistance to unforeseen pathogenic threats [1], and a number of innate system immunomodulatorshave been identified, including cytokines [2],s u b s t a n c e s isolated from microorganisms and fungi [3], and substances isolated from plants [4,5] . Indeed, a wide range of bioactive polysaccharides have been isolated from various medicinal plants, and these polysaccharides have been shown to possessimmunomodulatory activity through their ability to modulate macrophage function (reviewed in [6]).

For example, fruits and stems of many Opuntia species have been used in folk medicine for burns, wounds, edema,bronchial asthma, hypertension, indigestion, and type II diabetes (reviewed in [10,11] ). Extracts of fruits and stems from Opuntia s p e c i e sh a v eb e e nr e p o r t e dt oe x h i b i t hypoglycemic [12], antiulcer [13],antioxidant [14], anti- inflammatory activity [15],h e p a t o p r o t e c t i v e [16],a n d neuroprotective [17] activities. While glycoproteins and proanthocyanidins, carotenoid s, betalains, beta-sterols, and alpha-pyrones have been be among theactive principles of Opuntia species [13,15,18 22], little is known regarding the medicinal properties of polysaccharides from Opuntia , and essentially nothing is known regarding their potential immunomodulatory properties. Indeed, themain substance produced by these plants is mucilage composed primarily of water and polysaccharides, which helps prevent dehydration and freezing of their tissues. Among the numerous Opuntia species, bioactive poly- saccharides have been isolated and , Opuntia ficus-indica [12,23 26]. Poly- saccharides from this species have been reported to exhibit hypoglycemic activity [12] and enhance re-epithelization in a model of dermal wounding [25]. Although macrophages play an important role in cutaneous wound healing (reviewed in[27]), the potential immunomodulatory effects of poly- saccharides from Opuntia in this process were not evaluated. Based on previous studies showing that many plant poly-saccharides enhance immune function by activation of macrophages (reviewed in [6]), we suggest that at least part of the effects of Opuntia polysaccharides on wound healing is through modulation of macrophage function. Thus, it is now important to address this question and further define the contribution of polysaccharides to the therapeuticproperties of Opuntia tissues. In the present study , we extracted polysaccharides from O. polyacantha and isolated four polysaccharide fractions (desig- as C-I C-IV). Analysis and human monocyte/macrophages demonstrated that Opuntia polysaccharides activated the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species, and cytokines, andstimulated nuclear factor B (NF- B). The ability of O. polyacantha polysaccharides to modulate macrophage func- tion suggests they may contribute to the therapeutic potentialof tissues derived from this plant species. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Reagents BioChemica (Buchs, Switzerland) and 8-amino-5-chloro-7-phenylpyrido[3,4-d]pyridazine-1,4-(2H,3H)dione coli K-235 were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Dulbecco's modifiedEagle's medium (DMEM) and endotoxin-free fetal bovine granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). 2.2. Purification and fractionation of polysaccharides Stems of cactus O. polyacantha were collected near Big Timber , MT . The fresh O. polyacantha stems (1.8 kg) were washed with distilled H 2O, homogenized, extracted with 6 l distilled H 2O, and the aqueous extract was centrifuged at 2000 \u00d7g for 15 min. A four-fold volume of ethanol was added to the supernatant to precipitate polysaccharides overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The centrifugation, re-dissolved in distilled H 2O, sonicated for 10 min, and centrifuged at 11,000 \u00d7g for 1 h. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.22 m filter and concentrated in an Amicon concentrator with a 5 kDa PM5 membrane to obtainthe crude polysaccharide extract (yield of 0.4% by weight). The crude polysaccharide extract was fractionated by chromatography (SEC) on equilibrated with 0.01 M Tris -HCl buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.15 M NaCl and eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 21 ml/h. The carbohydrate elutionprofile was determined by the phenol -H 2SO4method, and absorbance was measured at 488 nm using a SpectraMax Plus microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA). Therelevant fractions were pooled, concentrated, and lyophi-lized. For analysis of biological activity, the fractions were diluted in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) at the indicated concentrations (w/v) and filtered through sterile0.22 m filters. 2.3. Characterization of polysaccharide fractions The pooled polysaccharide fractions were analyzed for protein content using a modified Lowry assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard, and carbohydrate content was determined by the phenol H2SO4method with glucose as a standard. For nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, samples (5 mg) were dissolved in deuterium oxide (0.5 ml), and1H NMR spectra were recorded on a sodium salt as an reference ppm). The homogeneity and average Mrof the determined by high performance size-exclu- sion chromatography SB-804 HQ column mm\u00d7300 mm)eluted with 50 mM sodium citrate buffer , pH 7.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl and 0.01% NaN 3at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Peaks were detected using a refractive index detector (RID-10A; Shimadzu, Torrance, CA). Average M rof the Opuntia1456 I.A. Schepetkin et al.polysaccharide fractions were estimated by comparison with retention times of pullulan standards P-800, 400, 200, 100,50 and 20 (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), which have M rof 788, 404, 212, 112, 47.3, and 22.8 kDa, respectively. Reproducibility of the retention times was typically N98%. The presence of arabinogalactan in the samples was detected by single radial gel diffusion in 1% agarose gels containing 100 II arabinogalactan structures. Four micro- liters of polysaccharide samples (10 mg/ml; w/v) were loaded into the wells, and the samples were incubated at25\u00b0C for 24 h in a humid atmosphere. A positive reaction was identified by a reddish circle around the well, and arabic gum (4 mg/ml) served as a positive control. For monosaccharide composition analysis, samples were hydrolyzed at 100 \u00b0C for 6 h with 3 M TFA, and the resulting samples were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC)on Whatman silica gel 60 plates using monosaccharide standards for reference. The plates were developed with butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1), and bands were visua-lized acetone) and heating at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min. Individual monosaccharide bands were scraped off the plate, extractedwith H 2O, and quantified using a colorimetric method with monosaccharide standards. Briefly, the extracts were mixed anthrone reagent (0.2% anthrone and 1% thiourea inH at 100 \u00b0C for 10 min, absorbance was measured at used to evaluate Opuntia polysaccharide samples for possible LPS contamination. To further evaluate the possible role of endotoxin, Opuntia polysaccharide fraction C-I was applied to a column containing Detoxi-GelEndotoxin Removing Gel (Pierce, St. Louis, MO) and elutedwith 0.05 M phosphate buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl to decrease ionic interactions of sample molecules with the affinity ligand. The concentration of polysaccharides in theeluted sample was adjusted to match that of the untreated fraction, as determined by the phenol -H 2SO4method, and both treated and untreated samples were analyzed forbiological activity, as described below. 2.5. Cell cultures Murine macrophage J774.A1 cells were and 100 U/ml penicillin. Cells were grown to confluence in sterile tissue culture flasksand gently detached by scraping. Human monocyte-macro-phage MonoMac6 cells (DSMZ, penicillin. Human monocytic THP1-Blue cells obtained from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA) were RPMI stably transfected with a secreted embryonic alkalinephosphatase gene that is under the control of a promoter inducible by nuclear factor B (NF- B). All cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmo- sphere containing 5% CO 2. Cell number and viability were assessed microscopically using trypan blue exclusion. 2.6. Human monocytes-derived macrophages Blood was collected from healthy donors in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board atMontana State University. Mononuclear cells were purifiedfrom the blood using dextran sedimentation, followed by Histopaque 1077 gradient separation and hypotonic lysis of red blood cells, as described previously [28]. Adherent monocytes were cultured for 7 days in RPMI-1640 containing 10% endotoxin-free FBS and 50 macrophage differentiation. Optimal conditions were main-tained by refreshing the medium and cytokines every 3 days. 2.7. Analysis of NO production J774.A1 cells were plated at a density of 1.5\u00d7105cells/well in a final volume of 200 l in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates and incubated in medium alone or medium containing various concentrations of polysaccharide frac-tions or E. coli LPS as a positive control. Cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO 2for 24 h, and 100 l of the cell culture supernatants were removed and analyzed for NOusing a colorimetric method with NaNO 2as the standard. Briefly, supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of Griess reagent, which was prepared by mixing one part of0.1% (w/v) N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine with one part of 1% 5% phosphoric acid. After 20 min, was measured at 540 nm using a SpectraMax Plusmicroplate reader. 2.8. Analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production Macrophage ROS production was analyzed using the chemi- luminescent probe, L-012, which is highly sensitive Murine J774.A1 macrophages with various concentrations of polysaccharide fractions or posi-tive control (LPS) for 24 h. After incubation, the culture supernatant was removed and replaced by an equal volume of HBSS supplemented with 25 M L-012 and 5 g/ml horseradish peroxidase with or without 100 nM PMA, as described previously [29]. Reactions were monitored on a Fluoroscan Ascent FL microtiter reader (ThermoElec-tron, Milford, MA) at 37 \u00b0C. Chemiluminescence wasmeasured every 2 min for 2 h and is expressed as the integrated response over this time (arbitrary units). 2.9. Determination of TNF- and IL-6 Cells were incubated for 24 h in culture media supplemented with 3% (v/v) endotoxin-free FBS with or without Opuntia polysaccharide fractions LPS as a positive control in 96-well1457 Macrophage immunomodulatory activity of polysaccharides isolated from Opuntia a density of 2\u00d7105cells/well. Human monocyte- derived macrophages were plated in 96-well adensity of 6\u00d710 assay (ELISA) Biosciences Pharmigen) were detect TNF- /IL-6 in the cell supernatants. Cytokine concentrations were deter- mined by extrapolation from TNF- /IL-6 standard curves, according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2.10. Analysis of NF- B activation Activation of NF- B was measured using an alkaline phosphatase reporter gene assay in THP1-Blue humanmonocytic cells. One week before an experiment, the cells were pre-activated overnight with PMA (50 ng/ml) to induce differentiation and plated in 96-well plates at a cell densityof 2\u00d710 5cells/well. The cells were then incubated for 5 days with daily media changes. On day 7, Opuntia polysaccharide fractions or LPS (100 ng/ml) were added, the cells wereincubated for 24 h, and alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in cell supernatan ts using QUANTI-Blue mix(InvivoGen, San Diego, CA). Activation of NF- B is reported as an absorbance at 655 nm and compared with positive control samples (LPS). 2.11. Cytotoxicity assay Cytotoxicity was analyzed with a Kit (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI) accord-ing to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were cultured at a density of 3\u00d710 4cells/well with the poly- saccharide fractions for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2. Following treatment, the cells were allowed to equilibrate to roomtemperature for 30 min, substrate was added, and the samples were analyzed with a Fluoroscan Ascent FL. 2.12. Statistical analysis T wo-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the indicated sets of data (GraphPad Prism Software, San Diego,CA). Pair-wise comparisons with differences at Pb0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. 3. Results 3.1. Preparation and characterization of Opuntia polysaccharides Polysaccharides chromatography toobtain four main fractions, which were selected based on the total carbohydrate elution profile (designated as Opuntia polysaccharides C-I, C-II, C-III, and C-IV) ( Fig. 1 A). Each of the four fractions contained at least 96% carbohydrate and 2% protein ( Table 1 ). Negligible levels of protein were also previously reported in mucilage of O. ficus-indica [30]. Analytical HP-SEC of the individual fractions showed that each fraction was represented by a single, generally symmetrical peak on the chromatogram ( Fig. 1 B), suggesting the polysaccharide fractions were relatively homogeneous. Based on calibration curves derived from analysis of pullulan standards, we deter- mined that the average molecular weights of polysaccharidefractions C-I through C-IV were 733, 550, 310 and 168 kDa,respectively ( Table 1 ). Analysis of the fractions using the Yariv test showed that fractions C-III and C-IV contained type II arabinogalactan; whereas, fractions C-I and C-II tested negativefor the presence of this type of arabinogalactan ( Table 1 ). Sugar composition analysis revealed that polysaccharides of size-exclusion using Sepharose 6B column chromatography, and the eluate was combined to four fractions (designated C-I through C-IV). Total carbohy- drate content of the fractions was determined as described (detected at 488 nm). Panel B. The Opuntia polysaccharide fractions were analyzed by HP-SEC, and eluates were monitoredwith a refractive index detector , as described. The arrows indicate the peak retention times of the indicated pullulan standards used for calibration.Table 1 2 C-II 550 Negative 99 b1 C-III 310 Positive 98 b1 C-IV 168 Positive 98 b11458 I.A. Schepetkin et al.Very-high-field (600 MHz)1H NMR was characterize the structure of native Opuntia polysaccharides ( Fig. 2 ). The spectra from all fractions were similar to each other , suggestinga common backbone structure, and resembled the spectra of polysaccharides isolated from O. ficus-indica [30]. The weak signals present at 3.38 3.45 ppm can be assigned to - rhamnopyranose ( -Rha p), while the strong signals at 3.68 - 3.90 ppm are consistent with the presence of -galactopyranose (-Gal p)[31]. The signals at 4.05 -5.05 ppm are consistent with the presence Opuntia polysaccharides on macrophage NO and ROS production A minimum amount of NO was produced when murine J774.A1 macrophages were incubated with medium alone; whereas, treatment of these cells with any of the four Opuntia polysaccharide fractions resulted in a concentration-dependentincrease in NO production ( Fig. 3 A), with fraction C-I being the most active. Indeed, NO production induced by fraction C-I at 800g/ml was comparable to that induced by 100 ng/ml LPS. In the absence of any treatment, murine J774.A1 macrophages generated very low levels of ROS ( Fig. 4 , control); whereas, a concentration-dependent enhancement of ROS production wasobserved in macrophages treated with 25 400g/ml doses of eachpolysaccharide fraction, with fraction C-I being the most active (Figs. 3B and 4 ). Thus, the individual polysaccharide fractions from O. polyacantha showed a similar pattern with respect to their ability to induce NO and ROS production by murine J774.A1 macrophages (C-I NC-IINC-IIINC-IV). Since endotoxin (LPS) is often a contaminant in biological preparations, we evaluated possible contribution of endotoxinTable 2 Monosaccharide composition of 12 C-II 35 15 25 15 10C-III 43 19 20 12 6 C-IV 48 18 17 10 6 Monosaccharides were identified and quantified based on TLC analysis of known standards.

Figure 3 Effect of Opuntia polysaccharides on J774.A1 macrophageswere incubated for 24 h with positive control). NO production was quantified by measuring nitrite in the cell-free supernatants (Panel A), and chemiluminescence was monitored using an L-012 detection system, as described (Panel B). Values are the mean\u00b1 S.D. of triplicate samples from one experiment, which is representative of two independent experiments. Statistically significant differences ( Pb0.05) between untreated cells and cells polyacanthato the observed biological activity of Opuntia polysaccharides. All fractions caused a similar positive Limulus response (data not shown), suggesting polysaccharides present in our fractions were also activating the Limulus coagulation cascade (see Discussion). Thus, we evaluated NO production by macrophages treated with Opuntia polysaccharide fractions or LPS in the presence and absence of polymyxin B. As shown in Fig. 5 , polymyxin B almost completely suppressed macrophage NO production induced by LPS ( N90% inhibition). In comparison, polymyxin B only slightly reduced responses induced by the individual Opuntia polysac- charide fractions ( b25% inhibition), suggesting that the observed responses were not due to LPS contamination. The small amount of inhibition observed with polymyxin B treatment is likely due to nonspecific effects of this compound on the cells (see Discussion). To eliminate this artifact, we pretreated Opuntia polysaccharide samples (fraction C-I) by elution through a column of endotoxin-removing gel so that the cells were not exposed directly to polymyxin B and found that treatedpolysaccharides were just as active as untreated samples. This control, which is present in subsequent assays, further demon- strates LPS contamination is not responsible for the responsesobserved (see Figs. 6 10). To determine whether human phagocytes also responded to Opuntia polysaccharides, we analyzed their ability to activate ROS production by human MonoMac6 macrophages. Opuntia polysaccharides stimulated low levels of ROS production by MonoMac6 cells in a concentration-dependent manner ( Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, Opuntia polysaccharides significantly enhanced PMA-mediated activation of ROS production by MonoMac6 cells (Fig. 6 B), suggesting these polysaccharides can prime cells similar to LPS. Note, however , that pretreatment of fraction C-I withendotoxin-removing gel had no effect on its activity, indicating Figure 4 Kinetics of ROS production by murine macrophages stimulated with Opuntia polysaccharides. J774.A1 cells were h with polysaccharide fraction C-I (800 g/ml), and chemiluminescence was monitored, as described. Values are the mean\u00b1S.D. of triplicate samples from one experiment,which is representative of three independent experiments.

Murine J774.

Values are the mean\u00b1S.D. of triplicate samples from one experiment, which is representative of two independent experiments.

Chemiluminescence was monitored using an L- 012 detection system in unstimulated cells (Pane A) and cellsstimulated with 100 nM PMA (Panel B). Values are the mean\u00b1S.D. of triplicate samples from one experiment, which is representative of two independent experiments. Statistically significant differences(Pb0.05) between untreated cells and cells treated with fractions the effect was not due to LPS contamination ( Fig. 6 ). Overall, these data verify that Opuntia polysaccharides are not specific for murine phagocytes and can also activate human phagocytes. 3.3. Effect Opuntia polysaccharides on macrophage TNF-and A number of immunomodulatory compounds can regulate cytokine production. Thus, we analyzed the effects of Opuntia polysaccharide little TNF- and IL-6; whereas, incubation of these cells with the Opuntia polysaccharide fractions significantly enhanced TNF- and IL-6 production in a concen- tration-dependent manner ( Figs. 7 and 8 ). These responses were quite robust, and the levels of TNF- induced by 20 40g/ml of fraction C-I were comparable to those induced by 50 ng/ml LPSin both murine and human cells. Furthermore, cytokineproduction induced by fraction C-I was essentially the same for untreated samples and samples pretreated with endotoxin-removing gel, further demonstrating that LPS is not responsible for the observed effects ( Figs. 7 and 8 B). The effect of Opuntia polysaccharides on macrophage TNF- production was also confirmed in human primary monocyte- derived macrophages. All fractions induced TNF- production by monocyte-derived macrophages ( Fig. 9 ). Again, responses were not significantly different between untreated and polymyxingel-pretreated samples of fraction C-I. Thus, these results indicate that Opuntia polysaccharides induce a significant up- regulation of TNF- and IL-6 synthesis in murine as well as in human macrophages. 3.4. Effect of Opuntia polysaccharides on nuclear factor kappa B (NF- B) activation To evaluate signaling pathways involved in the immunomodulatory activity of Opuntia polysaccharides, we utilized a transcription Figure Effect of Opuntia polysaccharides on macrophage TNF-production.

For both panels, values are the mean\u00b1S.D. of triplicate samples from one experiment, which is representativeof two independent experiments.

Note also that the activity of untreated fraction C-I was not significantly differentthan that of fraction C-I pretreated endotoxin-removing gel(Fig. 10 ). 3.5. Effect of Opuntia polysaccharides on cell viability Although our functional assays suggested that Opuntia poly- saccharides were relatively non-toxic, we evaluated the poten-tial cytotoxic effect of the polysaccharides to determine if the results might be influenced by background toxicity. Using a cytotoxicity assay, we determined that none of the fractionssignificantly affected proliferation/viability of J774.A1 cells overthe entire concentration range of polysaccharide fractions tested (100 800g/ml), verifying that these polysaccharides were not toxic to these cells ( Fig. 11 ). 4. Discussion Since ancient times, fruits and stems of different species of the genus Opuntia have been used in remedies for treating a number of medical problems. For example, the stems of O. polyacantha have been used to treat infections and wounds [33], which suggests that O. polyacantha extracts might have immune-enhancing effects. Despite the wide-spread use of O. polyacantha ,l i t t l ei sk n o w nr e g a r d i n gt h ea c t i v e components responsible for its therapeutic properties.Previous studies indicated that some of the biological properties of O. polyacantha were due to the presence glycoproteins and low-molecular weight -pyrones [13,15,18 22]. the present report, we provide evidence suggesting that polysaccharides of O. polyacantha have potent immunomodulatory properties that can enhance monocyte/macrophage function and suggest that this may contribute, at least in part, to the therapeutic potential of O. polyacantha tissues.

Schepetkin et al.We isolated four polysaccharide fractions from the stems ofO. polyacantha and provide initial structural and pharma- cological characterization. Average molecular weights of the fractions were 733, 550, 310, and 168 kDa for fractions C-I through C-IV , respectively, and sugar composition was similarto the monosaccharide composition of polysaccharides isolated from another cactus species, O. ficus-indica [30,34] . Analysis of the fractions using the Yariv test showed that two relatively high molecular weight Opuntia polysac- charide fractions C-I and C- II lacked arabinogalactan; whereas, the other fractions (C-III and C-IV) tested positive for the presence of type II arabinogalactan ( Table 1 ). Type II arabinogalactans have a -(1,3)-linked galactan backbone with side chains containing arabinose and galactose residues and have been reported to possess a variety of biologicalactivities [4]. Indeed, in polysaccharide fractions C-III and C- monosaccharide and repre- sented N40 mol% of the total sugars in these fractions. However , the most potent biological properties were asso- ciated with fractions C-I and C-II. Thus, type II arabinoga- lactans do not appear to be the main structures responsiblefor macrophage-activating properties of the Opuntia poly- saccharides. This observation is supported by our previous studies on other plant-derived polysaccharides [35,36] . Macrophages play critical roles in host defense, including phagocytosis of pathogens and apoptotic cells, production of cytokines, and proteolytic processing and presentation of foreign antigens (reviewed in [37]). Thus, the identification of agents that can modulate macrophages is of significant interest. Indeed, a variety of plant polysaccharides have been reported to exhibit beneficial pharmacological effectsvia their ability to modulate macrophage function (reviewed in[6]). In this study, all Opuntia polysaccharides contained potent macrophage immunomodulatory activity, as demon-strated of effector molecules, such as NO, ROS,and In addition, treatment with Opuntia poly- saccharides before PMA resulted in a significantly enhanced response, which is indicative of a priming effect. Manyimmunomodulatory compounds, including LPS, can prime phagocytes for enhanced ROS production, and it is generally thought that priming plays a key role in the host defenseprocess and may be essential for host survival against microbial pathogens [38].N o t et h a tm a c r o p h a g eR O S production plateaued or even decreased slightly at higherpolysaccharide concentrations, especially with murinemacrophages. Based on our previous studies showing that Artemisia polysaccharides can scavenge ROS [36], we suggest that this effect may be due, at least in part, to ROSscavenging by residual Opuntia polysaccharides present in the wells ( b10% of the initial concentrations), since the cells were not washed when the medium was replaced with freshmedium containing the detection reagents. Indeed, we found that all of the Opuntia polysaccharide fractions exhibited ROS scavenging activity in an enzymatic ROS-generating system, with the high molecular weight fractions C-I and C-II being the most active (data not shown). Thus, wells treated with the highest polysaccharide concentrationswould have the greatest residual polysaccharide concentra-tions and the greatest ROS scavenging effect, which would explain the apparent plateau in ROS production. Never- theless, further studies are needed to fully evaluate the ROSscavenging properties of Opuntia polysaccharides.The macrophage immunomodulatory activity seems to positively correlated with theaverage molecular weight of the polysaccharides, with higher molecular weight fractions being the most active. This may be a common feature of plant polysaccharides thatmodulate macrophage function, as we found previously that biological activity correlated with molecular weight for polysaccharides isolated of mannans from Aloe vera [40] and -glucans from mushrooms [41] was found to correlate with increased size. Overall, these observationssuggest that Opuntia and other plant-derived polysacchar- ides may activate macrophages via receptor(s) or other surface structures, although the nature of these surfacetargets is currently unknown. The potent macrophage- stimulatory effect of high molecular weight polysaccharides may also be related to their highly repetitive structures,which could cross-link receptors or other membrane targets in a multivalent fashion [40]. Clearly, further studies are necessary to identify the cellular target of these polysac-charides and understand the relationship between theirmolecular weight and biological activity. For example, it is not clear how such plant-derived polysaccharides are metabolized in the gut and whether this affects theirbioavailability. Traditionally, extracts from Opuntia species have been used topically for treatment of wounds and burns, as well as internally for a variety of diseases [10,11] . Thus, bioavailability of various components of Opuntia extracts may vary, depending on the site of application and other metabolic processes. A number of plant-derived polysaccharides have been s h o w nt oi n d u c ep r o d u c t i o no fT N F - and/or IL-6 in macrophages (e.g., see [6,35,36] ). However , this is the first report to demonstrate induction of cytokines byOpuntia polysaccharides. Among the proinflammatory IL-6 is one of the most important mediators of fever and the acute-phase response [42]. TNF- also plays an important role as a key cytokine in immune and inflamma- tory reactions. TNF- has direct in vitro and in vivo cytostatic and cytocidal effects and, together with IL-6, isalso considered as a major immune and inflammatory mediator [42]. One of the most prominent characteristics of TNF- is its ability to cause apoptosis of tumor-associated endothelial cells, resulting in tumor necrosis [43]. TNF- also plays a pivotal role in host defense and can act on monocytes and macrophages in an autocrine manner to enhance various function responses and induce the expression of a number ofother immunoregulatory and inflammatory mediators [44]. Furthermore, TNF- has been reported to exert in anti- influenza effect, which is greater than that of - and - interferons [45]. In addition to enhancement of cytokine production, Opuntia polysaccharides also activated macro- phage NO and ROS production. These reactive oxidants playkey roles in host defense and other physiological processes and are also involved in the regulation of apoptosis and immune homeostasis (reviewed in [46,47] ). Overall, our data suggest modulation of the production of cytokines andreactive oxygen/nitrogen species by macrophages likely contributes to the therapeutic effects of O. polyacantha extracts and provides further evidence that the Opuntia polysaccharides have potent immunomodulatory transcription B in THP-1 human monocytes. Activation of NF- B controls multiple genes in phagocytes, and target genes regulated by NF- B include proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, inflammatory enzymes, adhesion molecules,receptors, and inhibitors of apoptosis (reviewed in [48]). Therefore, the ability to activate phagocyte NF- B signaling provides further evidence that Opuntia polysaccharides possess immunomodulatory properties and confirms thathuman phagocytes respond to these compounds. In support of this finding, a number of polysaccharides have been reported previously to activate NF- B. For example, high molecular weight polysaccharides from Aloe barbadensis increased NF- B-directed luciferase expression B, leading to increased immune cytokine mRNA levels [50]. Clearly, activation of NF- B plays a critical role in the transcriptional regulation of TNF-and inducible NO synthase addition, TNF- [52] and NO [53] generated upon cell activation can further activate the NF- B pathway. Thus, it is reasonable that dose- dependently stimulated macrophage NO production and also activated NF- B in a similar pattern. In future studies, it will be interesting to determine whether these polysaccharides enhanced the production of proin- flammatory mediators (e.g., TNF- and NO) through NF- B and/or vice versa . Endotoxin (LPS) is a known immunomodulator and is often a contaminant in biological preparations. Therefore, anumber of approaches were utilized to evaluate and prevent possible LPS contamination. Since the crude extract used for isolation of the Opuntia polysaccharide fractions was prepared from intact, uninjured green stems of O. poly- acantha after washing in ultrapure water , bacterial contam- ination of the stems was unlikely. Furthermore, isolation was conducted under conditions that minimized the possibility ofbacterial contamination, and the fractions were filtered through 0.22 m filters prior to biological assays. However , further analyses were performed to directly evaluate thisissue. Initially, we evaluated Opuntia polysaccharide frac- tions using the Limulus -based endotoxin assay. We found that all four fractions caused a positive Limulus response. This is not surprising, as a number of plant polysaccharides havebeen shown to react in the Limulus assay, presumably through their ability to mimic LPS [39,54,55] . Thus, we evaluated the effects of polymyxin B on polysaccharideactivity. This compound can bind to and inactivate LPS, and we found that inclusion of polymyxin B only had little effect on macrophage NO production induced by Opuntia polysac- charides, while it completely inhibited activation by LPS. The partial inhibition of the polysaccharide activity observed after polymyxin B treatment is likely due to nonspecificeffects of this agent. For example, polymyxin B has been reported to cause down-regulation of phospholipid-sensitive Ca 2+-dependent protein kinase [56] and in murine [57]. In addition, polymyxin B is a surface-active peptide that may interact with sites on the plasma membrane functionally related to the targets of plant polysaccharides[58]. Polymyxin B is a cationic peptide that could also directlybind to and/or neutralize active anionic groups in plant polysaccharides. Because of these issues, we performedadditional control experiments using polysaccharides eluted through a column of endotoxin-removing gel and showed that polysaccharides treated with endotoxin-removing gel wereas active as untreated samples. Therefore, we are confident that the biological activity in our samples is due to the Opuntia polysaccharides and not a contaminating artifact. In summary, the present study demonstrates that high molecular weight polysaccharides from the stems of O. polyacantha are not cytotoxic and activate macrophages, resulting in modulation of NO, ROS, and cytokine production. Our data provide a molecular basis to explain at least part of the beneficial therapeutic effects reported for extracts of O. polyacantha , and suggest that macrophage stimulation by the Opuntia polysaccharides might enhance resistance to infection. Further studies are now in progress to determinewhich receptor(s) are essential to the expression of the various immunomodulatory effects ascribed to Opuntia polysaccharides and other structural features conferringbiological activity.
