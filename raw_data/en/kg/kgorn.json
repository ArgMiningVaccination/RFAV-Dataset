Apologies w ere noted from Mr Rodney Morton, Mr John Patrick Clayton, Ms Deepa Mann- Kler, Dr Aideen Keaney and Mr Brendan Whittle. - | Page 2 | - 110/21 Item 2 - Declaration of Interests 110/21.1 The Chair asked if anyone had interests to declare releva nt to any items on the agenda. No interests were declared. 111/21 Item 3 - Minutes of previous meeting held on 16 September 2021 111/21.1 The minutes of the Board meeting held on 16 September 2021 were APPROVED as an accurate record of that meeting. 112/21 Item 4 - Matters Arising 112/21.1 There were no matters arising . 113/21 Item 5 - Chair's Business 113/21.1 113/21.2 113/21.3 113/21.4 The Chair presented his Report and noted that there had been a discussion about the issue of peer vaccinators during the confidential session. He advised that a workshop had taken place to discuss the ALB Self -Assessment and that another workshop will be organised to look at Board papers. The Chair said that he has asked for an update on the development of the Project Initiation Document (PID) regarding the new operating model for PHA following the recent workshop. He advised that a letter of appreciation was sent to all sta ff involved in contact tracing and that following the Internal Audit report on contact tracing he has written to the Deputy Chief Medical Officer regarding one of the recommendations. The Chair expressed concern about the increasing number of cases of COVID -19 and advised that Dr Diane Anderson will be joining the meeting later to parti cipate in discussion about this and will also respond to the points raised in his Chair's report and the information from Professor Martin McKee and from the article in t he Financial Times. The Chair shared correspondence that he had received from the Permanent Secretary regarding a further pause in sponsorship and governance activities. He said that although there is no Accountability Meeting taking place, PHA should be taking time to looks at its own strategic agenda and continue to be mindful of such long -term issues as the health of future generations, AMR as well as the health implications of climate change. 114/21 Item 6 - Chief Executive's Report 114/21.1 The Chief Executive advised that it was his intention that this would be the last Report he would bring to the Board in this format. Going forward, he said that his Report would look at emerging issues, risks and areas that need to be addressed. He added that there would be a performance management every two months or every quarter which - | Page 3 | - 114/21.2 114/21.3 114/21.4 114/21.5 114/21.6 114/21.7 114/21.8 would update on the objectives set out of the Business Plan or the Corporate Plan. The Chief Executive reported that PHA remains in business continuity mode and although society is slowly opening up and normalising, the HSC will lag behind in this and the PHA will be one of the last organisations to return to normal and this could take up to two years. The Chief Executive said that testing numbers for COVID -19 remain at around 7,000 per day and that these figures are still too high. In terms of the number of daily positive cases, he described the situation as an \"undulating plateau\" with cases sitting between 1,100 and 1,600 each day. He noted that during the first peak cases were between 300 and 400 per day, but now numbers are much higher. Ms Henderson commented that the testing numbers are very high which indicates that a lot of individuals are aware of symptoms and believe they have them. The Chief Executive said t hat the positivity rate is around 20/23%. He added that when schools returned, the number of daily tests reached 20,000. Ms Henderson still felt that the number of people getting tested was high given the positivity rate and asked if people know when the y are supposed to get tested. The Chair said that the testing numbers include individuals who have been \"pinged\". The Chief Executive agreed that the number of tests carried out needs to be reduced because Northern Ireland only gets a certain quota as per the Barnett formula. The Chief Executive reported that at one point 89 PHA staff had been redeployed to assist with contact tracing and while this number has reduced to 30, all staff will be repatriated back to their normal duties by the end of the mont h. As we head into the winter months, he said that RSV and flu are likely to create pressures. The Chief Executive advised that the HSCQI team was very heavily involved in the recent NICON conference and he had received good feedback on their work. Mr Irvine commented that this report did not contain the type of information that he would wish to see. He said that it should contain information about issues that are pertinent to the organisation and that require decision by the Board. He added that there should be a principle of \"no surprises\". He said that the Board should be aware of any areas where there is deviation from policy direction. While the information contained in this Report was useful, he said he would wish to be made aware of any threads that need to be dealt with, or where a change needs to be made, a rationale being brought for that change. Ms Henderson agreed that she would wish to see information on emerging issues. She praised the campaigns work but noting the low vaccination uptak e, she asked who has responsibility for the booster - | Page 4 | - 114/21.9 114/21.10 114/21.11 vaccine. The Chief Executive explained that the responsibility for the vaccination programme still sits with the Department of Health and that there is a regional board which is chaired by the Chief Medi cal Officer (CMO). He added that PHA is leading on the work to get 12 to 15 years old vaccinated, but responsibility for the booster sits with the Department and the CMO. Alderman Brett also agreed that the Report should focus on emerging strategic issue s instead of being a general update. He said that a performance report would be a useful addition. The Chief Executive sought clarity from members in terms of how often they would wish to see a performance report and it was agreed that this would be a qu arterly report. Professor Rooney suggested that instead of a report by directorate, it should link back to PHA's statutory functions (Action 1 - Chief Executive) . Professor Rooney asked about education as she had some concerns about how PHA was portrayed in the media. The Chief Executive advised that the number of daily cases in schools fluctuates between 350 and 500, but he hoped that would start to flatten out soon. He said that PHA's relationship with schools has improved and that the new more target ed approach is causing less disruption. He noted that there has been a small number of complaints from parents and also concerns expressed about staff not being vaccinated. He said that PHA will continue to work with the Education Authority. He advised that PHA has a direct link with special schools and all other schools are asked to contact the Education Authority in the first instance. The Chief Executive said that from a business continuity perspective, there is a number of public health doctors and consultants who are working in the school cell and are therefore not working in other areas. Professor Rooney said that she would like to see more about the impact of PHA's work as she felt it should be celebrated. The Chief Executive noted that the Chair had written to all those sta ff involved in contact tracing and in the education cell to thank them for their work on behalf of the Board. 115/21 Item 7 - Finance Report (PHA/01/ 10/21) 115/21.1 115/21.2 Ms McCaig presented the latest Finance Report and explained that at the end of August there is an underspend of approximately \u00a31m with a forecast year -end surplus of \u00a3800k. She advised that this has increased since the previous month's report. She explained that where some of the surplus is in areas where funds are ring fenced, this money will have to be handed back. Ms McCaig said that there has been an increase in Trust expenditure between month 4 and month 5. She explained that the next section of the Report relates to direct programme expenditure which is where PHA releases funding through SLAs on a month ly or quarterly basis. For - | Page 5 | - 115/21.3 115/21.4 115/21.5 115/21.6 115/21.7 115/21.8 115/21.9 that there is a \u00a3613k variance but this relates to a timing issue and is not of concern. Ms McCaig reported that there is a \u00a3224k surplus in areas where there is ring fenced funding, but reiterated that any surplus cannot be utilised elsewhere. She said she expected any surplus to be retracted by the Department and she would be linking with the Department regarding that. Ms McCaig explained that PHA has a management and administration budget of approximately \u00a328m, and that the SBNI element of this is ring fenced so again any surplus in the SBNI budget would have to be returned to the Department. She drew attention to the surplus and added that this is partly to the length of time it can take to fill posts with a recruitment process taking up to six months. Ms McCaig said that the next section looked at capital expenditure and reminded members that for the last 5/6 years, spend in the area of Research and Development (R&D) is now classed as capital. She noted that a high proportion of the budget is usually spent at the year end and that the team has a good track record of using their full budget. Ms McCaig advised that PHA's prompt payment performance is one of the best in the HSC. She moved on to the las t section of the Report which she said contained more information on COVID -19 related expenditure. She advised that the business case for contact tracing is currently being revised and that process is almost complete. She said that she was not expecting any deficit in this area and that PHA will receive any funding that it requires. The Chair thanked Ms McCaig for the Report and noted that PHA's R&D budget per head of population is only half of the R&D budget allocated in Scotland and Wales. Ms Henders on asked if the Agency Management Team (AMT) has a list of priorities for the \u00a3800k underspend. Ms McCaig advised that there would be priorities set through the business planning process and that AMT will also look at funding any other core strategic areas. She said that this process is presently being worked through. Mr Stewart said that the Board should have sight of the areas that the AMT deem to be priority. He noted that within the Report there is a deficit within the PHA Board spend line. Ms McCaig advised that this cost centre is where some areas are funded centrally, and it may be a profiling issue but she would look into it (Action 2 - Ms McCaig). Mr Irvine noted some rounding up issues in some sections of the Report and asked whether this was simply an issue within the system. Ms McCaig confirmed that this was the case and it is not possible to eliminate all of them totally . - | Page 6 | - 115/21.10 115/21.11 115/21.12 115/21.13 Alderman Brett asked about the number of vacant posts and if there is a plan to recruit to these. The Chief Executive advised that he has set up weekly meetings with HR to progress the number of vacant posts, particularly those at senior level. H e added that there are some posts, for example in health protection, where funding has come from the Department for these, but has not yet been spent as PHA is working out its new structures. He reiterated that it is a slow process. Ms McCaig commented that PHA is emerging from a period of significant challenge which is also linked to the delays. Alderman Brett said that he would be concerned that if PHA has a surplus, the Department may think that PHA does not need the funding. Ms McCaig explained that there are some staffing costs marked against COVID -19 expenditure which makes it more difficult to get the full picture. The Chief Executive noted that sometimes when a recruitment process has been completed it is not possible to make an appointment. He also pointed out that there is presently a national deficit of public health nurses and doctors. He assured members that the Department will not retract funding as it acknowledges that going forward PHA's workforce needs to be boosted. Professor Rooney said that in terms of the format of this Report she would like to know that PHA is spending its funds in the right areas. Ms McCaig said that in terms of Trust spend there is a lot of work goes into that area as business cases are reviewed and there is monitoring to ensure that funding is being spent in line with set objectives. She said that within the management and administr ation budget, there is a directorate structure and she would be content to look to see what more information could be provided. Ms Henderson said that she would like to understand more about how services to Trusts are commissioned and if there are SLAs in place. She suggested that there may be historical arrangements and commitments in place and so she would like to know what is short term and what is long term. She added that the information is so aggregated that it is difficult to understand. Ms McCai g advised that that would be a question for the Health Improvement team to answer as it manages the budget and determines how the funds are allocated. The Chair said that it wou ld be his intention to invite representatives from Health Improvement to a fut ure meeting in order to gain a better understanding of this issue . Ms Henderson said that would be helpful. Alderman Brett asked if any business cases are approved by the Board and Ms McCaig replied that it would depend on the delegated level as outlined in the Scheme of Delegated Authority (SoDA). Mr Stewart advised that he had had a conversation with the Chief Executive about the PHA Assurance Framework and what is brought to the Board for approval and for noting and suggested that there needs to be a discussion about this at Board level. Mr Wilson suggested that rather than focusing solely on Health Improvement, the Operations directorate could also provide some level of induction as it has oversight of the procurement process. The Board noted the Fi nance Report. - | Page 7 | - 116/21 Item 8 - Update on 116/21.4 116/21.5 116/21.6 Dr Bergin gave members an overview of the latest data in relation to COVID -19. He showed how during the second and third waves of the pandemic these waves lasted for up to six months and that the current wave is now in its third month so will last throughout the winter. He said that the present situation is different than previous waves because of the impact of the Delta variant. He explained that the virus is mutating and that similar to flu, variants will become more potent and will require different vaccines to fight them. Dr Bergin showed that the cases in Northern I reland are spread across all Local Government Districts but it is possible to identify hotspots. He showed data giving a breakdown of the number of cases by age which indicated that there is now a greater impact on younger people with almost 50% of current cases among people under the age of 20. However, he noted that these people are disproportionately less impacted by the possibility of requiring hospital treatment and are less likely to die. Following the vaccinati on programme, he reported that most care homes are not seeing as many cases as previously. Dr Bergin presented information showing Northern Ireland's infection rate compared to other countries and he suggested that socio- economic factors may partly explain why it is performing worse. He adv ised that hospital admissions are at half the rate they were at previously now that the vaccination programme is in place. In terms of hospital care he noted that it is worth pointing out that at the turn of the year many areas of elective care remained o n pause, but now hospitals are trying to carry out this work as well as dealing with COVID -19. Dr Bergin said that although society is trying to return to normal, the health protection team in PHA remains stretched with the majority of staff still tasked with dealing with COVID -19, He noted that there are opportunity costs as health improvement staff have been diverted from their core work, for example dealing with issues as smoking and obesity. He said that PHA needs to be robust in terms of getting back to its programme work. He added that health inequalities may increase citing the example of the increasing costs of fuel. The Chair asked what work is being done to target those harder to reach groups, as well as young people, to improve vaccination uptake. Dr Bergin replied that PHA has a dedicated approach to this work. He advised that Mr Maurice Meehan and Ms Deirdre Webb are working on this by linking with colleagues in communications, health intelligence and data analytics to identify and subsequentl y target low uptake areas or specific employment sectors can be identified and targeted with information. He said that the booster vaccine will be important in the battle to shorten the latest wave. Professor Rooney asked how PHA's intelligence and expertise is used - | Page 8 | - 116/21.7 116/21.8 to influence decisions when the uptake rates remain lower. Dr Bergin said that a lot of the work is driven centrally by Government, but assured members that PHA shares its information and has daily communication with the Department. He added that work to address low uptake remains a battle across Europe and that COVID -19 will take hold if the vaccination uptake rate decreases. Professor Rooney said that there is a perception that PHA is the font of all knowledge, and said that if it has all this information and expertise it should be able to have greater influence. Dr Bergin said that vaccination is voluntary, but PHA has aimed to put centres in the heart of areas where there is low uptake. Professor Rooney commented that it is all about behaviour change. The Chief Executive said that Professor Ian Young has been key in this work and that PHA has held meetings with him. He added that he, as well as Mr Meehan and Dr Jillian Johnston attending the Vaccination Programme Board and said that over the summer there was a campaign aimed at targeting students which Mr Meehan and Ms Hilary Johnston, who has links with the universities, were involved in. He said that PHA's work has had an impact, but ult imately the policy direction comes from the Department. Ms Henderson commended the presentation but she said that at present, she would not know where to get a COVID -19 vaccine and she felt that there is a cohort of people who do not think about COVID -19 and so are unlikely to get a vaccine. Mr Wilson advised that the PHA communications team has been working with the Department since the start of the pandemic in terms of pushing out public information. He said that PHA has been using community pharmacies and will do again during the month of November in terms of both the booster vaccine and the flu vaccine. He advised at present approximately 200 pharmacies are engaged with the Programme Board whether that is dealing with first doses, or subsequent doses, and PHA has provided promotional materials for them. He said that shortly in the meeting there will be a presentation, part of which will look at the public's understanding of the vaccination programme. The chair expressed concern that there was not c larity about where people in younger age groups would receive the booster vaccine. Mr Wilson replied that GPs are proactively contacting patients and will be doing so in the same order as the first vaccination programme. T herefore, he explained that it is care home residents and then different age groups starting with the oldest. Professor Rooney asked if there is a KPI for this work. The Chief Executive said that any target would sit with the Programme Board and not with PHA. Mr Stewart commented that from the outside, the booster programmes appears a little disjointed and it is not immediately obvious how to get one so communication needs to be improved. Presentation on Insights on the Northern Ireland Public's Knowledge, Awareness and Intended Behaviours Associated with the COVID -19 Response (PHA/02/10/21) The Chair welcomed Dr Diane Anderson to the meeting and invited her - | Page 9 | - 116/21.9 116/21.10 116/21.11 116/21.12 116/21.13 116/21.14 to deliver her presentation. Dr Anderson thanked members for the invitation and said that she was going to present finding s of a PHA survey. By way of background she explained that at the start of the pandemic the population was dealing with a fatal and contagious disease and in the absence of any vaccine, the only protection was for people to change their behaviour. She said that PHA has always had a role in producing guidance but this required people to change completely their behaviour. She explained a theory where changes in behaviour start from knowledge of an issue which impacts on people's attitudes and belief and ul timately behaviours. Dr Anderson said that during the third wave the spread of the virus has been complex to track and there have also been changes in behaviours because of the easing off of some of the restrictions. She added that hospitalisations were down even though the number of cases was at similar levels to previous waves. She reported that hospitalisation and mortality levels were highest in Northern Ireland compared to other UK countries. At this point Ms Cassidy left the meeting. Dr Anderson noted that there have already been references to obesity and poverty in the earlier discussion. She advised that obesity rates are similar and poverty is currently no worse, but it depends on the calculations being looked at. Dr Anderson reported that the UK infection rate is higher than neighbouring countries and coming into the winter months, there continues to be a backlog for planned admissions and an increasing demand for urgent care. Dr Anderson said that in the early days of the pandemic PHA surveyed people's knowledge of the symptoms and generally there was good knowledge. However, she noted that the symptoms of the Delta variant and the cold may have led people being unaware that t hey had COVID - 19 and that these people may not have self -isolated or had themselves tested. She added that healthy children could pass the virus on and looking specifically at people with children under the age of 15, half of them believed that children s hould be vaccinated compared with three quarters of people who do not have children. With regard to the booster vaccine, she said that people do intend to get a booster, but the speed at which the UK pushed out its first vaccine programme means that boost ers need to be pushed out very soon. The Chair asked how the data from the presentation can be used to formulate policy. Dr Anderson said that she can report on findings and say where decisions may be made. For example, she noted that many people are uncomfortable with face masks not being mandatory . She added that people are up to 1.5 times more likely to test positive for - | Page 10 | - 116/21.15 116/21.16 COVID -19 if they do not wear a mask in a confined space. Ms Henderson said that it is her understanding that vaccinations are a priority and that PHA is responsible for communication, but it is not responsible for accessibility to the vaccination centres. The Chief Executive advised that there were mass vaccination centres, but now Trusts are providing services through outreach centres . He added that PHA provided advice as to where those centres should be located and Trusts set up a number of walk -in clinics so PHA does not have some influence. Ms Henderson asked where the responsibility lies for increasing the uptake. The Chief Executive replied that this lies with the Department of Health but the communications teams work together to get the messaging out to the public. Ms Henderson said that it is therefore the Department's role but PHA also makes a contribution. The Chief E xecutive said that PHA has been proactive and gave the example of the Farm Families programme, but Ms Henderson said there needs to be an organisation that is clearly in the lead role. She felt that PHA is seen as the public face of COVID -19 and it is wor king with schools and the education sector. The Chair said that when normality returns PHA has a primary role in responding to the public, but during COVID -19 he felt that the Depar tment has taken over that role . Alderman Brett noted that there is a lot of messaging which is carried out by the Executive. Mr Wilson said that the strategy for communications is clear, and that it is led by the Department and it agrees the tactical rollout of messaging. He assured members that it is a top priority for his t eam and they are working full time in this area. He added that there is the Executive Information Service but PHA aims to provide value for money and impact from its messaging. In terms of providing insight, he said that everything that Dr Anderson repor ted on will be fed back to the appropriate fora to see how it can be used to effect behavioural change. The Chief Executive thanked Dr Anderson for her presentation. He said that he wanted to show that PHA has all of this information available but it is does not have is a behavioural science unit to guide us. He added that he would like to look at this and get support from the Board to take the PHA in that strategic space where it has a behavioural science unit. The Chair said that the Board has been as king f or this for a long time as PHA does harvest a lot of data but it may not readily have the expertise to translate those data into practice. Professor Rooney said that everything that PHA does should be about behavioural change and she said that she enjoyed reading this Report. She felt that thes e types of report can sometimes end up on a shelf whereas it is important that the findings drive what PHA does and a behavioural science unit can bring credibility to the organisation. She said that she woul d be happy to assist in any way she can with this approach. Dr Anderson felt that the Health Intelligence Unit is one of PHA's best kept secret and she noted that the team does have staff who have the required qualifications, even if behavioural science does not appear in their job title. She said that a lot of work PHA does is behavioural and welcomed the opportunity to - | Page 11 | - 116/21.17 116/21.18 116/21.19 116/21.20 further develop this. The Chair thanked Dr Anderson and her team for compiling this Report. He said that he sees Health Intelligence as a critical element of the work of the PHA. Ms Henderson asked if there were any actions coming out of this Report. The Chief Executive advised that the Report was presented to AMT and he would like to see action on the back of it, but given the present focus on COVID -19 it is difficult to find the space to do this. The Chair said that it is important to ensure that when research is carried out, that the Board sees the outputs of the work of the Health Intelligence Unit. Mr Stewart commented that the N on-Executive Directors have always been keen to engage on workforce planning and to look at where resources are best deployed. The Board noted the Report about the Insights on the Northern Ireland Public's Knowledge, Awareness and Intended Behaviours Associated with the COVID -19 Response. 117/21 Item 9 - Update from Chair of Governance and Audit Committee (PHA/03/10/21) 117/21.1 117/21.2 117/21.3 117/21.4 Mr Stewart updated members on the last meeting of the Governance and Audit Committee (GAC) . He drew members' attention to the discussion in the minutes of the meeting of 7 October regarding the progress against outstanding audit recommendations and passed on his concern ab out the need for the procedures on rota and timesheet management for the contact tracing services to be completed as soon as possible. He said that the GAC was advised that a reason for the delay is due to the number of PHA staff hav ing been directed to o ther COVID -19 facing work. He added that while he was pleased to hear the Chief Executive's comments that staff will be repatriated back to their normal duties by the end of the October, he said that the GAC would wish to see progress on these recommendat ions, if not by December, then as soon as possible thereafter. Ms Henderson asked whether there was clarity as to whether the responsibility for contact tracing has transferred to the PHA. Mr Stewart advised that the Chair was seeking that clarity. Mr Irvine noted that the Chief Executive had already advised how he is tracking current audit recommendations and suggested that the Board should be informed about how these are being dealt with and closed. Mr Irvine felt that there was a lot of work coming to the Board which would be more appropriate for a sub- committee and he gave an example of the previous paper. He said that it was the type of report - | Page 12 | - 117/21.5 117/21.6 117/21.7 where a smaller number of Non -Executive Directors could consider the findings and make recommendations to the Board. He added that the Board should be looking at strategic issues with a sub- committee bringing options to the B oard, and that the Board could make use of the talent at its disposal. The chair advised that he has For a long period of time been advocating the need for additional committees of the Board. At this point Ms McCaig left the meeting. The Chief Executive said that it was his decision to bring the report on the previous item to the Board because he was keen for the Board to see this information and this represented the best mechanism to showcase this work. He added that he was new in post and that while he agreed that there is a lot of talent on the Board, it will take time for the Board to work together in partnership to draw out that talent. He commented that it has not been helpful that the organisation has not had a permanent Chief Executive for some time and that going forward he wants to work with the Board in partnership and using all of the skills that are available. He ag reed that there needs to be more time to consider strategic matters as they are not getting the attention they require at present and there should be a workshop to discuss this. Professor Rooney said that when she applied for the role of NED, the specification asked for an individual with a background in mental health and psychology, but her skills in that area have never been used and there is now an opportunity for NEDs to use their skills going forward. The Chair commended the GAC for their commitment in dealing with all of these issues. The Board noted the update from the Committee Chair. 118/21 Item 10 - PHA Mid -Year Assurance Statement (PHA/04/10/21) 118/21.1 118/21.2 118/21.3 The Chief Executive advised that PHA is normally required to submit a Mid-Year Assurance Statement but following receipt of correspondence from the Department this is no longer required. However, he said that PHA intends to share a copy with its Sponsor Branch. The Chief Executive said that the Mid- Year Assurance was approved by the Agency Management Team and also by the Governance and Audit Committee. He added that the Statement follows a set template. The Board APPROVED the PHA Mid -Year Assurance Statement. 119/21 Item 11 - Annual Quality Report (PHA/05/10/21 ) 119/21.1 Ms Denise Boulter joined the meeting for this item. Ms Boulter said that PHA is required to submit a joint Annual Quality Report with HSCB to the Department of Health in advance of World - | Page 13 | - 119/21.2 119/21.3 119/21.4 119/21.5 119/21.6 Quality Day on 11 November. She explained that this Report covers a shorter period than the previous Report and is for t he period October 2020 to March 2021. She advised that the Report follows the five themes of Quality 2020 and gives examples of work that has been done against each the me and the impact of that work. She asked for members' approval of the Report. The C hair commended the excellent design of the report and how it has been presented in a way that is understandable by the public. He said such success is a key performance indicator for the PHA. The Chair also asked that congratulations should be conveyed t o all involved and in particular to the company which led on the design. Professor Rooney asked about the role of the Director of Quality Improvement in terms of this Report. Ms Boulter said that the responsibility for producing this Report has always sat with the Director of Nursing and that this is the 8 th Report that has been produced. She advised that parts of Quality 2020 are going to be revisited to look at the future. She noted that the work of HSCQI is well represented within the Report and that while she helped to compile the Report, the contributions come from across the whole organisation. The Chief Executive said that he agreed with what Ms Boulter said and added that the Report follows a standardised template, but he has been involved in discussions with the Director of HSCQI and Mr Andrew Dawson in the Department and it may be that HSCQI produces its own separate report. He explained that while the Director of HSCQI role sits within PHA, it also reports to the HSCQI Alliance which is made up of Trust Chief Executives. He said that while the Director of HSCQI would prefer to be outside this process, PHA does have a responsibility to produce a report in this format. Professor Rooney noted that RQIA is another responsible for quality and asked about its role. She also said that she remains unclear about PHA's role in relation to Serious Adverse Incidents (SAIs). The Chief Executive said that there have been discussions with RQIA and agreed that there is some confusion in terms of which organisation is responsible for leading on quality, and said that there is a need to clarify that confusion. Mr Stewart commented that the Board has been asking for some time about clarity on SAIs as he said that the section in this Report on SAIs is giving h im cause for concern. He added that within this Report it is difficult to delineate what PHA's responsibilities are which he said makes it difficult to assess performance. The Chief Executive said that this is an issue in terms of the format of the Repor t. Professor Rooney asked if PHA will in future do its own Report once the functions of HSCB migrate into the Department. The Chief Executive said that theoretically this should be the case. He advised that there has been a series of joint workshops tak ing place with HSCB looking at roles - | Page 14 | - 119/21.7 119/21.8 and responsibilities, governance and links with the new planning model. Ms Boulter said that this Report has always been a conjoined piece of work between HSCB and PHA and does not distinguish between the two organisat ions. The Board APPROVED the Annual Quality Report. 120/21 12 - ALB Self -Assessment 2020/21 (PHA/06/10/21) 120/21.1 120/21.2 The Chair noted that work has taken place over the last few months to complete the ALB Self -Assessment and that Non-Executives were much more involv ed in its completion. He asked if members were content to approve the final Assessment following the recent workshop. The Chair thanked Board members for their input and commended the Board Secretary for his very extens ive and highly skilled contribution. The Board APPROVED the ALB Self -Assessment. 121/21 Item 13 - Any Other Business 121/21.1 121/21.2 121/21.3 121/21.4 Mr Stewart sought clarity on what actions were agreed following the workshop held after the last Board meeting to look at the PID relating to the outworking of the Hussey Review. The Chief Executive replied that there will be a further iteration of the PI D, but conceded that due to work relating to the COVID -19 response, there has not been as much progress on this as he would have liked. He advised that he has been attempting to recruit a Project Manager to commence this work but a recent exercise run by the Leadership Centre did not come up with any suitable applicants. Mr Stewart asked how the PID would be approved and how the work will be taken forward . The Chief Executive said that although the PID will be jointly approved the work will be led by the Department. Mr Stewart felt that the best placed people to lead on this are in the PHA as they know the organisation and that they should be able to influence this work . The Chief Executive agreed with Mr Stewart's comments. Professor Rooney said th at the PID needs to be brought back to the Board. Mr Irvine requested that in future documents there is a table outlining any acronyms used. The Chair thanked members for their contributions to today's meeting. 122/21 Item 14 - Details of Next Meeting Thursday 18 Novem ber 2021 at 1:30pm Fifth Floor Meeting Room, 12/22 Linenhall Street, Belfast, BT2 7ES - | Page 15 | - Signed by Chair: Date: PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT REPORT Monitoring of Targets Identified in The Annual Business Plan 2021 - 2022 As at 31October 2021 2 This report provides a mid-year update on achievement of the actions identified in the PHA Annual Business Plan 2020-21. The updates on progress toward achievement of the actions were provided by the Lead Officers responsible for each action. There are a total of 53 actions in the Annual Business Plan. Each action has been given a RAG status as follows: On target to be achieved or already completed Will be completed, but with slight delay Significantly behind target/will not be completed Of these 53 actions 47 have been rated green, 6 as amber and 0 as red.

Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 1 Continue to provide professional Health Protection leadership to effectively manage the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our population. The Health Protection service has secured support and assistance from other PHA Directorates during the Covid-19 pandemic. Health Protection has also secured staff for the contact tracing service via an HSCNI workforce appeal and HSCNI recruitment service. Clinicians have also been secured via local recruitment agencies to support the contact tracing service, acute response service, care home teams and the PHA education cell. Recruitment is currently underway to enhance the Health Protection service. The Director of Public Health office/function (to address COVID) has been enhanced through the appointment of a deputy Director of Public Health S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 2 Maintain a professional Contract Tracing service that will have the capability and capacity to respond effectively to changes in infection levels and ensure people in receipt of a positive test result are Performance of the CTC has largely been in line with agreed indicators for the year. July and August saw an exponential rise in cases which meant a small dip below the 80%/24 hour measure for contacting cases. This was resolved in September. The Service has an escalation plan agreed with DoH which is used to maintain operations when case volumes rise. This includes promoting use of Digital Self Trace. CTC has expanded rapidly over the year to meet the demands of not only volume but complexity of cases. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 4 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red contacted as quickly as possible. The staff complement has been increased and a number of PHA staff have been trained and deployed to support the service in the latest surge. We have developed a skills retention programme to allow us to utilise this resource should it be needed in future waves. A robust programme of monitoring and control has been developed and refined to provide assurance as to the quality of the service provided. Additional information on performance of the service is attached as appendix 1.2 3 Ensure there is continued appropriate timely access to testing services both in Pillar 1 (HSC) and Pillar 2 (National testing service). Identification of variants of concern through timely reflex assays and whole genome sequencing of positive cases. Ongoing support for roll out of lateral flow devices across the community and in Timely access to testing continues across Pillars 1 and 2. Up to 31 Oct 2021: Number of individuals tested in total: total tests) - National Testing Programme: 1,688,491 (73.8% of total tests) Procedures are in place for identification of variants of concern. We are currently undertaking 1000 whole genome sequencing tests per week for surveillance purposes. Lateral flow device roll out continues across multiple settings, facilitating, for example, safer workplaces, care homes, domiciliary care and schools: S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 5 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red specific settings e.g. care homes, healthcare workers, education. 960,010 lateral flow tests were recorded as being performed as at 31 Oct 2021. (N.B.This understates the total number of tests used, as not all test results are recorded by members of the public.) We are currently collating reports on the tests distributed across the different settings. 4 Strengthen PHA capacity to provide the intelligence needed to meet organisational goals by supporting staff to develop their knowledge and skills; providing tools needed to deliver intelligence effectively and efficiently; and by designing organisational and governance arrangements enabling sharing knowledge and skills across topic areas. Progress has been made on this objective with further activity planned in the short term. A small data science team has been formed, using mainly temporary and external staff, which has been working with PHA analysts to support data engineering and analysis to meet PHA information needs. Modern data science infrastructure has been adopted for data engineering for several key work programmes. PHA analysts have benefited from numerous online courses, seminars and conferences, relating, for example, to the application of statistical programming, automation, data visualisation, dashboarding and bioinformatics. AMT has approved the formation of a group to lead this work, starting with describing the existing data science capacity in PHA and the information needs of PHA teams, and developing plans to strengthen capacity. From a strategic perspective, to develop capacity over the medium-long term, a specific group has been established: this will identify potential requirements to enhance data and intelligence capabilities (required for 2022 onwards). S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 6 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 5 Ensure that the health protection service has robust surveillance systems in place to respond to the current Covid-19 pandemic. Review the current IT systems such as the Covid-19 surveillance dashboard and the data analytics systems. Work is ongoing to continually improve the surveillance systems and outputs with regards to COVID-19: The PHA HP Surveillance team continues to work with colleagues in the rest of the UK and ROI to support work on the COVID-19 pandemic. The HP surveillance team have been working with external colleagues (e.g. SIB, Ernst and Young, Kainos and QUB) to produce and improve reporting around Whole Genome Sequencing of COVID-19 samples, nosocomial infections of COVID-19, COVID-19 outputs. Work is continuing around developing, accessing and utilising the COVID-19 vaccination data held in the Vaccine Management System and using this data to respond to requests for information to inform multiple areas of work within the PHA and responding to requests from DoH and other external colleagues. The contact tracing service now produces a range of reports to assist in monitoring and managing the Covid-19 pandemic: Weekly performance metrics (https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/covid-19-coronavirus/testing-and- tracing-covid-19/contact-tracing-service-management-information ) Weekly cluster reports on schools (https://www.publichealth.hscni.net/publications/coronavirus-bulletin ) CT Huddle Dashboard (produced 3 times daily and circulated to Senior PHA team - summary headline numbers on cases and contacts and key performance measures), and a Daily S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 7 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red report circulated to Senior PHA team with detailed measures of call numbers, performance e.g. 24/48/72 age breakdown, % using Digital self-trace etc.) Reports are used for a range of purposes, such as: to seek to identify common exposure settings (e.g. workplaces), to provide a twice weekly multi-disciplinary Covid overview (assessing HP Surveillance data, schools data and estimated transmission patterns data from a number of sources (Virology database, cluster data from CTC etc.)), a 2-Weekly Travel Report (summary of cases for DOH Travel Programme Board). 6 Lead the Regional Infection Prevention Control Response. This will include the Development of New Managed Care IPC Network. New IPC Resource Framework, and development of professional guidance in the modelling and use of PPE Operationalise the updated Infection Protection and We are in the final stages of developing the Regional IPC Framework which will be shared with the Regional IPC Cell for consultation before submission to the DoH for consideration. Following the submission of the Regional IPC Framework a Regional Managed Care IPC Network will be developed and will replace the current Regional IPC Cell. The Managed Care Network will be multidisciplinary and will provide an opportunity to promote consistency, standardisation and shared learning. Northern Ireland currently follows the UK Health Security Agency (formally PHE) national guidance which outlines the PPE requirements in various settings. Updated guidance is due to be published in November 2021. BSO are engaged in forecasting PPE based on historical usage and volume data, through the last 3 surges. In relation to modelling, it has been agreed that it is no longer required to scientifically correlate other factors and R.Morton, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and AHPs Regional IPC Framework to be finalised and issued for consultation as soon as possible. We aim to submit the framework to DoH before Christmas . 8 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red Control (IPC) infrastructure including anti- microbial resistance stewardship therefore modelling PPE has been stood down. The IPC infrastructure will be operationalised when the DoH have approved the Regional IPC Framework and following development of the IPC Managed Care Network. 7 Provide input to the development of professional guidance on how to effectively manage Covid 19 in various settings and reduce the risk of spreading the virus, based on up to date evidence and best practice. The PHA has continued to provide detailed Health protection advice to a range of professional audiences - eg. the School's team worked extensively with DE, EA and Trade Unions to implement the outworking of the change in policy regarding close contacts definition in Education settings. In addition the acute Duty Room team provides advice across a wide range of settings, both HSC and non HSC settings (eg. wider public sector, private/commercial sector, and to other individual organisations and groups). This input and advice is provided on a seven day basis with a 24/7 on call service to encompass the full weekly period. The Public Health team continues to provide expert advice to DoH strategic programme Boards including, Testing, Tracing and Vaccination and is also contributing to specialist cells eg. Modelling. A Health protection guidance cell provides evidence based advice to a range of partner organisations and the Health protection team continues to facilitate management of outbreak situations. The availability of clear, accurate and up to date public and professional communications has been of paramount importance at each stage of the Pandemic and the Agency's Communications team continues to ensure that appropriate communications are delivered on a timely and effective basis meeting the specific needs of a diverse range of audiences. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) / S.Wilson, Director of Operations (interim) 9 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 8 Rebuild the screening programmes post COVID to ensure that services are operating to the standard required and that capacity for all programmes is maximised to ensure as many people as possible from the target populations are able to access services All screening programmes impacted by Covid continue to build capacity and reduce delays for screening invites. The current position across each screening programme is below and more detail is available at Appendix 1.8 Bowel cancer screening: The delay in routine invitations is currently 23 weeks (reduced from 29 weeks). The catch up exercise will be completed by August 2022. Breast screening: The round length is currently 38 months. This is down from 41 months in September 2020 (although it remains above the standard of 36 months). This is being achieved through the provision of additional screening clinics. Progress will not be linear as it is dependent upon the continued availability of staff. Diabetic eye screening: The programme continues to use a risk stratified approach to invite individuals for screening. Additional in year funding was secured via the June monitoring review to support recovery, and further expansion of capacity is being taken forward with the Trust to move towards reintroducing routine screening. This programme has faced significant logistical challenges due to the impact of covid. As well as a reduced patient throughput required for infection control purposes, programme has had to develop a new model of service delivery. AAA screening: Surveillance scanning for men with small/medium AAA is operating as normal. Approximately 56% of men in the 20/21 cohort for primary screening have now been called for their initial appointment. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 10 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 9 Continue to support the roll out of the Covid 19 Vaccination programme and any subsequent booster programmes and ensure that action is taken to improve uptake rates for vulnerable populations or in specific localities where uptake is low Reduction in hospitalisation rates and mortality from Covid 19 due to increased levels of immunity achieved through high levels of vaccine uptake. .The Covid Vaccine Programme is now being offered to all 12-17 year olds. The Booster Programme is being offered to everyone over 50 years and others at risk. The PHA continue to support the implementation of the programme. PHA has taken forward a number of actions to improve uptake of vaccine for vulnerable populations including : Workplace interventions to target Ethnic Minority & Migrant communities in food processing sector; Moy Park (May/June 2021) NI Meat Exporters Association and NI Pork & Bacon Association (July - Sept 2021) Low vaccine uptake data shared with Trusts (July/Aug/Sept) to influence locations of mobile vaccination clinics - targeting low vaccine uptake areas. Communications developed (translated materials & videos) to encourage vaccine uptake in Ethnic Minority & Migrant communities. Engaged with DAERA & PHA funded Farm Families health Check Programme (Sept/Oct) to target low vaccine uptake in targeted rural areas. Engaging with Community Pharmacy (Oct onwards) to encourage primary dose vaccination options in targeted low vaccine uptake areas across NI Established a 6 week vaccine uptake clinic programme for those returning to Colleges and Universities to increase vaccine uptake in the 16-29 age group in particular. R.Morton, Director of Nursing, Midwifery and AHPs 11 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 10 Expand the routine adult and child influenza vaccines to help manage the impact of the ongoing Covid -19 pandemic. The 2021/22 influenza programme will be targeted at: people aged 50 years and over in the age based programme; School age children to year 12; and other at risk groups and HSCNI workers. The flu vaccine programme officially commenced on 4th October and is progressing for the public in GP Practices, Community Pharmacy and schools, and for health and social care workers, through the Trust Health and Social Care worker campaign, including mobile visits to Care homes, and community pharmacy. The PHA is responsible for delivering flu vaccine uptake monitoring. In previous years monitoring was carried out using HSCB GP claim returns and auto-extraction of limited data from GP clinical systems. This year, however, a new regional Vaccine Management System (VMS) has been introduced to record COVID and flu vaccines. To date, there are issues with GP use of VMS for seasonal influenza with incomplete use of the system and difficulties recording data in a timely way (due to lack of admin support within practices): this is currently being addressed. There is a risk therefore that uptake may be reported as artificially lower than the true uptake, until the VMS is fully utilised by GPs. The first vaccine uptake report, reflecting implementation of the programme regionally is due 24 November 2021 (this will cover uptake over the Sept-October period). S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 11 Ensure Incident Management Teams are established to effectively manage outbreaks, especially in responding to clusters and new variants, to minimise the potential for wide spread infection. The Health Protection service continues to provide expert advice and support to all stakeholders in relation to new Covid-19 variants and clusters. Health Protection consultants also provide advice and support to Trusts and external stakeholders by joining IMT's and outbreak control management teams to ensure the health and wellbeing of the N. Ireland population. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 12 1. Covid 19 Response Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Oct Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 12 Take forward the implementation of the Health Improvement Recovery Plan and work with wider stakeholders, to continue to support those individuals and communities who have been adversely affected by Covid. Health Improvement Recovery Plan presented to AMT and PHA Board in May 2021, focussed on short term actions (2021-22), medium term (2022-25) and lone term (2025 +). Actions outlined in the recovery plan are currently being re-profiled into population health outcomes using a theory of change approach. Update to be presented to AMT by end of December 2021. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 13 Use research funding programmes (CHITIN, NIHR, Opportunity Led, Research Fellowships) to effectively manage the COVID 19 pandemic and ensure we save lives, protect our health and social care services and rebuild services to ensure the health and wellbeing needs of society are effectively addressed Nine studies funded through the HSC R&D Covid-19 call are ongoing as well as those funded through the national prioritisation exercise. Over 26,000 people from NI including staff, patients, carers, students, children and the wider public have now been invited Findings have identified new therapies to prevent and treat Covid- 19 including vaccines as well strategies to address the longer term physical and psychological impacts of Covid-19 meaning the evidence base to deal with the ongoing and future pandemics is ever expanding. Seven studies were funded/co-funded through the COVID-19 Rapid Response Funding Call: A mixed methods study of the community pharmacy workforce's preparedness for, and response to, the COVID-19 pandemic Effectiveness of staff well-being interventions in response to S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 13 1.

The impacts of each study will be reported separately, and reports will be made available on the HSC R&D Division website, but will include recommendations for staff, student and patient support, treatment and testing options, and contribute data to modelling and public health messaging plans. 14 Continue to progress quality improvement work linked to Covid learning / recovery Regional Learning System On 24th April 2020 Trust CEOs asked the HSCQI Network to provide support to Trusts and to the wider system in order to develop a regional learning system focused on lessons learned from COVID-19 to date. Harvesting of examples during a 90 day cycle resulted in regional agreement to focus the collective improvement effort on 3 key themes: virtual visiting, virtual consultations and staff psychological wellbeing. Work has been progressing in these 3 areas. Next steps: In order to support regional scale and spread within these learning themes, HSCQI have carried out a literature review to identify a robust framework for scale and spread. A proposed framework has been discussed with QI Leads and the HSCQI Leadership Alliance. If endorsed, this regional scale up framework will become an integral part of HSCQI Learning Dr A. Keaney, Director HSCQI HSCQI Hub Team returned from contact tracing end September 2021. Since then the work has been progressed with HSCQI carrying out a literature review to identify a robust framework for scale and spread. A proposed framework has now been discussed with QI Leads and the HSCQI Leadership Alliance. If endorsed, this regional scale up framework will become an integral part of HSCQI Learning System 15 1.

Additional information on the work progressed is provided in Appendix 1.14 going forward. 15 Develop a regional and consistent approach to promoting staff health and wellbeing across HSC through the HSC Healthier Workplace Health Network. Ensure support systems are in place to mitigate and understand impact of COVID on staff. HSC Healthier Workplace Health Network continues to meet and share best practice across all HSC organisations. Best practice has been shared across the Network on: Menopause Prostate cancer Nutrition Maintaining health and wellbeing in later years. Support for carers Regional HSC Workforce Wellbeing group has developed a Regional Staff Health and Wellbeing mini-website to collate and streamline resources across all HSC organisations for ease of access and signposting for staff. Website will be maintained and updated by the Regional Workforce Wellbeing Group and will carry the branding of all membership organisations. A Workplace Charter has been developed on behalf of all organisations and discussions are ongoing with DOH Workforce Branch to integrate with the emerging Workplace Staff Health and Wellbeing Health Framework and strategy.

Health Protection Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Sep Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red 1 Drive increased uptake of childhood and adult preventable disease vaccines, through targeting low uptake groups. Flu/COVID At this time of year, the PHA immunisation team prioritises the flu vaccine programme. In addition, the team is attending and supporting the DOH led COVID vaccine programme implementation and is responsible for delivery of the children's COVID vaccine programme. An Implementation Group for the children's programme has been established with key stakeholders and meets weekly. The children's COVID vaccine programme commenced in a limited way on 4th October and has expanded with majority taking place during November. Uptake as of 11th Nov is 17.5%. Additional weekend clinics have been agreed and additional funding has been provided to school nursing teams to enable this COVID vaccine uptake surveillance that provides additional information to that provided on the public facing dashboard has been established to assess uptake by school, age and deprivation. This will enable us the target agreed clinics at end of November / December and the new year to low uptake areas. Pregnancy vaccines The HP consultant lead for pregnancy vaccines has prioritised COVID vaccine uptake. Monitoring has been established via NIMATS and through the analytics platform system. Uptake as of end of September is 30%. Working with maternity commissioning colleagues to increase training for midwives and vaccinating sessions within antenatal setting. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) Monitoring will enable us the target agreed clinics at end of November / December and the new year to low uptake areas. PHA team is also carrying out a quantitative study to identify causes of low uptake in preschool children 17 2. Health Protection Action from Business Plan: Progress Achievability (RAG) Sep Mar Mitigating actions where performance is Amber / Red Other children's vaccines Since prior to pandemic, preschool vaccines were falling in a small but persistent way, similar to England, especially in 12mt and 24mt age groups, and is now appearing to plateau at a lower level. It is too early to see the impact of the pandemic on uptake but early indications suggest that there has not been further decline. Further analysis to assess falling uptake is being carried out to identify causes of low uptake in preschool children. Trusts child health teams are aware and have been following up. 2 Based on learning from responding to the pandemic, increase the PHA's Health Protection capacity to effectively manage on-going issues arising from the Covid 19 and enable it to develop the skills, knowledge and capacity to ensure that it can respond effectively to other health Protection issues and plan for managing future The Health Protection service has secured funding from DoH to enhance the service. Recruitment is underway to establish and enhanced a robust Health Protection service for the future. The posts range from consultant to administrative level. Recruitment should be completed with all new staff in post by the end of 2022. S.Bergin, Director of Public Health (interim) 18 2.

Explicative analytics - why is the world the way it is? Predicative analytics - what might the future hold for our population/communities? Evaluative analytics - did it make a difference and was it worth it? 6 Support DoH colleagues to ensure that public health policy is embedded in the development and delivery of Programme for Government eg transport, housing, air quality, greenways, economic development.

The current position across each programme is below: Bowel cancer screening: The delay in routine invitations is currently 23 weeks (reduced from 29 weeks). The catch up exercise will be completed by August 2022. No. of individuals with a completed screening test result 2021 activity as a % of 2019 activity 2019/20 2021/22 Quarter 1 (April - June) 22,398 22,703 101.4% *note the type of screening test used in the programme changed from January 2021.The above numbers can reflect invites/test kits that were sent out several months prior. Breast screening: The round length is currently 38 months. This is down from 41 months in September 2020 (although it remains above the standard of 36 months). This is being achieved through the provision of additional screening clinics. Progress will not be linear as it is dependent upon the continued availability of staff. July- Sept 2019 July- Sept 2021 2021 activity as a % of 2019 activity No of women invited 19,533 21,976 113% No of women screened (71% uptake) 103.2% 53 Cervical screening: The programme continues to operate with a 5 month delay in routine invitations with a formal catch up programme not likely to be feasible. Ongoing pressures are noted in relation to turnaround times for lab results and some colposcopy services. The number of screening samples received by the labs provides an indication of activity for women being screened. This figure is dependent on the number of women due for screening at a given time, the availability of appointments at GP practices, and the uptake by women, so it is subject to fluctuation. No. of cervical samples taken (as recorded received at a NI laboratory) 2021 samples taken as a % of 2019 samples 2019/20 2021/22 Quarter 1 (April - June) 31,668 27,939 88.2% Diabetic eye screening: The programme continues to use a risk stratified approach to invite individuals for screening. Additional in year funding was secured via the June monitoring review to support recovery, and further expansion of capacity is being taken forward with the Trust to move towards reintroducing routine screening. This programme has faced significant logistical challenges due to the impact of covid. As well as a reduced patient throughput required for infection control purposes, programme has had to develop a new model of service delivery. No. of people screened 2021 activity as a % of 2019 activity 2019/20 2021/22 Quarter 1 (April - June) 12,459 6,539 52.5% AAA screening: Surveillance scanning for men with small/medium AAA is operating as normal. Approximately 56% of men in the 20/21 cohort for primary screening have now been called for their initial appointment.

During weekly meetings with QI Leads (May and June 2020) HSCQI members from across the system explored the core components of a learning system, depicted in Diagram 1(Amar Shah, Chief Quality Officer at East London Foundation Trust). This diagram has been used to assess the readiness of HSCQI as a regional learning system. Diagram 1: Core components of a learning system. Diagram Credit: Amar Shah, ELFT 2019 Using the structure of a 90 day learning cycle the HSCQI Network continued with these weekly meetings. A number of regional workshops were designed to identify a wide range of learning. Attendance at each of the meetings and workshops and the diversity of attendees is shown below in Diagram 2. Harvesting of examples during the 90 day cycle resulted in regional agreement to focus the collective improvement effort on 3 key areas: virtual visiting, virtual consultations and staff psychological wellbeing. QI Science Literature Mandate - HSCQI Leadership Alliance HSCQI hub and spoke HSCQI Leadership Alliance Other stakeholders Local and regional data - Quantitative & Qualitative HSCQI ECHO Structured learning sets Life QI 55 Work streams for each of these 3 themes were established with representation from across the HSCQI network. To support this work the HSCQI Hub partnered with the Regional ECHO team to co-deliver monthly HSCQI learning sessions. Diagram 3 shows attendance numbers at each of the 7 sessions held between November 2020 and June 2021. The ECHO/HSCQI learning sessions were paused early June due to PHA Covid-19 pressures. Virtual Visiting: The scale and spread of virtual visiting across Trusts during 2020/21 during the COVID 19 pandemic has been a real success story, accelerated by the focus of HSCQI and of the HSCQI Leadership Alliance. Quality Improvement Teams from across the region engaged with HSCQI and collected data on activity as displayed below looking at the number of participating wards and uptake of virtual visiting slots. These QI teams used run and SPC charts Diagram 2: Attendance at HSCQI Network meetings/workshops Diagram 3: ECHO session attendance 56 to tell the story and show their tests of change. Examples of QI data collected from one of these teams shown in the appendix - diagrams 4 and 5. In addition to this quantitative data, QI teams also asked service users, families and staff for feedback to inform change and service development. To explore the regional picture, HSCQI partnered with the Regional Care Opinion Team to get regional feedback. This feedback is shown in diagrams 6 and 7. Following agreement with the HSCQI Leadership Alliance in June 2021, responsibility for sustaining virtual visiting now sits locally with Trusts, with regular \"check-ins\" from the HSCQI Hub to ensure sustainability. Staff psychological wellbeing: A number of examples of initiatives to support staff psychological wellbeing during the first wave of Covid-19 were harvested. Given the scope of this work, this workstram connected with other regional groups, for example colleagues in the Public Health Agency Staff Wellbeing group and with the DoH Regional Staff Health and Wellbeing group. Work has been progressed through all of these groups to develop a regional infographic and animation to promote the 'Bridge to Recovery' message for staff - diagram 8. Diagram 4 Diagram 5 Diagram 6 Diagram 7 Diagram 8 57 Virtual Consultations All Trusts have made progress in this area with many developing local guidance. Through the HSCQI Learning System sub group many are beginning to focus on data and measures to demonstrate the effectiveness or \"quality\" of Virtual Consultations. Measures being progressed through the virtual consultations work stream include: 1. Patient or service user feedback 2. Staff Feedback 3. The number of virtual consultations offered and the number of consultations that actually took place. Diagram 9 shows regional virtual activity between January and June 2021. Framework for scale up: In order to support regional scale and spread within these learning themes, HSCQI carried out a literature review to identify a robust framework for scale and spread. A proposed framework has been discussed with QI Leads and the HSCQI Leadership Alliance. If endorsed, this regional scale up framework will become an integral part of HSCQI Learning System going forward.

It is an essential service we often refer to and see positive outcomes for families who engage . (Family Support Hub Co -ordinator) \"I was so glad of the support especially over lockdown, even just to chat and take my mind off the situation for a while and also knowing you where there for support and help was a great comfort.\" Parent \"I like the ideas of how I can be not nervous. The things of what I could scale 1 -5 and how I can help myself.\" Child \"The service was a lifeline for me and got me through some difficult days. Every session was very helpful, and I felt listened to.

The PHA Financial Plan for 2021/22 was approved by the PHA Board in the June 2021 Board meeting, which described the opening financial position of the organisation and reported an anticipated breakeven position within 2021/22. 2. The Financial Plan identified a number of areas of projected slippage and how this was to be used to address in -year pressures and priorities. 3. This executive summary report reflects the latest position, as at the end of September 2021 (month 6). Supplement ary detail in the format of previous reports is provided in Annex A . Section B: Update - Revenue position 4. The PHA has reported a year to date surplus , at September 2021 , of \u00a30.5m (\u00a31.0m at August 2021) . The primary movements relate to the year to date are as follows: Programme expenditure - movement of \u00a30.46 m bringing the previous underspend to a small overspend cumulatively (\u00a30.03m). The main movements relate to: o expenditure within the area of Health Improvement back in line with profiled budget, a movement of \u00a30.3 7m from month 5, reducing the variance to an underspen d of \u00a3 0.02m; and o planned expenditure in the area of Campaigns being ahead of profiled budget, a movement of \u00a3 0.25m , creating a small cumulative overspend at the end of month 6 (\u00a3 0.30m ). a small decrease in Management & Admin underspend (\u00a30. 02m). 5. The updated position is summarised in the table below. N.B.

In respect of the year to date surplus of \u00a30.5m: There are a number of variances to profiled budget within the area of PHA Programme expenditure, inc luding expenditure in respect of Campaigns, referenced above, and a current underspend in the area of Service Development & Screening which is mainly due to a slight delay in the issue of funding for Breast Screening , profiled for issue in month 6 , and being issued in month 7. An underspend in the area of Management & Admin, primarily in the areas of Nursing & AHP and Operations , which reflects a high level of vacant posts in each area . Efforts are on -going to fill these posts as soon as possible. 7. The forecast year end position has moved marginally to \u00a30.79m (\u00a30.8m in the prior month ) and is being kept under close review. Followin g a mid -year review of all Programme planned expenditure : Covid related downturn has been projected in the Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) budget, with a projected surplus of \u00a30.5m for the year ; Contact Tracing Centre expenditure of a total of \u00a39m has been projected, with a net requirement being advised to DoH of \u00a38.5m, as a result of the identified NRT Covid downturn of \u00a30.5m. Section C: Risks 8. Internal Programme expenditure outturn . As in each year, Programme expenditure needs to be monitored closely to ensure that planned expenditure is met. As referenced above, the PHA senior team is conducting a mid-year review of expenditure plans to identify any potential easements or inescapable pressures which may need to be addressed in-year. 9. Management and Administration expenditure outturn. This i s closely monitored by the Finance team , in conjunction with PHA management, to ensure that the forecasted financial position is updated on a monthly basis. However, given current plans and timelines for recruitment , the level of slippage highlighted will require to be considered for reapplication to other priorities or pressures through the mid -year review process. 10. Ring -fenced funding - Covid . The position assumes that all areas of expenditure, funded via Covid funding, wil l breakeven. Currently the majority of Covid expenditure relates to the Contact Tracing Centre , however it is anticipated that expenditure will commence in other areas in the coming months . A business case for additional funding in respect of the Contact Tracing Service has been f inalised for issue to the DoH for additional funding in this area. Regular review s are undertaken on all areas relating to Covid ring -fenced funding, to identify any areas of risk and close liaison will continue with the D oH. 11. Covid response impact on P HA. It has been a challenging period for PHA, not least from the focus on the operational nature of the Contact Tracing Service and other Covid impacts to normal service provision . Staff internally have been sourced to support the service, which has impa cted the PHA's ability to fully conduct it's business as usual operational requirements. 12. Due to the complex nature of Health & Social Care, there will undoubtedly be further challenges with financial impacts which will be presented in year. PHA will continue to monitor and manage these with DoH and Trust colleagues on an ongoing basis. Section D: Update - Capital position 13. The PHA has a current capital allocation (CRL) of \u00a31 2.7m. This is primarily in respect of Research & Development (R&D) , \u00a312.6m and includes a recent additional allocation of \u00a30.64m for this area. 14. The overall summary position is reflected in the table below.

R&D expenditure is managed through the R& D Division within PHA, and funds essential infrastructure for research such as information databanks, tissue banks, clinical research facilities, clinical trials units and research networks. The element relating to 'Trusts' is allocated throughout the fina ncial year, and the allocation for 'Other Bodies' is used predominantly within universities - both allocations fund agreed projects that enable and support clinical and academic researchers. 16. CHITIN (Cross -border Healthcare Intervention Trials in Ireland N etwork) is a unique cross -border partnership between the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland and the Health Research Board in the Republic of Ireland, to develop infrastructure and deliver Healthcare Intervention Trials (HITs). The CHITIN project is funded from the EU's INTERREG VA programme, and the funding for each financial year from the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) matches expenditure claims, ensuring a breakeven position. 17. There is currently a small allocation for IT expenditure within PHA, \u00a30.09m, however additional funding is expected in this area which is contained within the Contact Tracing Business Case. 18. The Capital position will continue to be kept under close review throughout the financial year. Recommendation 19. The PHA Board are asked to note the PHA financial update as at September 2021. Public Health Agency Annex A - Finance Report 2021-22 Month 6 - September 2021 Year to Date Financial Position (page 2) Administration Budgets (page 5) At the end of month 6 PHA is reporting an underspend of \u00a30.5m against its profiled budget. This underspend is primarily the result of underspends on Administration budgets (page 6), offset by some expenditure ahead of profile on Programme budgets. Budget managers continue to be encouraged to closely review their profiles and financial positions to ensure the PHA meets its breakeven obligations at year-end.Approximately half of the Administration budget relates to the Directorate of Public Health, as shown in the chart below. A significant number of vacant posts remain within PHA, and this is creating slippage on the Administration budget. Management is proactively working to fill vacant posts and to ensure business needs continue to be met. Programme Budgets (pages 3&4) The chart below illustrates how the Programme budget is broken down across the main areas of expenditure. Full Year Forecast Position & Risks (page 2)PHA Financial Report - Executive Summary PHA is currently forecasting a surplus of \u00a30.8m for the full year (no change from \u00a30.8m in month 5 report), arising from identified slippage on Administration budgets. The Administration and Programme budgets are being continually reviewed in order to update the full year forecast. It is also assumed that any slippage identified in Ringfenced areas will be retracted by DoH. After staffing resources were diverted to assist in PHA's response to the Covid-19 surge, most staff have now been phased back. It is hoped that this will mitigate the risk regarding underspends arising in Programme and Ringfenced areas. 44% 20%19%0%3%2% 9%2%-1%PHA Programme Budgets 2020-21Health Improvement Health Protection Service Development & Screening R&D - capital R&D - revenue Operations Nursing & AHP Centre for Connected Health Other 19% 15% 60%1%2%3%Administration BudgetsNursing & AHP Operations Public Health PHA Board Centre for Connected Health SBNI Page 1Ringfenced Ringfenced Trust PHA Direct Trust & Direct Trust PHA Direct Trust & - - - - - - - - - Revenue Income from Other Sources - 31 - 1,241 1,272 - 30 - 605 635 38,574 19,287 - - - 19,287 PHA Direct Programme * 52,733 8,629 - 61,362 - 20,495 4,014 - 24,509 PHA - - 26,552 26,552 - - - - 789 789 - (29) - 533 504 Cumulative variance (%) 0.00% -0.14% 0.00% 3.92% 0.88% month Surplus/(Deficit) 800 * Please note that a number of minor rounding differences may appear througout this report. * PHA Direct Programme includes amounts which may transfer to Trusts later in the yearPublic Health Agency 2021 -22 Summary Position - September 2021 The year to date financial position for the PHA shows an underspend of \u00a30.5m, which is the result of underspend on Admin budgets and an overspend on Programme Budgets. Annual Budget Year to Date Programme Mgt & AdminTotalProgramme Mgt & AdminTotal A year-end underspend of \u00a30.8m is currently forecast (no change from \u00a30.8m in month 5 report), this underspend position is in relation to Admin budgets. This forecast position may be subject to change through the year and will be kept under review to identify any significant movements. For example, this would include any in-year impact to PHA's normal operations from its ongoing response to Covid-19 surges (such as support to the Contact Tracing service).

Service Development and Screening expenditure is currently behind the profiled budget at month 6, while Campaigns is showing a year-to-date overspend. These are timing issues only, and it is expected that all areas will achieve a breakeven position against budget by the end of the financial year. A review of the Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) activity has been completed and levels of uptake continue to be lower than expected, accordingly a surplus of circa 500k has been projected for the full year. This is demand lead and impacted by COVID activity in pharmacies and will be subject to continued monitoring. PHA is currently undertaking a review of all budget areas and the forecast position will be updated on completion of the exercise.-1,000,000 Nursing & AHP Campaigns Research & Development Service Development & Screening Health Protection Health Improvement Total PHA Direct Budget Page 4September 2021 Covid Transformation Other 8,463 3,828 - 106 3,935 Assumed Allocation - - 166 166 - 80 80 Total 7,966 272 391 8,629 3,828 - 186 4,014 Expenditure Trusts - - - - - - - - PHA Direct 7,966 272 391 8,629 - 186 4,014 Surplus/(Deficit) - - - - - - - - Transformation funding has been received for a Suicide Prevention project totalling \u00a30.3m.

Other ringfenced areas include Safe Staffing and EITP. Staff are presently being recruited regarding Safe Staffing and it is assumed that any underspends identified will be retracted by DoH and a breakeven position will be achieved for the year. Public Health Agency 2021-22 Ringfenced Position Annual Budget Year to Date PHA has received a COVID allocation of \u00a38.0m to date, \u00a35.0m of which is for Contract Tracing. PHA is working with DoH to assess the final costs of the Contact Tracing service, with a total cost of \u00a39.0m projected, net of NRT Covid downturn (\u00a30.5m), further funding is expected from DoH to cover this net cost once the relevant business case has been finalised. More detail on the COVID funding allocations PHA has received is provided in page 9 of this report.

This is driving reduced expenditure in areas such as travel and courses. Senior management continue to monitor the position closely in the context of the PHA's obligation to achieve a breakeven position for the financial year. The full year surplus is currently forecast to be \u00a30.8m. The SBNI budget is ringfenced and any underspend will be returned to DoH prior to year end.

This is managed through the R&D Division within PHA, and funds essential infrastructure for research such as information databanks, tissue banks, clinical research facilities, clinical trials units and research networks. The element relating to 'Trusts' is allocated throughout the financial year, and the allocation for 'Other Bodies' is used predominantly within universities - both allocations fund agreed projects that enable and support clinical and academic researchers. CHITIN (Cross-border Healthcare Intervention Trials in Ireland Network) is a unique cross-border partnership between the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland and the Health Research Board in the Republic of Ireland, to develop infrastructure and deliver Healthcare Intervention Trials (HITs). The CHITIN project is funded from the EU's INTERREG VA programme of \u20ac8.84m, and the funding for each financial year from the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) matches expenditure claims, ensuring a breakeven position. There is also currently a small allocation of \u00a392k for ICT capital expenditure within PHA.
