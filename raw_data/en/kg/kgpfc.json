Biomedical research encompasses a wide variety of interdisciplinary efforts aimed at understanding the fundamentals of the physiological and molecular processes that underpin human health and that are involved in disease, as well as applied work aimed at developing and testing possible cures and other health interventions. Our faculty and students across our seven departments along with many OSU interdisciplinary centers and institutes collaborate to deconstruct disease, probe the gut microbiome, engineer new genetic solutions, model smarter public health interventions and more. Based on detailed statistical analysis of the scientific workforce in the United States by the National Science Foundation, the data suggests that biomedical science is a growing area, not just in our country but globally, with dramatic increases recently in countries such as China.
