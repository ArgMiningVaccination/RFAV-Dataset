To achieve these goals, federally -recognized Indian Tribes and HHS engage in open, continuous and meaningful consultation. The 2011 Tribal Consultation Report provides a comprehensive summary of the Department's consultation efforts from October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011. HHS's guiding policy, the Tr ibal Consultation Policy, was revised in 2010, and signed by Secretary Sebelius on December 14, 2010. In keeping with prior versions, the current policy calls for the Department to measure and report the results and outcomes of its Tribal consultation per formance to fulfill the government -to-government relationship with Indian Tribes. This report describes the significant progress that the Department has made over the last year and a half towards reshaping the way that work with Tribes is conducted. Unde r the leadership of Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been working hard to implement the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care reform law which was passed on March 23, 2010. Many of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act specifically reference Tribes, urban Indian organizations, the Indian Health Service (IHS), or Tribal and urban Indian health facilities. Tribes, as sovereign nations, have businesses, employ people, and administer health programs and grants, and, therefore, are among the primary beneficiaries of the insurance reforms, grant programs, and cost -saving measures of the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, as part of the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) was reauthorized. The Department has prioritized consultations by operating divisions and regional offices around the Affordable Care Act, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, and other issues of interest . The Department has made key leaders accessible and available and has created and implemented new advisory structures and policies. At th e December 2011 White House Tribal Nations Conference, Secretary Sebelius echoed her commitment to working closely with T ribal nations: \"I hav e been proud to see the relationship between our nations grow stronger and stronger. In the face of immense challenges ahead, we will need one another more than ever. That's why this conference and our consultation are so important. This Administration is co mmitted to shaping a future where every American Indian and Alaska Native has access to the care and support to achieve their highest aspirations. We understand and abide by the true meaning of the government to government relationship. And we believe in true partnership with you. We have made great progress and I know that through our partnership we will continue to move forward, in support of strong healthy Tribal communities. \" The 2011 Tribal Consultation Report's format largely mirrors that of last year's report . Feedback from Tribal leadership indicates that this format is easily readable and accessible. The Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs (IEA) welcomes any feedback or suggestions readers have on improving the report. Feedback and suggestions can be submitted by email to consultation@hhs.gov. 2011 Tribal Consultation Overview 8 Executive Summary Section I: 2010 HHS Consultation Overview lists the consultation efforts of the HHS Office of the Secretary.

Pl ease feel free to review this report online at our website: http://www.hhs.gov/ofta . 2011 Tribal Consultation Overview 9 2011 Major Accomplishments 2011 MAJOR HHS OUTCOMES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS Secretary Sebelius sends letter to State Governors regarding Tribal State Relations and Consultation On September 14, 2011, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote the Governors of the states regarding the importance of Tribal relations and consultation. In the letter , the Secretary reiterated her commitment to the government -to-government relationship with American Indian and Alaska Native Nations and encouraged states to consult with Tribes as they administer health and human services programs supported by federal funding. A copy of the letter is attached in the appendix. Secretary's Tribal Advisory Committee (STAC) As part of the Department's efforts to improve services, outreach, and consultation efforts with Tribal partners , Secretary Sebelius established the Secretary's Tribal Advisory Committee in Decem ber of 2010 . The establishment of a T ribal advisory committee at the Secretarial level has created a coordinated, department -wide strategy to incorporate Tribal guidance on HHS priorities, policies and budget, improve the government -to-government relations hips, and mechanisms for continuous improvement with HHS services to Indian Tribes. Since its inception, the STAC has met five times and established three priorities: 1) Eliminating health and human services disparities; 2) Increasing access to HHS resources and funds for Tribes and Tribal populations; and 3) Improving the Tribal/State/Federal relationships. Several accomplishments of the STAC have been: 1. Supporting Tribal Access to Grants: On December 6, 2011, a workshop was held for HHS program and grant managers from each HHS operating division designed to give the HHS program and grant reviewers a better understanding of Tribes, how Tribes work, why Tribes are unique and how to work with Tribes. 2. Tribal Eligibility for Grants: HHS has taken steps to make sure Tribes have an accessible, accurate, and comprehensive list of every grant offered by HHS for which tribes are eligible. It has been a large undertaking by HHS. It is the goal of HHS to provide a list to the Tribes as well as make recommendations to the Secretary that where she has administrative authority she will make changes to grant eligibility for Tribes where they are not explicitly eligible. 3. Expansion of Services: Tribal Self Governance: HHS through the advice of the STAC explored and reviewed the programs that were identified in the 2003 Feasibility Study to determine if we had authority to authorize a demonstration via any of those programs. Through the review HHS was not able to identify any authority that would permit a demonstration project of the sort proposed by the study carried out under Title VI of the ISDEAA. In response these findings HHS has created a Self Governance Tribal Federal Workgroup (SGTFW). The purpose of the SGTFW is to assist HHS in developing further plans for the ex pansion of Tribal Self -Governance. The workgroup will begin their work in February 2012. Federal Medical Assistance Percentages for Indian Tribes On August 1st, the rule for the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAP) for Indian Tribes became effective. FMAP had not previously been calculated for Indian tribes because they had not previously been eligible grantees for programs that use FMAP. However, as a result of the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and tribal consortia became eligible to operate foster care, adoption assistance, and kinship guardianship assistance programs authorized under title IV -E of the Social Security Act. These programs use the FMAP to calculate the federal share of costs. Because of low incomes, most Indian tribes, tribal organizations and tribal consortia will be 2011 Tribal Consultation Overview 10 2011 Major Accomplishments eligible for the maximum FMAP of 83 percent. Of the 158 Indian tribes that either currently have agreements with states to operate t itle IV -E programs or have expressed interest in operating these programs directly, 121 would receive the maximum FMAP rate of 83% . Most others have per capita incomes that would result in an FMAP lower than the maximum, but still higher than the states within which they are located. National Health Service Corps Designation for Indian Health Service and Tribal Facilities The Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) has designated all IHS/tribal facilities as National Health Service Corps approved sites. This allows IHS/tribal facilities to recruit and retain primary care providers by utilizing the scholarship and loan repayment incentives offered through the National Health Service Corps program. On May 6, 2011, Dr. Mary Wakefield and Dr. Yvette Roubideaux sent welcome letters to all site d irectors outlining the benefits of becoming a National Health Service Corps approved site. As a second step in the initiative, HRSA and IHS are partnering to designate a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPS A) score for over 300 newly approved IHS/tribal facilities. Medicaid Meaningful Use Incentive In coordination with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), eligibility for Medicaid Meaningful Use incentives has been modified to allow all T ribal clinics to be treated as Federally Qualified Health Centers for purposes of qualifying for these incentives. This modification allows T ribal clinics to meet the needy individual patient volume threshold, rather than the more stringent Medicaid patient volume threshold, making it easier for tribal clinics to qualify for these incentives. SAMHSA: Uniform Block Grant Application On July 26, the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) announced a new application process for its major block grant programs which include the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant and the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant (MHBG). The change is designed to provide States greater flexibility to allocate resources for substance abuse and mental illness prevention, treatment and recovery services in their communities. One of the key changes to the block grant application is the expectation that States will provide a description of their tribal consultation activities. Specifically, the new application's planning sections note that States with federally -recognized Tribal governments or Tribal lands within their borders will be expected to show evidence of Tribal consultation as part of their Block Grant planning processes. However, Tribal governments shall not be required to waive sovereign immunity as a condition of receiving Block Grant funds or services. Included within the MHBG application SAMHSA notes that States should identify strategies for the MHBG that reflect the prior ities identified from the needs assessment process. Affordable Care Act Outreach The Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs (IEA) has been coordinating and communicating directly with Tribes on the Affordable Care Act on a regular basis. HHS engages tribal partners in monthly conference calls, quarterly reports, listening sessions, and weekly emails , as well as special consultations. It is our intention that this outreach effort will complement and enhance the interagency implementation effort and improve communication between the federal government and tribes. Active partners in this outreach effort include the White House Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs, Indian Health Service, Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, Office of Health Reform, and the Office of Personnel Management. 2011 Tribal Consultation Overview 11 2011 Major Accomplishments Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Tribal Consultation Policy On August 18, 2011 Acting Assistant Secretary George Sheldon signed the ACF Tribal Consultation Policy. This policy sets official protocol on how the agency engages tribes in consultation on legislation, regulations, and policies that affect the services delivered to federally recognized tribes. Representatives from tribes met with ACF staff over the summer of 2010 to discuss how ACF consults with Indian tribes. After months of discussion, including consultation and internal review, a policy specific to ACF programs was listed in the Federal Register for a 45-day comment period in December 2010. This policy provides a clear channel of communication that lays out who responds on behalf of the agency, a timeline for responses, and where the communication takes place with tribal leaders. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Tribal Consultation Policy On November 17, 2011, CMS Administrator Dr. Donald Berwick signed the CMS Tribal Consultation Policy. CMS has been working on an agency -specific tribal consultation policy for several years and the policy is consistent with the HHS tribal consultation policy. The purpos e of the policy is to establish a clear, concise and mutually acceptable process for consultation between CMS and Indian Tribes and to improve greater access to CMS programs by American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). The policy was distributed to all 565 Tribes via a Dear Tribal Leader letter. 2011 Annual Tribal Budget and Policy Consultation At the 2011 Consultation Session, Tribal representatives provided testimony, received responses from HHS leadership regarding the budgets and policies of nine HHS agencies, and participated in a department -wide discussion on cross cutting issues. The Tribes indentified two crosscutting issues that they wanted to specifically consult on: the Affordable Care Act and State Budget Reductions Impacting Medicaid. In t he FY 2012 Budget Congress appropriated an increase of $237 (5.8%) for IHS over FY 2011 as well as increases for AI/AN programs at ACF and AoA. Regional Tribal Consultation Sessions The HHS Regional Tribal Consultation Sessions are designed to solicit Tribes' priorities and needs on health and human services programs. The sessions provide an opportunity for Indian Tribes to articulate their comments and concerns on budgets, regulations, legislation, and HHS policy matters. This year marks the 8th year of these consultation sessions in the field ; between March through May of 2011, HHS held ten regional Tribal consultation sessions across the country with the goal of improving the HHS Tribal consultation process, agency policies, and overall communication. These regional s essions were well -attended, with over 350 federally recognized Tribes participating. Secretary Sebelius Tribal Engagement Secretary Sebelius actively engaged Tribes throughout 2011. The Secretary wanted to ensure that she was personally involved in the delivery of HHS communication and accomplishments directly to Tribes and elected Tribal leadership. The following is a list of Tribal meetings, speaking engagements, and site visits Secretary Sebelius participated in during 2011: Muckles hoot Tribal Nation Site Visit (February) National Congress of American Indians Executive Winter Session (March) HHS National Tribal Budget Consultation (March) Secretary's Tribal Advisory Committee Meetings o March 2, 2011 2011 Tribal Consultation Overview 12 2011 Major Accomplishments o May 18, 2011 o September 14, 2011 Alaska Tribal Site Visits (August) o Alaska Tribal Health Consortium o South Central Foundation o Alaska Native Health Board o Village of Ana ktuvu k Pass o Village of Barrow o Village of Tanana o Tanana Chiefs Conference White House Tribal Nations Conference (December) Meeting with President Obama and Tribal Leaders (December) 2011 Tribal Consultation Overview 13 13th Annual Conference 13TH ANNUAL NATIONAL HHS TRIBAL BUDGET AND POLICY CONSULTATION On March 2 -4, 2011, HHS hosted the 13th Annual Department -wide Tribal Budget and Policy Consultation Session in Washington, D.C. The registered 82 participants were Tribal leaders and representatives, Indian organization leaderships and staff, such as the National Congress of American Indians and the National Indian Health Board, and HHS leadership and staff. Dur ing the Tribal Resource Day on March 2nd, HHS presented on topics selected to assist Tribes in understanding HHS, the federal government, and the resources available. The Tribal Resource Day also provided HHS staff and tribal representatives a valuable opportunity to directly interact. On M arch 3rd, HHS Deputy Secretary Bill Corr welcomed Tribal leaders and representatives and affirmed the Department's commitment to American Indian and Alaskan Native communities. Tribes expressed the need to consult on policies that impact them and noted they appreciated HHS government -to-government consultation. Tribal representatives also described the difficulties they face operating under the FY 2011 continuing resolution, the need for increased Contract Health funding, and barriers they face in trying to access federal programs. Ag ency leadership and staff from ACF, AoA, SAMHSA, HRSA, NIH, AHRQ, and FDA gave updates on their activities that impact Tribes. The Tribal representatives provided highlights of their testimony and had an opportunity to ask questions of the agencies. For example, HRSA reported that a major legal barrier was removed, allowing IHS Facilities greater participation in HRSA's National Health Service Corps, that will help fill vacancies at IHS facilities. Commen ts from Tribes included requested for increased funding, the value of thoughtfully including Indians in research methodologies, State and Tribal relationships, and the need to consult with Tribes when new tobacco regulations may impact them. On March 4th, the agenda moved to two cross -cutting issues: 1. Af fordable Care Act Overview 2. State Budget Reductions Impacting Medicaid At the conclusion of consultation, Tribal leaders discussed budget priorities for FY 2013 with Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Assistant Secretary for Financial Resources Ellen Murray, IHS Director Yvette Roubideaux, Administration for Native Americans Commissioner Lillian Sparks, Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Paul Dioguardi, and several of the Secretary's policy advisors. Tribal Priorities for the FY 2013 Budget: Behavi oral Health - Tribes requested additional financial resources, service integration, and coordination across HHS. Diabetes - Combating diabetes and its resultant complications remains a top health priority in Indian country. Cancer - Tribes noted limited access to cancer screening and lack of specialized care contribute to the increasing cancer mortality rate among AIAN, while cancer deaths have been declining overall among all US races. 2011 Tribal Consultation Overview 14 13th Annual Conference Follow -up -- I mpact of the 2011 Consultation: The FY 2012 President's Budget proposes an increase in HHS funding targeted specifically toward serving the needs of American Indians and Alaskan Natives, including an increase of $571 million, or 14 percent over FY 2010, for the Indian Health Service. The budget also includes an increase of $50 million at SAMHSA for a new Tribal Block Grant Program focused on behavioral health and prevention, and increases for AIAN programs at ACF and AoA. 2011 Tribal Consultation Overview 15 Regional Consultation Summary 2011 HHS REGIONAL CONSULTATION SUMMARY On November 5, 2009, at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, President Obama demonstrated his commitment to American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) and to fulfilling the consultation requirements of Executive Order 13175\u2014originally issued by President Clinton on November 5, 2000\u2014by signing a Presidential Memorandum. Executive Order 13175 - Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments calls for all Federal agencies to come into compliance with regards to regular, meaningful consultation and collaboration with Tribal officials in the development of Federal policy that have Tribal implications; to strengthen the U.S. government - to-government relationships with Indian Tribes; and to reduce the imposition of unfunded mandates upon Indian Tribes. In accordance with the President's directive, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) convened 11 regional Tribal Consultations in 2011. Held from January 6, 2011, through June 9, 2011, the consultations' primary purpose was to allow Tribal leaders to discuss programmatic issues and overall concerns of Tribes at the local level with HHS officials. The regional sessions also provided an opportunity for Tribes to hear updates from HHS, discuss the revised HHS Tribal Consultation Policy (signed by HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on December 14, 2010), provide testimony and/or comments on topics of interest, and pose questions on issues that concern Tribal communities and members. This document serves as the executive summary for al l of the 2011 HHS Regional Tribal Consultations, summarizing the common themes and overarching priorities. It is national in perspective. This is important to note because, as various Tribes have poignantly articulated, each Tribe is different and unique . Tribes face different challenges and present different needs based on their size, geographic location, structure, etc. To that end, the concerns, issues, and recommendations cited in this document reflect common items shared among them. Information on specific regional sessions is available via individual meeting and executive summaries, under separate cover. The 2011 HHS Regional Tribal Consultations were held as follows: Januar y 6, 2011, Green Bay, WI, Region V February 24, 2011, Oklahoma City, OK, Regions VI and VII March 10, 2011, Las Vegas, NV, Region IX and VIII March 24, 2011, Rapid City, SD, Regions VII and VIII March 29, 2011, Verona, NY, Region II March 30, 2011, Cherokee, NC, Region IV March 31, 2011, Boston, MA, Region I April 26, 2011, Window Rock, AZ, (Navajo Nation), Regions VI, VIII, IX April 28, 2011, Albuquerque, NM, Regions VI and VIII June 7, 2011*, Grand Ronde, OR, Region X June 9, 2011*, Anchorage, AK, Region X * Due to a pending government shutdown, the Grand Ronde and Anchorage consultations were rescheduled from April 13th and April 15th to June 7th and June 9th, respectively. Ag endas for each regional consultation were tailored for that specific area. Generally, each consultation was conducted as follows: registration; welcome activities; introductions and opening remarks; presentations and response; and wrap- up/next steps. Deliverables resulting from each consultation included an executive summary, as well as a detailed meeting su mmary comprising the following sections: 1. Ov erview and Purpose of Session 2. Tribal Priorities 2011 Tribal Consultation Overview 16 Regional Consultation Summary 3. Open Tribal Leader Comment/Testimony/Discussion 4. Highlight of Issues Brought up by Tribes 5. Responses from Regional Staff Participants 6. Agenda 7. Wrap -Up and Next Steps Tr ibal leaders and representatives voiced their concerns about challenges facing their Tribal communities. Notwithstanding, a few positive remarks were consistently heard across the regions. Namely, the Obama Administration was praised for its commit ment to Indian Country \u2014as evidenced by an increase in fiscal year (FY) 2011 and the proposed FY 2012 budgets for the Indian Health Service (IHS) over FY 2010; regional directors were credited for their role in helping to improve the accountability of the Federal government; and IHS Director Yvette Roubideaux was applauded for using her Director's Blog to keep Tribes updated on relevant issues. Similarly, Tribes and Tribal officials expressed their approval when learning of the following information: All T ribal employees will be eligible for Federal Employee Health Benefits. Intradepartmental Council on Native American Affairs (ICNAA) is addressing the issue of Tribal access to grants, including eligibility/ineligibility for HHS grants. ICNAA is focused on expanding self -governance outside of HHS. Methamphetamine/Suicide Prevention Initiative (MSPI) funding is in the proposed 2012 budget. Proposed 2012 Behavioral Health- Tribal Prevention grants slated for $50 million\u2014 with a base award to every Tribe that applies of $50,000. [Remaining $25 million will be awarded through a distribution formula.] Ac ross the regions, common themes and priorities centered on the following six categories: Tribal -State relations; funding; service needs; policy; process; and dat a issues. Highlights pertaining to each of the categories are provided below. Tribal -State Relations Role HHS plays in Tribal- State relations. Impact of State budgets on Tribes, especially optional Medicaid Services. Tribes' options/opportunities in regards to States' lack of consultation with them and/or lack of willingness to move forward on Affordable Care Act (ACA) activities.

Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) and Tribes cooperation/agreement on payer of last resort and how Tribes submit claims. Tribes to be considered 51st State for reimbursement purposes. Federal officials and Congress members' understanding of Tribal sovereignty, treaties, and issues in Indian County. Issues regarding Indian health provider licensing. Moving forward the issue of Tribal self -governance. Process Time liness of CHS referrals is an issue. Requests for timely feedback on Tribal comments, questions, and concerns. Requests for cross -agency collaboration. Need for more non- competitive grants to Tribes. Data Diffic ult for Indian clinics to collect data and set up electronic systems. Tribes not informed of results when they respond to requests for data. Tribes' difficulty in understanding health information technology (HIT) and meaningful use. In r esponse to the concerns raised, at times Federal officials indicated that statutory requirements limited their ability to influence change. Other times, they were immediately able to respond. When that was not possible, they indicated that they needed to follow -up with answer s at a later date. Among the Federal responses to some of the Tribal concerns included the following: New VA Tribal Consultation Policy was released and a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the VA and IHS instituted. From the MOU, 12 national workgroups were established to address increasing access to care; and a 13 th workgroup will focus solely on Alaska. Training is underway to train individuals on how to become a Tribal Veteran Representative. The issue of payer of last resort is being discussed. 2011 Tribal Consultation Overview 18 Regional Consultation Summary Tribes can participate on monthly calls for ACA updates. SAMHSA will place regional administrators in all the regions over the next two years. Enrollment dates for Medicare are now October 1st - December 15th. ACA has provisions for long- term care services. CMS release of best practices regarding ways States could consult with Tribes was expected in August/September 2011. IHS proposing funding in the 2012 budget for youth tele- mental health projects and innovative facilities construction. ACA will yield Health Professions Opportunities grants; funds for Tribal Court Improvement programs; Native Asset Building Initiative, and expansion of the NHSC.

On August 16 th at Exeter, New Hampshire and again on November 14th at the DentaQuest Foundation, Westborough, Massachusetts, Director Hager met with the RHEC which includes tribal representatives from the region. The Region I RHEC is one of ten councils in the United States, each of which covers the same geographical territory as an HHS region. The RHEC serve as leaders and catalysts for strengthening health equity actions within a region in response to the National Partnership for Action's (NPA) National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity; and enhance collaboration between health equity stakeholders in the region, including public -private partnerships, alignment between initiatives and programs, and leveraging of assets to more effectively accomplish health disparity reduction goals. SUMMARY OF REGIONAL CONSULTATION SESSIONS The 2011 Tribal Consultation for Region I was held on March 31, 2011, in B oston, Massachusetts. The primary purpose of Consultation was to serve as a forum Tribal leaders to discuss programmatic issues and overall concerns of Tribes at the local level with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials. The regional session also provide an opportunity for Tribes to be aware of HHS updates, discuss the updated HHS Tribal Consultation Policy, provide testimonies and/or comments on topics of interest, and pose questions on issues that concern Tribal communities. Following the Regional Consultation, the ORD immediately began working towards the resolution of the action items and issue requested by the tribes. The ORD will continue to build on its relationship with tribes and their leaders to improve the health and human services provided to tribal citizens in 2011 and beyond. The Region I Draft Consultation Report was submitted for the Tribes review and comment on May 26, 2011. Highlights of Consultation: Lynn Malerba, Chief, The Mohegan Tribe, opened the mee ting with a Tribal blessing.

Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act and how different attorneys general respond 9. Contract health services 10. Title VI of the Tribal Self -Governance Amendments of 2000, self -implementing and non - self-implementing portions of the Act. To move forward this should be permanently authorized 11. Aging 12. Federal employee health benefits 13. Substance abuse and mental health 14. Executive summary of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Pam Hyde, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Administrator, informed attendees of Secretary Sebelius' new Tribal Advisory Committee (STAC) and updated HHS's Tribal Consultation Policy. Administrator Hyde also provided the Keynote Presentation: \"Tribal Law and Order Act\" and addressed SAMHSA's work to improve behavioral health in Indian Country. Hyde characterized the SAMHSA mission is to r educe the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on America's communities whose challenges include higher adolescent death rates, youth suicide rates, binge alcohol use, illicit drug use, sexual assault and homicide against women, intimate partner violence, incarceration and arrest, and historical trauma. Finally, SAMHSA proposed for a $50M Behavioral Health- Tribal Prevention Grant for FY2012. While it is not competitive, grant recipients are required to apply for must apply every 3 years and submit annual reports. As of the writing of this report, the criteria for the grant have not been set. Dr. Harry Brown, Chief Medical Officer, IHS -Nashville Area, reported that the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) contains permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). Some important provisions for American Indians are equal access to State- based exchanges with no co -pay or deductible if their income is less than 300% of the Federal poverty level as well as expanded care coverage for dependent children until age 26. Furthermore, tribally hired health care professionals are granted the same status as Federal health care professionals and can be licensed in any state. Dr. Brown further noted that m programs interact around electronic health records (EHR) and meaningful use, e.g., drug -drug and drug -allergy checks, smoking status, or clinical quality measures such as hypertension, tobacco use, and influenza immunization. Cross- cut ting Issue Area #1: Affordable Care Act (ACA) Jaye W eism an, CMS, reported that the prescription drug benefit is included to close the coverage gap under Part D, and will gradually increase until 2020. Eligibility is determined by prescription drugs obtained through Tribal pharmacies. Prevention services, e.g., cancer screenings and wellness visits, are given at no cost. Medicaid eligibility will expand and state health insurance exchanges will be introduced. The Tribal Affairs Group in CMS provides technical information; their meetings are listed on the Web site http://www.cms.gov/default.asp . Jeff Reck, Health Resources and Services Administration ( HRSA) reported that ACA generally does not impact HRSA in any new ways but instead magnifies its resources to carry on its programs. There are now 80 programs for 3000 grantees. HRSA focuses on the uninsured, HIV/AIDS -positive pregnant women and children, primary health care, and maternal and child health. The National Health Service Corps incentivizes providers to work in medically underserved areas. HRSA has a department that focuses on rural health (62% of the country is rural; and 40% of Tribal lands are rural). A HRSA e- mail address list has been compiled, and 2011 Regional Office Reports 25 Region 1: Boston they established a website specifically for Native American public health issues with a tool that offers the ability to find a community health center or IHS center by typing in a zip code. Lisa Wilson and Pete Nakahata, Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) [via telephone], provided an overview of CCIIO's functions as ACA provisions related to private health insurance with the goal of restoring power to consumers and holding insurance companies accountable. Beginning in 2014, the biggest change is helping consumers shop for and enroll in an insurance plan that fits their needs. Wilson and Nakahata noted reported that s - based exchanges will bring individuals and small businesses into a larger purchasing group, which will allow flexibility and one -stop shopping. These exchanges are intended to distribute insurance benefits, and to regulate insurance. Panel #2\u2014 Aging, Family & Human Services Issues Mary A nn Higgins, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), said ACF administers more than 60 programs, not particularly designed for Tribes. In addition to Head Start, they administer three grants that have a 5% tribal set -aside\u2014Home Visiting Program, Health Professional Opportunities, and Personal Responsibility Education Program \u2014and the Assets for Independence Project. Most ACF grants are not competitive and have no match at all. A 2010 resource directory has been compiled and is available on- line. ACF has begun its own Consultation process. Kathleen Otte, Administration on Aging (AoA), reported that through the Older Americans Act, AoA fun ded 256 grants this year, and further announced 218 care- giver grants on April 1. AoA funds are seen as a safety net; thereby reduced monies make collaboration more important. Gene Brown encouraged all Tribes to apply. AoA program eligibility requires the minimum age limit of 60 years. Otte also noted that Title VI programs should be doing more in prevention and wellness, physical activity, health screening, nutrition counseling, and weight watching. For more information on resources , see http://www.olderindians.org/ . Forward comments on Older Americans Act programming to http://aoa.gov/ . Panel #3\u2014Health, Wellness and Behavioral Health Michael Milner, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health (OASH), reviewed OASH's functions on prevention and preparedness activities in collaboration with other organization that foster stronger State -Tribe interactions. ADM Milner proposed to discuss ways to bring community health directors and State health directors together and identify opportunities for collaboration to integrate behavioral health and primary care. Chris Bersani, HRSA reported that while many HRSA programs are not specific to Tribes, many were applicable and multiple collaborative projects were underway. Bersani noted that one of HRSA's immediate goal s is to integrate prevention activities with obesity diagnosis because while many patients are screened, measuring prevention proves to be a continuous challenge. This is particularly important for the Tribal communities as members of this population are most often affected by high -risk behavior, e.g., smoking and lack of preventive care. Peter Delaney, SAMHSA Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, reported that preventi on is SAMHSA's number one goal, followed by promotion of wellness and resilience in order to prepare communities for disasters. In other words, SAMHSA is working to finding good ways of coping and not moving toward drug abuse given that emergency departments' use of prescription drugs has increased 78%). Since problems related to substance abuse are suicide and trauma, the criminal justice system has created trauma -informed systems. To improve access to the community for military families, SAMHSA has also been working with the National 2011 Regional Office Reports 26 Region 1: Boston Guard. The goal is to create prepared service systems, improve quality of treatment as well as prevention, and create resilience for emotional health, and a seamless set of care for the military. SAMHSA firmly believe that be havioral health is a critical component of healthcare and therefore emphasizes the need to collect good data. SAMHSA reported that a draft of its Behavioral Health Quality Framework draft will be soon be posted on its website. Gary Perlman, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), reviewed the features of a multi -purpose software to help Tribes deal with contaminated land, which consists of two parts, 1) a tool to inventory and prioritize sites and 2) to analyze health risks. Perlman noted that the tool is Microsoft Access -based and can store documents within it. These features included a 1) Site Visit Guide prompts visual inspection and exposure pathways, and a health risk module that covers edible species and toxins that enter through the skin. Perlman noted that free tool (including technical support and training) has been widely distributed. Mr. Perlman invited the Tribes to provide feedback for improvements. Panel #4\u2014Preparedness and Response G ary Kleinman, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), gave an overview of the National Health Security Strategy as a way toward ensuring community resilience. While ASPR is primarily responsible for public health and works directly with States and Tribes in planning and preparedness activities and operations during emergencies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has authority to coordinate all agencies during emergencies... In between emergencies, ASPR provide supports capacity building and training activities that to ensure community resilience such as managing the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) - the civilian Medical Volunteer Reserve Corps. Mark Libby, ASPR, presented varying communication options that Tribal nations can access in cases of emergency preparedness and response, primarily through IHS, such as the availability of 24- hour number to call when needed. Libby emphasized that ASPR's mission is to promote preparedness and response, which in turn promotes resilience. ASPR fulfills its missing by helping communities assess risk and hazards in the community, facilitate education and training especially for the health workforce, and coordinate activities across jurisdictions. For response activities, ASPR is the lead Federal agency for HHS, and receives huge support from Regional Health Administrators. ASPR's general concept of operations is helping communities implement their response plans, but they do not provide funds. Their response assets include access to 6,000 to 9,000 members of the Public Heal th Service Corps, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), HHS, and FEMA, with the core of the Disaster Medical Assistance Teams serving as its core response teams. Pam Hyde, SAMHSA, noted that while SAMHSA has not been part of emergency planning, behavioral health issues happen immediately in an emergency, and should therefore begin to work with ASPR at the beginning of disaster preparedness. Panel #5\u2014Tribal -S tate Relations The O ffice of Civil Rights (OCR) provided an overview of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rule and the Health Information Technology for Clinical and Economic Health (HITECH) Act in response to previously expressed concerns from the Mohegan and Eastern Pequot Tribal leaders at Consultation and meetings held in 2010. These tribes expressed interest on the jurisdiction of the State Attorney General's office over the sovereign nations to enforce HIPAA and the HITECH Act and requested further clarification from OCR. 2011 Regional Office Reports 27 Region 1: Boston REGI ONAL VISITS TO TRIBES Regional Director Visits the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe\u2014 January 2011 On January 26th, 2011, Region I Director Christie Hager met with Mashpee Wampanoag Tribal Councilwoman Cheryl Frye- Cromwell & Tribal Health Development Officer Wanda Lord at the Mashpee Tribal Health Office.

Quarterly conference calls were scheduled and now they have been merged with the United South and Eastern Tribes (USET) to maximize Tribal participation. On March 29, 2011 Region II held the region- specific Tribal Consultation. Region I Director highlighted HHS cross -cutting programs and initiatives and the benefits provided by the Affordable Care Act. On May 19 th and 20th, the Administration on Aging (AoA) participated in a conference hosted by the Oneida Indian Nation, the \"Aging Well Conference\". This was a conference for American Indians and their caregivers. All federally recognized Indian Tribes in New York State were invited and over 100 Native Americans and caregivers participated. AoA met with three of the four Title VI grantees in New York State, The Senecas, St. Regis Mohawks and Oneidas. AoA gave a presentation on how to stay healthy, and discussed how new preventive health benefits, authorized by the Affordable Care Act could keep seniors healthy and due to the waiver of deductibles and co -insurance payments, people who were not getting any basic health care due to costs, could now see a physician and start to receive routine health care. In May 2011, Region II Director Torres facilitated communication between New York State Department of Health, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Tribal leader s as regards to the Health Insurance Exchange. The Insurance Department sent a letter to invite Tribal leaders to participate in public forums and reached out to the Office of the Regional Director requesting assistance to set up separate meetings with the Tribes for their input on issues related to the Health Insurance Exchange. On August 17 & 18, IGA Specialist Aguilar participated in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Indian Health Services (IHS) Training in Niagara Falls, NY. The meeting provided information to a group of tribal representatives from diverse Tribal nations including Onondaga, Seneca, Tuscarora, Shinnecock and St. Regis Mohawk. The training included information about Medicare Basics, Social Security Disability and the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Tribal Technical Advisory Group (TTAG). SAMHSA provided a presentation on behavioral health care and substance abuse specifically related to Tribes. The Veterans Administration provided information on eligibility and benefits. NYS Medicaid eligibility, Health Insurance Exchanges and the NY Bridge Plan. CMS Region II Native American Coordinator and other regional staff continue to assist the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe Partridge House Treatment Program in their reimbursement issues. CMS participates in calls and workgroups with IHS to help clarify the cross border Medicaid payment issue. The Partridge House is an inpatient substance abuse facility in Hogansville, NY. The clinic has been in operation since 1983 and is licensed by the State of New York. Partridge House provides culturally sensitive treatment that is unique from other non -tribal treatment facilities along with other accepted treatment practices. Partridge House accepts and provides treatment to Am erican Indians/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) from anywhere in the United States who qualify for their program. They have been unable to collect reimbursement on a regular basis for services provided to out of state patients that may have or are eligible for Medicaid in their home state. The issue is not only an issue for the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe but for many other Tribes who provide services to out of state Tribal members. 2011 Regional Office Reports 30 Region 2: New York In August after Hurricane Irene, the Office of the Regional Director reached out to G ov. Cuomo's Director of State Operations to reiterate the support of all regional components of HHS to help with the response and recovery efforts related to Hurricane Irene. The Office of the Regional Director also reached out to the NYS American Indian Health Program, to confirm that no assistance was needed from the Tribes. All was well, even the Shinnecock Reservation in spite of being located in Long Island, held up remarkably well. There was no flooding to main buildings, no loss of electricity, health and dental clinic was fully functioning with all staff present. IGA Specialist Aguilar collaborated with the NYS American Indian Health Program coordinator to arrange an informational meeting for the Project Directors of the NYS Health Insurance Exchange Planning on September 13, 2011.

SUMMARY OF REGIONAL CONSULTATION SESSIONS The 2011 Tribal Consultation for Region II was held March 29, 2011, in Verona, New York. The primary purpose of the consultation was to allow Tribal leaders to discuss programmatic issues and overall concerns of Tribes at the local level with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials. The regional session also provided an opportunity for Tribes to hear updates from HHS, discuss the updated HHS Tribal Consultation Policy, provide testimony and/or comments on topics of interest, and pose questions on issues that concern Tribal communities and members. Charmaine Frederick, Oneida Indian Nation, opened the meeting and introduced Mary Blau, Oneida Indian Nation, who gave the opening prayer.

Ms. Frederick and Dr. Torres served as co- moderators. Tribal leaders and other consultation attendees provided testimony and comments on topics of concern. Panel presentations highlighted new ACA funding opportunities for Tribal nations. The Tribal priorities cited were: 1. Self-i denti fying as American Indian to ensure appropriate health care. 2. Data, data access, and data- sharing: Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS), mandated by Article 28, Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), and EpiCenters. 3. Co-pay issue under HHS regulations; care is provided free and they are not allowed to collect a co -pay, including for people who access two different Tribal clinics. 4. Communications networking with various departments, especially Medicaid. 5. Finding a pool of providers who accept Medicaid rates to whom they can refer people. Highlights and objectives brought up by Tribes at this meeting were: Indian Health Service (IHS) will provide Tribes with an update on health insurance for Tribal employees. Explore data- sharing agreement between USET and New York State on SPARCS - sharing. 2011 Regional Office Reports 31 Region 2: New York Forward issues on interface or data -sharing between RPMS and SPARCS.

Cheryl Donald and IHS, Dr. Ricks or Dr. Brown, will follow -up to encourage Tribes to apply to be a National Health Service Corps (NHSC) site. Work with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to review section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, and assist Tribes in competing for HRSA grants. Cheryl Donald will let Tribes, USET, and IHS know whether Tribes can apply for HRSA grants under a single authority, e.g., USET. IHS will find out how to work with the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) to backfill positions or work on short -term projects. Philip Mossman will inform Tribes of upcoming Medicaid Redesign Team (MRT) meetings. Michael Melendez will set up Tribal consultation quarterly conference calls, beginning by proposing tentative dates over the next 2 weeks.

Gunn provided the group with a comprehensive presentation on the Affordable Care Act, including elements that focus specifically on the tribes. His thorough presentation specifically focused on how the ACA impacted the state of Florida and served to benefit its citizens, including specifically the members of the Miccosukee and Seminole nations. Gunn also used the opportunity to share updates from central office, including the dates and location of the upcoming tribal meetings. The visit to Miccosukee, which included a tour of the tribal grounds, including the health center, school, residential area and new administration building, was significant, even though the Honorable Chairman Colley Billie was unavailable for a meeting. No one from the Office of the Secretary had visited the reservation since former Deputy Secretary Claude Allen and the Region IV acting RD in 2004. The visit was made possible by an invitation extended by CMS tribal liaison Crystal Francis. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians expressed a concern over a need to be included in the formation and crafting of the state's health insurance exchange in mid- November. Choctaw Director of Financial Services, Donita Stephens contacted the ORD requesting assistance in reaching out to the proper officials regarding the committee that will form the Mississippi State Insurance Exchange. Stephens' correspondence with Choctaw's liaison, Phyliss Williams from the Division of Medicaid, led her to Misty Watson with the Department of Insurance. However, Stephens was unsuccessful in obtaining the information needed regarding the Mississippi Health Exchange and was unsure whether she was communicating with the proper agency in her desire to submit her name as the tribal contact regarding the exchange. In November, Stephens requested assistance with obtaining the Mississippi Title XIX State Plan and a listing of any amendment requests and ARRA waiver requests. Working through CMS, the ORD requested and received the needed documents, which were forwarded to the MBCI financial services director a few days later. Similarly, in October, Poarch Creek Health Director Candace Fayard requested assistance in connecting with the group charged with forming the Alabama State Health Insurance Exchange. Working through the regional CMS office, The ORD was able to connect her to the lead official. Also, in addition to regular disseminating grant announcements and other news of interest from the department, Region IV collaborated with USET to hold three quarterly calls in 2011. Working with Regional Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) Coordinator Kathy Handra, the ORD was able to connect Handra for an introductory meeting in May, with tribal representatives and begin conversations on the possibility of establishing an MRC unit thorough the Catawba Tribal Nation of Rock Hill, South Carolina. The new relationship led to an invitation for Dean Canty, Catawba Emergency Preparedness Coordinator, to attend the 2011 Integrated Medical, Public Health, Preparedness and Response Training Summit in Grapevine, Texas. While plans are ongoing for the establishment of the Catawba MRC, Canty was also invited to serve as a co -presenter, along with Seminole Tribe Emergency Management Operations Manager, Jason Dobronz, for the \"Tribal Partnership\" session at the 2012 Integrated Medical, Public Health, Preparedness and Response Training Summit . 2011 Regional Office Reports 34 Region 4: Atlanta SUMMARY OF REGIONAL CONSULTATION SESSIONS The 2011 Tribal Consultation for Region IV was March 30, 2011, in Cherokee, North Carolina. In addition to the host Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI), the Poarch Creek Band of Indians (PBCI), Vickie Bradley, Health and Medical Director for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, served as Tribal moderator. The HHS co -moderator was Anton Gunn, Director of the Region IV Office of HHS. Other tribal reps (3) included Candace Fayard, PBCI health director and Mary Harrison, Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (MBCI) health director. State officials included Heather Burkhardt , Planning and Evaluation Coordinator at NC Division of Aging and Adult Services and Audrey Edmisten from the Department of Aging and the Division of Medicaid Services, Kevin Kelley, Assistant Section Chief of Child Welfare Services (Child Protective Services) of the NC DHHS Division of Social Services and Barbara Pullen- Smith, Director of the Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities for the NC DHHS. Betty Moses, from the South Carolina Division of Medicaid Services and Alicia Crowder, from the Mississippi Department of Medicaid Services, were also in attendance. RD Anton Gunn co-facilitated the consultation, along with Cherokee Director of Health and Medical Services Director Vickie Bradley. Deputy Director Kidwell provided the HHS headquarters overview. IHS Acting Director Martha Ketcher presented an overview of her agency's work with the tribes and their implementation of the Affordable Care Act. United Southeastern Tribes (USET) Executive Director Kitcki Carroll attended his first Region IV consultation. Among the fifty -plus participants were representatives from CMS, AOA, HRSA, FDA, ACF, ASPR and the OASH. Following an opening prayer and traditional dancing, RD Gunn opened the Region IV Tribal Consultation. RD Gunn next introduced Lauren Kidwell, Deputy Director of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs at HHS. Providing an update from the national level, Ms. Kidwell noted that 2010 proved a significant year with the passing of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). National issues of concern: Maj or t opics of discussion included the shortage of emergency room staff in Indian Country Tribal input at State Health Officers' meetings Cuts to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's REACH program. Focus: ethnic health disparities Regional issues of concern: Regarding the insurance exchange, Mr. Casey Cooper of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians said he wanted to go on record with three main points: The issue essential community provider. CMS should issue a statement that Tribal providers and the Indian Health Service (IHS) meet the definition so there is no question or debate. Section 206 (Section 206 of the IHCIA clearly states that IHS and Tribal providers have the right to bill as though they are in network, regardless of whether they are in network or not, with private insurance. The challenge comes when insurers choose for the IHS or the Tribal provider to be out of network, then they issue payment to the beneficiary. 2011 Regional Office Reports 35 Region 4: Atlanta The definition of Indian. Cooper expressed the hope that the CMS definition will be the definition used in the interpretation and the application of the provisions of the law. Mr. Gunn will look for ways to encourage a conversation with the Department of Veterans Affairs regarding how the Tribes submit claims to the VA as well as issues surrounding payer of last resort. Tribes seek a greater sense of cooperation with the VA, Department of Defense and all agencies and departments connected to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. RD Gunn has initiated conversations seeking a solution and expects to report his findings by January 2012. HHS staff will inform Tribes of State Health Officers' meetings so Tribal representatives can attend regularly. Deputy Regional Health Administrator Sharon Ricks will keep the tribes updated on upcoming state health officer meetings. Mr. Gunn will share information about the CDC Tribal Consultation. RD Gunn will debrief CDC officials during his next meeting with them. Improve population wellness by investing in children's health with preventative health services and continuing to address such major concerns as diabetes, depression and substance abuse. Ricks will report back to Regional Health Administrator Cobb so that they can explore possible opportunities to support initiatives around the aforementioned maladies. Increase emergency room staffing in Indian Country. The RD defers to CMS on this issue. Maintain vigilant focus on racial and ethnic health disparities through the CDC's REACH program and other efforts. Secure funding for mental health providers, behavioral health services and the expansion of geriatric services. This concern will be channeled to th new SAMSHA office that will open in Region 4 in January 2012. Also, Martha Ketcher, of IHS directed Toedt to contact Elder Care Consultant Dr. Bruce Finke and Behavioral Health Consultant Dr. Pamela Taylor; both are in the IHS Nashville Area. The consolidated report was disseminated to the tribes July 28. Initial requests to review and commit on transcripts was made May 3 rd with a request to have them returned to the ORD by May 11. REGIONAL VISITS TO TRIBES Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, November 2011 The November 2011 visit to Miccosukee was an opportunity to meet with contract specialist Mr. Albert of the Miccosukee Health Department and representatives of both the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and the Poarch Creek Band of Indians.

ACF has placed strong emphasis on interoperability and has worked to ensure that tribes are a part of the process and kept informed of our efforts. This topic was highligh ted in our Fiscal Year (FY) 2010 and FY 2011 tribal consultation sessions. We recognized that through necessity, many tribes have already implemented interoperability with their ACF programs and other federally funded programs they have received. 2. OCS' AFI Program provided support to the ANA to conduct outreach in Native communities with the goals of increasing access to and awareness of asset -building strategies in Native communities. With support from OCS, ANA implemented an AFI pre-application training curriculum for tribes and Native groups interested in building financial education and Individual Development Account (IDA) projects in their communities. ANA conducted AFI pre- application trainings in Oklahoma City, OK; Reno, NV; Juneau, AK; and Fairbanks, AK. 3. The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) and the Office of Community Services (OCS) worked together this past year to issue a joint funding agreement for the Native Asset Building Initiative (NABI) grants. Under this partnership, applicants completed one application and received funding from both ANA and OCS via the NABI grant. The ANA money is used for grant administration, outreach, financial literacy, and similar items, while the OCS money will be the matching dollars. Five grants were awarded for a total amount of $727,275. The recipients were: 1. Wai`anae Community Re- Development Corporation, HI; 1. American Indian Community Development Organization, MN; 2. The Peoples Partner For Community Development, MT; 3. Warm Springs Community Action Team, OR; and 4. Crow Creek Housing Authority, SD. 1. The Office of Head Start (OHS) convened four tribal consultation sessions with Tribal Leaders operating a Head Start/Early Head Start Program(s). The purpose of the consultations was to discuss delivery of Head Start services to American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) children and families, \"taking into consideration funding allocations, distribution formulas, and other issues\" that may affect services in the various geographic areas. Sessions were held in conjunction with other Tribal Leader meetings to reduce the burden of additional travel for the participants. 1. OFA participated in two 102- 477 tribal consultations (March 7 in Seattle, WA, and March 9 in Anchorage, AK). At the consultations, HHS and Department of Interior (DOI) leadership provided 477 Program tribes with updates and addressed several issues regarding the 477 Program. DIVISION SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES Administration for Children, Youth and Families Children's Bureau (CB) CB continued its outreach to tribes, particularly with regard to Public Law 110- 351, the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, which authorized tribes to apply to receive direct funding under Title IV -E of the Social Security Act. Beginning October 1, 2009, tribes, tribal organizations, and tribal consortia (hereafter, tribes) became eligible to receive 2011 HHS Divisions 74 direct funding from the Federal Government for Title IV -E programs that provide entitlement funding for foster care, adoption assistance, guardians hip assistance payments, and related administrative expenses for eligible children. Before that date, tribes had access to these funds only through negotiated agreements (commonly referred to as Title IV -E agreements) with States. CB has worked to ensure that tribes understand the Title IV- E program and the issues they will need to explore in considering whether to apply to receive direct funding under the program. No tribe has yet been approved to operate a Title IV -E program. One tribe, Port Gamble S'Klallam, Kingston, Washington, submitted a Title IV -E Plan to directly operate a Title IV-E program. Staff in CB's Region X office in Seattle continue to work with the tribe to achieve an approvable plan. No other tribe has yet submitted a plan. The F ostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 authorized funding for grants of up to $300,000 to be used over a 2- year budget period for tribes to develop an approvable Title IV -E Plan. Thus far, 12 tribes have been awarded grants. The first six grantees, which began their projects in September 2009, requested and were granted no- cost extensions of their grants, which will allow them up to one additional year to complete work under the grant. In-depth Technical Assistance (TA) to each grantee is provided during on -site visits by both Central Office and Regional Office staff. Each grantee has received several visits. Grantees have also attended TA sessions in their respective CB regional offices. Regular on-going phone calls occu r between the visits. Several grantees have weekly calls for TA in developing their infrastructure and to discuss Federal review and comments on draft materials they are developing to meet the Title IV- E plan requirements (e.g., tribal codes, court orders , policies/procedures, agreements, etc.). TA is also provided to tribes by CB's National Resource Centers (NRC). Along with Federal staff providing on- site TA to Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, TA was provided by the National Resource Center for Child Welfare Data and Technology for a pilot project to develop a manual Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS). Several of the grantees have been interested in this manual system. This NRC has also been holding monthly calls for the gr antees to discuss data needs and for grantee peer -to-peer sharing related to data and technology issues. Another regional office facilitated a number of requests for Training and Technical Assistance (T/TA) from the NRCs resulting in a peer -to-peer visit between the Washoe Tribe of California and Nevada, and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs regarding an administrative review process, family group decision making, and recruiting/retaining/training resource caregivers. The Washoe Tribe was excited about their visit and thought it was very productive. In addition, training has also been provided to interested grantees so they can participate as reviewers on individual State Title IV -E reviews. Grantees who participated all expressed how valuable the experience was. In December 2011, all the tribal grantees participated in a meeting in Palm Springs, CA. The grantees helped plan the meeting. Port Gamble S'Klallam, although not a grantee, has submitted a Title IV -E plan and was invited to and part icipated in the meeting. Grantees have been requesting that CB and DOI/Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) develop a working relationship so that the Federal offices better understand the programs each is responsible for, allowing Federal staff to provide more comprehensive TA to the grantees. BIA is very open to developing a closer collaborative effort between our agencies. 2011 HHS Divisions 75 In furthering this effort: 2. CB attended and presented on Title IV -E at BIA's annual social worker meeting in Phoenix in May. 3. A BIA social worker participated in an on- site visit CB had with Shoshone- Bannock Tribes. 4. CB Regional staff p resented on Title IV -E options and provisions in the Fostering Connections legislation at the BIA - New Mexico Children, Youth and Family Division Indian Child Welfare/Child Protection Conference in Isleta, NM, on June 1- 2, 2011. 5. BIA held a Tribal Conference for tribes in Regions V and VII on August 8 - 9, 2011. CB staff from CB's Region V office presented on the Title IV -E program and provided informat ion regarding the Tribal IV -E Plan Developmental Grant. 6. In Region VI, CB has provided outreach to the BIA regional offices in Albuquerque, NM; Anadarko, OK; and Muscogee, OK. As a result, staff shared key contact information on the Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico tribes, and share relevant child welfare information such as training, meetings, and State/tribal relationships. Region VI continues to partner with the BIA on a variety of topics including conferences, information sharing, audits, abuse/neglect referrals, legal opinions, etc. 7. At a meeting with the Yurok Tribe on September 26- 28, 2011, attendees included CB's Regional Office program and fiscal staff and BIA's Regional Office staff. Central Office staff from CB and BIA participated by phone. CB sponsored three national tribal gatherings about the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act legislation. The NRC for tribes had the lead responsibility (in conjunction with the NRC for Organizational Improvement and the NRC for Permanency and Family Connections) for designing, developing, and delivering the three gatherings. The NRC for tribes utilized the extensive expertise and experience of partner agencies to meet this challenge, enlisting substantial tribal involvement (tea ms of three persons from each tribe representing tribal leadership, tribal court, and tribal child welfare) while also including CB's input. The three national Fostering Connections tribal gatherings were very successfully conducted. A total of 335 people (representing 92 tribes) participated in these three tribal gatherings. Tribal participants from tribes throughout the country expressed strengths, challenges, and needs that closely matched the findings of the NRC for tribes' national T/TA needs assess ment. Feedback from these three gatherings has generated more T \\TA requests for the T \\TA Network. As a follow -up to the these tribal gatherings, in 2012 there will be two more such tribal gatherings focused on capacity building for tribes to apply for the Title IV -E demonstration grants. CB conducted tribal- specific public consultations on the Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) process in August 2011 (Seattle, WA, and Oklahoma City, OK) and in September 2011 (Minneapolis, MN). CB Regional Program Managers and/or the Acting Associate Commissioner were present for these sessions. The sessions were held pursuant to a Federal Register notice published on April 5, 2011, which solicited comments from stakeholders and tribes about the CFSR process. Tribal leaders as well as tribal administrators were invited to and attended each of these sessions. The consultation sessions clarified for CB that tribal leaders and administrators as a group have had limited experience with the CFSRs. The consultation sessi ons also surfaced other issues related to how States, CB, and BIA work with tribal leaders and administrators, as well as Federal funding concerns. CB regional offices provided outreach to all federally recognized tribes to provide information and TA on Title IV -E. One venue CB participated in was the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) 2011 HHS Divisions 76 association meetings in Michigan and Oklahoma. CB Central Office and Regional Office staff participated in the BIA Child Abuse Conference in April, presenting on both the Ti tle IV -E and IV-B programs. Intensive TA on Title IV -B and the application process was provided using various outreach efforts including on -site visits, regionally based meetings, calls, and webinars. These efforts have resulted in an increase in the num ber of tribes applying for Title IV -B, including an increase of seven tribes in Regional VI. One of the seven is a new federally recognized tribe, the Delaware Tribe of Indians. At the same time, tribes requested additional TA from the NRCs. The Shinnecock Nation , Southampton, New York (which recently was designated a federally recognized tribe) hosted a meeting with the ACF's Region II CB, Child Support and Child Care staff. The Tribal Council members and the Social Services component learned of ACF programs, services, and application processes related to obtaining services for the Shinnecock community. CB's New York Regional Office (Region II) has been invited as a permanent participant in meetings of the New York Federal -State -Tribal Courts and Indian Nations Justice Forum. The group membership includes Federal, State, tribal, and local judges, attorneys, law enforcement representatives, other court and legal staff, and child welfare staff. The Regional Office was also formally on the agenda for ma king a 10 -minute presentation on the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act with respect to opportunities for tribal groups to access Court Improvement funds. The Regional Office also took the opportunity to highlight our current work with tribal Nations and our \"extended hand\" to expand the partnership with others, which resulted in a first -time invitation from the Tonawanda Seneca Nation of Indians to do a meeting and site visit with them on a date to be determined later. The New York Regional Office staff met with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe at the Akwesasne Territory. The visit consisted of learning of the many child welfare programs implemented by the Saint Regis Mohawk people through the Adult Services Unit; the Differential Response Program (Family Assessment Response Presentation); Preventive Services; Foster Care and Adoptive Services; and the Akwesasne Group Homes. Staff learned of the unique interventions that are utilized to address the needs of their people. The Regional Office also met with the Seneca Nation of Indians and discussed their child welfare programs, relationships with the State and local jurisdictions, and their unique cultural programs. The Regional Office also conducted Joint Planning sessions and discussed updates on Federal programs and policies. CB's Region VI has established a relationship with the United Southern and Eastern Tribes (USET), which serves tribes located in Texas and Louisiana. The USET group asked the Regional Office to present at their annual conference this coming year. CB had a week -long Leadership Academy for Middle Managers training with selection based on recommendations, support, and nominations through the Regional Office. One member from the Seneca Nation of Indians, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, and the Onondaga Nation, and eight tribes in Region X participated in the regionally based week -long training. In Region VIII (Denver), CB staff are collaborating on a project with Utah's Court Improvement Program which has developed a joint State/Tribal committee to improve collaboration between entities. The committee is chaired by the Honorable William Thorne and includes two State Juvenile Court Judges, an Ute Indian Tribal Court Judge, the Utah Department of Human Services ICWA Administrator, the Division of Child and Family Services Director, the Ute Tribal 2011 HHS Divisions 77 Social Services Director, Legal Aide, and Region VIII CB staff. The goal of the committee is to improve service delivery to the Utah Native American population being served through the child welfare system. Initial focus is on service delivery on or near the Ute Indian Tribe. A work plan is being developed that will address the following topics: ICWA, Foster Care and Foster Care Licensing. The State/Tribal committee started meeting in April 2011, and will continue its work into 2012. As part of CB's T/TA network, each of the five Implementation Centers covers two of CB's regions. Implementation Centers are uniquely placed to provide long term TA. Presently, Mountain and Plains Child Welfare Implementation Center is providing long term TA for the following projects: Shawnee Area Native American Child Protection Team (SANACPT) is comprised of six tribes: Absentee Shawnee, Citizen- Potawatomi, Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma, Sac and Fox, Seminole, and Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma. SANACPT is receiving technical assistance and resources to develop a culturally appropriate foster parent training curriculum and implement a training model. Focus is on Native American children rather than on a specific tribe. Learning will be shared using a train- the- trainer model. Project site visits were made in September and October 2011. Three Affiliated Tribes and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa's implementation project (Skun- eyah or Garden Project) is designed to develop and put into practice a culturally responsive, family centered practice model, and create system change at the direct practice level of intervention with families. Tribal Child Welfare staff have new skills and a new approach to providing services, along with an increased level of support from the communities through increased awareness, understanding, and engagement in keeping children safe. The process to define and implement a culturally responsive, family centered practice model for each tribe has been documented for replication in other tribal programs. The Osage Nation implementation project goal is three -fold: develop a business mapping model; develop and articulate a culturally based, family centered practice model; and create a decision support data system to help facilitate the first two. Underlying the goal and ultimate purpose of the project is to create system change on the management and direct practice level to improve the coordination and delivery of child welfare service to Osage Nation families and children. CB Central Office and Region VIII staff participated in the Colorado Court Improvement International Site Visit to the Southern Ute, Ute Mountain Ute and Navajo Nation reservations. A Welcome Dinner was held at Tribal Judge Plewe's home. The visit included a tour of the Tribal Park, a meeting with stakeholders, observation of a tribal/administrative court, and ICWA training from the Navajo Nation. Southern Ute is also a part of the Mountain and Plains Child Welfare Implementation Center project with Colorado, which is doing some one- on-one with the agency as part of the practice model implementation. Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) T hrou gh a 10 percent set aside for Indian tribes, Alaska Native Villages, and tribal organizations, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) Program supports emergency shelter and related assistance for victims of domestic violence and their dependents. In FY 2011, 237 federally recognized tribes, Alaskan Native Villages, and tribal 2011 HHS Divisions 78 organizations received FVPSA grants totaling $12,979,190, ranging from $23,599 to $2,064,871. Technical Assistance (TA) Support Services : The FVPSA Program has increased TA support through monthly TA calls, on -site mo nitoring, webinars, peer mentoring meetings, and email. These efforts were intended to assist grantees in establishing and maintaining their domestic violence programs, to encourage collaboration, and to enhance their awareness and responses to FVPSA's pr ogrammatic and financial obligations. Through the support provided, the FVPSA Program has increased the number of tribes reporting in a more unified, substantive, and timely manner, and increased collaboration among peers. Peer Mentoring: In April 20 11, the FVPSA program sponsored and facilitated its 2nd pilot Tribal Peer Mentoring meeting. It consisted of six individuals from four tribal domestic violence and sexual assault programs in California, New Mexico, and Nevada. The intent of this meeting was to discuss key issues specific to tribal consortiums and to allow individuals the opportunity to utilize expertise from peers with experience addressing similar issues. The topics of discussion included: 1) TA for consortium member tribes; 2) program presentations; 3) precarious trauma; 4) cultural awareness to non- tribal providers; and 5) peer mentoring. The meeting was piloted successfully and the next session is expected to convene in May 2012. Reporting : In FY 2010, FVPSA continued to provide the Standard Form - Performance Progress Report (SF- PPR) reporting requirements training via telephone and webinar. In 2011, FVPSA was able to capture useful information using data compiled from the reports to provide a more comprehensive and data -driven assessment of the FVPSA Tribal programs - as well as the kind of support services provided and the number of individuals served in tribal communities annually. Some highlights from the report showed that local tribal domestic violence programs served 32, 840 victims of domestic violence and their children; FVPSA funds supports approximately 68 domestic violence shelters and 160 non- residential sites; and over one hundred thousand crisis calls were made to local tribal domestic violence programs for crisis counseling, shelter services, or other services. Eighty percent of the 137 FVPSA tribal grantees contributed to this report. National Indigenous Women's Resource Center (NIWRC) : As mandated in the December 2010 reauthorization of FVPSA, in September 2011, FVPSA awarded a National Indian Resource Center addressing domestic violence and safety for Indian women. The resource center o ffers a comprehensive array of TA and training resources to AI/ANs to enhance the capacity of the tribes and organizations to respond to domestic violence. NIWRC's headquarters is located in Montana. Their website is www.niwrc.org . Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs (RHY) Funded RHY Grants in Indian Country : In 2011, RHY grants to tribes totaled approximately $1.1 million across two program areas: Transitional Living Programs and Basic Center Programs. Runaway and Homeless Youth Programs (Region X) /Alaska T/TA Initiative : An Alaska T/TA Initiative is underway to address some of the unique challenges faced by grantees providing services in RHY programs. One major challenge is that Alaska grantees are unable to participate in most lower 48 T/TA workshops and training opportunities, and there are specific unique T/TA grantee needs that can be most effectively addressed in Alaska. The Alaska Initiative began the end of last fiscal year with an onsite T/TA assessment of all four (now five) 2011 HHS Divisions 79 Alaska grantees. The basis of this work will lead to continued Alaska -specific T/TA targeted toward trauma -informed care and other issues of concern to Alaska Native people. RHY meeting with delegation - Lummi Nation : In July 2011, the Division Director of Youth Services met with a delegation of youth and adults representing the Lummi Nation who shared their experiences as part of the Transitional Living Program on the reservation. The following are AI/AN activities that cross FYSB's program areas: Interagency Working Group on Indian Affairs (IWGIA) : is a government -wide group of Federal agency representatives who work with tribal governments. Federal agency members include the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation; the Corporation for National and Community Service; individual agencies of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Internal Revenue Service (IRS); the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the Small Business Administration; and the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution. The main focus of this workgroup is to discuss potential coordination of TA efforts, particularly in the areas of tribal courts and justice, youth victims of crime, family/youth violence issues, youth mentoring, and youth programs in general, as well as potential collaboration efforts. Strengthening outreach and building relationships in the areas of trauma- informed care, protective factors for youth, and better research to improve service to Native communities: FYSB increased outreach and developed partnerships at the Native Research Network Conference (June 2011) and the National Tribal Youth Summit (cross -Federal agency supported event, July 2011). Additional linkages with the Indian Health Service (IHS) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) were developed in Fall 2011. Administration on D evelopmental Disabilities (ADD) The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000, Public Law 106- 402 (DD Act of 2000) authorizes support and assistance to States, public agencies, and private non - profit organizations, including faith- based and community organizations, to assure that individuals with developmental disabilities and their families participate in the design of, and have access to, culturally competent services, supports, and other assistance and opportunities that promote independence, productivity, integration, and inclusion into the community. There are four programs authorized by the DD Act of 2000: State Councils on Developmental Disabilities (Councils) Protection and Advocacy Systems (P&A) University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service (UCEDD); and Projects of National Significance (PNS) In FY 2011, $169 million was available to support these programs. Each of these programs engages in systemic change, capacity building, and advocacy activities both as a collaborative network and as independent entities to improve the lives of individuals with developmental disabilities (DD) and their families and enhance participation in community life in the State, including American Indian reservations and Native American communities. 2011 HHS Divisions 80 Native American Protection & Advocacy Agency : ADD funds one P&A, the Native American Disability Law Center, Inc. (NADLC) which covers the Four Corners region of Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado, and serves individuals of the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Reservation. This P&A received $205,808 in FY 2011. Activities and Achievements : The issues NADLC addresses include civil rights, special education, health care, and rights to public and private services. NADLC staff investigates abuse and neglect in care facilities, and provides rights -based training for people with disabilities, their families, educators, and service providers. It currently focuses on five priorities: 1. Responsible agencies will be more responsive to investigating and protecting indi viduals with disabilities from abuse and neglect. 2. Increase the employment opportunities of individuals with disabilities who are receiving Social Security benefits. 3. Individuals with disabilities will have improved access to appropriate special education services. 4. Increase community awareness of the needs of Native Americans with disabilities in order to decrease discrimination and stigmatization based on disability. 5. Increase financial resources of individuals with disabilities. Thirty -eight clients were served in 2010 - 2011. The majority of the clients identified themselves with intellectual disabilities, followed by autism, and then other disabilities. Education was listed as the most common issue area. Examples of Other DD Network Projects for Tribal Communities Arizona - The Sonoran University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities at the University of Arizona, in conjunction with the Native American Research and Training Center (NARTC) is performing a needs assessment of AI/ANs to explore their familiarity with and utilization of DD Network Program agencies, the availability of services and support for individuals with DD and their families in AI/AN communities, and the needs of DD tribal members and their families. South Dakota University Center on DD (UCEDD) The UCEDD Center for Disabilities/University of South Dakota (CD/USD) administers two developmental clinics on the reservations of Cheyenne River and Pine Ridge. These clinics address health, nutrition, and developmental needs of children from birth through 5 years of age. Pediatric professionals from CD/USD fly by charter plane once a month to work with local pr ofessionals to implement these clinics. Two teams provide a comprehensive evaluation to determine if the child may be eligible for early intervention services. Each team works through an arena -based style and evaluates motor development, communication, cognition, and adaptive behavior. In addition, each child receives a nutrition consult. Quarterly, an audiologist provides hearing examinations to the children that appear to be at -risk for a hearing loss. On a quarterly basis a developmental pediatrician also sees children who have been through the developmental clinic but still have questions regarding health/development that need to be addressed. 2011 HHS Divisions 81 Approximately eight children are seen at each monthly clinic. Prior to the clinics, local staff provides developmental screenings in the local reservation communities. Children that appear at-risk as a result of the screening process are referred into the clinic. After clinic, the local staff, along with the Birth -to-3 Service Coordinator for the area, provides a follow -up visit to the family. At this visit all of the information from the clinic is shared and appropriate releases are signed. If the child qualifies and if the family wants it, the child is then connected to the Individualized Family Services Plan (IFSP) or Individualized Education Plan (IEP) and a service plan is developed. Children qualifying for services are usually receiving services within 2 weeks and always within 30 days. Many products have been developed in conjunction with these clinics. Some of the products have been translated into Lakota depending on the wishes of the local advisory com mittee. Administration for Native Americans (ANA) In July 2011, Commissioner Sparks accompanied the Acting Assistant Secretary George Sheldon on a visit of three Native American communities in New Mexico. At San Ildefonso and Pueblo of Pojoaque, Mr. Sheldon had the opportunity to tour community gardens, providing healthy and nutritious food for the community. At Tesuque Pueblo, Mr. Sheldon had a tour of the wellness center and learned about the activities being conducted with \"Let's Move! in Indian Country,\" an ANA grant supplement. These visits have helped Mr. Sheldon to learn more about ACF's work with Native American communities and the impact that ACF grants, programs, and services can have in our Indian communities. Significant groundwork has been laid in 2011 to establish and enhance partnerships with the Department of Education and the Department of Interior for Native Language Instruction programs to help instill language programs in future grants between the three agencies. These discussions are expected to continue in 2012. In September of 2011, ANA held a Language Symposium for all new and continuing grantees with the intent to build a core of knowledge in what works for native language retention, renewal, and survival. Sixty -three ANA g rantees from 17 States and the U.S. territory of Guam convened to learn tools and techniques from experts in the field and to share their experiences. Another goal was to provide input to Health and Human Services, primarily ANA and other ACF programs, an d other Federal agencies (and for their own State and local communities) on how to make the programs and projects more effective in Native communities. In a roundtable discussion of challenges and opportunities for native language maintenance and revitalization, groups discussed what resources and support would be necessary in the areas of language policy, professional development for instructors, curriculum development for language programs, and encouraging native language use beyond the classroom sett ing. While many of the suggestions are State or local in nature, several of these are changes the Federal Government can make to existing programs, services, and funding to make the most impact on communities seeking to maintain and/or revitalize their languages. ANA will be sharing the information gathered at the symposium with ACF and other Federal agencies that provide funding or assistance to Native American communities in the area of education. In Fiscal Year 2011, ANA participated in a series of 1- day workshops, titled \"Growing Economies in Indian Country,\" with nine other Federal Government agencies to share information on various Federal grants, loans, and programs that support economic development activities for Native Americans. Taking place in seven cities from Maine to Hawaii, the 2011 HHS Divisions 82 workshops used regional experts to gain perspective on the challenges that are unique to that area, as well as drawing out successes or barriers that may be local or national in character. Through attendance at these events, ANA was able to promote their grants and services, as well as highlight successful economic development projects that ANA grantees have undertaken. Additionally, ANA used these meetings as a way to increase outreach for NABI, a new joint funding opportunity with OCS, and increase attendance at their Project Planning and Development training sessions, 2 -day workshops conducted at the same locations as the \"Growing Economies in Indian Country\" meetings either immediately prior or immediately following the interagency meeting. ANA implements three types of trainings - project development, pre- application, and post award. Each type of training is free and designed for a specific audience. Project planning and development training provides potential ANA applicants with the skills to identify and develop project ideas for their community, while pre- application training teaches potential applicants how to fit their project idea into the framework of that year's ANA Funding Opportunity Announcement. Post award training is for current ANA grantees and provides details about the rules and regulations required to implement an ANA funded project. In FY 2011, ANA held 95 trainings across the lower 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii, and the Pacific territories. One thousand twelve participants and 594 tribes or organizations attended these trainings. In addition to the trainings, ANA offers TA to potential applicants and grantees. In FY 2011, ANA provided TA to 35 grantees and 97 applicants. Office of Child Ca re (OCC) The O ffice of Child Care revised the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) Tribal application (Plan Preprint) for the FY 2012- 2013 funding year. The revision marked the first changes to the Plan Preprint since 1997. During the public comment period, OCC consulted with CCDF Tribal grantees and other interested parties via two conference calls to obtain input on the proposed revisions. The final Plan Preprint was approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on May 18, 2011. OCC cond ucted regional and multi -regional training sessions on the revised CCDF Tribal Plan in the months of April and May 2011. Over 246 tribal registrants participated in these training sessions. The content was comprehensive, allowing participants to review each section of the new Plan in depth. Group discussions took place on key topics including market rate surveys, sliding fee scales, and health and safety standards. The trainings were hands -on and grantees used their laptops to walk through the Preprint. Many of the participants were able to begin developing portions of their Plans. The Tribal CCDF New Administrators training was held December 7- 9, 2010, in Dallas, Texas. The training provided 116 tribal representatives an opportunity to gain knowledge and skills related to the administration of their CCDF grants. Training focused on program eligibility, fiscal and program accountability, reporting, payment rates/sliding fee scales, and quality activities. thThe 17 National American Indian & Alaska Native Child Care Conference was held April 6- 7 , 2011, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The theme \"Pathways to Excellence: Planning the Future of Tribal Child Care\" supported the OCC Pathways and Partnerships for Child Care Excellence. Over 322 tribal represent atives attended this event. The workshops were designed to help attendees strengthen program administration, encourage collaboration, enhance program quality, and ensure healthy and safe child care environments. 2011 HHS Divisions 83 OCC convened the first National Public Law 102- 477 Child Care Conference, \"Tribal Interoperability for Higher Quality Child Care: Building Pathways and Partnerships, Strengthening Program Integrity and Accountability within the 477 Tribal Communities,\" to address the unique needs of CCDF programs administered under 102- 477. The conference was held in Washington, D.C., on June 28 -30, 2011. Thirty -three tribes consolidate the CCDF program into their Public Law 102- 477 Plans. The two and one- half day event consisted of plenary sessions, training workshops, and open dialogue that focused on supporting the early childhood workforce through improved professional development opportunities. The meeting also focused on strengthening the integrity of CCDF activities while building a child care subsidy system that is child- focused, family -friendly, and works in partnership with child care providers. OCC collaborated with DOI; the Federal lead agency responsible for the administration of the 477 tribes. DOI staff conducted several training workshops. OCC has taken a systematic approach to address the issue of Program Integrity and Accountability including efforts established by tribal governments that ensure effective internal controls to reduce programmatic or financial risks in the administration of CCDF funds. OCC in consultation with the tribes developed exploratory questions that were incorporated in the Biennial CCDF Tribal Plan Preprint application. The goal of the exploratory questions is to obtain a snapshot of policies and procedures that tribes have adopted and to determine future strategies that will allow tribes to enhance their overall accountability. As a next step to support program integrity, OCC developed a draft Tribal Grantee Internal Controls Self-Assessment instrument that will allow tribal grantees to measure their internal controls. OCC conducted an onsite visit to consult with the Cherokee Nation on the validity for use with tribal programs. The feedback obtained from Cherokee Nation will be used to make additional adjustment and further field -testing will be necessary before the instrument is finalized and shared with all of the CCDF Tribal grantees. OCC sponsored a \"Let's Move Child Care! in Indian Country\" track (in support of the First Lady's \"Let's Move! Child Care\") at the National Indian Child Care Association (NICCA) Bi -Annual Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, on August 24 -26, 2011. The track included sessions on: (1) \"I Am Moving, I Am Learning;\" an obesity prevention strategy developed by the Office of Head Start (OHS) to promote children's healthy development and physical activity through movement, music, and nutrition. OCC has been working with OHS to build a capacity around healthy weight and strategize for larger- scale rollout of \"I Am Moving, I Am Learning\" in States, Territories, and tribal child care programs; (2) \"Physical Activity Kit\" (PAK) - training conducted by representatives from IHS that provides an effective and efficient method to package, implement, evaluate, and disseminate culturally appropriate physical activity for AI/AN communities. Seventy -three tribal representatives from participating CCDF tribes completed the training sessions and received certificates of completion. Participa nts also received informat ion on how to join the \"Let's Move! in Indian Country 25,000 Presidential Activity Lifestyle Award (PALA) Challenge.\" OCC received and approved five new Tribal Plans for the CCDF FY 2012- 2013 biennium. The new tribes include the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and Mohegan Tribe in Region I , the Shinnecock Nation in Region II, and the Nooksack Indian Tribe and Sun'aq Tribe of Kodiak in Region X. OCC funds 259 tribes or tribal consortia that represent 539 tribes who have access to the CCDF program services. 2011 HHS Divisions 84 Office of Community Services (OC S) The Office of Community Services' AFI and the ANA's Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) Program launched the Native Asset Building Initiative (NABI), a joint funding opportunity for tribes and Native organizations to administer comprehensive asset -building projects. Under NABI, grantees implement one comprehensive asset -building project with two funding streams. The majority of the AFI award must be used to match participant savings in an IDA, while the SEDS funding can be used to support program administration, financial education, and other complementary asset -building and/or social and economic development strategies. In September 2011, OCS and ANA awarded five grants to tribes and Native organizations through NABI. OCS' AFI Program provided support to the ACF regional offices to conduct outreach about the AFI Program and to integrate asset -building strategies into existing ACF programs. With OCS support, the regional offices presented to tribes and Native groups at tribal consultations and conferences and met with Tribal Child Welfare Directors and Tribal TANF Directors across the country: 1.

The presentation to the Economic, Finance, and Community Development committee focused on how two OCS programs - NABI and Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) - can support economic and community development in Indian country. OCS's information booth at the conference included materials about all OCS programs as well as information about OCS' partner office, the Administration for Native Americans. During the fall of 2010, the Strengthening Communities Fund (SCF) developed several affinity groups made up of grantees, based on organizational and project characteristics. Convening a group of Tribal Governments and Tribal Organizations' g rantees was a priority, and the invitation extended to this targeted group was well -received. With the help of the SCF National Resource Center, the Tribal Governments and Tribal Organization - SCF Tribal Affinity Network collaborated remotely to identify topics of interests related to capacity building and grant management. During the meeting, the Tribal Governments and Tribal Organizations - SCF 2011 HHS Divisions 85 Tribal Affinity Network had the opportunity to learn about tribal capacity building efforts from a Federal Government's perspective and interact with Lillian Sparks, Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans, as well as Thom Campbell, former SCF Program Manager. One of the meeting objectives was to create a network where grantees could continue to develop connections, share information, and exchange ideas after the SCF grant period had concluded. The SCF Tribal Affinity Network planned to collaborate on a project to gather promising practices, lessons learned, and stories of impact related to capacity building in a tribal community. OCS' Division of Energy Assistance (DEA) held a Webinar on Administrative costs for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) tribal grantees on February 17, 2011. In April 2011, DEA distributed an Information Memorandum (IM) to all LIHEAP tribal grantees announcing the FY 2012 LIHEAP Model Plan. The IM included a section on the Program Integrity Assessment, which is now a permanent, required component of a LIHEAP Plan for all grantees. In an effort to ensure that the Program Integrity Assessment provided reliable, useful information, the IM clarified the meaning and intent of questions in the Program Integrity Assessment, reflecting lessons learned by DEA and input from the LIHEAP Program Integrity Working Group. In addition to the IM, DEA hosted two teleconferences/webinars on the subject of the Program Integrity Assessment for tribes. DEA staff provided guidance and clarification on the Program Integrity Assessment, and grantees had the opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback. The teleconferences were held on June 15 and July 12, 2011. National Energy and Utility Affordability Conference - LIHEAP.

On August 10, 2011, DEA staff held a training teleconference and webinar for LIHEAP tribal grantees to ensure that all new and past LIHEAP coordinators are aware of the LIHEAP statute and regulations. The training was intended to help grantees to administer a successful LIHEAP program. Each grantee was forwarded a training PowerPoint presentation that was used during the presentation. Also during the presentation, time was set aside to answer questions from grantees. Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) O CS E Commissioner Vicki Turetsky held an OCSE -specific tribal consultation session following the ACF Tribal Consultation Session. Commissioner Turetsky meets with tribal child support program directors that have Tribal IV -D programs while she is traveling. In FY 2011, she met with the Chickasaw Nation, the Pueblo of Zuni, and the Oneida Nation. OCSE hosted the International Heads of Agency Meeting in August 2011. One of the topics on the agenda was working with indigenous populations. OCSE led the discussion with a presentation on tribal child support enforcement programs. In addition, the Nez Perce Tribe 2011 HHS Divisions 86 made a presentation to the international delegation describing its child support enforcement program and answered questions about working with indigenous populations. OCSE invited tribal leaders to engage in written consultation on a State regulation that could potentially impact the tribal child support enforcement programs. OCSE Region I Regional Program Manager (RPM) met in Boston with four members of Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe (a federally recognized Massachusetts tribe), including a member of the Tribal Council and two Tribal Social Services Program Directors, to discuss possible tribal participation in several ACF programs, including the Tribal Title IV -D program. The Tribal IV -D program was explained and promoted, and the Tribe was invited to seek further information and TA if they were interested in applying for Tribal Title IV -D program funding.

Sessions were held in conjunction with other Tribal Leader meetings to reduce the burden of additional travel for the participants. These sessions were held in the following locations: 1. October 18, 2010 - Auburn, WA 2. October 20, 2010 - Fairbanks, AK 2011 HHS Divisions 89 3. March 25, 2011 - Rapid City, SD 4. April 29, 2011 - Albuquerque, NM The OHS Director met with Tribal Leaders and/or their designated representative and dialog ued about many issues and concerns. Some of the major issues of concern, which have been raised in prior years as well, included: 1. Program quality and funding a. Increased professional credentialing requirements for teachers without additional resources to meet these requirements; b. Retention of qualified teachers once they get their degrees; c. The need for clearer guidance from OHS on what credentials will be accepted in lieu of an Early Childhood Development Degree; and d. Health specialty services for mental health and oral health care are lacking. 2. Transportation costs are high and impinge upon the rest of the program services' budget because of the rural and remote locations of tribes. Need more buses also. 3. Facilities replacement and renovation. 4. Equipment replacement. 5. Funding level disparities and parity with other Head Start Programs. 6. Improve the quality of AI/AN Regional T/TA services to tribal grantees. 7. Redesignation and how it will be implemented in very rural and remote areas. Understanding the triggers, e.g. , Classroom Assessment Scoring System. 8. Broaden the definition of expansion funding. 9. Support language and culture integrated into program and with family engagement. 10. Improve the quality of communication and coordination between tribal grantees and OHS prog ram and ACF grant staff. 11. Revisit Head Start program policies that are impacting tribal communities, e.g. in conflict with tribal culture and values or because of the very rural and remote geographic locations of Tribal Nations: 12. Eligibility 13. Policy council membership 14. NFS Match requirement 15. Monitoring reviews: a. Don't send out review team leaders who have never been to a tribe b. Timeliness of review reports 16. Fiscal issues: Indirect Cost rate agreements and applicability to Head Start grant and administrative cap limitations further burden programs with limited funding increases. Tribes bear the additional costs. AI/AN OHS Grant Funding In FY 2011, OHS funded 153 grantees including three Early Head Start (EHS) only; 96 Head Start (HS) only; and 54 HS/EHS programs located in 26 States.

To augment the National redesigned T/TA Program, and as part of The Head Start Roadmap to Excellence, an administration- wide effort to close achievement gaps and promote early learning through the first 8 years of life for the nation's most vulnerable children, OHS has awarded the following grants to Tribal Head Start grantees: The Centers of Excellence Program was established in the Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007. Twenty Centers of Excellence were designated for a period of up to 5 years. Applicants had to be nominated by the Regional Program Manager. Among these Centers is the first AI/AN Head Start program, Pueblo Laguna, Department of Education, Laguna, NM. They received this designation for excellence in their utilization of the Touch Points parent -staff interaction/reflection approaches, family support and financial literacy services, and enhancement of culture and home language experiences for children with their families. Early Learning Mentor Coaches is a 17 -month pilot to explore core elements or attributes critical to the successful implementation of mentoring programs. As part of this pilot, the grantees will share their approaches and mentoring strategies with other Tribal Head Start grantees. Among the awardees this year were the following tribal grantees: a. Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians b. Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe c. Cheyenne and Arapaho T ribes d. Rosebud Sioux Tribe The expanded requirement for education credentials for teaching staff has been a primary concern, given the rural and remote nature of tribal communities.

Region VII TANF staff provided TA to NEW non- 102-477 grantees (Kickapoo Tribe of Kansas, Omaha Tribe of Nebraska, and Santee Sioux Nation) in the completion of the requirement to use Standard Form 425 (Federal Financial Report). In January 2011, the Region VII TANF program facilitated the connection of the IRS (Stakeholder Partnerships, Education and Communication) and the Kickapoo Tribe of Kansas, resulting in the set -up and operation of a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) site on the reservation. In all, 15 tribal members and non -tribal members were served, receiving free tax preparation and financial literacy information for and during the 2010 tax season. The Regio n VII TANF program assisted with the facilitation and hosting of a quarterly Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) meeting on February 18, 2011, and presented on various tax credits available as well as asset building information. In collaboration with the Office of Regional Administrator, the Region VII TANF program introduced the ASSET Initiative at a tribal consultation meeting July 19, 2011. Information was presented on AFI and comprehensive asset building strategies. In attendance were tribal leaders, tribal council members, and tribal staff from the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska, 2011 HHS Divisions 94 Kickapoo Tribe of Kansas, Prairie Band Potawatomie Nation, and Sac and Fox Nation of Reserve Kansas. To promote awareness of Asset Building and Financial Literacy, the Region VII TANF program hosted a conference call for tribes operating a NEW Program on August 9, 2011. This call focused on culturally relevant financial education curriculums and resources for tribes. Topics discussed were IDAs, AFI, Children's Savings Accounts, program implementation and TA. Additionally, the tribe was informed of the IRS' VITA sites and Tax Care for the Elderly Program, specifically for the upcoming tax season. Information was shared with the Santee Sioux Nation and Omaha Tribe of Nebraska. Region VII TANF program, in collaboration with the Office of Regional Administrator, hosted a call on Tribal TANF, AFI, IDAs, Children's Savings Accounts, financial education resources, and Voluntary Income Tax Assistance with the Economic Development Director of the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa on September 28, 2011. Regional Office leadership, including TANF, met with Chris Howell, Executive Director of Native American Affairs for the State of Kansas, October 19, 2011, to discuss the opportunities and challenges facing Kansas tribes and how ACF programs can help tribes take advantage of those opportunities and meet any challenges. Region VIII: During the week of August 1 -4, 2011 in Denver, CO, a Bi -Regional State/Tribal T ANF conference was held. On August 3- 4, the conference featured tribal centered presentations with topics that included a Tribal TANF Forum with Mark Greenberg and Earl Johnson presenting; Child Welfare and Kinship Care; Improving State/Tribal Relations (with specific breakouts for each State/Tribal program); Preventing Fraud, Waste and Abuse; and Increasing Tribal TANF Program Accountability. Each fiscal year, quarterly conference calls are held with Tribal TANF grantees. FY 2011 topics included, but were not limited to: Emergency Procedures for Natural Disasters (as several tribal programs had been impacted by flooding), Administrative Costs Caps, Time Limits for TANF on Reservations serving areas that are not considered Indian Country, Effects of A RRA on Tribal Communities (presented by Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services), OFA -100 applications and finalization. The conference calls were held December 2010, February 2011, and June 2011. Regional Office staff also held a conference call with all NEW administrators on the new financial reporting form SF- 425. Provided training on Tribal TANF (TTANF 101) to four of the region's seven Tribal TANF grantees. Regional staff was able to conduct onsite training for two of the four training sessions . The audience for all presentations included tribal leaders/council and staff from Tribal TANF, the NEW program, tribal courts, child welfare and tribal fiscal offices. Two site visits to the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming were conducted to visit the Northern Arapaho Nation and the Eastern Shoshone Tribe. The first visit in November 2010 was with Earl Johnson to discuss FY 2011 budgeting. A follow -up visit was conducted in September 2011 to continue budget discussions as well as determine training and program needs for the newly appointed TANF administrator and the acting Chief Financial Officer. 2011 HHS Divisions 95 A site visit to the Sisseton -Wahpeton Oyate in South Dakota occurred on September 16, 2011. The purpose of this visit was to provide TA to Tribal TANF staff with an increasing caseload and limited funding. OFA staff provided detailed Tribal TANF related T/TA, including guidance on plan renewals, program development, and regulatory compliance to all 7 Tribal TANF and 17 NEW grantees in Region VIII, via regular telephone and e- mail contact, general outreach, and when specific requests were made. The Ely Shoshone Tribe is proposing a new Tribal TANF program and Region VIII and Region IX TANF staff are working to gather necessary data to ensure the Tribe has an approvable plan. The proposed plan would have a service area that includes States within both Regions IX and VIII. Region IX staff are taking the lead. The Region worked with staff from the ED on a proposed initiative involving Tribal TANF families living on the Wind River Reservation. Region VIII staff held discussions with the Tribal TANF program directors and ED staff about acceptable ways to gather the needed information. Region VIII staff provided resources and information to Tribal TANF and N EW grantees regarding the ASSET initiative and VITA sites, as this was a major priority for ACF this fiscal year. Region VIII staff assisted the Chippewa Cree Tribe with a Peer -to-Peer TA request to help them implement wraparound services. The Chippewa Cree Tribe is now implementing wraparound services by partnering with their tribal court, chemical dependency treatment, mental health, and social services to serve their TANF clients more effectively. Region IX Region IX provided extensive Tribal TANF r elated T /TA, including guidance on plan renewals, program development, and regulatory compliance to all 23 Tribal TANF grantees in Region IX, via regular telephone and e- mail contacts, general outreach, etc. Additional T/TA was also provided during individual meetings at the Regional Office with: Torres Martinez Tribe, Hoopa Valley Tribe, Washoe Tribe, Owens Valley Career Development Center, Soboba Tribe, and the Scotts Valley Tribe. Region IX provided extensive guidance and TA to the Pechanga Tribe in the process of their withdrawal from an existing Tribal TANF program and the development and approval of their Tribal TANF program. The Region also provided guidance and TA in the development and approval of the San Carlos Apache Tribe's TANF program plan and worked closely with the Soboba Tribe, Scotts Valley Tribe, Salt River Pima Tribe, and the Washoe Tribe in the development, review, and approval process of their Tribal TANF renewal plans. Provided guidance to the Pascua Yaqui and the Hoopa Tribe to assist them in the completion of their final OFA-100 reports for TANF Emergency Contingency Funds received under ARRA. Worked closely with the Ely Shoshone Tribe through the complex process of establishing a new Tribal TANF program involving multiple partner tribes, covering multiple shared service areas in multiple States; acted as the lead, primary contact, and technical advisor for both the State(s) and the Tribe in understanding the process requirements, roles, and guidelines. 2011 HHS Divisions 96 Conducted on -site TA an d monitoring oversight at the White Mountain Apache Tribe, Scotts Valley Tribe, and the Washoe Tribe. Developed and hosted three comprehensive TA workshops for Region IX Tribal TANF program grantees, in both Arizona and California, with training which focused on subsidized employment development, program capacity building, improvement in fiscal and program management, and other critical program issues that had been identified through tribal input and ongoing communication/site visits with tribal grantees. Two of the workshops were held in San Francisco for California and Nevada tribes; a third workshop was held in Arizona for Arizona tribes and the State. Region X The Region X Fiscal and Data Meeting held on April 26- 27, 2011, in Seattle, WA, for Washingt on, Oregon, and Idaho tribes provided further guidance on data management, processing, reporting, and fiscal procedures. The Region X Alaska Tribal Case Managers Training was held in Anchorage, AK, on May 3- 5, 2011, to address Alaska Tribal TANF organizat ions' request for case management training. The training addressed case management activities, such as engaging TANF participants, motivational interviewing, and building self -sufficiency plans for participants. In addition, the meeting incorporated strategies for detecting fraud, working with Child Support Enforcement agencies, providing supportive services, and improving fiscal and data management practices. The 2011 Annual Region X Tribal TANF Conference was held in Tulalip, WA, at the Tulalip Resort from September 27- 29, 2011. The Conference provided Tribal TANF programs from Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington an opportunity to discuss and strategize methods for improving their programs and services to better serve their families and communities. Best practices and lessons learned were shared throughout the conference on a wide range of topics, including asset building, child care, child welfare, economic development, program evaluation as a method for program enhancement, and subsidized employment. The Tribal Coalition, an ACF- wide team of the tribal related programs, meets monthly to discuss issues and related activities. The team provides oversight and opportunities where the different teams can collaborate. TANF staff provided TA to grantees to prepare and submit Tribal TANF and NEW plan renewal materials by required deadlines. Five Tribal TANF plans were renewed during 2011. Region X is taking an active role in helping tribes be up to date on reporting. Two fiscal/data meetings were held this year: one in Seattle for Washington, Oregon, and Idaho Tribes, and one in Anchorage at Cook Inlet Tribal Council for the Alaska Native Organizations. AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ACTIVITIES SPECIFIC TO TRIBES Administration for Children, Youth and Famili es Children's Bureau (CB) Section 10909 of the Affordable Care Act extends and expands the adoption tax credit that eligible families may claim for qualifying expenditures relating to the adoption of an eligible child. 2011 HHS Divisions 97 Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) Tribal Personal Responsibility Education Program (Tribal PREP authorized by the Affordable Care Act) Conducted Tribal PREP consultation sessions. In October 2011, FYSB completed in -person consultation sessions and opportunity for written comments on Tribal PREP. Consultation directly informed the development of the funding opportunity announcement released in June 2011. Funded Tribal PREP grants . In September 2011, FYSB awarded 16 grants to tribes and tribal organizations under the Tribal PREP discretionary grant program. During the Planning Year (Phase I) of the project, grantees will conduct needs assessments, develop data collection protocols and performance measures, create frameworks for evaluation, and select/adapt evidence- based programs that have potential for success in AI/AN communities. Strengthened partnerships within HHS around teen pregnancy prevention in Native American communities . Significant groundwork has been laid in 2011 to establish and enhance partnerships with other agencies within HHS around the issue of teen pregnancy prevention among Native youth; of particular importance are relationships with IHS and Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Office of Child Care (OCC) The Affordable Care Act of 2010, Public Law 111- 148 provides funding to States, tribes, and Territories to develop and implement one or more evidence- based Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Visitation model(s). Model options would be targeted at reducing infant and maternal mortality and its related causes by producing improvements in prenatal, maternal, and newborn health, child health and development, parenting skills, school readiness, juvenile delinquency, and family economic self -sufficiency. Five non- competitive grants were awarded for Tribal Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (TMIECHV) programs in FY 2011. Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) The OCSE program has statutory responsibility to secure health care coverage for the children in its caseload called medical child support. The program is reassessing its medical support role in light of the Affordable Care Act and moving towards a focus on expanding children's health care coverage rather than cost recovery. In winter 2011, OCSE held a series of tribal conver sations to discuss the implications of the Affordable Care Act for tribal medical support enforcement about improving coordination with Medicaid and outreach to families regarding new health care options. Each conversation was co- hosted with a tribal child support program. In July 2011, OCSE participated in medical child support group discussion at the National Child Support Associations Annual Conference in Denver. The conversations and discussions supplement, but do not replace, consultation. This model for communication was very well received and will be carried forward for additional discussions with tribal child support directors. TRIBAL DELEGATION MEETINGS Tribal Early Learning Consortium, Washington, D.C. ACF's Deputy Assistant Secretary and Inter- Departmental Liaison for Early Childhood Development met with tribal grantee participants in a wrap- up session to gain feedback on issues of concern in implementing their early childhood programs in tribal communities. 2011 HHS Divisions 98 Bristol Bay Association of Alaska Bristol Bay Native Association is a non- profit tribal consortium organized to provide educational, social, economic, and related services to the Native people and communities of Alaska's Bristol Bay region. The Tribal Council met with the OHS Leadership to discuss challenges in operating a Head Start Program in several remote villages and the need for buses to address health and safety issues. Hualapai Tribal Delegation Meeting, Washi ngton, D.C. The Chai rman of the Hualapai Tribe met with the Director to discuss program issues including the recent termination of the Tribe's Head Start Director. Havasupai Tribal Head Start, Supai, AZ The OHS Director made a site visit to this Tribal Head Start program, which is located at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and only accessible by helicopter or mule. A meeting was held with Tribal Leadership and discussions were centered on the challenges of operating a Head Start program in such an isolated location. Laguna Head Start, Laguna, NM The OHS Director made a site visit to the Laguna Head Start and Early Head Start and met with the Head Start Director. Omaha of Nebraska Tribal Delegation M eeting , Washington, D.C . The OH S Director met with the leadership of the Omaha Tribe of Nebraska at their request for a \"face -to-face\" meeting. ACF Tribal Consultation Session, Washington, D.C. OHS Director and staff attended the first ACF- wide Tribal Consultation Session held in 5 years. The first ACF Tribal Consultation Policy was signed. Navajo Nation Head Start Tribal Del egation M eeting, Washington, D.C. Navajo Tr ibal leadership met with the OHS Director to discuss issues related to the potential closure of their Head Start Program which would impact 2,000 Navajo children. AGENCY TRIBAL CONSULTATION POLICY The ACF Trib al Consultation Policy was signed on August 18, 2011, in front of 42 North American tribes who attended the ACF Tribal Consultation session held in Washington, D.C. This policy sets official protocol on how the agency engages tribes in consultation on leg islation, regulations, and policies that affect the services delivered to federally recognized tribes. Representatives from tribes met with ACF staff over the summer of 2010 to discuss how ACF consults with Indian tribes. Prior to this meeting, ACF relied on policy guidelines provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This effort to establish a more formal policy was in direct response to Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments and the President's memorandum on Tribal Consultation issued by President Barack Obama in November 2009. After months of discussion, including consultation and internal review, a policy specific to ACF programs was listed in the Federal Register for a 45-day comment period in December 2010. This policy provides a clear channel of communication that lays out who responds on behalf of the agency, a timeline for responses, and where the communication takes place with tribal leaders. A copy of the policy can be found at the following website: http://www.acf.hhs.gov/tribal/index.html 2011 HHS Divisions 99 U nited States Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) As 1 of 12 agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) supports health services research initiatives that seek to improve the quality of health care in America. AHRQ's mission is to improve the quality, safety , efficiency, effectiveness, and cost -effectiveness of health care for all Americans. The Agency works to fulfill this mission by conducting and supporting health services research, both within AHRQ as well as in leading academic institutions, hospitals, physicians' offices, health care systems, and many other settings across the country. The Agency has a broad research portfolio that touches on nearly every aspect of health care. Contact Information Carolyn M.

Also, AHRQ is working closely with the Indian Health Service (IHS) on two comparative effectiveness research projects supported with the Office of the Secretary's (OS') ARRA funds. These efforts are being led out of one of AHRQ's research centers and is headed by an IHS staff person on detail to AHRQ. DIVISION SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES AHRQ supports a research infrastructure development project run by the Montana- Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council which includes several studies addressing in- depth topics. In addition to supporting the development of a sustainable resea rch infrastructure for the Montana/Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council, Black Hill State University, and the Black Hills Center for American Indian Health, this project funded a study aimed at designing, implementing, and evaluating the effectiveness of a structured process in which tribal members and IHS providers jointly developed strategies to improve performance based on priority issues identified through a consumer survey (developed by AHRQ). Investigators developed a targeted research agenda that addressed tribally identified priority issues, such as hepatitis C, West Nile virus, and methamphetamine use. In addition, three other research studies were planned: evaluation of interventions to promote healthy weight among women, examination of factors that contribute to breast and cervical cancer outcomes, and design and implementation of a \"healthy reservations\" model program for system wide health improvement on reservations. AHR Q supports a research project to assess AIs'/ANs' perceptions of their care. The Qual ity Improvement (QI) Project undertaken by Yale University is being conducted with the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes of the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming and with the Fort Peck Indian Reservation (Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes) in Montana. During Fiscal Year 2011, they conducted and analyzed the tailored American Indian CAHPS survey at each reservation, and presented the findings to the Tribal -Indian Health Service (IHS) Working Group at each site. The Wind River Tribal -IHS Workin g Group identified Customer Service as the specific QI area that they would pursue; they developed a work plan for implementing a QI project with staff. This work plan has included bringing in speakers on customer service, regular meetings to discuss cust omer service improvement strategies with staff members, and holding a monthly competition between the two clinic sites on the reservation to achieve positive and measureable improvement in customer service, using a short satisfaction survey. Results for the first three months have been positive with both clinics producing higher scores on the short survey each month through August. The Fort Peck reservation site has determined that it is over-committed to other activities and chose not to implement a new QI strategy, but is continuing to participate as a control site in the project and will cooperate in the final year follow - up CAHPS survey (FY12). They have conducted site visits and follow -up telephone interviews with key staff at each Reservation to document their ongoing quality improvement activities (general and specific to this project), organizational changes, and other factors that may be expected to affect patient satisfaction and ratings of health care. During the final year of the project (FY12), monitoring and documentation of the QI interventions will continue, another round of site visits will be conducted, and the follow -up CAHPS surveys will be conducted at 2011 HHS Divisions 101 each site. Results of the project will be presented to each Tribal -IHS Working Group during the final month of the study. Medical home model for Alaska Natives to be assessed for impact on patient care deliv ery The Sout hcentral Foundation (SCF), a tribally -owned organization, implemented a patient - centered medical home (PCMH) in 1999 and 2000 in Anchorage, Alaska. The SCF PCMH has three key characteristics: patient selected family match to a primary care team, patient -driven care, and advanced access. In this project, the University of Alaska and the SCF are partnering to determine the impact of the PCMH transformation on the characteristics and quality of patient care delivery, and to assess changes in healthcare delivery, such as quality and safety efforts, efforts to bring evidence to the point of care, use of information systems, and costs. This PCMH model could have national implications for improving the health of the AI/AN population and may also be relevant to other practices serving diverse populations with multiple health disparities. The project is in its final stages. Impro ving the Delivery of Self Management Support Services to American Indian/Alaska Nat ive (AI/AN) People The purpos e of this Intra -Agency Agreement was to transfer funds from AHRQ to IHS for the purpose of supporting the improvement of the delivery of prevention and care management services through the IHS Improving Patient Care Program (IPC). This project was designed to help understand, develop and test Electronic Health Record (EHR) elements that improve the delivery, documentation, and tracking of self -management support services. Improving Patient Care Learning Networks In this effort, AHRQ provided (directly or through funding) subject matter experts for 16 presentations to the IHS learning network teams. The project builds on a previous IAA that provided clinical staff training and skill -building in self -management support for 38 clinical sites and teams participating in the IPC learning collaborative. Self -management support is a key component of patient -centered health care and the Chronic Care Model. AHRQ continued to support the annual American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) Health Research C onference providing funding to support a Tribal College and University pre- meeting as part of the conference. AMERICAN RECOVERY ACT SPECIFIC TO TRIBES Project to improve race and health status data for Pacific Northwest States The Improving Data and Enhancing Access -Northwest Project seeks to more accurately characterize health status and clinical outcomes data for Northwest tribal people, while working to minimize and eventually eliminate racial misclassification errors in State surveillance data systems. To identify and correct racial misclassification, the project will conduct record linkages with an array of health -related data systems in a three- State re gion. Ultimately, it will disseminate results and develop concrete methods by which other States and Tribal Epidemiology Centers may implement similar programs. AHRQ is providing support for this project through funding received from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Project to improve the quality of race and ethnicity data in hosp ital discharge and emergency Department databases in New Mexico New M exico's Improving the Quality of Race and Ethnicity Data Project will contribute to reduci ng racial and ethnic health and health care disparities by improving the reliability of race, 2011 HHS Divisions 102 ethnicity, and tribal affiliation hospital data in the State. Guided by a State advisory committee, between 5 and 10 pilot hospitals will field test training materials that will be developed for the project. These will include hospital procedure, data collection, patient education, and train- the- trainer materials. Hospital discharge records will be linked with birth certificate records and IHS records to track improvements. New Mexico expects to establish a model for the collection, reporting, and appropriate dissemination of tribal identifier data which will be informally disseminated to other States and through a published manuscript. AHRQ is providing support for this project through funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. AHRQ is continuing its efforts to work with IHS on several fronts including two large A RRA programs funded with OS ARRA funds: Electronic clinical data to assist in assessing comparative effectiveness of quality improvement efforts Ov er the past decade, the IHS has developed a national information technology infrastructure that allows for the routine, reproducible measurement of ambulatory quality of care across a spectrum of conditions for AI/AN communities. This infrastructure represents a model for evaluating the use of a nationally integrated health information system to conduct comparative effectiveness research (CER) and ultimately identify the most capable quality improvement activities. This project will use electronic clinical data from the IHS national health information systems to create a longitudinal database linking quality of care measures for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer screening over a 9-year period. A second objective will be to conduct two comparative analyses to determine the effectiveness of delivery system interventions, such as the use of an advanced electronic health record and a chronic care model (Improving Patient Care) to assess health care quality and outcomes for diabetes, cardiovascular care, and cancer screening. This project is currently in month 14 of 24 (as of October 2011). The development of a longitudinal data infrastructure (LDI) is in process. One of the CER projects plans to test the LDI by looking at the association between EHR utilization and quality of care (QOC) by physicians by assessing effectiveness of organizational interventions on quality of care using breast cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease measures. The second project plans to define the best method of linking patients to individual primary care providers within the IHS. The IHS has received a review of IHS data systems, a beta version of the CER dataset, and two social determinants of health review papers (adverse childhood outcomes & distance to care). The contractor is working on a final CER study plan and future work involves a Tribal dissemination plan, interim report, final study report, 2 external manuscripts and a final report. AHRQ is providing staff support to IHS in this project. Funding was received from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Office of the Secretary funding). P roject studies comparative effectiveness of disease management by IHS advanced pract ice pharmacists The purpose of this project is to support the development of data infrastructure and enhance data collection methodology with the IHS. The Contractor will link service data, pharmacy cost data, and health status measures and assess utilization and spending for a population subset in12 IHS regions. The Contractor will then conduct a targeted CER project focusing on health delivery system strategies, such as advanced pharmacy practice, to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among AI/AN adults. 2011 HHS Divisions 103 Update (October 2011): This project is currently in month 13 of 24. The development of a dataset to test the use of CER studies is ongoing. The subcontractor has been working with the IHS and tribal organizations to obtain institutional review board (IRB) approvals and data use agreements. The first of three site visits to the 14 selected sites are being conducted. The CER study will use observational research methods to provide critical information on health status, utilization, and treatment costs. The project findings will assist IHS in prioritizing and evaluating chronic disease management strategies. In addition, this project will offer CER methods training modules/webinars to identify lessons learned concerning dataset limitations and method s for controlling bias for future CER studies. AHRQ is providing staff support to IHS in this project; funding is from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Office of the Secretary funding). AGENCY TRIBAL TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP AHRQ is ac tively involved in the work of the AI/AN Health Research Advisory Council which provides input to the Department on health research matters. Given its small size and limited budget, AHRQ does not have a technical advisory group of its own. AHRQ participated in all meetings of this group in FY11. AHRQ is also actively involved in the Department -wide Intradepartmental Council on Native American Affairs (ICNAA) and participated in all of its meetings during FY11. AGENCY TRIBAL CONSULTATION POLICY AHRQ updated its Tribal Consultation Policy during FY11. AHRQ mailed a copy of the draft Tribal Consultation Policy to all tribal leaders requesting feedback and comments in the spring of 2011. It further disseminated the draft policy statement through HRAC membe rs and their networks. AHRQ made changes to the draft policy based on the tribal comments received. AHRQ is in the process of disseminating the finalized Tribal Consultation Policy to all tribes. It will soon be uploaded onto the AHRQ website. 2011 HHS Divisions 104 United States Department of Health and Human Services Administration on Aging (AoA) The Administration on Aging (AoA), an agency in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is one of the nation's largest providers of home- and community -based care for older persons and their caregivers. Our mission is to develop a comprehensive, coordinated and cost - effective system of long- term care that helps elderly individuals to maintain their dignity in their homes and communities. Our mission statement also is to help society prepare for an aging population. Created in 1965 with the passage of the Older Americans Act (OAA), AoA is part of a Federal, State, Tribal and local partnership called the National Network on Aging. This network, serving about 7 million older persons and their caregivers, consists of 56 State Units on Aging; 655 Area Agencies on Aging; 244 Tribal organizations; two organizations that serve Native Hawaiians; 29,000 service providers; and thousands of volunteers. These organizations provide assistance and services to older individuals and their families in urban, suburban, and rural areas throughout the United States. While all older Americans may receive services, the OAA targets those older individuals who are in greatest economic and social need: the poor, the isolated, and those elders disadvantaged by social or health disparities. The Office for American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian Aging was established in the Older Americans Act under Title II, Section 201. The Director of the Office has several responsibilities to include serving as the effective and visible advocate in behalf of older individuals who are Native Americans within the Department of Health and Human Services and with other departments and agencies of the Federal Government regarding all Federal policies affecting such individuals and administering and evaluating the grants provided under this Act to Indian tribes, public agencies and nonprofit private organizations serving Native Hawaiians.

Native American Caregiver Support Grants to 218 Indian Tribal Organizations AoA awarded $6,319,367 to Indian Tribal Organizations to help them support unpaid family members in caring for their elders and grandparents raising their grandchildren by providing training on caregiving, caregiver support groups, and respite. Nutrition Service Incentive Grants to 252 Indian Tribal Organizations AoA awarded $3,153,093 to Indian Tribal Organizations to support their congregate and home delivered meals programs . TRIBAL SUMMITS The National Title VI Training and Technical Assistance Forum was held in Washington, DC from August 23 to 25, 2011. Approximately 200 Tribal Council members, Tribal Senior Program Directors and Tribal staff attended the Forum. Assistant Secretary for Aging, Kathy Greenlee, convened a Tribal Listening Session in conjunction with the National Forum. The following is a summary of the testimony given by Forum participants during the Listening Session. Increased Funding The testimonials point to a need for increased funding in Title VI, Part A/B and C and NSIP grants. Participants repeatedly informed the audience that their elder population was growing and that elders are living longer, while Title VI funds were not keeping pace. The need for funding to increase program staff to meet the growing elder population was also expressed. Participants repeatedly voiced the need for elder abuse funding for awareness, education, prevention, and program development in Indian country. Participants cited a need for vehicles and transportation program operating costs. Several participants discussed the success and need for funding health promotion and wellness programs, including evidence- based programs. Several participants pointed out the need to increase funding levels for programs that coordinate with, or provide services to, tribal elders, such as the USD A Farmer's Market Nutrition Program and the Foster Grandparent Program. Testimonials support the need for increased health funding and the need to provide training to in- home care workers. Tit le VI and Title III Multiple participants cited their appreciation of the Title VI program's flexibility and indicated their Title VI funds serve as a \"base\" for leveraging Title III funds. Participants indicated there was a need for increased coordination with the States. Participants were concerned about the lack of comparability of allowable services between the caregivers programs under Title III -E and Title VI -C. 2011 HHS Divisions 106 El der Abuse 1. Forum participants testified that the current laws and support for prevention of elder abuse and neglect are inadequate. As one participant stated, \"We have those kinds of needs on our reservation and they are not very different from other reservations.\" 2. Numerous participants expressed the need for adequate funding to establish and develop elder abuse and neglect programs. Transportation There was frequent reference to a severe lack of transportation services and transportation funding on reservations. One participant expressed frustration at the current state system; calling is a \"headache\" for elders. Participants suggested increased collaboration with local, state, and national organizations as a way to bring better transportation services to the elders. One testimony described a need for vehicles to assist elders in getting to and from meal sites. Many participants testified to the urgent need for viable transportation services for seniors living in rural and frontier communities. One participant from Alaska said, \"The cost of home delivered meals in southeast Alaska is three times higher than in the lover 48.\" Acce ss 1) One participant testified that many Native communities qualify as \"food deserts\", places without access to fresh fruits and vegetables. Studies have shown an increase in chronic disease and diet. 2) Several testimonies were heard concerning the high cost of providing services to seniors living in rural and frontier areas that directly limits access to those services. Long- term Care Services and Livable Communities 1. Testimony points to a need for tribal specific long-term care services and to the need for Tribes to train States on culturally appropriate long -term care service delivery. 2. Testimony included the need to involve tribal elders in planning long- term care services. One participant said to always \"listen to the quiet\" voice for direction and need. 3. Testimony indic ates a need for trained tribal in- home workers working with elders. 4. Several participants testified asking for support for the severe health care needs of tribal elders. One participant said, \"They don't have money to buy teeth so they can enjoy a meal tha t someone cooks for them or they cook for themselves. They don't read the newspaper or watch the news anymore because they cannot see the screen or read the print. So, they suffer in silence because we don't have that kind of funding.\" Heal th Promotion and Disease Prevention 1. Many participants testified that funding for health promotion/disease prevention programs should be increased and available directly to the Tribes. 2. Testimony demonstrated a need for training in how to implement evidence- based health promotion programs. 3. Several participants stated that a successful ADRC in Indian Country would require tribal input during the planning and development process . 2011 HHS Divisions 107 United States Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Pr evention (CDC) The mission of CDC is to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability.

Due to these anthropogenic activities, there remains a level of potential uranium exposure to the Navajo people from various sources including abandoned uranium mills/mines, contaminated drinking water, soil, and homes built with mi ning waste. While there have been many studies of occupational exposure to uranium and renal effects, there have been very limited studies on other adverse health effects. There is also limited toxicological and epidemiological data that indicates that uranium may pose a risk to the developing fetus. The purpose of this study is to quantify fetal risk from uranium by recruiting Navajo mothers, assessing their uranium exposure at key developmental milestones, and then following the children post -birth to ev aluate any associations with birth defects in developmental delays. The study also has applied public health goals to provide educational outreach to increase prenatal care utilization, earlier assessment and referral for developmental delays, and mitigati on of uranium exposure among Navajo mothers. In 2011, the study protocol was developed and received clearance from the Institutional Review Boards from all involved institutions. We have initiated clearance with the Office of Management and Budget and anticipate beginning study participant recruitment in 2012. Funding -$2 million.

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever: In 2011, CDC provided design input and printing of 5,000 coloring book calendars that were distributed to children of the San Carlos and White Mountain Apache tribes, with a goal of educating children about RMSF. Following the distribution of these calendars, CDC assisted the tribes with an evaluation of the efficacy of the coloring book calendar campaign, by conducting a door to door survey in August 2011. CDC assisted tribes with the first -ever census of dogs on the reservations. The census identified that 70% of dogs on the reservation were free- roaming, which contributes greatly to the problem of tick distribution. CDC developed a pilot program for a remote dog treatment baiting system, using food as an attractant and treating dogs for ticks. CDC provided eight staff members who assisted with summer prevention efforts for both tribes, working in the field in Arizona for two weeks at the end of June, 2011. CDC worked with both tribes to conduct a systematic chart review of severe and fatal RMSF cases to identify risk factors for poor outcome; chart reviews 2011 HHS Divisions 110 were conducted throughout the year, with CDC IRB exemption and tribal approval from both the San Carlos and White Mountain Apache tribes. On Gila River Indian Community, CDC provided 4 staff members during April 2011; staff conducted a canine serosurvey to assess possible spread of RMSF from an affected housing district, and to assess efficacy of prior year's prevention efforts on the reservation.

Prevention and Control of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) on tribal lands in Ar izona Sinc e 2003, Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) has emerged as a significant public health threat in American Indian communities in Arizona, on the White Mountain Apache, San Carlos Apache, and Gila River Indian Community reservations. Human infection is associated with transmission from Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the brown dog tick, and is supported by large numbers of free- roaming community dogs that provide a food source for the ticks. Through 2011, over 200 human cases of RMSF with > 14 human deaths have been reported. The region's reported incidence (527 cases per million persons) is 70X the national incidence of RMSF. Over 50% of deaths occur in children. The problem appears to be worsening: in 2011, there were 5 reported fatalities from the White River and San Carlos Apache tribes, compared to an average fatality of 1 -2 cases per year. CDC, working together with the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Indian Health Service, are assisting tribes with developing and implementing prevention efforts to control the RMSF problem. CDC offers consultation, cl inical evaluations of patients, educational materials, and guidance for environmental control. In addition, CDC provides field staff each year to support San Carlos and White Mountain's summer prevention campaigns, consisting of treating tick -infested homes with pesticide and placing tick collars on dogs.

Contact Information Mary Wakefield, R.N., Ph.D. : Administrator Health Resources and Services Administration 5600 Fishers Lane Rockville, MD 20857 Phone Number: (301) 443-2 216 Intradepartmental Council on Native American Aff airs Liaison Marcia Brand, PhD Deputy Administrator Health Resources and Services Administration Phone Number: (301) 443-2 216 Fax Number: Website: http://www.hrsa.gov/index.html Tribal Consultation Policy: Yes 2011 HHS Divisions 145 HIGHLIGHTS OF DIVISION SPECIFIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS/ACTIVITIES TARGETED TOWARD AMERICAN INDIANS/ALASKA NATIVES (AI/AN) The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) shares many priorities with American Indian and Alaskan Native populations, including, but not limited to, reducing the burden of disease; increasing health professional workforce development; increasing health information technology investments in Tribal and Urban health facilities; and improving access to funding and grant opportunities. HRSA does this work through a variety of activities and has made significant progress in Federal Fiscal Year 2011. In order to more fully engage with and support our Tribal partners, HRSA has made efforts to improve our communication with American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN) populations through various means. HRSA meets quarterly with the Indian Health Service (IHS); convenes an internal workgroup on a quarterly basis; and meets with National organizations and Tribal/Urban leaders. Our tribal website provides information on funding opportunities, regional contacts, and technical assistance. And, in an effort to increase our accessibility and respond to any questions and concerns that our Tribal partners may have, we have created an email box aianhealth@hrsa.gov to manage all inquires. HRSA leadership actively participates in the Secretary's Tribal Advisory Committee (STAC) as well as the Interdepartmental Council on Native American Affairs (ICNAA), and the various sub - groups in order to strengthen our relationships with the American Indian/Alaskan Native communities. HRSA Administrator Dr. Wakefield and IHS Director Dr. Roubideaux have written two Dear Tribal Leader Letters (December 2010 and October 2011) and a Dear Title V Urban Indian Program Director letter (April 2010). The Dear Tribal Leader and Dear Title V Urban Indian Program Director letters address concerns raised by our tribal partners including increasing AI/AN representation on HRSA's advisory committees; providing better support for the recruitment and retention of health care providers; increasing access to primary care; and highlighting implementation efforts around the Affordable Care Act and the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. DIVISION SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES With support from the Indian Health Service and Secretary Sebelius, HRSA and IHS have designated all IHS/tribal facilities as National Health Service Corps approved sites. This allows IHS/tribal facilities to recruit and retain primary care providers by utilizing the scholarship and loan repayment incentives offered through the National Health Service Corps program. A welcome letter was sent by Drs. Wakefield and Roubideaux to all site Directors on May 6, 2011 outlining the benefits of becoming a National Health Service Corps approved site. Following the letter, IHS participated at the National Health Service Corps Scholar Orientation and Placement Conference as a speaker and exhibitor, where IHS representatives spoke to National Health Service Corps scholars about the opportunities available at IHS sites throughout the country. The National Health Service Corps and IHS have also developed and distributed joint informational materials. As a second step in the initiative, HRSA and IHS are partnering to designate a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) score for over 300 newly approved IHS/tribal facilities. HRSA's health center program grantees served over 217,000 American Indians and Alaskan Natives according to the 2010 Uniformed Data System. Currently 25 organizations receive both Health Center Program and Indian Health Service (IHS) funding (18 Tribal organizations and 7 2011 HHS Divisions 146 Urban Indian Program organizations). These 25 organizations served approximately 121,000 patients in 2010 and HRSA awarded approximately $48 million to these dually -funded health centers in Fiscal Year 2011 including $13 million in Capital Development funding to two tribal health centers, $100,000 to one tribal health center to improve quality of care and electronic reporting capabilities in Beacon Communities, $455,000 to 13 centers to achieve recognition as a patient -centered medical home, and $560,000 to seven tribal organizations throug h the Health Center Planning Grant Program to assist in the development of a future health centers. In coordination with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS), eligibility for Medicaid Meaningful Use incentives has been modified to allow all tribal clinics to be treated as Federally Qualified Health Centers for purposes of qualifying for these incentives. This modification allows tribal clinics to meet the needy individual patient volume threshold, rather than the more stringent Medicaid patient volume threshold, making it easier for tribal clinics to qualify for these incentives. The Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2010 reauthorized the National Cord Blood Inventory. The National Cord Blood Inventory focuses on increasing collections of umbilical cord blood from donor mothers of diverse racial and ethnic groups. The status is pending, but the University of Colorado Cord Blood Bank has set funding targets to collect and store 51 Native American cord blood units. In calendar year 2010 the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program served a total of 5,264 (duplicated) American Indians/Alaskan Natives living with HIV/AIDS, and trained 1,956 providers who serve American Indian and Alaskan Natives living with HIV/AIDS. The Emergency Medical Services for Children program is supported by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and provided support to 84 IHS affiliated EMS programs in 25 States in Fiscal Year 2011. The EMSC program assists with the procurement of ambulance and equipment purchases for the programs and develops and supports pediatric specific training initiatives tailored to the needs of Tribal emergency medical services. In Fiscal Year 2012 HRSA's Emergency Medical Services for Children program intends to solicit applications for a demonstration project that will address the regionalization of care in areas serving American Indian and Alaskan Natives, focused on the pediatric population. Demonstration programs would partner state Emergency Medical Services for Children programs wi th Indian Territories. It is expected that 3- 4 demonstration projects would be funded for 3 years at $270,000/year. Through HRSA's Office of Federal Assistance Management, HRSA has been actively seeking tribal grant reviewers. The call for reviewers was also promoted by colleagues at IHS and Intergovernmental and External Affairs. As a result, 47 new American Indian and Alaskan Native individuals have registered in our reviewer database since June 15, 2010, bringing our total of American Indian and Alaskan Native reviewers to 200. Of these 200 reviewers, 49 have participated in application reviews. The Office of Rural Health Policy continues to provide technical assistance to tribal entities around funding opportunities and grant writing tips. The O ffice has begun to implement the Rural Health Information Technology Network Development Program; this 3- year pilot program was developed in Fiscal Year 2011 in response to the Secretary's Rural HIT Taskforce and the President's Rural Health Initiative. The purpose of the program is to improve health care and support the adoption of Health Information Technology in rural America by providing targeted 2011 HHS Divisions 147 support to rural health networks and assist them in reaching meaningful use. Up to $300,000 in awards were made to three tribal entities on September 1, 2011. HRSA's ten Regional Offices have convened a regional workgroup that focuses on the various interactions regional offices have with tribal partners; this group also provides a forum to identify opportunities for HRSA staff to improve support for tribal stakeholders. Throughout the year HRSA's ten Regional Offices have begun to explore ways to partner with IHS Area Offices to better meet the health care needs of American Indians/Alaskan Natives. On September 14, 2011, the Chief Medical Officer and Deputy Director for the Bemidji Area Office provided an overview to the Regional Workgroup on potential opportunities to improve systems of care through HRSA's and IHS' programs. In continued support of the important role Tribal Colleges and Universities play in their communities HRSA provided $766,949 in funding to four Tribal Colleges and Universities in Fiscal Year 2011. Technical assistance to Tribal organizations has been provided on various occas ions throughout fiscal year 2011. Over 20 technical assistance activities have had a Tribal/Urban focus. 1.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ACTIVITES SPECIFIC TO TRIBES HRSA is responsible for implementing several key provisions of the Affordable Care Act that impact Tribal and Urban American Indian/Alaska Native populations. HRSA has been working with the Indian Health Service and others across the Department of Health and Human Services to do this work. The Affordable Care Act provides $11 billion in funding for the operation, expansion and construction of health centers throughout the nation. HRSA awarded approximately $48 million to 25 dually -funded health centers in fiscal year 2011 including $13 million in capital development funding to two Tribal health centers; $100,000 to one tribal health center to improve quality of care and electronic reporting capabilities in Beacon Communities; $455,000 to 13 cente rs to achieve recognition as a patient -centered medical home, $560,000 through the Health Center Planning Grant Program to assist in the development of a future health centers to seven tribal organizations; and $500,000 was awarded to the Native American C ommunity Academy to support their school- based health center program. The Affordable Care Act authorizes and appropriates $1.5 billion for the NHSC through 2015. In Fiscal Year 2011, the Affordable Care Act funded 2,612 new loan repayment awards and 248 scholarships. The Affordable Care Act also: 1. Increases the maximum annual loan repayment award from $35,000 to up to $50,000. 2. Establishes permanent half -time service opportunities for NHSC scholars and loan repayers with the creation of 2- and 4 -year c ontracts for the Loan Repayment Program. 3. NHSC participants may now receive up to 20 percent service credit for teaching (and up to 50 percent in future Teaching Health Centers). 4. Allows Indian Health Facilities that serve only Tribal members to qualify as N HSC sites. In cooperation with the Administration for Children and Families and supported by the Affordable Care Act, $1.5 billion was made available for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program through 2014. Funding for home visiting programs has been made available for states, Tribes and territories that plan to deliver services for early childhood home visitation programs that provide comprehensive services and improve outcomes for families living in at -risk communities. In Fis cal Year 2011 $10.5 million has been set -aside for Tribal and Urban Indian entities. To date thirteen cooperative agreements were awarded to tribal entities in Fiscal Year 2010 and six cooperative agreements were awarded in Fiscal Year 2011; HRSA anticipates that approximately five to six cooperative agreements will be made to tribal entities in Fiscal Year 2012. In addition $600,000 was awarded on September 28, 2011 to support the Tribal Research Center on Early Childhood which will provide leadership and support to promote excellence in community -based participatory research and evaluation of Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting, Head Start, and Early Head Start initiatives that serve American Indian and Alaskan Native children and famil ies. 2011 HHS Divisions 149 Section 7101 of the Affordable Care Act expands participation in the 340B Drug Pricing Program to newly eligible covered entities that include: Sole Community Hospitals, Critical Access Hospitals, Children's Hospitals, Free Standing Cancer Hospitals, and Rural Referral Centers. Twelve hospitals were identified as Tribal on the list of newly- eligible Critical Access Hospitals. AGENCY TRIBAL CONSULTATION POLICY Based on feedback received at the 13th Annual Budget Consultation, HRSA has begun the process of updating our Tribal Consultation Policy in accordance with the Department of Health and Human Services Consultation Policy. Two meetings were held with Tribal Leaders at the National Indian Health Board (NIHB) and The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) on September 26, 2011 and October 30, 2011 respectively. These meetings provided an opportunity to receive input and feedback from Tribal Leaders and Tribal partners on HRSA's draft Consultation Policy. Approximately 140 Tribal leaders at tended both of these sessions. HRSA staff is currently reviewing all comments and feedback received and expects to have a final draft Consultation Policy for review by February 20, 2012 with an approved policy by March 2012. 2011 HHS Divisions 150 United States Depa rtment of Health and Human Services Indian Health Service (IHS) The Indian Health Service provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who are members or descendents of 565 federally recognized Tribes in 35 states. The IHS fiscal year (FY) 2010 appropriation was $4.05 billion. The IHS has a total of about 15,700 employees, which includes approximately 2,700 nurses, 900 physicians, 700 engineers and sanitarians, 600 pharmacists, and 300 dentists. The IHS system consists of 12 Area offices, which are further divided into 161 Service Units that provide care at the local level. Health services are provided directly by the IHS, through tribally contracted and operated health programs, and through services purchased from private providers. There are over 600 facilities in the Indian health system. The Federal system consists of 31 hospitals, 63 health centers, and 30 health stations. In addition, 34 Urban Indian health programs provide a variety of health and referral services. The provision of Federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives is based on a Government -to-Government relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States, as well as numerous treaties, court decisions, and legislation. The Snyder Act of 1921 provides the basic authority for health services provided by the Federal Government to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEA A), as amended, allows Tribes to assume the administrative and program direction responsibilities that were previously carried out solely by the Federal Government. Tribes currently administer over one- half of IHS resources through ISDEAA contracts and compacts. The IHS administers the remaining resources and manages facilities where Tribes have elected not to contract or compact their health programs. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976 (IHCIA), as amended, authorizes the provision of health care services by IHS and was reauthorized in 2010 with passage of the Affordable Care Act.

Acting Deputy Director for Intergovernm ental Affairs Indian Health Service 801 Thompson Avenue, 443- 1083 Email: HHS Divisions 151 HIGHLIGHTS OF DIVISION SPECIFIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS/ACTIVITIES TARGETED TOWARD AMERICAN INDIANS/ALASKA N ATIVES (AI/AN) Tribal Consultation Tribal consultation was identified as a top division priority in 2011. The four IHS priorities include: 1. To renew and strengthen our partnership with Tribes; 2. To reform the IHS; 3. To improve the quality of and access to care; and 4. To ensure that our work is accountable, transparent, fair and inclusive. Activities in FY 2011 included comprehensive and wide- ranging activities targeted at improving communication with Tribes, expanding consultation activities on top Tribal priorities, increasing formal written communications with Tribal Leaders, convening a series of listening sessions throughout Indian Country and within each IHS Area, and hosting Tribal delegation meetings. Consultation on Tribal Consultation Process IHS continued to implement recommendations on how to improve the IHS Tribal consultation process. In addition to the strategies listed below, the Director's Tribal Advisory Workgroup on Consultation recommended that IHS hold a \"summit\" that would serve as a \"one stop shop\" for Tribes to learn about IHS Tribal consultation activities and as a forum for providing input. On July 6-7, 2011, the first IHS Tribal Consultation Summit was convened, which was followed by a half-day educational session on the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Tribal participants actively engaged with the IHS and other Federal agencies during the two- day meeting. The event provided numerous opportunities for Tribes to provide feedback and recommendations on current IHS consultation topics. The Summit also allowed Tribes to participate in workshops and other information sharing on resources to expand Tribal consultation activities. The IHS Director also initiated a consultation in 2011 on the application of the Federal Advisory Committee Act to the current list of IHS advisory groups, workgroups and committees. Tribal Communication Strategies The IHS Web site www.ihs.gov functions as a central portal for updates on important Agency initiatives and operational updates. Redesigned in early 2010, The Director's Corner , which is accessed through the site's main page, has proven to be a tremendous success, receiving more than 95,000 individual views during the past year. The Director's Corner features press releases, presentations, and links to a host of Agency -relevant activities, including IHS reform initiatives, Tribal Leader letters, and other announcements. The Director's Corner also features the Director's Blog, which provides timely updates on a variety of topics, photographs from Tribal site visits, and other events effecting Indian Country, along with essential Agency communications. These updates have increased Agency transparency and information sharing with an annual usage of approximately 32,000 us ers. Tribal Consultation Website Developed in response to Tribal recommendations, the Tribal Consultation Web site at http://www.ihs.gov/PublicAffairs/DirCorner/index.cfm?module=tc was developed in 2010 to serve as a central location to find information about these vital activities. Site content includes the following: information on all IHS Tribal workgroups, boards, and committees; a repository of 2011 HHS Divisions 152 Letters to Tribal Leaders; and, in the near future, postings of current activities, including minutes and meeting summaries. IHS Area Listening Sessions The IHS Director initiated Tribal consultations in each of the 12 IHS Areas during FY 2011, with an emphasis on continued improvement in the IHS Tribal consultation process at the national and Area levels. In FY 2011, the IHS Director convened 12 Area listening sessions at each of the 12 IHS Areas by teleconference videoconference or in- person meetings. Tribal Leaders recommended improvements to Tribal consultation processes at the national, Area, and loc al levels, asked questions on current issue and also presented Tribal priorities on the funding needs. Tribal Delegation Meetings During 2011, the IHS Director met with 65 Tribal delegations that represented 339 Tribes. During Tribal delegation meetings, Tribes discussed issues specific to their local health facility and community and IHS provided information, updates and helped determine next steps to resolve issues. Agency Consultations on Tribal Priorities Tribal consultation activities in response to priorities established by Tribes in FY 2011included the following: Annual IHS Budget Formulation The IHS Budget Formulation Workgroup met in February 2011 to review IHS Area budget formulation recommendations and to make national recommendations for the IHS budget. The IHS Director reviewed the workgroup recommendations and incorporated them into the agency budget formulation process. Annual HHS Tribal Budget and Policy Consultation The IHS participated in Tribal Resource Day and the HHS Tribal Budget and Policy Consultation Session held on March 2 -4, 2011, in Washington, DC. Two Tribal representatives from the IHS Budget Formulation Workgroup presented oral and written testimony on IHS budget recommendations at the Tribal Consultation Session. Contract Health Services (CHS) Tribal consultation on the CHS program continued throughout FY 2011. In a mailing to Tribal Leaders on January 10, 2010, the IHS Director initiated a formal consultation on how to reform the CHS program, including the establishment of a Federal/Tribal workgroup. The 24 - member Director's Workgroup on Improving CHS met several times and developed specific recommendations for improvements. The recommendations included improving how IHS calculates CHS unmet need, improving CHS business practices, evaluating the current CHS formula, and including medical inflation in the IHS budget. An update to Tribal Leaders was provided on February 9, 2011, which outlined the workgroup recommendations, indicated the IHS Director's concur rence, and discussed next steps. Based on one of the workgroup recommendations, 12 Area work sessions were held throughout the second quarter to review current CHS policies and procedures and make recommendations on changes to improve CHS business practices. These recommendations are currently being used as a framework for revisions to Chapter 3 of the Indian Health Manual . A technical sub- committee was formed to evaluate alternatives to calculating current and future CHS need. 2011 HHS Divisions 153 Consultation on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA) Formal consultation on the ACA and IHCIA was initiated by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the IHS in a jointly signed letter to Tribes dated May 12, 2010. Listening sessions were held with Tribes at several Indian health meetings and with several Tribal workgroups and advisory committees. The IHS Director also updated Tribes on the progress of the implementation efforts during the IHS Tribal Consultation Summit in July 2011. In May, 2011, a letter was sent to Tribes to report on the status of provisions that had deadlines as of the one year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. In July, 2011, the IHS Director sent a letter to Tribes with an update on implementation of the IHCIA and included a summary table with progress on implementation of each provision. In November, 2011, a letter was sent to Tribes with the IHS Director's decision on the consultation on the formula for distribution of program increa ses for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund. While updates to data used in the formula were approved, the formula itself will be kept the same until all programs are funded at a similar level of need, and new provisions in the IHCIA will not be adopted until specific funding is available for their implementation. Consultations were initiated to gather input on two IHCIA provisions: establishment of the agency's first Sexual Assault Policy; and an update to the Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of Interior on Indian alcohol and substance abuse treatment. IHS participated in several listening sessions, HHS and IHS meetings and monthly White House Affordable Care Act Outreach calls to provide updates and answer questions from Tribes on ACA and IHCIA implementation. Updates were also provided on the IHS Director's blog, including updates on the issue of the definitions of Indian in ACA, the Notices of Proposed Rule- Making on the ACA State Exchanges and how they addressed the special provisions for Indians, updates from the Office of Personnel Management on implementation of the Access to Federal Insurance (FEHB) provision, links to documents that were submitted to Congress on behavioral health issues, a draft letter to notify outside providers of new CHS payment policies, a link to a fact sheet on the Affordable Care Act, and a blog on the cost of repeal of the ACA for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Health Information Technology Shares Consultation In August, 2010, the IHS Director sent a letter to Tribes to report on the initial recommendations of the Information Systems Advisory Committee (ISAC) and to initiate further consultation activities. The IHS Office of Information Technology (OIT) held 12 listening sessions in 2011 in coordination with the IHS Areas. Listening sessions in each IHS Area provided Tribes with multiple opportunities to discuss the recommendations and current information technology programs, services, functions, and activities. An action plan has been created that summarized the Tribal feedback and recommendations from these events, and the IHS Director plans to provide an update to Tribes in early 2012. Behavioral Health Ongoing efforts to address behavioral health issues, including mental health, substance abuse , and suicide, continue as top Tribal priorities. In a letter to Tribes dated November 12, 2010, the IHS Director, Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, and Administrator, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), informed Tribal Leaders of a combined effort to hold a national Suicide Awareness Conference and ten Listening Sessions and requested input on the agenda and goals. On March 8, 2011, the IHS Director initiated a consultation with Tribes on priorities for implementation of the updated Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Department of the 2011 HHS Divisions 154 Interior (DOI) on AI/AN alcohol and substance abuse prevention and treatment. Section 703 of the IHCIA provides new authorities that permit the DOI and HHS, acting through the IHS, to develop and enter into a MOA, or review and update an existing MOA. On March 28, 2011, the IHS Director requested a consultation with Tribes on the IHS National Sexual Assault Policy, as required by sections 17 and 25 of the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010. An update was provided by the IHS Director to Tribes on the progress of Agency behavioral health and suicide prevention strategic plan development on September 2, 2011. Access to Quality Health Care Collaborating to strengthen Departmental efforts in support of AI/AN communities in FY 2011, the IHS Director and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Administrator met to identify priorities common to both agencies, including the following: reducing the burden of disease on the AI/AN population; increasing health professional workforce development; increasing health information technology investments in Tribal and Urban Indian health facilities; and improving access for American Indians and Alaska Natives to funding and grant opportunities. The IHS Director initiated a consultation in 2011 on the distribution of the Special Diabetes Program for Indians renewal through FY 2013. After review of input received from Tribes, the Director decided to continue the same distribution of funding to IHS, Tribes and urban Indian health programs. Contract Support Costs IHS initiated a consultation with Tribes to evaluate the 2007 Contract Support Costs Policy. An advisory committee was established with Tribal governmental representatives and the f irst workgroup meeting is scheduled in January 2012. Other IHS Consultation Activities The IHS Director also met with many of the Agency's Tribal advisory workgroups, committees, and boards. The IHS Director attended the White House Tribal Nations Conference in December 2011. DIVISION SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES In FY 2011, IHS Areas reported a number of new consultation activities and initiatives that relate to the Agency's partnership with Tribes. The activities that follow have been grouped by IHS Area. Aberdeen Area IHS Annual IHS Budget Formulation Consultation The Aberdeen Area IHS Budget Formulation Consultation was conducted on December 13, 2010, in Rapid City, South Dakota. The Tribes and the IHS met to discuss the Tribal priorities and make recommendations for the IHS budget. Contract Health Services (CHS) The Aberdeen Area IHS conducted three CHS workgroups with Tribes. Three sessions were held to discuss efforts to reform the CHS program and make overall improvements to the CHS program: March 22, 2011, in Rapid City, South Dakota; April 13, 2011, in Aberdeen, South Dakota; and May 4, 2011, in Chamberlain, South Dakota. Additional topics under discussion included whether or not changes should be made to the existing formula for distribution of new CHS funds and various methods to improve CHS business operations. 2011 HHS Divisions 155 Affordable Care Act and IHCIA The Aberdeen Area IHS partnered with the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Health Board to conduct two ACA Consultation sessions with Tribes. The first meeting was held on December 14, 2010, in Rapid City, South Dakota and the second meeting was held on January 25-26, 2011, in Bismarck, North Dakota. Commitment to Consultation The IHS, in collaboration with Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Health Board, met with Aberdeen Area Tribal Leaders and staff from each Tribe, governing bodies, and organizations in FY 2011 for consultation to develop a Strategic Plan for the Aberdeen Area IHS. The IHS, along with the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Health Board met onsite with 17 Tribes and 2 Urban Indian health organizations. Agency staff participated in the National Indian Health Board Conference, Direct Service Tribes workgroup meetings, and numerous national meetings.

The Tucson Area IHS, Tohono O'odham Nation, and Pascua Yaqui Tribe have submitted waiver letters to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in Baltimore, Maryland, to allow eligible Native Americans who are enrolled in the State childless adult program to retain their eligibility for services. The Tohono O'odham Nation developed a Tribal Resolution on this issue, which they subsequently approved and submitted to the National Congress of American Indians. Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) and Medicaid Enrollment Outreach The Tucson Area IHS received a $300,000 grant from CMS for the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA) outreach and enrollment in April 2010. Since that time, the Tucson Area IHS has hired two full -time Patient Benefits Coordinators to provide outreach and facility -based Medicaid assistance to the Tohono O'odham Nation. This has resulted in an additional 300 children enrolled in the Arizona AHCCCS program. For FY 2011, third- party revenue also increased by five percent, primarily, as a result of Arizona AHCCCS payments. The Tucson Area IHS conv ened a committee of health department members comprised of members of the Tohono O'odham Nation, Pascua Yaqui Tribe, and IHS staff. The group sponsored an Outreach and Education training conference on September 30, 2011, which provided educational presentations by representatives of the AHCCCS, CMS Region IX, and the Social Security Administration (SSA). Approximately 165 IHS and Tribal staff participated in this conference. The Tucson Area IHS is currently marketing and promoting CHIPRA outreach to Area Tribal communities. Other IHS consulted with Tribes on the selection of several Area Directors during 2011 in a collaborative process where Tribes participated in the interview process and made recommendations on the candidates for selection. Area Directors were appointed after Tribal consultation for the Albuquerque, Portland, and Phoenix Areas. AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT ACTIVITIES SPECIFIC TO TRIBES In 2010, all IHS ARRA funding was obligated for health facility construction, maintenance and improvements, sanitation facilities construction, health equipment, and health information technology projects. Throughout FY 2011, 84 percent of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) funds were disbursed. The following are examples of activities and accomplishments of the IHS and Tribes working together on this important initiative. 2011 HHS Divisions 168 Aberdeen Area IHS ARRA Projects The Aberdeen Area IHS received $113 million in ARRA funds to implement projects on reservations across the four -state region: maintenance and improvement ($15.2 million); medical equipment ($1.286 million); regular sanitation facilities construction ($6 million); sanitation facilities construction from the EPA ($6 million); and new health care facilities constructi on ($84.5 million). Many Area Tribes have taken control of their projects and a few have been completed. The Eagle Butte IHS hospital replacement project, which has an overall budget in excess of $110 million, was nominated as one of the Department's \"Best ARRA Projects.\" The Aberdeen Area IHS met its 2010 goal of obligating all ARRA funds into projects. The refined goals now include project completion and disbursing the funds to the contractors as the work is completed. ARRA Project Funds Obligations and Disbursements American Recovery and Reinvestment Act project funds obligations and disbursements in the Aberdeen Area IHS included the following: Maintenance and Improvement Projects for Health Care Facilities ($15.2 million received, 100 percent obligated, and 75 percent disbursed); Medical Equipment (General) ($563,000 received, 100 percent obligated, and 91 percent disbursed); Scanners ($500,000 received, 100 percent obligated, and 100 percent disbursed); Tribal Medical Equipment ($223,000 received, 100 percent obligated, and 89 percent disbursed); Sanitation Facilities Construction (Regular) ($6.0 million received, 100 percent obligated, and 66 percent disbursed); Outpatient Care Facility (New Construction) ($84.5 million received, 100 percent obligated, and 99 percent disbursed); EPA Safe Drinking Water Act ($2.8 million received, 100 percent obligated, and 69 percent disbursed); and EPA Clean Water Act ($3.2 million received, 100 percent obligated, and 88 percent disbursed). Tribal Consultation about ARRA Funding The Aberdeen Area IHS and Tribes consulted to assign $113.3 million in ARRA project funds to prioritized projects and has now disbursed $105.3 million to Tribes and other recipients. Alaska Area IHS Total ARRA Implementation The Alaska Area IHS successfully implemented over $200 million in ARRA projects, including the following: 14 sanitation facility construction medical equipment projects ($1 million); and 37 health facility maintenance and improvement projects ($19.6 million). Also, in collaboration with the EPA, the Alaska Area IHS obligated 11 Safe Drinking Water Act projects ($8 million), and 19 Clean Water Act projects ($19.9 million). Nome Hospital This new 18- bed acute care hospital is funded with $142.5 million in ARRA funds and $25.12 million in IHS and Denali Commission funding. The 150,000 square foot facility is being constructed through a unique partnership between the IHS and the Norton Sound Health Corporation, via a Title V Construction Project Agreement. The new facility replaces the existing hospital built in 1948, servicing over 8,000 people in 20 remote communities. The project is on track for completion in the fall of 2012. 2011 HHS Divisions 169 ARRA Maintenance and Improvement Projects Alaska Area IHS ARRA Maintenance and Improvement projects include roof and window replacement and exterior siding at Mt. Edgecombe Hospital in Sitka, Alaska; renovating the woma n's clinic and laboratory at the Anchorage Native Primary Care Center; renovating the electrical distribution system and emergency generator at the hospital in Dillingham, Alaska; and constructing a new birth postpartum center at the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage, Alaska. Projects are conducted via P.L. 638 Title V Construction Contract Agreements with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and are either completed or scheduled for completion by September 30, 2012. Sanitation Facility Construction The Alaska Area IHS has successfully managed 34 projects that received ARRA funding for Sanitation Facilities Construction projects. These were funded by the IHS ($14.4 million), EPA Clean Water Act ($19.9 million), and EPA Safe Drinking Water Act ($7.9 million). The majority of the ARRA projects are complete or nearing completion with 93 percent ($13.4 million) of the IHS funds and 81 percent ($22.5 million) of the EPA funds being expended. The following examples demonstrate the positive impact of ARRA funding on our remote Tribal villages: The sewage collection system failed in Scammon Bay due to shifting ground conditions and the Arctic's extreme seasonal changes. This caused raw sewage to spill out into a densely populated area of the village. The IHS, EPA, Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, and the local village collaborated on an ARRA -funded project, which remedied the sewage overflow situation, protecting the residents of the community from direct contact with raw sewage. Due to an outdated water treatment plant, residents of Kwigillingok, Alaska, received a boil water notice, which is issued when contamination is confirmed in the water system. During a notice, all customers must boil their water before consuming it or use bott led water. The ARRA project provided a modern washeteria for laundry facilities and a much needed water treatment plant. While most homes still lack running water services, community residents no longer have to boil water. Medical Equipment Projects Twenty-one medical equipment projects, with a combined value of $1.7 million were awarded ARRA funding within the Alaska Area IHS. All medical equipment projects have been completed. Albuquerque Area IHS ARRA Projects The Albuquerque Area IHS awarded ARRA maintenance and improvement projects to four Tribes and one equipment project through P.L. 93-638 contracts. All five projects were completed on schedule. ARRA Funding Disbursement Sixteen water and wastewater ARRA projects were funded totaling $8,894,190. Twelve projects have been completed, with 4 projects nearing completion. Funding disbursements are at about 90 percent with the remaining funds scheduled for dispersal by December 2012. Bemidji Area IHS The Bemidji Area IHS Office of Environmental Health and Engineering (OEHE) is on target to meet all targeted outlays of ARRA funds. As of September 30, 2011, Sanitation Facilities (IHS and EPA) were 87 percent disbursed; Maintenance and Improvement projects were 2011 HHS Divisions 170 92.9 percent disbursed; and Equipment projects were 99.8 percent disbursed, resulting in an overall disbursement rate of 90.7 percent of the funding and obligations. In addition to the OEHE ARRA projects, the Bemidji Area IHS received six ARRA projects, totaling $480,285, addressing the needs of Tribes utilizing non- RPMS systems for their Electronic Health Records. The projects improved the internal and external interfaces required to transmit data. Awards were granted to five Tribes and one Urban Indian health program in the Bemidji Area. Billings Area IHS The Billings Area IHS contracted $7.4 million in ARRA projects with private sector companies and Tribal Governments in FY 2011. The majority of these projects have been completed. California Area IHS Largest EPA and IHS ARRA Project in the United States The California Area IHS is managing the largest EPA and IHS ARRA -funded project in the nation, on the Tule River Reservation. The $8.2 million ARRA project, which is scheduled for completion in November 2013, will serve 371 homes. Water Treatment Monitoring Equipment The California Area IHS installed water treatment monitoring equipment for three remote public water systems on the Yurok Reservation. Compliance with the EPA's Surface Water Treatment Rule was particularly challenging, since no electrical power is available in the three communities. This ARRA project will serve 127 homes. Nashville Area IHS The Nashville Area IHS received and managed $14,062,607 in ARRA funding that supported 42 new projects for sanitation facilities construction, medical equipment, and health care facility improvements. The majority of the ARRA funds (94 percent) were awarded to Area Tribes through P.L. 93-638 contracts or P.L. 86-121 agreements. Thirty -three of 42 projects are fully complete at thi s time. ARRA funds disbursement currently stands at 86 percent for the Nashville Area IHS. New Roof, HVAC System, and Computed Tomography (CT) Scanner at Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (MBCI) Hospital The health center for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians received significant benefits from ARRA funding, which greatly improved facilities and equipment serving 9,258 members. Significant water leaks were addressed by a new roof and repairs were made to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. This substantially decreased energy usage and improved the facility environment. A new CT scanner replaced a non- functional unit, greatly improving access to quality diagnostic services and enhancing timeliness for patients seeking treatment. New Clinic at Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians (HBMI) The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians (HBMI) in northern Maine received a new clinic as a result of ARRA funding. The existing clinic was undersized, did not meet minimum health care facility standards, and was not economically feasible to renovate. Using ARRA funding and additional resources secured by the Tribe, they were able to design and construct a new, energy efficient, state -of-the art clinic facility, which will enable them to meet existing and future health care needs for nearly 700 Tribal members. 2011 HHS Divisions 171 Navajo Area IHS Quarterly meetings tracked completion of ARRA funded activities. As of September 2011, P.L. 86-121 project funds were 100 percent obligated and 65 percent disbursed. All of medical equipment dollars (including information technology) were disbursed and equipment had been delivered. Twenty -six out of 27 Maintenance and Improvement projects were completed. The Navajo Area IHS relocated a 16 -slice CT scanner to Crownpoint Service Unit from Gallup, New Mexico, after the Gallup Service Unit received $750,000 in ARRA dollars for a CT Scanner replacement. Oklahoma City Area IHS The Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma's Frye Road Water Line Extension was an ARRA -funded project in conjunction with the EPA. The goal of the project was to extend the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma's potable water supply line to Tribal residents whose water was found to have high concentrations of radioactive materials. The Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma's Inlet Pipe Rehab Project was also an ARRA -funded project via the EPA. The project objective was to rehabilitate the existing wastewater lagoon inlet pipe, which had been damaged during construction. Phoenix Area IHS Seventy ARRA projects, totaling $27.4 million were funded in the Phoenix Area IHS. These projects consisted of the following: Maintenance and Improvements, Medical Equipment, Computed Tomography Unit, and Sanitation Facilities Construction. All ARRA funds have been obligated and 73 percent of the funds have been disbursed as of the end of FY 2011. Portland Area IHS As of December 1, 2011, 76 of 77 ARRA projects were completed within budget and scope, fully reconciled, and closed out. Thirty -five of Portland Area's 43 Tribes benefited from $12.2 million in expenditures. Highlights include the following: (1) purchase and installation of digital radiography at three Federal Service Units, allowing better interface with electronic health records, higher quality images, and more timely review of x -rays for imp roved patient care, allowing these sites to eliminate use of some hazardous materials and reducing the space needed for storage of x -ray film; (2) upgrading a heating, ventilating, and air conditioning system at a YRTC has yielded a 23 percent reduction in energy costs and a 30 percent reduction in energy usage during comparable time periods over the past 3 years; (3) two Tribal water systems are again in compliance with the EPA's allowed level of arsenic; and (4) a $346,000 project closed a Tribal landfil l, that did not qualify for funding under the Agency's Sanitation Deficiency System but met ARRA requirements for funding. Tucson Area IHS The Tucson Area IHS met all target goals regarding reporting, funds obligations, equipment installations, and funds disbursements on ARRA projects. All ARRA projects are approximately 80 percent complete and on schedule for completion by the target date. ARRA Funding The Tucson Area Division of Environmental Health and Engineering is successfully managing 21 ARRA proj ects, totaling $7.33 million in Facilities Management and Sanitation Facilities Construction (SFC). Approximately 72 percent of ARRA funding has been disbursed. 2011 HHS Divisions 172 Fourteen projects (all 13 of the Facilities Management projects and one of the SFC projects) are complete with final reports submitted. The original scope of work has been completed for two SFC projects at a substantial cost savings, and additional work has been added to each project. Five SFC projects use ARRA funds transferred from the EPA t o the IHS. Inter -agency coordination has been successful in completing the original scope of work for three of these projects and accomplishing above 90 percent construction completion for one project and 75 percent completion for the other. Project moni toring and reporting has also been successful with 100 percent of ARRA recipients reporting for all M&I and SFC projects. Internal monitoring of project status, including financial status in the UFMS, continues at the Area level on a monthly basis to ensure ARRA goals are being met. Health IT ARRA Activities Health IT activities funded by the ARRA included the following: Domain controller equipment installation; Cisco equipment installation in all facilities (with the exception of the San Xavier Health Ce nter); video conferencing equipment was installed and configured; peripheral devices, such as monitors and printers have been deployed as improvements for the inpatient and emergency room. The Tohono O'odham Nation and Pascua Yaqui Tribe have been utilizi ng video- conferencing equipment since the summer of 2010. The Tohono O'odham Nation Community Health Representative laptops were purchased and are fully operational for the Personal Health Record initiative. The ARRA IT equipment funding was provided to the Area by IHS Headquarters, which handled all ARRA funding and reporting requirements. Repair and Renovations to Health Facilities The Pascua Yaqui Tribe completed renovation of existing Tribal health facilities to include a pharmacy, which is currently operational. The Tucson Area IHS was requested by the Tohono O'odham Nation to use ARRA funds to complete repairs and renovations to the health facility. All repairs and renovations have been completed. AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ACTIVITIES SPECIFIC TO TRIBE S Communication of Implementation Activities Since May 12, 2010, the Department and IHS have consulted with Tribes on implementation of the ACA and permanent reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). The Department is the lead on ACA implementation and the IHS participates in implementation activities. The IHS, as the IHCIA implementation lead, communicates with Tribes through a variety of means, including correspondence to Tribes, regional and national Tribal Listening Sessions, and the annual budget consultation sessions on the progress of the implementation activities. At the July 2011 IHS Tribal Consultation Summit, the IHS Director provided an update to Tribal Leaders on IHCIA implementation milestones, timelines, and inter -Agency coordination activities for the past year. During the Consultation Summit, the IHS Director also facilitated a workshop on the ACA to provide opportunities for the HHS and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide information on ACA and IHCIA implementation of provisions important to improving access to health care for AI/AN communities. 2011 HHS Divisions 173 Tribal consultation information and updates were provided on several ACA and IHCIA provisions during the year. In May, 2011, a letter was sent to Tribes to report on the status of provisions that had deadlines as of the one year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. In July, 2011, the IHS Director sent a letter to Tribes with an update on implementation of the IHCIA and included a summary table with progress on implementation of each provision. In November, 2011, a letter was sent to Tribes with the IHS Director's decision on the consultation on the formula for distribution of program increases for the Indian Health Care Improvement Fund. While updates to data used in the formula were approved, the formula itself will be kept the same until all programs are funded at a similar level of need, and new provisions in the IHCIA will not be adopted until specific funding is available for their implementation. Consultations were initiated to gather input on two IHCIA provisions: establishment of the agency's first Sexual Assault Policy; and an update to the Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of Interior on Indian alcohol and substance abuse treatment. IHS participated in several listening sessions, HHS and IHS meetings and monthly White House Affordable Care Act Outreach calls to provide updates and answer questions from Tribes on ACA and IHCIA implementation.

TRIBAL DELEGATION MEETINGS Tribal Leaders and representatives frequently request high- level consultations with the IHS Director on a host of topics affecting AI/AN health policy and program management issues. In accordance with IHS Circular No. 91- 3 (1991), Tribal Delegation Meetings with the IHS Director follow a formal process that includes coordinated briefings to ensure that IHS staff are prepared to respond to questions and requests. In addition, issues requiring follow -up are identified and addressed in a timely manner. In 2011, IHS held 65 meetings with Tribal delegations representing 339 Tribes at IHS headquarters and at various Indian health meetings throughout the year. AGENCY TRIBAL TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP IHS has several advisory groups, committees and workgroups that provide input and advice to the IHS Director on a variety of topics that relate to current consultations or ongoing priority issues. Updates on groups active in 2011 are included below. Director's Tribal Advisory Workgroup on Consultation The Director's Tribal Advisory Workgroup on Consultation consists of 24 elected or appointed Tribal officials from each of the 12 IHS Areas. The charge of the workgroup is to recommend improvements to make the Tribal Consultation process more meaningful, effective, and accountable. The Director's Tribal Advisory Workgroup on Consultation met by phone in May, 2011 to plan the agency's first Tribal Consultation Summit, which was designed, based on the workgroup's recommendation, to be a \"one stop shop\" for Tribal leaders to hear updates and provide input on current consultation activities. The workgroup provided an update on their activities and held a breakout session to provide Tribal leaders an opportunity to provide input on workgroup activities. Tribal Self -Governance Advisory Committee (TSGAC) Comprised of Tribal leaders from each IHS Area, the IHS TSGAC provides advice to the IHS Director and assistance on issues and concerns pertaining to Tribal Self -Governance and the implementation of ISDEAA Self -Governance activities within the IHS. On a quarterly basis, the TSGAC meets to confer, discuss, and reach consensus on specific Self Governance issues. The TSGAC is supported by a technical workgroup, which is available to conduct further research and review to address policy issues. In 2011, the IHS TSGAC and the IHS Director met quarterly and discussed several issues, including implementation of ACA and the permanent reauthorization of the IHCIA, the IHS budget and its formulation process, contract health services, contract support costs, Self -Governance expansion in HHS, and the Self - 2011 HHS Divisions 177 Governance strategic plan. The Annual Self -Governance Conference was held in May, 2011 and a joint Federal/Tribal Self -Governance t raining session was held in August, 2011. Direct Service Tribes Advisory Committee (DSTAC) The IHS DSTAC was established in FY 2005 to provide leadership, advocacy, and policy guidance on behalf of Tribes receiving health care services directly from the IHS. The DSTAC is comprised of elected and appointed Tribal Leaders from 10 IHS Areas with Direct Service Tribes (DST). Technical assistance for the DSTAC is provided by IHS Headquarters and Area level staff. The DSTAC met quarterly in FY 2011 and held monthly conference calls. During the spring of 2011, the DSTAC participated in the IHS budget formulation process by developing priorities for the FY 2013 budget and presenting testimony at the IHS National Budget Formulation Work Session. The DSTAC also participated in the Agency's first Tribal Consultation Summit during the summer of 2011 and provided an overview of their membership, goals, and accomplishments. The Eighth Annual Direct Service Tribes National meeting was held in Nashville, Tennessee, with strong support from Federal and Tribal representatives. Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee (TLDC) The IHS TLDC was created by the IHS Director in 1998 and continues to hold quarterly meetings. The TLDC recommends a process for distributing congress ionally mandated Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI) funding to the IHS Director. The TLDC also provides the IHS and Tribal leadership with an ongoing forum to discuss all matters related to diabetes and the impact of other chronic diseases on AI/ AN communities. The SDPI, now in its fourteenth year, provides funding for diabetes treatment and prevention services at 404 I/T/U health programs, serving nearly all federally recognized Tribes. The TLDC made recommendations for the distribution of the reauthorization of SDPI funding through FY 2013 and the IHS Director concurred with their recommendations to keep the distribution the same and to transition from a competitive to a continuation application process. Information Systems Advisory Committee (ISAC) The ISAC, an advisory body to the IHS Director that represents the Indian health system customer base, was established to guide the development of co- owned, progressive, and innovative Indian health information technologies.

In 2011, the ISAC addressed issues that included the establishment of the IHS IT strateg ic planning framework and the IT Tribal Shares Improvement Project recommendations to the IHS Director. The ISAC also participated in the first IHS Tribal Consultation Summit held on July 6, 2011. Information Technology Investment Review Board (ITIRB) As required by the Clinger -Cohen Act of 1996, the IHS created an IT Investment Review Board. Comprised of 9 permanent members, including 5 Federal representatives, 4 Tribal representatives, 2 rotating members, and an Ex -Officio member, the ITIRB is the of ficial IHS review body for IT investment, including all major initiatives, funding, and expenditures. The ITIRB ensures that IT resources support the IHS mission, promote the life cycle management of IT systems as \"capital investments,\" and assure IT system project approvals are based on established selection criteria. 2011 HHS Divisions 178 National Tribal Advisory Committee (NTAC) on Behavioral Health The IHS established the NTAC to enhance the Government -to-Government relationship and direct the efforts of the IHS Division of Behavioral Health to improve service delivery within Indian Country. The NTAC helps guide the development and support for behavioral health throughout the I/T/U health system. The committee works to ensure that services are as broadly integrated, available, and culturally appropriate as possible. The NTAC serves as an advisory body to the IHS Director, providing guidance and recommendations regarding behavioral health programmatic issues that affect the delivery of behavioral health care to eligible beneficiaries. The NTAC membership is made up of elected Tribal Leaders from each of the IHS Areas. The NTAC met on December 9, 2010, in Ontario, California, to finalize their recommendations to the IHS Director on the National Behavioral Health and Suicide Prevention Strategic Plans. The NTAC also met in Scottsdale, Arizona, at the IHS/BIA/BIE/SAMHSA Action Summit for Suicide Prevention on August 1, 2011. The goal of the summit was to identify priorities related to the behavioral health and suicide prevention strategic plans. The NTAC also periodically reviews progress of the Agency's Methamphetamine and Suicide Prevention Initiative and the Domestic Violence Prevention Initiative. Behavioral Health Workgroup (BHWG) The IHS BHWG was established as a technical advisory group of subject matter experts charged with providing guidance to the IHS in the development of programs and services for behavioral health for AI/AN communities. The BHWG currently functions as a technical advisory group providing advice through the NTAC. The BHWG is composed of Tribal and Urban representatives who are providers and experts in the field of behavioral health or substance abuse representing each IHS Area. The NTAC held a joint meeting with the BHWG on December 9, 2010, in Ontario, California, to finalize their recommendations to the IHS Director on the National Behavioral Health and Suicide Prevention Strategic Plans. Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Measures Steering Committee The IHS GPRA Steering Co mmittee meets to review IHS GPRA measures plans. The IHS convened the 2012 GPRA evaluation meeting and 2013 planning session on June 2930, 2010, in San Diego, California, in conjunction with the IHS budget formulation workgroup. While the meeting was primarily focused on the budget, a new document was distributed that provided a history of each clinical measure and included annual targets, results, and a graph of historical results for each measure. In November 2010, the IHS convened the 2010 GPRA Coordinators Conference in Sacramento, California, to discuss and plan improvement for IHS and tribally operated GPRA measures, targets, and outcomes. Scholarship Standing Advisory Board The IHS Scholarship Standing Advisory Board provides advice and consultat ion related to the IHS Scholarship Program to the Chief of the IHS Scholarship Program. This advisory board is comprised of 10 Tribal members. This board meets if requested by the IHS Director or IHS Scholarship Program. Budget Formulation Workgroup Tribes, Tribal organizations, Urban Indian health programs, and other key stakeholders are actively involved in the budget formulation process to ensure that the IHS budget reflects the evolving health needs of AI/AN people and communities. The IHS Tribal Consultation policy 2011 HHS Divisions 179 describes the charge and activities of the IHS Budget Formulation Workgroup. This workgroup develops annual budget recommendations starting with 12 Area IHS budget sessions, a national budget meeting, a Departmental meeting, and an evaluation meeting. Budget Formulation Workgroup meetings were held in FY 2011 to develop and complete the FY 2013 budget cycle including the HHS Budget Consultation Session and Tribal Resource Day on March 2- 4, 2011, in Washington, DC. The Agency also convened the FY 2013 budget formulation evaluation meeting and 2014 budget formulation planning session on May 10-11, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Budget formulation workgroup members assist with Area budget formulation sessions each year. Tribal prioriti es from the Tribal budget formulation workgroup are reviewed and incorporated into the IHS budget formulation process each year. Contract Support Costs (CSC) Workgroup On October 11, 2011, the Director wrote to Tribal Leaders announcing a formal Tribal Consultation on the IHS 2007 CSC Policy. A CSC workgroup will be developed and convened. Two Tribal leaders from each IHS Area will serve on the CSC Workgroup to review, evaluate and make recommendations regarding the 2007 CSC Policy (IHS Indian Health Manual Part 6, Chapter 3). The IHS plans to convene the workgroup in January 2012. All recommendations submitted by the workgroup will be shared with all Tribes for review and comment before implementation. IHS and Tribal Institutional Review Board Chai rs Workgroup The IHS and Tribal Institutional Review Board Chairs Workgroup is composed of approximately 20 individuals who review research proposals that need national institutional review board (IRB) review. The members are drawn from the I/T/U and academic organizations. Area IHS and Tribal IRBs convene conference calls to discuss issues related to the protection of human subjects in research activities conducted in I/T/U settings. All human participant research conducted in IHS facilities or with IHS staff or resources must be approved by an IHS IRB. This also includes all research in tribally managed or Urban Indian health facilities. AGENCY TRIBAL CONSULTATION POLICY The IHS has a Government -to-Government relationship with AI/AN Tribal Governments and is committed to regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with eligible Tribes. Consultation is considered an essential element for a sound and productive relationship with Tribes. Tribal consultation has been affirmed by Executive Order in 2000 and through Presidential Memoranda in 1994, 2004, and 2009. The IHS Tribal Consultation Policy can be referenced at IHS Circular No. 2006- 01 and was the first Tribal consultation policy implemented in HHS over 10 years ago. The recent consultati on on the IHS Tribal consultation process resulted in recommendations from Tribes to keep the policy the same but to improve its implementation. The Director's Tribal Advisory Workgroup on Consultation developed 6 pages of recommendations for improvements in the Tribal consultation process and implementation of those recommendations continues. They focus mainly on the process for consultation, including timely notification, clear communication of the purpose of the consultation, clear plans and deadlines, better distribution of consultation notices, development of a Tribal consultation website, and more specific outcomes. The Director's Tribal Advisory Workgroup on Consultation will review the updated HHS Tribal Consultation Policy and will determine if changes to the IHS Tribal Consultation Policy are needed. 2011 HHS Divisions 180 United States Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health (NIH) The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and to apply that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness and disability. The NIH works towards this mission by conducting and supporting research in: 1) the causes, diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases; 2) the processes of human growth and development; 3) the biological effects of environmental contaminants; 4) in the understanding of mental, addictive and physical disorders; and 5) directing programs for the collection, dissemination, and exchange of information in medicine and health, including the development and support of medical libraries and the training of medical librarians and other health information specialists. The prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and conditions that disproportionately affect American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native American (AI/AN/NA) communities are a priority for the NIH. Toward this end, the NIH promotes research and capacity -building programs and conducts and supports health promotion education and the translation of research findings into programs, educational/informational tools and materials for dissemination into the AI/AN/NA community. Expanding the pool of scientists, researchers, and health professionals within the AI/AN/NA community is also essential in dealing with the many variables associated with improving the health of the AI/AN community. The NIH also recognizes partnerships and consultation as a fundamental strategy to reach the community. This report highlights several programs and specific activities the NIH supported or participated in during 2010 in the areas of research, capacity -building and health education that are relevant to AI/AN/NA communities.

These projects address the need for evidence- based, culturally relevant drug prevention and treatment interventions that are accessible and engaging to NA youth and adults in remote locations. National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research Periodontal Disease Prevention and Control in American Indian and Alaska Native Adolescents This study is focused on characterizing the status of periodontal health in adolescents with type 2 diabetes. Both of these associated diseases are increased in AI/AN populations. The study participants are urban -dwelling AI/AN adolescents living in Denver, Colorado who are at high risk for Type 2 diabetes and periodontitis. Preventing Caries in Preschoolers: American Indian Head Start Programs This trial will determine whether or not an oral health promotion program delivered by community oral health workers in the Head Start setting is effective at preventing ECC. In addition to evaluating the impact on ECC, the study will examine family changes in oral health knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. This study team is from the Center for Native Oral Health Research at the University of Colorado, Denver. Promoting Behavioral Change in American Indian Mothers and Children The Center for Native Oral Health Research at the University of Colorado, Denver is studying several aspects of Early Childhood Caries (ECC), which develops in a disproportionately high number of AI children. A recently launched randomized trial is investigating the cost and efficacy of a behavioral intervention (motivational interviewing) on the prevention of ECC in a Northern Plains tribe. The intervention is being conducted in collaboration with the AI community to assure the development of culturally appropriate educational and health promotional materials that emphasize the value of family oral health at all stages of development, from prenatal to adulthood. Streptococcus Mutans and Dental Caries in Native American Children This prospective cohort study is targeted at establishing the risk factors for the development of ECC in infants and toddlers of a Northern Plains Tribe to determine if the caries -causing bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, alone or in combination with environmental factors, increase the risk of ECC. Investigators will determine the incidence of ECC through age 36 -months and consider issues that may contribute to ECC such as the transmission of Streptococcus mutans from mother to child; bacterial virulence factors; and behavioral, dietary, and nutritional risk factors. A Targeted Approach to Increasing American Indian Tissue and Organ Donation National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases In this project, investigators will mount a multi- pronged program on ESRD and organ donation at seven TCUs in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Plains. These states are primarily rural, contain medically underserved areas, and have large populations of AIs. Because students are among those most likely to donate organs, TCUs offer the possibly of reaching a younger population of AIs. 2011 HHS Divisions 192 Diabetic Nephropa thy NIDDK has a substantial portfolio of clinical investigations of diabetic nephropathy in AIs, supported through the intramural program. In addition to the portfolio of laboratory interventions, NIDDK also supports studies evaluating factors that affec t therapeutic response, enzyme inhibitors, the renin- angiotensin system, angiotensin -converting enzyme inhibitors, and variables responsible for the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease. Genetic Determinants of Obesity in Pima Indians The Pima Indians of AZ have the highest prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus of any population in the world. Obesity is also extremely common, and data indicates that obesity in this population has major genetic determinants. In 2009, a genome- wide association study using over 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms was conducted and completed on approximately 1500 members of the Pima Indian population of the Gila River Indian Community in AZ. Analyses are being conducted currently to identify regions of the genome that are associated with obesity. Genetics of Obesity in Yup'ik Eskimos The investigators extended their current data set of over 800 interrelated Yup'ik Eskimos to 1000 family members in order to: 1) Identify single nucleotide polymorphism s (SNPs) in the seven candidate genes, 2) Test these genes for association with obesity phenotypes, and 3) Test for gene- environment and gene- gene interactions. The discovery of gene- environment interactions gained from this study will further the underst anding of obesity and will be relevant to future studies aimed at developing and testing interventions and novel therapeutic targets for obesity. Hepatitis Beta Research Network Clinical Center in Pacific Northwest/Alaska This Clinical Center is being est ablished as a part of the Hepatitis B Clinical Research Network (HB-CRN). It will consist of three collaborating institutions in the Washington and Alaska. The goal is to establish a data base, a natural history study, and a bio repository of patients wi th chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection from the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. The Clinical Center will bring together patients, investigators, and resources from a variety of health centers as well as a number of affiliated community and outreach cl inics. Neural Correlates of Food Reward in American Indian Women Despite the disproportionate obesity burden among AIs, this will be the first study in this underrepresented population that uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an opioid antagonist. Our results will provide important data about brain activation in response to high-calorie foods that will inform dietary interventions aimed at preventing and treating obesity and may identify a promising pharmacologic treatment for obesity and overeating in AIs. NIDDK National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP) Multicultural Campaigns The NIDDK launched the NDEP with the Centers for Disease Control in 1997 to change the way diabetes is treated. Since its inception, NDEP has taken a multicultural approach to address its goals of improving diabetes management, approaches, community- based interventions, health system changes, and an inclusive partnership network. The project provides ideas and encourages creation of activities in AI communities regarding education about diabetes prevention and treatment. 2011 HHS Divisions 193 Prevention and Control of Type 2 Diabetes in the Pima Indians of Arizona NIDDK, community leaders, and community members have developed and produced several health education materials to promote the message that diabetes can be prevented. These materials include two videos, \"Close to the Heart: Breastfeeding Our Children and Honoring Our Values,\" which encourages breastfeeding to prevent obesity and Type 2 diabetes, and \"Message of Hope: We Can Prevent Diabetes in Native American Communities.\" Members of the Gila River Indian Tribe participated in this effort. Research on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus- Gila River Indian Reservation This agreement employs local or area personnel to serve as coordinators, recruiters, interpreters, clerks, receptionists, technicians, and medical personnel to assist NIDDK personnel in the conduct of a comprehensive study of the causes and complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Pima Indian population on the Gila River Indian Reservation, other Indian reservations in the Phoenix Area office jurisdiction, and the Phoenix Indian Medical Center (PIMC). Protecting the Health of Future Generations: Assessing and Preventing Exposures National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences This CBPR project investigates exposures to two classes of emerging endocrine- disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with the Yupik people of St. Lawrence Island (SLI) in the Alaskan Arctic. The purpose of this project is to initiate research partnerships that work in collaboration with the two Yupik villages of SLI to assess multiple exposure routes of two emerging EDCs -polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated compounds will assess exposures to PBDEs and PFCs in surface waters through analyses of contaminant levels and biomarkers for xenobiotic chemicals in the threespine stickleback fish. The research team will also analyze household dust for PBDEs and PFCs. Air Pollution Outreach, Education, and Research Capacity -Building in Alaska Natives In collaboration with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC), researchers will implement the Air Toxics Under the Big Sky program in seven AN villages to educate the communities on the importance of good indoor air quality. As the program evolves, it will support the communities to identify community -specific air pollution issues of importance and to characterize respiratory disease within the communities. In the future, intervention type strategies will be identified and implemented within each of the communities to mitigate the identified air pollution problems and improve respiratory health among the AN populations. Applying Toxicogenomics and Biomolecular Technologies to Environmental Monitoring, Risk Assessment, and Bioremediation (University of San Diego Superfund Research Center) Biomarkers developed by UCSD Superfund Research Program scientists are being evaluated, in partnership with tribal labs, for environmental monitoring of water quality. Biomarkers can be used as effective tools for detecting Superfund toxicants in contaminated watersheds. Important gaps persist in tribal institutional capacity to access the most effective technologies to protect the environment and human health. Work ing in close partnership with the 29 Palms Band of Mission Indians, the UCSD Research Translation Core completed the transfer of a tried-and-true biomolecular assay for dioxin- screening. This effort serves as an effective model for building the institutional capacity of tribes to utilize cutting -edge molecular assays developed by UCSD Superfund Research. 2011 HHS Divisions 194 Environmental Health and Justice in Norton Sound, Alaska The purpose of this project is to work in partnership with fifteen communities in the Norton Sound region of Alaska to find effective means to limit the release of, and mitigate the human health effects of, contaminants in the natural environment. The majority of the residents of these villages are Inupiat and Yupik, indigenous people who depend on the harvest of wild foods to sustain them and their ways of life. The collaborative work includes constructing a database of information regarding formerly used defense sites (FUDS) in the region and the contaminants found at these sites. Researchers are working with village leaders to provide training to oversee FUDS clean- up work and establish independent monitoring programs for contaminants.

In-depth descriptions about all projects of the aforementioned Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program and the PAF grantees can be found on the Office of Adolescent Health website at http ://www.hhs.gov/ash/oah/oah - initiatives. AGENCY TRIBAL TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP The HHS AI/AN Health Research Advisory Council (HRAC) was established to provide HHS a vehicle for consulting with Tribes about health research priorities and needs in AI/AN communities, and collaborative approaches in addressing these issues and needs. The HRAC is comprised of elected Tribal officials from each of the 12 Indian Health Service areas, and four National At -Large Members. Federal partners participate in Council activities by providing input and support, and linkages with HHS's operating and staff divisions. The HRAC held a face- to-face meeting on October 7, 2010, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The first annual HRAC Research Roundtable was held October 21, 2010, on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The HRAC held teleconference calls with Tribal delegates and Federal partners on January 18, 2011 and May 12, 2011. The second HRAC meeting was held on June 27, 2011, in Niagara Falls, New York, in conjunction with the Annual Native Health Research Conference. The HRAC provided the Secretary's Tribal Advisory Council with an overview of HRAC and its priorities during the March 2, 2011, meeting and then presented testimony at the 13 th Annual National Tribal Budget Consultation on March 3- 4, 2011. HRAC members participated in the Annual Native Health Research Conference as well as the Indian Health Service Roundtable in Niagara Falls, New York. The HRAC was also represented during a panel presentation at the National Indian Health Board's Annual Consumer Conference in Anchorage, Alaska in September 2011. These outreach opportunities allow the HRAC to receive feedback on research priorities and issues that the HRAC can utilize as it prov ides recommendations to HHS. The HRAC developed an Annual HRAC Report, which provides a summary of HRAC's activities and priorities for the year. In addition, the HRAC produced an Annual Health Research Report, a compilation of findings from HHS related to important health research topics in AI/AN communities as well as programs that have been established by Federal agencies to serve AI/ANs or minority populations. 2011 HHS Divisions 206 OASH The HRAC submitted recommendations to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on research issues including: The National Institutes of Health will develop a single Tribal consultation policy; National Children's Study oversample AI/AN populations and fund additional cohorts in Indian Country; HHS Data Council adopt an HHS wide Research Policy for Indian Country; HHS adopt agency wide minimum standards and requirements for a Tribal data sharing agreement; and research priorities on quantification of chronic disease prevalence, mental health/suicide prevention, methamphetamine and other drugs prevalence and prevention, intentional and unintentional injuries, hypertension, stroke prevalence/prevention, auto immune disorders, health services, and evaluation of emerging technology. The HRAC Co -Chairs met with the NIH Director, Dr. Francis Collins, to discuss the HRAC recommendations and then followed up discussions with the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Director, Dr. John Ruffin. The HRAC has tentatively scheduled a face- to-face meeting on July 16, 2012 in Seattle, WA in conjunction with the Annual Native Health Research Conference and an HRAC Research Roundtable on November 15, 2012 in Bethesda, MD. 2011 HHS Divisions 207 United States Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services (SAMHSA) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has established a clear vision for its work \u2014a life in the community for everyone. To realize this vision, the Agency has sharply focused its mission on building resilience and facilitating recovery for people with or at risk for mental or substance use disorders. Prevention Works ... Treatment is Effective... People Recover. Mission: To reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on America's communities . To achieve this missi on SAMHSA has 8 Strategic Initiatives that will guide the agency's work. They are: 1. Prevention of Substance Abuse and Mental Illness 2. Trauma & Justice 3. Military Families - Active, Guard, Reserve, and Veteran 4. Health Reform 5. Recovery Support 6. Health Information T echnology for Behavioral Health Providers 7. Data, Outcomes, and Quality -Demonstrating Results 8. Public Awareness and Support Organization SAMHSA's core functions are to administer discretionary, formula, and block grant programs; and provide up- to-date information on behavioral health issues and prevention and treatment approaches. This work is achieved through the following Centers: 1. Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) 2. Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) 3. Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) 4. Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) Contact Information Pamela S. Hyde, J.D. : Administrator Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Intradepartmental Council on Native American Affairs Liaison: Sheila K. Cooper Senior Advisor for Tribal Affairs Website : http://www.samhsa.gov Tribal Consultation Policy: Yes 2011 HHS Divisions 208 HIGHLIGHTS OF DIVISION SPECIFIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS/ACTIVITIES Behavioral Health - Tribal Prevention Grant (BH -TPG) The Administration's budget proposal for FY 2012 includes the Behavioral Health - Tribal Prevention Grant (BH -TPG) administered by SAMHSA. The proposal for the BH -TPG emerged from SAMHSA's participation in HHS national and regional Tribal consultation, in SA MHSA - specific Tribal consultation sessions, and from Tribal leaders' identifying services and resources that would improve behavioral health in Indian Country. The BH -TPG represents a significant advance in the Nation's approach to substance abuse and suicide prevention, based in recognition of behavioral health as a part of overall health. The program will focus on the prevention of alcohol abuse, substance abuse and suicides in the 565 federally -recognized Tribes. Recognizing the Federal obligation to help Tribes deal with physical and behavioral health issues, SAMHSA will work in consultation with Tribes, establishing a single coordinated mental health and substance abuse program for all federally -recognized Tribes. BH-TPG would be non- competitive funding to prevent substance abuse and suicide for every federally - recognized Tribe. SAMHSA consulted with Tribes on the design of the program and on a distribution formula for funds available beyond a base award of $50,000. The program would provide flexibility to appropriately allow for Tribal self -governance. The final program requirements would be determined based on additional Tribal consultation. Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) Implementation The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA) was signed into law on July 29, 2010 and included several important provisions to improve public safety and address behavioral health issues. As a result, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Attorney General, recently signed a MOA to, among other things: 1. Determine the scope of the alcohol and substance abuse problems faced by American Indians and Alaska Natives; 2. Identify the resources and programs of each agency that would be relevant to a coordinated effort to combat alcohol and substance abuse among American Indians and Alaska Natives; and 3. Coordinate existing agency programs with those established under the Act. To accomplish the above stated goals, SAMHSA sought to establish an Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee (IASA Committee) to include key agency representation from SAMHSA, Indian Health Service (IHS), Office of Justice Programs, Office of Tribal Justice, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education, and the Department of Education. To date, the IASA Committee is also represented by the Administration on Aging and Administration for Children and Families within HHS. The IASA Committee has created an organizational structure to include workgroups to carry out its work. TLOA created within SAMHSA an Office of Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse to improve coordination among Federal agencies carrying out the Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and a framework for interagency and Tribal coordination was developed that established the roles and responsibilities of the Federal agencies and sets the foundation for further implementation of the TLOA. The work of the new Office of Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse will help inform the Administration's National Drug Control Strategy as overseen and coordinated by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Office of Indian Alcohol and Substance Abuse (OIASA) SAMHSA established the OIASA in the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, to take the lead in coordinating Federal agencies and departments in leveraging their expertise, programs, 2011 HHS Divisions 209 services, and resources addressing substance abuse in Indian country, as required under the Tribal Law and Order Act. During the period October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2011, OIASA worked with TLOA partner agencies in creating an organizational structure under a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to guide their collaborations under TLOA; established five workgroups to address key TLOA activities including guidance for Tribal Action Plans, an inventory of federal resources for Indian country, and a newsletter through which to communicate with AI/AN communities; and established a Web site ( www.samhsa.gov/tloa/ ) as a central sourc e for information on Federal resources and information for AI/AN substance abuse prevention and treatment issues. SAMHSA joined other TLOA partner agencies in preparing and mailing a Deal Tribal Leader letter, including hard copies of the MOA and the relevant sections of the TLOA, to all Federally recognized Tribes on August 4, 2011. The OIASA staff and TLOA partners conducted 14 outreach presentations to keep Indian country and the prevention field informed of TLOA progress, and participated in several tribal consultations and listening sessions in preparation for these TLOA responsibilities: a. Attended, presented and participated in several consultation/listening sessions in partnership with BIA, OJP, OTJ and IHS as well as at the Tribal Justice Safety Wel lness sessions (TJSW): between September and December 2010 b. Formal consultation on MOA and TAP: December 8, 2010 c. Formal consultation on Detention Planning (DOJ/DOI) and other TLOA activities: May 8, 2011 Uniform Block Grant Application On July 26, SAMHSA a nnounced a new application process for its major block grant programs -- the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant and the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant (MHBG). The change is designed to provide States greater flexibility to allocate resources for substance abuse and mental illness prevention, treatment and recovery services in their communities. One of the key changes to the block grant application is the expectation that States will provide a description of their tribal cons ultation activities. Specifically, the new application's planning sections note that States with federally -recognized Tribal governments or Tribal lands within their borders will be expected to show evidence of Tribal consultation as part of their Block Grant planning processes. However, Tribal governments shall not be required to waive sovereign immunity as a condition of receiving Block Grant funds or services. Included within the MHBG application SAMHSA notes that States should identify strategies for the MHBG that reflect the priorities identified from the needs assessment process. Goals that are focused on emotional health and the prevention of mental illnesses should be consistent with the IOM Report on Preventing Mental, Emotional, and Behavioral Disorders. More specifically, they also should include Strategies that implement suicide prevention activities to identify youth at risk of suicide and improve the effectiveness of services and support available to them, including educating frontline workers in emergency, health and other social services settings about mental health and suicide prevention. Finally, the uniform application requests that States attach to the Block Grant application(s) the most recent copy of the State's suicide prevention plan. It notes that if the State does not have a suicide prevention plan or if it has not been updated in the past 3 years, the State should describe when it will create or update its plan. The SAMHSA Military Families Strategic Initiative The Service Sys tem's Development Program hosted a Tribal Partnership Summit, September 21-22, 2011, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Summit was designed to provide technical assistance 2011 HHS Divisions 210 and support to States collaborating with Tribes and Tribal communities in their efforts t o strengthening the behavioral health systems serving Service Members, Veterans, and their Families (SMVF). The Summit included 51 participants from six States including, Arizona, California, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Utah, and Washington. State Team Leaders identified State teams of six delegates comprised of three Tribal participants who influence behavioral health policy for SMVF, as well as three State team members. State delegations included department heads from mental health, substance abuse, children and families, Indian services, and Veterans Affairs as well as leaders/liaisons from several Tribal nations including the Lumbee, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Suquamish, Spokane, and Quileute. The goals of the Tribal Summit were to provide TA focusing on: 4. Developing practical strategies for promoting State behavioral health system partnerships with Tribal communities in supporting the recovery, resiliency, and readiness of SMVF. 5. Linking Tribal leaders with State resources for improving outreach and engagement for Tribal SMVF. 6. Implementing promising, best, and evidence- based practices among military, civilian, and Tribal entities for strengthening behavioral health systems. The Project LAUNCH (Linking Actions for Unmet Needs in Children's Health) Tribal technic al assistance specialist worked with the New Mexico State -level leadership to help them successfully connect with a number of Tribes and pueblos in order to increase the use of social/emotional and developmental screenings for young children. These partne rships led to trainings and the distribution of screening materials within several Tribal communities. Tribal Portfolio American Indian/Alaska Native youth experience disproportionately high rates of violent victimization; substance abuse and dependence; and suicide. Recognizing these serious issues, SAMHSA administers a variety of programs that serve Tribal youth. In FY 2010, SAMHSA granted 104 awards to Tribes and Tribal Organizations for a total of $68,120,563. In FY 2011, SAMHSA granted 103 awards to Tribes and Tribal Organizations for a total of $71,065,895. Regional Staff For the first time in its history, SAMHSA now has a presence in each of the 10 HHS Regional Offices. This new configuration of SAMHSA staff will help ensure that a voice for behavioral health is present in the regions along with all of the other HHS operating divisions. The Regional Administrators will help SAMHSA reach out to and provide information for States, Territories, Tribes, providers, communities and other stakeholders about funding opportunities, Federal policies affecting them, or disaster preparedness and response. They will also make it easier for SAMHSA to collaborate with other HHS colleagues in the regional offices and be better informed about behavioral health needs throughout the country. This staff configuration will help SAMHSA be more effective in accomplishing its mission of reducing the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on America's communities. National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention On September 10, 2010, the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (NAASP) was launched by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, and former Defense Secretary, Robert Gates. The NAASP has a private sector Co- Chair, former U.S. Senator Gordon Smith (R -OR), and a public sector Co -Chair, Army Secretary John McHugh. Members of the NAASP include, but are not limited to, the Surgeon General, Regina 2011 HHS Divisions 211 Benjamin; the SAMHSA Administrator, Pamela S. Hyde; Department of Interior Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, Larry Echo Hawk; HHS Assistant Secretary for Health, Dr. Howard Koh; and National Indian Youth Leadership Project Executive Director, McClellan Hall. In addition, the IHS Director, Dr. Yvette Roubideaux, serves as an ex officio Member of NAASP. Mr. Echo Hawk, Mr. Hall and Dr. Roubideaux serve as the leaders of the NAASP AI/AN Task Force which will establish specific priorities for Tribal youth regarding suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention strategies, including positive youth development. The Task Force also helped develop the agenda and strategy for the National Suicide Prevention Summit and will also do so for the Alaska Suicide Prevention Summit for AI/AN communities, leaders, service providers, educators, and law enforcement. Action Summits for Suicide Prevention Between November 2010 and February 2011, SAMHSA, IHS, and the Department of the Interior jointly conducted a series of ten Tribal listening sessions across Indian Country on suicide prevention to gather information on Tribal needs. The input shaped the theme and agenda for two Action Summits for Suicide Prevention. The first Action Summit was held in Phoenix and the second was held in Anchorage. The Action Summits emphasized an action oriented approach and brought together nationally recognized speakers, behavioral health providers, Tribal leaders, health care providers, first responders, and many others to develop and strengthen new or existing collaborations, gather information on best and promising practices, collect information on the most up -to-date research on suicide and substance abuse prevention, intervention, and aftercare, and share personal experiences in addressing suicide and substance abuse in Indian Country. The Action Summit themes focused on the importance of collaboration among Tribal, Federal, State, and community - and program -level leadership to promote AI/AN behavioral health. Compiled feedback from the Action Summits will form the next steps for future age ncy collaboration. Using Art to Raise Awareness Around Behavioral Health On March 8, SAMHSA unveiled a painting by artist Sam English, Turtle Mountain Band and Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, which was commissioned to help raise awareness about the roles of families and the community in mental and substance use disorder prevention. Mr. English was specifically chosen for this work because of his familiarity with the prevention and recovery populations. During the unveiling ceremony, Mr. English shared his history with alcohol and his 30 years of sobriety and how he uses art as a healing process. The art work hangs in the main foyer, 8 th floor, of the SAMHSA Building. TRIBAL DELEGATION MEETINGS HHS Annual Tribal Budget, HHS Regional and SAMHSA Specific Consultation The goal of SAMHSA's participation in Tribal Consultation includes, but is not limited to, eliminating behavioral health disparities of Indians, ensuring that access to critical behavioral health resources and services is maximized, and to advance or enhance the social, physical, and economic status of Indians. To achieve this goal, and to the extent practicable and permitted by law, it is essential that federally -recognized Indian Tribes and SAMHSA engage in open, continuous, and meaningful consultation. In addition to Administrator Hyde, SAMHSA senior leadership participated in Tribal consultation sessions. The BH -TPG and the TLOA Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and TLOA Tribal Action Plans were consultation items discussed at each Regional Consultation session. In August, the signed MOA and supporting documents were mailed to all 565 Tribal Leaders. 2011 HHS Divisions 212 SAMHSA Meetings Tribal Justice, Safety and Wellness Sessions (TJSW) In response to Tribal Leaders, Tribal Representatives and Tribal Organizations request, SAMHSA and DOJ have partnered with other Federal agencies to address cross -cutting issues and to continue joint Federal efforts to conduct consultation, training, and technical assistance sessions to help address issues of concern facing AI/AN communities. The sessions bring together elected Tribal leaders and key policy decision makers, Tribal administrators, executive directors, finance and grant administration officers, Tribal planners, grant writers, justice and law enforcement personnel, Tribal program project coordinators, and grantee officers. TJSW sessions were held at Palm Springs in December and at Phoenix in May. Navajo Disaster Behavioral Health Plan The SAMHSA Disaster Technical Assistance Center (DTAC) is planning a 2- day meeting for the Navajo Nation Emergency Mutual Aid Compact (NNEMAC) Work Group. The DTAC will facilitate the discussion on drafting the Navajo Nation Disaster Behavioral Health (DBH) Plan. During the October meeting, the director of the Navajo Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), behavioral health staff, including spiritual leaders and traditional healers, will draft the DBH plan for the Navajo Nation. The NNEMAC work group includes Navajo Nation professionals, emergency first responders, division directors, managers, and elected officials who are developing a Navajo Nation- wide emergency management framework that enables all response partners to prepare for and provide a unified response to disasters and emergencies. During the 2- day meeting, the NNEMAC workgroup will discuss the Navajo Nation Response Framework and will also hold a workgroup session to discuss the DBH planning process. DTAC will be assisting in facilitating pre -meeting conference calls, facilitation during the 2- day meeting, and assessing for possible training needs of behavioral health and emergency management staff. The October session is a result of a DTAC presentation in June to the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona in conjunction with the NNEMAC. In addition, DTAC has been exploring data collection with several Tribal communities and there is favorable Tribal interest in SAMHSA conducting a disaster behavioral health needs assessment. AGENCY TRIBAL TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP TTAC Meeting, March 23, Rockville, MD. SAMHSA has six standing committees and on March 22, for the first time, all six committees, including the TTAC, came together for a Joint Committees Meeting. The Joint Committees Meeting provides an opportunity for the committee members to meet, share their committee involve ment and find common ground. It also gives SAMHSA an opportunity to present information to all committees with an immediate ability to address questions and clarify information. The Joint Committees Meeting includes presentations on the Federal budget (current and future), progress on SAMHSA's Strategic Initiatives, and on special topics such as women's issues, defining recovery, or quality data collection. The TTAC membership held their committee meeting the day following the Joint Committees meeting which provided an opportunity to discuss the topics presented the previous day and the relevance or impact to Tribes. A new chair, Julia Davis -Wheeler, Nez Perce Tribe and co -chair, Andy Joseph Jr, Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation were elected during this meeting. TTAC Meeting, August 15, Rockville, MD. The TTAC met prior to the Joint Committees Meeting and the meeting served as an orientation session since several new members had joined within the past year. 2011 HHS Divisions 213 AGENCY TRIBAL CONSULTATION POLICY The SAMHSA Tribal Consultation Policy was last updated on March 2, 2007. The SAMHSA TCP has been re- written to reflect and align with the 2010 HHS TCP and will be available for public comment by the end of 2011 2011 Tribal Consultation Report 214 ICNAA United States Department of Health a nd Human Services Intradepartmental Council on Native American Affairs (ICNAA) The Intradepartmental Council on Native American Affairs (ICNAA), authorized by the Native American Programs Act of 1974 (42USC2991), as amended, serves as the focal point within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for coordination and consultation on health and human services issues affecting the American Indian, Alaska Native and Native American (AI/AN/NA) population, which includes more than 560 federally recognized tribes, approximately 60 tribes that are state recognized or seeking federal recognition, Indian organizations, Native Hawaiian communities, and Native American Pacific Islanders, including Native Samoans. It brings together HHS leadership to ensure consistency on policy affecting American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Americans, and to maximize limited resources. The major functions of the ICNAA are to: Develop & promote HHS policy that provides greater access; Assist in the Tribal Consultation process; Develop both short term & long term strategic plans; Promote self -sufficiency and self -determination; Develop legislative, administrative, and regulatory proposals to benefit Native Americans; and Promote the Government -to-Government relationship as reaffirmed by the President Membership The ICNAA membership consists of each of the HHS Operating Divisions heads, Staff Division heads, the Director, Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs, the Director, Center for Faith- Based and Community Initiatives, the Executive Secretary to the Department, and two HHS regional representatives. Direction and Oversight The ICNAA is located in the Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs (IEA), Immediate Office of the Secretary and provides executive direction and coordination with the Council Chairperson on all Council activities 2011 Tribal Consultation Report 215 ICNAA The Commissioner, Administration for Native Americans (ANA), is the Chairperson and the Director, Indian Health Service (IHS) is the Vice- Chairperson. The Chairper son is charged with the overall direction of the Council and shall preside over all Council activities, including Council meetings and Executive Committee meetings. The Executive Committee, comprised of the Chairperson and Vice- Chairperson, the Assistant Secretaries for Children and Families, Aging, Health, and Resource and Technology and the IEA Director, is authorized to act on behalf of the Council, and is responsible for overseeing Council functions and recommending subjects and actions for consideration by the full Council. Management and Administration IEA's Principal Advisor on Tribal Affairs serves as the principal management officer for all Council functions, including management and administration of Council activities, the administration of fun ds provided for Council activities, and in consultation with the Executive Committee, preparation of agendas for Council meetings, and maintaining records of Council business, including minutes from Council meetings. The Principal Advisor is the primary l iaison between Council members, and other Federal agencies, and reports directly to the Council Chairperson and Vice- Chairperson. The Council meets no less than twice a year. At least one Council tribal liaison has been appointed by each ICNAA member to work with IEA on special projects, and on the implementation of Secretarial initiatives and policies affecting AI/AN/NAs. A key element of the Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs (IEA) mission is to facilitate communication regarding health and human services (HHS) initiatives as they relate to state, local, and tribal governments. The Office of Tribal Affairs within IEA coordinates and manages IEA's tribal and native policy issues, assists tribes in navigating through HHS programs and service s, and coordinates the Secretary's policy development for tribes and national native organizations. The ten Regional Offices housed in IEA are one of the key components in the ongoing relationship building HHS has with all the federally recognized tribes in the United States. The ten Regional Offices (ORD) are the lead organizers of the annual regional tribal consultations. In this responsibility the ORD in conjunction with the tribal leaders in their respective region plan, coordinate, and conduct consultation meetings. At these meetings the tribal leaders meet with HHS Regional Operating Division staff as well as HHS headquarters leadership to discuss policy changes that impact their respective tribal community. This true government -to-government conversation reaffirms and promotes the sustaining relationships the ORD has with the tribal leaders. Throughout the year, the ORD continues these exchanges and addresses all the ICNAA priorities. ORD bi -monthly report document this activity, but the constant and consistent interaction the ORD has with the tribal leaders cannot be overlooked. The meetings, phone calls, and emails, though too numerous to list; represent the groundwork of the relationship that the ORD has with the tribes. The ORD and the work of ICNAA go hand in hand. The tribal consultations and the daily connections with tribal leaders allow the ORD to deepen the connections with Indian Country. Status and Activities Tribal consultation activities across HHS, is an ICNAA priority and is required by Presidential Order 13175. The annual two day HHS Tribal Budget Consultation sessions as well as the regional HHS Tribal consultations have proven to be very successful in assuring that AI/AN 2011 Tribal Consultation Report 216 ICNAA communities have an opportunity to communicate their health and human services needs and priorities to high level HHS officials. Although, the Indian Health Service serves as the main conduit for the provision of federally supported health care for federally recognized tribal nations, this responsibility is shared with all HHS agencies because of the overarching government to government relationship between the federal government and the 565 tribal nations. ICNAA serves to support this relationship across all of HHS which fosters a more meaningful provision of health and human services for AI/AN/NA communities. Accomplishments are expected to continue in order that more HHS resources are made available to AI/AN/NAs communities by analyzing and instituting the next level of recommendations of the Barriers Study; to continue to support HHS -wide tribal consultation; support new initiatives and to continue to serve as the HHS focal point for Native American health and human services. The 2011 priorities of the Council were: 1. Access and Availability 2. Outreach and Technical Assistance 3. Grants Eligibility Review 4. Expansion of Services (Self Governance Expansion) Access and Availability The ICNAA worked to develop, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive initiative to increase Tribal accessibility to HHS Federal Financial Assistance Programs. The following activities were completed to increase access and availability: The Grants Forecast Tool has been updated to highlight Tribal eligibility where it is explicitly known. There are specifically 55 records that show Native American / Tribal Organizations as eligible entities. The ICNAA will send out notices to each of the program offices alerting the broader community and encouraging them to continue to make these opportunities explicitly state where Tribes are eligible. We will also ask them to continue to work with their respective OGC where their statue is silent, in light of the ICNAA's activities. An awareness training was conducted on December 6th, 2011 to HHS OPDIV grants and program officials to offer ways to i mprove Tribal access. The \"Supporting Tribal Access to Grants\" workshop was held and included strategies for partnering with the Office of Grants Policy Oversight, and Evaluation to assist in bridging barriers to obtaining maximum grant funding opportunities for Tribal governments. This training aimed to increase the Tribes' ability to complete the life cycle of a grant. 200 grants and program officials from across the Department attended the training. Evaluations were given following the training and fol low up evaluations will be conducted at the six month and one year marks. Outreach and Technical Assistance The ICNAA worked to address outreach and technical assistance issues. The following activities were completed to improve outreach and technical assistance throughout the Department: In order to formulate next steps to improve our outreach to Native Americans, the ICNAA needed to first understand the extent and depth of the technical assistance that HHS currently provides. The ICNAA developed a survey document to query each of the operating divisions within the Department on whether or not they provide technical 2011 Tribal Consultation Report 217 ICNAA assistance to potential applicants and grantees and the kind of technical assistance they provide. The survey consisted of approximately 20 questions. Results were analyzed and next steps are being determined. Grants Eligibility Review The ICNAA worked to determine the funding opportunities, for which Tribes are eligible, so Tribes and HHS can identify priorities for technical assistance on application processes. In this process the ICNAA will also determine the funding opportunities, for which Tribes are not eligible, identify the nature of the barrier, so that HHS and Tribes can identify priorities and develop options to reduce them. Each operating division has identified funding opportunities for which Tribes are eligible or ineligible Where Tribes have been determined as ineligible, the nature of the barrier (law, regulations, policy/program instruction, other) has been identified Next steps include gathering feedback from the Secretary's Tribal Advisory Committee on determining priorities for policy or regulation change Expansion of Services and Pilot Development (Self Governance Expansion) The ICNAA worked to determine what self governance expansion would look like at the Department of Health and Human Services. Activities in 2011 inlcuded: Reviewed the previously completed HHS feasibility study on the expansion of Tribal Self governance to other parts of HHS. We then posed two que stions: 1) Did any HHS programs have existing legislative or regulatory authority that would allow for a demonstration project as proposed by the feasibility study under Title VI of the Indian Self Determination and Educational Assistance Act (ISDEAA)?; and 2) If not, does any existing program have authority to permit a demonstration project that would allow tribes more flexibility and authority over their decision- making? Held a series of detailed conversations to solicit the thoughts and feedback of Tribal Leaders and self governance experts Developed a list of questions to help HHS move forward with understanding from the Tribes more about expansion of services. In late October, the department sent Tribal leaders a letter regarding the status of Self Governance within HHS, to request Tribal input on self -governance expansion, announce two education sessions, as well as to solicit nominations for a Tribal Federal Workgroup The first education session was held November 30 th in Washington, DC and the second was held on December 13th in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Nominations for the Tribal Federal Workgroup were received and members were selected and notified of their selection The first meeting of the Tribal Federal Workgroup is set to occur on February 2, 2012 Plans for 2012 The Council met in December 2011 to address the Council activities and plans for this upcoming year. The ICNAA Leadership charged HHS to continue progressing with the priorities identified in 2011. In addition to continuing the work on the priorities of 2011, improving Tribal/State relations has been included as a new ini tiative of focus for the ICNAA. 218 United States Department of Health and Human Services APPENDICES Appendix I 219 HHS Tribal Budget U.S. Department of Health & Human Services 2011 Annual Tribal Consultation Report APPENDIX I HHS TRIB AL BUDGET HHS Tribal Resource Trends FY 20 11 - 2013 (Dollars in millions) Fiscal Year 57005800590060006100620063006400 FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Appendix I 220 HHS Tribal Budget FY 2011- 2013 HHS FUNDING FOR AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES (dollars in millions) Program FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Administration For (ACF): Native American Programs...................................... 48.7 Assistance Program....... 53.4 38.5 31.4 -7.1 Child Care & Development Block Grant.................... 44.5 45.6 46.1 +0.5 Child Care Entitlement............................................. 58.3 58.3 68.3 -2/ 13.0 13.0 13.5 +0.5 Developmental Disabilities........................................ 0.2 0.2 0.2 -- Community Servic es Block Grant ............................. 4.9 2.5 - 2.5 Community -Based Child Abuse Prevention................ 0.4 0.4 0.4 -- Promoting Safe and Stable Families ......................... 11.7 12.0 12.0 -- Tribal TANF Grants................................................. 181.7 Healthy Marriage Promotion and Responsible Fatherhood (Tribal TANF - Child Welfare Coordination) 1.5 1.5 1.5 -- Tribal Work Programs.............................................. 7.6 7.6 7.6 -- Tribal Child Support................................................. 42.0 35.0 42.0 +7.0 Child Welfare Services (I V-B)................................. 6.2 5.1 2.2 -2.9 Foster Care (Title IV and Services Administration: Health Centers - Native HI Program 14.2 14.2 14.2 -- Centers of Execellence............................................ 1.2 1.1 1.1 -- Health Careers Opportunity Program.......... .............. 0.9 0.6 -- - 0.6 Patient Navigator and Chronic Disease Prevention..... 5.0 -- -- -- Appendix I 221 HHS Tribal Budget Program FY 2011 FY -0.6 Administration on Aging: Native American Caregiver Support Program............ 6.4 6.4 6.4 -- NSIP (Title VI)....................................................... 3.2 3.2 3.2 -- Native American Elder Rights (APS)........................ -- -- 1.0 +1.0 National Resource Centers on Native Americans....... 0.7 0.7 0.7 -- National Minority Aging Organizations: Native Americans 0.1 0.1 0.1 -- Native American Nutrition and Supportive Services... 27.7 27.6 27.6 -- Subtotal, AoA............................................. ........ 38.0 38.0 39.0 +1.0 Centers For Disease Control and Prevention: Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant... 0.1 -- -- -- Local ST D screening and treatment.......................... 1.6 1.6 1.6 -- Subtotal, CDC.................................................... 1.7 1.6 1.6 -- Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA): Mental Health Programs of Regional and National Significance........ 5.9 5.1 5.1 -- Children's Mental Health Services............................. 8.9 8.2 8.2 -- Protection and Advocacy......................................... 0.2 0.2 0.2 -- Health Surveillance and Program Support -- Behavioral Health - Tribal Prevention Grant.............. -- -- 40.0 +40.0 Subs tance Abuse Treatment -- Substance Abuse Block Grant.................................. 0.6 0.5 0.5 -- Subtotal, SAMHSA............................................ 15.6 Includes insurance collections, rental of staff quarters and mandatory diabetes funding.

PU RPOSE The U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Indian Tribes share the goal to establish clear policies to further the government -to-government relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes. True and effective consultation shall result in information exchange, mutual understanding, and informed decision- making on behalf of the Tribal governments involved and the Federal Government. The importance of consultation with Indian Tribes was affirmed through Presidential Memoranda in 1994, 2004 and 2009, and an Executive Order (EO) in 2000. Appendix II 223 Tribal Consultation Policy The goal of this policy includes, but is not limited to, eliminating health and human service disparities of Indians, ensuring that access to critical health and human services is maximized, and to advance or enhance the social, physical, and economic status of Indians. To achieve this goal, and to the extent practicable and permitted by law, it is essential that Federally -recognized Indian Tribes and the HHS engage in open, continuous, and meaningful consultation. This policy applies to all Divisions of the Department and shall serve as a guide for Tribes to participate in all Department and Division policy development to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law. 5. BAC KGRO UND Since t he formation of the Union, the United States (U.S.) has recognized Indian Tribes as sovereign nations. A unique government -to-government relationship exists between Indian Tribes and the Federal Government. This relationship is grounded in the U.S. Constitution, numerous treaties, statutes, Federal case law, regulations and executive orders that establish and define a trust relationship with Indian Tribes. This relationship is derived from the political and legal relationship that Indian Tri bes have with the Federal Government and is not based upon race. An integral element of this government -to-government relationship is that consultation occurs with Indian Tribes. The Executive Memorandum titled \"Tribal Consultation\" reaffirmed this government -to-government relationship with Indian Tribes on November 5, 2009. The implementation of this policy is in recognition of this special relationship. This special relationship is affirmed in statutes and various Presidential Executive Orders including, but not limited to: Older Americans Act, P.L. 89 -73, as amended; Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act, P.L. 93- 638, as amended; Native American Programs Act, P.L. 93 -644, as amended; Indian Health Care Improvement Act, P.L. 94- 437, as amended; Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, P.L.104- 193; Presidential Executive Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments dated April 29, 1994; Presidential Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, November 6, 2000; and Presidential Memorandum, Government -to-Government Relationship with Tribal Governments, September 23, 2004 Presidential Memorandum, Tribal Consultation, November 5, 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, P.L. 111- 5, 123 Stat. 115 (Feb. 17, 2009). Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009, P.L. 111- 3, 123 Stat. 8 (Feb. 4, 2009). Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, P.L. 111- 148, 124 Stat. 119 (Mar. 23, 2010). Appendix II 224 Tribal Consultation Policy 6. TR IBAL SOVEREIGNTY This policy does not waive any Tribal Governmental rights and authority, including treaty rights, sovereign immunities or jurisdiction. Additionally, this policy does not diminish any rights or protections afforded other American Indians or Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) or entities under Federal law. The special government -to-government relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, established in 1787, is based on the Constitution, and has been given form and substance by numerous treaties, laws, Supreme Court decisions, and Executive Orders, and reaffirms the right of Indian Tribes to self -government and self - determination. Indian Tribes exercise inherent sovereign powers over their citizens and territory. The U.S. shall continue to work with Indian Tribes on a government -to- government basis to address issues concerning Tribal self -government, Tribal trust resources, Tribal treaties and other rights. Tribal self -government has been demonstrated to improve and perpetuate the government -to-government relationship and strengthen Tribal control over Federal funding that it receives, and its internal program management. Indian Tribes participation in the development of public health and human services policy ensures locally relevant and culturally appropriate approaches to public issues. 7. POLICY Before any action is taken that will significantly affect Indian Tribes it is the HHS policy that, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, consultation with Indian Tr ibes will occur. Such actions refer to policies that: 1. Have Tribal implications, and 2. Have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian Tribes, or 3. On the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes, or 4. On the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes. Nothing in this policy waives the Government's deliberative process privilege. Examples of the government's deliberative process privilege are as follows: 1. The Department is specifically requested by Members of Congress to respond to or report on proposed legislation, the development of such responses and of related policy is a part of the Executive Branch's deliberative process privilege and should remain confidential. 2. In specified instances Congress requires the Department to work with Indian Tribes on the development of recommendations that may require legislation, such reports, recommendations or other products are developed independent of a Department position, the development of which is governed by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-19. Appendix II 225 Tribal Consultation Policy A. Each HHS Operating and Staff Division (Division) shall have an accountable process as defined in Sections 8 and 9 of this policy to ensure meaningful and timely input by Indian Tribes in the development of policies that have Tribal implications. If Divisions require technical assistance in implementing these sections, the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA) can provide and/or coordinate assistance. B. To the extent practicable and permitted by law, no Division shall promulgate any regulation that has Tribal implications, or that imposes substantial direct compliance costs on Indian Tribes, or that is not required by statute, unless: 1. Funds necessary to pay the direct costs incurred by the Indian Tribe in complying with the regulation are provided by the Federal Government; or 2. The Division, prior to the formal promulgation of the regulation, a. Consulted with Indian Tribes throughout all stages of the process of developing the proposed reg ulation; b. Provided a Tribal summary impact statement in a separately identified portion of the preamble to the regulation as it is to be issued in the Federal Register (FR), which consists of a description of the extent of the Division's prior consultation with Indian Tribes, a summary of the nature of their concerns and the Division's position supporting the need to issue the regulation, and a statement of the extent to which the concerns of Tribal officials have been met; and c. Made available to the Secretary and to the Director of OMB any written communications submitted to the Division by Tribal officials. C. To the extent practicable and permitted by law, no Division shall promulgate any regulation that has Tribal implications and that preempts Tribal law unless the Division, prior to the formal promulgation of the regulation, 1. Consulted with Tribal officials throughout all stages of the process of developing the proposed regulation; 2. Provided a Tribal summary impact statement in a separately identified portion of the preamble to the regulation as it is to be issued in the FR, which consists of a description of the extent of the Division's prior consultation with Tribal officials, a summary of the nature of their concerns and the Division's position supporting the need to issue the regulation, and a statement of the extent to which the concerns of Tribal officials have been met; and 3. Made available to the Secretary any written communications submitted to the Division by Tribal officials. D. On issues relating to Tribal self -governance, Tribal self -determination, Tribal trust resources, or Tribal treaty and other rights, each Division shall make all practicable attempts where appropriate to use consensual mechanisms for developing regulations, including ne gotiated rulemaking. Appendix II 226 Tribal Consultation Policy 5. PHILOSOPHY I ndian Tribes have an inalienable and inherent right to self -government. Self -government means government in which decisions are made by the people who are most directly affected by the decisions. As sovereign nations, Indian Tribes exercise inherent sovereign powers over their members, territory and lands. HHS has a long -standing commitment to working on a government -to-government basis with Indian Tribes and to work in partnership with AI/ANs. Also, HHS is committed to enhancing the collaboration among its Divisions to address Tribal issues and promoting the principle that each Division bears responsibility for addressing Tribal issues within the context of their mission. IGA is identified as the responsible HHS entity, located in the Immediate Office of the Secretary (IOS) for monitoring compliance with EO 13175 and the Department Tribal Consultation Policy. In addition, the Secretary has charged the Intradepartmental Council on Native American Affairs (ICNAA) to meet regularly and no less then 2 times a year and to provide advice on all HHS policies that relate to Indian Tribes as well as instances where HHS activities relate to Native Americans. Regional consultation sessions have been developed as a systematic method to regularly consult with Indian Tribes on HHS programs at field locations. The goal of these efforts is to focus HHS on Tribal issues, to continue to enhance the government -to-government relationship between Indian Tribes and the U.S., as well as to make resources of HHS more readily available to Indian Tribes. 6. O BJECTIVES 4. To formalize the Administration's policy that HHS seek consultation and the participation of Indian Tribes in the development of policies and program activities that impact Indian Tribes. 5. To establish a minimum set of requirements and expectations with respect to consultation and participation throughout HHS management, the Office of the Secretary (OS) Division, and Regional levels. 6. The need to consult may be identified by the Department or by an Indian Tribe(s). Any time the Tribe(s) or the Department identifies a critical event the Department may initiate any necessary consultation in accordance with this policy. 7. To identify events and partnerships that HHS would participate with Indian Tr ibe(s) and Tribal/Indian Organizations that establish and foster partnerships with HHS which complement and enhance consultation with Indian Tribes. 8. To promote and develop innovative consultation methods with Indian Tribes in the development of HHS policy and regulatory processes. 9. To uphold the responsibility of HHS to consult with Indian Tribes on new and existing health and human service policies, programs, functions, services and activities that have Tribal implications. 10. To charge and hold accountable each of the HHS Operating Division Heads for the implementation of this policy. 11. To be responsive to requests by an Indian Tribe(s) request for consultation and technical assistance in obtaining HHS resources. 12. To charge the HHS Operating Divisions with the responsibility for enhancing partnerships with Indian Tribes which will include, requests for technical Appendix II 227 Tribal Consultation Policy assistance, access to programs and resources, as well as collaborating with Tribal subject matter expertise. 13. To provide a single point of contact within H HS and its Operating Divisions for Indian Tribes at the highest level which would have access to the IOS, the Deputy Secretary, and Operating Division Heads. The Principal Advisor for Tribal Affairs and the Division Tribal points of contact will be responsible for compliance with this policy and ensuring timeframes identified in section 9 are met. 7. CONSULTATION PARTICIPANTS AND ROLES 7. Indian Tribes: The government -to-government relationship between the U.S. and Federally recognized Indian Tribes dictates that the principal focus for HHS consultation is Indian Tribes, individually or collectively. 8. Indian Organizations: At times it is useful that the HHS communicate with Indian organizations to solicit Indian Tribe(s) advice and recommendations. The government does not participate in government -to-government consultations with these entities; rather these organizations represent the interest of Indian Tribes when authorized by those Tribes These organizations by the sheer nature of their business serve and advocate Indian Tribes issues and concerns that might be negatively affected if these organizations were excluded from the process. 9. Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA): IGA is responsible for Department - wide implementation and monitoring of EO 13175 for HHS Tribal consultation. IGA serves as the Department's point of contact in accessing department -wide information. The single point of contact within the IGA for Indian Tribes and other Tribal/Indian organizations, at a level with access to all HHS Divis ions, is the Principal Advisor for Tribal Affairs. As a part of the IOS, IGA's mission is to facilitate communication regarding HHS initiatives as they relate to Tribal, State, and local governments. IGA is the Departmental liaison to States and Indian Tribes, and serves the dual role of representing the States and Tribal perspective in the Federal policymaking process, as well as, clarifying the Federal perspective to States and Indian Tribes, including Tribal consultation. 10. Assistant Secretary for Finance and Resources (ASFR): ASFR is the lead office for budget consultation for the overall departmental budget request. 11. HHS Divisions: The Department has numerous Staff Divisions and Operating Divisions under its purview. Each of the these Divisions share in the Department -wide responsibility to coordinate, communicate and consult with Indian Tribes on issues that affect these governments. All Operating Divisions shall establish a Tribal consultation policy to comply with the HHS Policy. All Divisions are respon sible for conducting Tribal consultation to the extent practicable and permitted by law on policies that have Tribal implications. 12. Intradepartmental Council on Native American Affairs(ICNAA): The ICNAA is charged with: (1) develop and promote an HHS policy to provide greater access and quality services for AI/AN/NAs throughout the Department; (2) promote implementation of HHS policy and Division plans on consultation with Indian Tribes in accordance with statutes and EOs; (3) promote an effective, meaningful AI/AN/NA policy to improve health and human services for AI/AN/NAs; (4) develop a comprehensive Departmental strategy that promotes self-sufficiency and self -determination for all Indian Tribes and AI/AN/NA people; (5) promote the Tribal/Federal Government- to-government relationship on an HHS -wide basis in accordance with EO 13175; and (6) operate in accordance Appendix II 228 Tribal Consultation Policy with policy and timeframes identified within ICNAA charter and as directed by the Secretary and the ICNAA Executive Leadership. 13. Regional Offices: The ten (10) HHS Regional Offices share in the Department - wide responsibility to consult, coordinate and communicate with Indian Tribes on issues that affect Indian Tribes and HHS programs, services and resources available to Indian Tribes through States. The Regional Directors are the Secretary's immediate representatives in the field for the HHS. Each of the Regional Office(s) shall conduct an annual regional Tribal consultation meeting with Indian Tribes in their respective regions. Additional meetings may be conducted if requested by the Regional Director or an Indian Tribe(s) within the Region. Further, the Regional Directors will work closely with the respective Indian Tribes and State Governments to assure continuous coordination and communication between Tribes and States. The Regional Office Directors will promote and comply with this policy and its timeframes identified in Section 9. 8. TRIBAL CONSULTATION PROCESS A n effective consultation between HHS and Indian Tribes requires trust between all parties which is an indispensable element in establishing a good consultative relationship. The degree and extent of consultation will depend on the identified critical event. A critical event may be identified by HHS and/or an Indian Tribe(s). Upon identi fication of an event significantly affecting one or more Indian Tribe(s), HHS will initiate consultation regarding the event. In order to initiate and conduct consultation, the following serves as a guideline to be utilized by HHS and Indian Tribes: 5. I denti fy the Critical Event: Complexity, implications, time constraints, and issue(s) (including policy, funding/budget development, programs, services, functions and activities). 6. Identify affected/potentially affected Indian Tribe(s) 7. Determine Consultation Mechanism - The most useful and appropriate consultation mechanisms can be determined by HHS and/or Indian Tribe(s) after considering the critical event and Indian Tribe(s) affected/potentially affected. Consultation mechanisms include but are not limited to one or more of the following: a. Mailings b. Teleconference c. Face- to-Face Meetings at the Local, Regional and National levels between the HHS and Indian Tribes. d. Roundtables e. Annual HHS Tribal Budget and Policy Consultation Sessions. f. Other regular or special HHS Division or program level consultation sessions. A. Communication Methods: The determination of the critical event and the level of consultation mechanism to be used shall be communicated to affected/potentially affected Indian Tribe(s) using all appropriate methods and with as much advance notice as practicable. These methods include but are not limited to the following: 12. Correspondence: Written communications shall be issued within 30 calendar days of an identified critical event. The communication should clearly provide Appendix II 229 Tribal Consultation Policy affected/potentially affected Indian Tribe(s) with detail of the critical event, the manner and timeframe in which to provide comment. The HHS frequently uses a \"Dear Tribal Leader Letter\" (DTLL) format to notify individual Indian Tribes of consultation activities. Divisions should work closely with the Principal Advisor for Tribal Affairs, IOS/IGA if technical assistance is required for proper format and protocols, current mailing lists, and content. 13. Official Notification: Within 30 calendar days, and upon the determination the consultation mechanism, proper notice of the critical event and the consultation mechanism utilized shall be communicated to affected/potentially affected Indian Tribe(s) using all appropriate methods including mailing, broadcast e- mail, FR, and other outlets. The FR is the most formal HHS form of notice used for consultation. 14. Meeting(s): The Division shall convene a meeting, within 60 calendar days of official notification, with affected/potentially affected Indian Tribe(s) to discuss all pertinent issues in a national, regional, and/or local forum, or as appropriate, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, when the critical event is determined to have substantial impact. 15. Receipt of Tribal Comment(s): The Division shall develop and use all appropriate methods to communicate clear and explicit instructions on the means and time frames for Indian Tribe(s) to submit comments on the critical event, whether in person, by teleconference, and/or in writing and s hall solicit the advice and assistance of the Principal Advisor for Tribal Affairs, IOS/IGA. 16. Reporting of Outcome: The Division shall report on the outcomes of the consultation within 90 calendar days of final consultation. For ongoing issues identified during the consultation, the Division shall provide status reports throughout the year to IOS/IGA and Indian Tribe(s). A. HHS Response to Official Tribal Correspondence: Official correspondence from an Indian Tribe may come in various forms, but a resoluti on is the most formal declaration of an Indian Tribe's position for the purpose of Tribal consultation. In some instances, Indian Tribes will submit official correspondence from the highest elected and/or appointed official(s) of the Tribe. HHS will give equal consideration to these types of correspondence. Once HHS receives an official Indian Tribe correspondence and/or resolution, the Secretary/Deputy Secretary and/or their designee should respond appropriately. The process for official correspondence to Indian Tribes is described below: 5. Correspondence submitted by Indian Tribes to HHS shall be officially entered into HHS correspondence control tracking system and referred to the appropriate Division(s). 6. Acknowledgement of Correspondence: HHS and/or Divisions shall provide acknowledgement to Indian Tribes within 15 working days of receipt. 7. Official Response to an identified critical event: HHS shall provide an official response to Indian Tribes that includes: the Division head responsible for follow up, the process for resolution of the critical event and timeline for resolution. Appendix II 230 Tribal Consultation Policy a. If an identified critical event is national in scope the Department shall to the extent practicable respond to the request within 60 working days or less. b. If a critical event is specific to a single Indian Tribe the Department shall to the extent practicable respond to the request within 45 working days or less. B. Policy Development through Tribal Consultation Process: The need to consult on the development or revision of a policy may be identified from within HHS, an HHS Division or may be identified by Indian Tribes. This need may result from external forces such as Executive, Judicial, or Legislative Branch actions or otherwise. Once the need to consult on development or revision of a policy is identified the consultation process must begin in accordance with critical events and consultation mechanisms described above. HHS Divisions may request technical assistance from IGA for the Tribal consultation process. C. Schedule for Consultation: Divisions must establish and adhere to a formal schedule of meetings to consult with Indian Tribes and their representatives concerning the planning, conduct, and administration of applicable activities. Divisions must involve Tribal representatives in meetings at every practicable opportunity. Divisions are encouraged to establish additional forums for Tribal consultation and participation, and for information sharing with Tribal leadership. Consultation schedules should be coordinated with IGA to avoid duplications or conflicts with other national Tribal events. HHS Divisions should make every effort to schedule their consultations in conjunction with the Annual Regional Tribal Consultation Sessions. 9. CONSULTATION PROCEDURES AND RESPONSI BLITIES The HHS Tribal consultative process shall consist of direct communications with Indian Tribes, and Indian organizations as applicable, in various ways: B. Consultation Parties and Mechanisms - Consultation Occurs: 1. When the HHS Secretary/Deputy Secretary, or their designee, meets and/or exchanges written correspondence with a Tribal President/Chair/Governor/Chief/Principal Chief and/or elected/appointed Indian Tribal Leader, or their designee to discuss issues concerning either party. 2. When an HHS Divis ion Head, or their designee, meets or exchanges written correspondence with an Indian Tribal representative designated by an elected/appointed Tribal leader to discuss issues or concerns of either party. 3. When an HHS Regional Director, who is the Secretary's representative in the field, meets or exchanges written correspondence with an elected/appointed Indian Tribal Leader, or their designee to discuss issues or concerns of either party. 4. When the Secretary/Deputy Secretary/HHS Division Head, or their designee, meets or exchanges written correspondence with a Tribal representative designated by an elected/appointed Indian Tribal leader to discuss issues or concern of either party. Appendix II 231 Tribal Consultation Policy B. Consultation Procedures 1. Tribal: Specific consultation mechanisms that will be used to consult with an Indian Tribe(s) include but are not limited to mailings, meetings, teleconference and roundtables. a. An Indian Tribe(s) has the ability to initiate consultation, i.e. meet one - on-one with an HHS Division Head or designated representative to consult on issues specific to that Indian Tribe. b. HHS Division Heads will initiate consultation to solicit official Indian Tribe(s)' comments and recommendations on policy and budget matters affecting Indian Tribe(s). These sessions at roundtables, forums and meetings will provide the opportunity for meaningful dialogue and effective participation by Indian Tribe(s). c. National/Regional Inter -Tribal Forums: Other types of meetings and/or conferences occur which may not be considered consultation sessions, but these meetings may provide opportunities to share information, conduct workshops, and provide technical assistance to Indian Tribes. 2. HHS: Consultation mechanisms that will be used to consult with Indian Tribe(s) include but are not limited to mailings, meetings, teleconferences and roundtables. HHS has various organizational avenues in which Tribal issues and concerns are addressed. These avenues include the OS, the ICNAA, Regional Offices, and Divisions. 1. Office of the Secretary a. The HHS National Tribal Consultation Sessions are designed to solicit Indian Tribes' health and human services priorities and program needs. The Sessions provide an opportunity for Indian Tribes to articulate their recommendations on budgets, regulations, policies and legislation. i. Upon completion of consultation, HHS will document and notify Indian Tribes on the proceedings, noting positions and following -up on all issues raised that would benefit from ongoing consultation with Indian Tribe(s) within 90 calendar days. 2. ICNAA a. The ICNAA represents the internal HHS team providing consistent direction across the Divisions for AI/AN/NA issues. One of the primary responsibilities of ICNAA is to solicit Tribal input in establishing Tribal policy and budget priorities and recommendations for Divisions. The health and human service priorities established by Indian Tribes are used to inform the development of the Divisions' annual performance goals and measures for improving health and human services, which are linked to their budget requests. 3. Regional Offices a. Regional Offices will work with the Indian Tribes and Indian organizations within their respective regional area in facilitating the Appendix II 232 Tribal Consultation Policy Tribal perspective with HHS programs, services, functions, activities and planning Tribal regional consultation sessions. HHS Divisions have various geographic coverage, however all HHS Divisions, regardless of geographic location, are intended to serve Indian Tribe(s) in their respective locations. b. Regional Offices/Directors will work collaboratively with the HHS Division lead regional representative in communicating and coordinating on issues and concerns of Indian Tribes in those respective regions or areas. c. Regional Offices/Directors will work collaboratively to facilitate Tribal -State relations as they affect Indian Tribes in the delivery of HHS programs and services. d. Regional Tribal Consultation Sessions are held to solicit Indian Tribe(s)' priorities and needs on health and human services. The sessions also provide Indian Tribes with a regional perspective and shall be held, at least but not limited to, annually with status reports to Indian Tribe(s) as appropriate throughout the year, or at least biannually. 9. Regional Consultations will occur between February and April of every year. 10. Regional Consultations shall be utilized as a venue for Divisions to coordinate their consultation responsibilities in a manner that is feasible and convenient for Indian Tribes. 11. Regional Offices/Directors will contact Indian Tribes and Indian Organizati ons in their respective regions to assist in the planning of the session. This will ensure inclusion of all perspectives and issues for the session. 12. Protocol will ensure that the highest ranking official present from each respective Indian Tribe is given the opportunity to address the session first, followed by other elected officials, those designated by official letter to represent their respective Indian Tribe and representatives of Indian Organizations. a. Official letter from the Indian Tribe designatin g a representative must be presented to Regional Director before the session begins. 13. Regional Offices/Directors will seek the assistance of Tribal Leaders to assist with moderating the annual regional consultation session. 14.

Divisions will work collaboratively to facilitate Tribal -State relations as they affect Indian Tribes and AI/ANs in the delivery of HHS programs and services. 3. States: In some instances the authority and program funding for HHS programs is administered by the States on behalf of Indian Tribes. The Divisions will consult with the Office of the General Counsel to determine whether these arrangements are based on statutes, regulations, or policy decisions. If there is no clear regulatory or statutory basis mandating that States administer the program on behalf of the Tribe(s), the Division will consult with the affected Indian Tribe(s) as soon as practicable to review alternate options. If there is a statutory basis mandating that the State administer the program and associated funding on behalf of the Indian Tribe(s) the Division will examine the permissibility of encouraging or mandating a term requiring tribal consultation as a condition of the State's receipt of program funds. If such a term may be mandated regarding State administered programs affecting Indian Tribes it should be incorporated. If it is not permissible, the Division shall facilitate consultation between the State and affected Tribe(s). In addition, whenever practicable and permitted by law, the Division shall notify Indian Tribes of funds administered by the State that the Division believes should be allocated to Indian Tribes. The Division shall also encourage the State to recognize that Indian Tribal members are entitled to benefits provided to all State citizens and should be provided the same access to State administered or funded services since Tribal members are citizens of the State(s).

Presentation protocol will ensure that the highest ranking official from each respective Tribe is given the opportunity to address the session first, followed by other elected officials, those designated by their elected official to represent their respective Indian Tribes and representatives of Indian/Tribal Organizations. i. Official letter from the Indian Tribe designating a representative must be presented to IGA before the session begins. B. Performance Budget Formulation: HHS IGA will ensure the active participation of Indian Tribes and Indian Organizations in the formulation and throughout the HHS performance budget request as it pertains to Indian Tribes to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law. Appendix II 235 Tribal Consultation Policy C. Budget Information Disclosure: HHS provides Indian Tribes the HHS budget related information on an annual basis: appropriations, allocation, expenditures, and funding levels for programs, services, functions, and activities. 15. TRIBAL CONSULTATION PERFORMANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY H HS and its Divisions will measure and report results and outcomes of their Tribal consultation performance to fulfill the government -to-government relationship with Indian Tribes. Parts of the HHS mission and performance objectives are designed to address the health and well -being of AI/ANs by providing for effective health and human services and by fostering strong, sustained advances in the sciences underlying medicine, public health and social services. The Divisions shall utilize the Tribal Consultation Policy to address HHS's mission and performance objectives wi th respect to AI/ANs. HHS and its Divisions will follow the goals and objectives of the seated Secretary and Administration. Divisions and Indian Tribes will also promote a collaborative atmosphere to gather, share, and collect data and other information to demonstrate the effective use of Federal resources in a manner that is consistent with OMB performance measures and requirements. Divisions shall consult, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, with Indian Tribes before taking actions that substantially affect Indian Tribes, including regulatory practices on Federal matters and unfunded mandates. 16. EVALUATION, RECORDING OF MEETINGS AND REPORTING T he consultation process and activities conducted within the policy should result in a meaningful outcome for the Department and for the affected Indian Tribes. To effectively evaluate the results of a particular consultation activity and the Department's ability to incorporate Indian Tribes' consultation input, the Department should measure, on an annual basis, the level of satisfaction of the Indian Tribes. 1. D ivisions should develop and utilize appropriate evaluation measures to assess Indian Tribes' responses to Department consultation conducted during a specific period to determine if the intended purpose of the consultation was achieved and to receive recommendations to improve the consultation process. a. The Divisions will maintain a record of the consultation, evaluate whether the intended results were achieved, and report back to the affected Indian tribe(s) on the status or outcome, including, but not limited to, the annual sessions conducted below. 2. At a minimum, HHS Regional Directors will conduct an Annual Regional Tribal Consultation to consult with Indian Tribes. d. These sessions shall provide an opportunity to receive the Indian Tribe's priorities for budget, regulation, legislation, and other policy matters. e. Consultation Sessions shall include evaluation components for receipt of verbal and written comments from participating Indian Tribes, HHS Divisions, Appendix II 236 Tribal Consultation Policy and other invited participants to obtain immediate feedback on the consultation process for the session conducted. f. The Divisions and the Regional Directors will report at each regional Tribal consultation session regarding what substantive and procedural actions were taken as a result of the previous Tribal consultation session and describe how HHS addressed the consultation evaluation comments provided received by participants. g. All national and regional consultation meetings and recommended actions shall be formally recorded and made available to Indian Tribes. h. Once the consultation process is complete, and any policy decision is finalized, all recommended follow -up actions adopted shall be implemented and tracked by the appropriate Regions and/or Divisions and reported to the Indian Tribes in the IGA Annual Tribal Consultation Report. i. Unless otherwise specified, the IGA Annual Consultation Report shall provide an annual reporting mechanism for this purpose and all HHS Divisions ar e required to participate in providing information for this report. 3. IGA will seek Tribal feedback to assist in measuring and evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of this Policy. IGA will assess the Department Tribal Consultation Policy on an ongoing basis and utilize comments from Indian Tribes and Federal participants to determine whether amendment to the Policy may be required. If amendment is needed, IGA will convene a Tribal -Federal workgroup. 7. Divisions are required to submit to IGA thei r fiscal year Tribal consultation information within 90 calendar days from the end of the fiscal year. IGA shall compile the Division submissions, and publish and distribute the information to the Indian Tribes within 60 calendar days from receipt of the Division reports. The IGA, Regional Directors and Divisions shall also report the Department's views on the level of attendance and response from Tribal leaders during the Annual Tribal Budget and Policy Consultation Session and the Annual Regional Tribal Consultation Sessions, including evaluative comments, and provide advice and recommendations regarding the Tribal consultation process. The IGA shall post on the HHS website, the IGA Annual Tribal Consultation Report, including the evaluation results. 17. CONFL ICT RESOLUTION T he intent of this policy is to promote partnership with Indian Tribes that enhance the Department's ability to address issues, needs and problem resolution. Agencies shall consult with Indian Tribes to establish a clearly defined conflict resolution process under which Indian Tribes bring forward concerns which have a substantial direct effect. However, Indian Tribes and HHS may not always agree and inherent in the government - to-government relationship, Indian Tribes may elevate an issue of importance to a higher or separate decision- making authority. Nothing in the Policy creates a right of action against the Department for failure to comply with this Policy. Appendix II 237 Tribal Consultation Policy 18. TRIBAL WAIVER D ivisions shall review and streamline the processes under which Indian Tribe may apply for waivers of statutory, regulatory, policy, or procedural requirements. Each Division shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, consider any application by an Indian Tribe for a waiver with a general view toward increasing opportunities for utilizing flexible approaches at the Indian Tribal level when the proposed waiver is consistent with the applicable Federal policy objectives and is otherwise appropriate. Each Division shall, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, render a decision upon a complete application for a waiver within 120 calendar days of receipt, or as otherwise provided by law or regulation. If the application for waiver is not granted, the Division shall provide the applicant with timely written notice of the decision and the reasons therefore. Waiver requests for statutory or regulatory requirements apply only to statutory or regulatory requirements that are discretionary and subject to waiver by the Division. 19. EFFECTIVE DATE T his policy is effec tive on the date of the signature by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This policy replaces the Tribal Consultation Policy signed on February 1, 2008, and it applies to all Operating Divisions and Staff Divisions. Operating Divisions shall compl ete necessary revisions to their existing Division consultation policy/plan to conform to the revised Department Tribal Consultation Policy. Operating Divisions without a consultation policy shall utilize the guidance of the OS policy until the development of their respective policy. 20. DEFINITIONS 1.

These Joint Tribal/Federal Workgroups and/or Task Forces do not take the place of Tri bal consultation, but offer an enhancement by gathering individuals with extensive knowledge of a particular policy, practice, issue and/or concern to work collaboratively and offer recommendations for consideration by Federally recognized Indian Tribes and Federal agencies. The subsequent work products and/or outcomes developed by the Joint Tribal/Federal Workgroup and/or Task Forces will be handled in accordance with this policy. These Workgroups will be Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) compliant unl ess exempt. 1. Meeting Notices: The purpose, preliminary charge, time frame, and other specific tasks shall be clearly identified in the notice. All meetings should be open and widely publicized ideally through IGA or the Division initiating the policy. Appendix II 241 Tribal Consultation Policy 2.

INTRODUCTION On November 5, 2009, President Obama signed an Executive Mem orandum reaffirming the government -to-government relationship between Indian tribes and the Federal Government, and directing each executive department and agency to consult with tribal governments prior to taking actions that affect this population. The importance of consultation with Indian tribes was affirmed through Presidential Memoranda in 1994, 2004, and 2009, and Executive Order 13175 in 2000. Appendix III 244 ACF Tribal Consultation Policy The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Indian tribes share the goal of eliminating health and human service disparities of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) and ensuring that access to critical health and human services is maximized. 2. PURPOSE The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), as an Operating Division within HHS, hereby establishes a consultation policy with federally recognized Indian tribes. The purpose of the ACF Tribal Consultation Policy is to build meaningful relationships with federally recognized tribes by engaging in open, continuous, and meaningful consultation. True consultation leads to information exchange, mutual understanding, and informed decision- making. ACF is bound by the HHS Tribal Consultation Policy in full. Nothing in the ACF Tribal Consultation Policy shall be construed as diminishing or waiving the HHS Tribal Consultation Policy. The ACF Tribal Consultation Policy shall not conflict with the HHS Tribal Consultation Policy and applies to all offices of ACF. This ACF Tribal Consultation Policy document was developed based upon: 1. Executive Memorandum \"Tribal Consultation,\" November 5, 2009; 2. Executive Order 13175, reaffirmed in 2009; 3. HHS Tribal Consultation Policy (established in 2005, and amended in 2010); 4. Input from an ACF Tribal Federal Workgroup (TFWG) convened to develop the draft ACF Consultation Policy; 5. Input from tribes to ensure a consultation policy that reflects the goals of all partners involved; and 6. Input of all of the programs and regions within ACF, many of which already consult with AI/ANs. 3. BACKGROUND Since the formation of the Union, the United States (U.S.) has recognized Indian tribes as sovereign nations. A unique government -to-government relationship exists between AI/AN Indian tribes and the Federal Government. This relationship is grounded in the U.S. Constitution, numerous treaties, statutes, Federal case law, regulations and executive orders, as well as political, legal, moral, and ethical principles. This relationship is derived from the political relationship that Indian tribes have with the Federal Government. An integral element of this government -to-government relationship is that consultation occurs with Indian tribes. ACF program offices shall provide an opportunity for meaningful consultation between tribes and ACF in policy development, as set forth in this policy. The Executive Memorandum titled \"Tribal Consultation\" reaffirmed this government -to-government relationship with Indian tribes on November 5, 2009. The implementation of this policy is in recognition of this special relationship. This special relationship is affirmed in statutes and various Presidential Executive Orders including, but not limited to: Older Americans Act, Public Law 89- 73, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq. ); Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law 93- 638, as amended ( 25 U.S.C . 450 et seq. ); Native American Programs Act, Public Law 93- 644, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2991 et seq.); Appendix III 245 ACF Tribal Consultation Policy Indian Health Care Improvement Act, Public Law 94- 437, as amended (25 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ); Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Public Law 104-193 (42 U.S.C. 1305 et seq. ); Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007, Public Law 110- 134, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9801 et seq. ); Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), Public Law 111- 148 (42 U.S.C. 18001 et seq. ); Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, Public Law 110-351 (42 U.S.C. 1305 et seq. ); Presidential Executive Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments dated April 29, 1994; Presidential Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments, November 6, 2000; and Presidential Memoranda, Government -to-Government Relationship with Tribal Governments, September 23, 2004; and Tribal Consultation, November 5, 2009. 4. TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY This policy does not waive or diminish any tribal governmental rights, including treaty rights, sovereign immunities, or jurisdiction. Additionally, this policy does not diminish any rights or protections afforded other AI/AN persons or entities under Federal law. Our Nation, under the law of the U.S. and in accordance with treaties, statutes, Executive Orders, and judicial decisions, has recognized the right of Indian tribes to self -government and self-determination. I ndian tribes exercise inherent sovereign powers over their members and territory. The U.S. continues to work with Indian tribes on a government- to-government basis to address issues concerning tribal self -government, tribal trust resources, tribal treaties, and other rights. The constitutional relationship among sovereign governments is inherent in the very structure of the Constitution, and is formalized in and protected by Article I, Section 8. Self -determination and meaningful involvement for Indian tribes in Federal decision- making through consultation in matters that affect Indian tribes have been shown to result in improved program performance and positive outcomes for tribal communities. The involvement of Indian tribes in the development of public health and human services policy allows for locally relevant and culturally appropriate approaches to public issues. Tribal self -government has been demonstrated to improve and perpetuate the government -to- government relationship and strengthen tribal control over Federal funding that it receives, and its internal program management. 5. BACKGROUND ON ACF ACF provides national leadership and direction to plan, manage, and coordinate the nationwide administration of comprehensive and supportive programs for vulnerable and at -risk children and families. ACF oversees and finances a broad range of programs for children and families, including Native Americans, persons with developmental disabilities, refugees, and legal immigrants, to help them develop and grow toward a more independent, self -reliant life. These programs, carried out by State, county, city, and tribal governments, and public and private local Appendix III 246 ACF Tribal Consultation Policy agencies, are designed to promote stability, economic security, responsibility, and self - sufficienc y. ACF coordinates development and implementation of family- centered strategies, policies, and linkages among its programs, and with other Federal, tribal, and State programs serving children and families. ACF's programs assist families in financial cri sis, emphasizing short -term financial assistance, and education, training, and employment for the long term. Its programs for children and youth focus on those children and youth with special problems, including children of low -income families, abused and neglected children, those in institutions or requiring adoption or foster family services, runaway youth, children with disabilities, migrant children, and Native American children. ACF promotes the development of comprehensive and integrated community and home -based modes of service delivery where possible. The following offices are located in ACF: o Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) Children's Bureau (CB) Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) o Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Early Childhood Development o Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) President's Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities (PCPID), an advisory Committee to the President of the United States and Health and Human Services Secreta ry o Administration for Native Americans (ANA) o Office of Administration o Office of Community Services (OCS) o Office of Child Care (OCC) o Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) o Office of Family Assistance (OFA) Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Bureau (TANF) o Office of Head Start (OHS) o Office of Human Services Emergency Preparedness and Response (OHSEPR) o Office of Legislative Affairs and Budget (OLAB) o Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) o Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) o Office of Region al Operations (ORO). In June 2010, ACF established the Native American Affairs Advisory Council (NAAAC). This Council will function as an internal agency workgroup to support the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families, the Commissioner of ANA, and all ACF program and Regional Offices that provide services to Native Americans . On behalf of the Assistant Secretary, Administration for Children and Families, the Commissioner of ANA is the Chair of the NAAAC and ANA is the lead office to coordinate the activities. One of the responsibilities of NAAAC is to facilitate the development of the ACF Tribal Consultation Policy, in conjunction with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families and in consultation with tribes. The members of NAAAC are the ACF program and Regional Offices that have Native American constituents or work with Native American communities. These offices include the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (Children's Bureau, and the Family and Youth Servic es Bureau); the Administration on Developmental Disabilities; the Administration for Appendix III 247 ACF Tribal Consultation Policy Native Americans; the Office of Child Care; the Office of Child Support Enforcement; the Office of Community Services; the Office of Family Assistance (Tribal Temporary As sistance for Needy Families (Tribal TANF)); the Office of Head Start; the Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation; and the Office of Regional Operations. The following Regions will be represented: Region I, Region II, Region IV, Region V, Region VI, Region VII, Region VIII, Region IX, and Region X. 6. CONSULTATION PRINCIPLES Consultation is an enhanced form of communication that emphasizes trust, respect, and shared responsibility. It is an open and free exchange of information and opinions among parties, which leads to mutual understanding and comprehension. Consultation is integral to a deliberative process that results in effective collaboration and informed decision- making with the ultimate goal of reaching consensus on issues. ACF will consult, as defined in this document and as practicable and permitted by law, with Indian tribes before taking action that will significantly affect Indian tribes. The ACF policy is to conduct timely, respectful, meaningful, and effective two- way communication and consultation with tribes wherein elected officials and other authorized representatives of the tribal governments provide input prior to any action that either ACF or one or more tribes determines has or may have significantly affected one or more Indian tribes, and before any such action or further action is taken. An action that triggers consultation is any legislative proposal, new rule adoption, or other policy change that either ACF or a tribe determines may significantly affect Indian tribes. ACF or a tribe may determine that an action may significantly affect one or more Indian tribes and by appropriate communication initiate tribal consultation. An action is considered to significantly affect tribes if there exists a reasonable presumption that it has or may have substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, on the amount or duration of ACF program funding, on the delivery of ACF program services to one or more tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. 7. CONSULTATION PARTIES Consultation parties are: A. The ACF Assistant Secretary, ACF Deputy Assistant Secretaries, ACF Central Office Principals, or their designee; and B. Tribal President, Tribal Chair or Tribal Governor, or an elected or appointed Tribal Leader, or their authorized representative(s). Each party will identify their authorized representatives with delegated authorities to negotiate on their behalf. 8. CONSULTATION PROCESS A. A consultation is initiated: 1. When either ACF or one or more tribes makes a written request for a consultation. a. Either ACF or a tribe may determine an action significantly affects or may affect one or more Indian tribes. b. An action that triggers consultation is any legislative proposal, new rule adoption, or policy change that either ACF or a tribe determines may significantly affect Indian tribes. Appendix III 248 ACF Tribal Consultation Policy 2. An action is considered to significantly affect tribes if there exists a reasonable presumption that it has or may have substantial direct effects on: a. One or more Indian tribes; b. The amount or duration of ACF program funding for one or more tribes; c. The delivery of ACF program services to one or more tribes; d. The relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes; or e. The distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. B. A consultation request by ACF or tribe(s) should: 1. Identify the subject issue(s) for resoluti on. 2. Identify the applicable program(s), policy, rule, regulation, statute, and authorizing legislation. 3. Identify the related concerns such as State- tribal relations, related programs, complexity, time constraints, funding and budget implications. 4. Identify the affected and potentially affected Indian tribe(s). C. ACF will acknowledge receipt of the tribal consultation request within 14 calendar days after receipt of the request. D. ACF shall have an accountable process to ensure meaningful and timely input by tri bal officials in the development of policies that have tribal implications. E. To the extent practicable and permitted by law, ACF shall not promulgate any regulation that has tribal implications, that imposes substantial direct compliance costs on Indian tribes, or that is not required by statute, unless: 1. Funds necessary to pay the direct costs incurred by the Indian tribe in complying with the action are provided by the Federal Government; or 2. ACF, prior to the formal promulgation of the regulation, a. Consulted with tribal officials early and throughout the process of developing the proposed regulation; b. Provided a tribal summary impact statement in a separately identified portion of the preamble to the regulation as it is to be issued in the Federal Register (F R), which consists of a description of the extent of ACF's prior consultation with tribal officials, a summary of the nature of their concerns and ACF's position supporting the need to issue the regulation, and a statement of the extent to which the concer ns of tribal officials have been met; and c. Made available to the Assistant Secretary any written communications submitted to ACF by tribal officials. F. To the extent practicable and permitted by law, ACF shall not promulgate any regulation that has tribal implications and that preempts tribal law unless ACF, prior to the formal promulgation of the regulation: 1. Consulted with tribal officials early and throughout the process of developing the proposed regulation; 2. Provided a tribal summary impact statement in a separately identified portion of the preamble to the regulation as it is to be issued in the FR, which consists of a description of the extent of ACF's prior consultation with tribal officials, a summary of the nature of their concerns and ACF's position supporting the need to issue the regulation, and a statement of the extent to which the concerns of tribal officials have been met; and 3. Made available to the Assistant Secretary any written communications submitted to ACF by tribal officials. G. Proper notice of the tribal consultation and the level of consultation shall be communicated to all affected and all potentially affected Indian tribes within 45 calendar Appendix III 249 ACF Tribal Consultation Policy days after receipt of the tribal request. Appropriate forms of notice include a \"Dear Tribal Leader Letter\" signed by the Assistant Secretary, broadcast e- mail, FR, and other outlets. The notice will provide at least 30 days notice of subject, location, date, and time. H. Consultation will occur through a combination of one or more methods, and will include additional actions and participants as determined by the parties. The following are examples of methods of consultation: 1. Meeting(s): One or more meetings for consultation with affected and potentially affected Indian tribes to discuss all pertinent iss ues related to the legislative proposal, new rule adoption, or other policy change that may significantly affect the tribe(s) using a single purpose meeting, or a national or regional forum, if appropriate, when the consultation is determined to include all tribes. Meetings can be face- to-face, by teleconference call, and other forms of new technologies. 2. Correspondence : Written communications for consultation exchanged between ACF and the Indian tribe(s) provide affected and potentially affected Indian tribes an opportunity to identify concerns, potential impacts, proposed alternatives or flexibilities, and provide ACF with the opportunity to identify resources and other considerations relevant to the issue(s) raised. All correspondence will identify the manner in which tribal comments will be solicited. 3. Federal Register (FR): When one or more meetings are not practicable, notices in the FR may be used as the method of consultation to solicit comment from tribes about broad- based issues including concerns, potential impacts, proposed alternatives or flexibilities. Such notices will include clear and explicit instructions for the submission of comments that provide adequate time, a minimum of 45 days, for tribal responses. The FR will not be used as a sole method of communication for consultation. I. Reporting of Outcome : All national and regional consultation meetings and recommended actions shall be recorded and made available to Indian tribes. ACF program offices will provide a detailed report on their consultation sessions, which summarizes the discussions, specific recommendations, and responses, and solicits tribal feedback on the consultation process, within 45 calendar days of the conclusion of the consultation process. The ACF report will be available on the program offices' websites. Once the consultation process is complete and a proposed policy is approved and issued, the final policy must be broadly distributed to all Indian tribes and it will be independently posted on the ACF webpage and also linked to several appropriate tribal and inter -tribal organization websites. J. Meaningful Outcomes : The consultation process and activities conducted within the scope of the ACF policy should result in a meaningful outcome for both ACF and tribes. Before any final policy decisions are adopted that significantly affect Indian tribes, the proposed outcome of a consultation shall be widely publicized and circulated for review and comment to affected Indian tribes, inter -tribal organizations, and within HHS, when appropriate, practicable and permitted by law. Good faith implementation of ACF programs and a cooperative working relationship with tribes in support of ACF programs is the primary meaningful outcome. ACF will work with States to emphasize the importance of working cooperatively with tribes. Appendix III 250 ACF Tribal Consultation Policy ACF shall facilitate meaningful consultations and outcomes between tribe(s) and one or more States administering ACF programs, shall report the outcome of its efforts to affected tribes, and shall make a good faith effort to ensure all parties fully comply with ACF program requirements. K. Waivers: The intent of this policy is to provide increased ability to address issues impacting Indian tribes. ACF will, consistent with HHS Tribal Consultation Policy and as practicable and permitted by law, utilize flexible approaches to enable tribes to achieve established ACF program objectives, including consideration of waivers of statutory and regulatory requirements and other alternatives that preserve the prerogatives and authority of Indian tribes. L. Elevation of Issues: Indian tribes may elevate an issue of importance to a higher or separate decision- making authority, detailed in Section 11. ACF- Tribal Conflict Resolution. 9. ACF CONSULTATION AND COMMUNICATIO N RESPONSIBILITIES ACF will conduct an annual agency -wide tribal consultation each year, in addition to the tribal consultations required by several ACF program offices. The following will guide ACF's coordination of the various sessions. NAAAC will work with the program offices to coordinate ACF required consultations, on required topics and in required regions, to maximize the time and resources of Indian tribes and program offices. A. ACF Annual Tribal Consultation Session 1. ACF will hold, at a minimum, an agency -wide annual tribal consultation session to discuss ACF budget, programs and policies impacting tribal programs. ANA, working through NAAAC, will be the lead agency to coordinate the annual tribal consultation session. 2. Every ACF program office Principal, or their designee, will be required to participate in the annual ACF tribal consultation. 3. NAAAC will coordinate with the program offices to prepare and disseminate a written report within 45 calendar days of the conclusion of the annual ACF tribal consultation. 4. ACF will post this report on its website within 7 days of the final report completion. 5.

Office of Head Start Children's Bureau Family and Youth Services Bureau 2. ACF program offices will conduct tribal consultation sessions that are required by law, including in conjunction with the Annual ACF Tribal Consultation Session. C. Individual Program Consultation Responsibilities Appendix III 251 ACF Tribal Consultation Policy 1. Each individual program office will meet with Indian tribes and AI/AN grantees regarding programmatic concerns at the request of the Indian tribe or AI/AN grantee. 2. An official staff contact will be designated as responsible for the initial coordination and facilitation of the program office interaction with tribes and Native American organizations and to serve as the program single point of contact for interaction with offices and workgroups within HHS on AI/AN issues. This contact will be kept current on the ACF website. 3. ACF program offic es will acknowledge requests for consultation within 14 calendar days of receipt of the request. 4. ACF program offices will acknowledge and report on unresolved issues with the tribe in a timely manner. ACF program offices will acknowledge issues within 14 calendar days after the conclusion of the consultation. 5. Feedback will be provided by ACF program offices to tribes on the resolution of issues for which consultation has been requested within 45 calendar days of the conclusion of the consultation. 6. ACF program offices will ensure intra- agency coordination with Regional Offices to facilitate communication and outreach on consultations held in the Region. Regional Offices will facilitate State participation as appropriate. 7. ACF program offices and Regional Offices will provide assistance in efforts to resolve tribal -State issues. 8. ACF program offices will provide a written report on the consultations, which summarizes the discussions, recommendations, and responses, within 45 calendar days after the conclusion of the last consultation.

Implementation of this policy shall be made part of the Annual Performance Plan for ACF Senior Management as a critical performance element in those offices where there are specific tribal activities. B. ACF program offices will design indicators to ensure accountability among program managers, and central office and Regional Office staff in carrying out the HHS and ACF tribal consultation policies. C. ACF will ensure that all personnel working with Indian tribes receive appropriate training on consultation, this policy, and working with tribal governments. D. As part of the Department's annual measurement of the level of satisfaction of Indian tribes with the consultation process and the activities conducted under this policy, Indian tribes' satisfaction with ACF will be recorded and evaluated to determine whether the intended results were achieved and to solicit recommendations for improvement from tribes. 11. ACF-TRIBAL CONFLICT RESOLUTION A. Should an impasse arise between ACF and a tribe(s) concerning ACF compliance with the consultation policy or outcome of c onsultation, a tribe may invoke the conflict resolution process by filing a written notice of conflict resolution and any action that is the subject of an impasse will be stayed until the conflict resolution process with ACF is complete to the extent practicable and permitted by law. Authorized tribal representatives shall have the opportunity to meet with the Assistant Secretary for Children and Families, and/or a Deputy Assistant Secretary, and/or the Commissioner Appendix III 252 ACF Tribal Consultation Policy for the Administration for Native Americans, and/or the ACF Regional Administrator(s) for the Regional Offices that provide services to the affected tribes . The goal is to accomplish the following: 1. Clarify all aspects of the issue(s) at an impasse; 2. Explore the alternative position(s) available to resolve the impasse; 3. Clearly state the issue(s) that the parties can accept on the record; 4. Form acceptance of recommended actions; and 5. Facilitate coordination of resolution(s) for parties. B. In cases where a tribe(s) is not satisfied with the resolution of an issue or issues after consultation with ACF, a tribe(s), consistent with the government -to-government relationship, may elevate an issue of importance to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, through the Office of Intergovernm ental Affairs (IGA), for decision. 12. WORKGROUPS AND ADVISORY COMMITTEES A. To maximize the expertise and knowledge of individuals working in tribal communities, ACF will convene TFWGs, subject to available funding, to develop and discuss agency - wide policies that impact Indian tribes, prior to formal tribal consultation sessions on the policies. T he TFWG will work in accordance with the HHS policy on tribal workgroups and will follow procedures to ensure compliance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). See the HHS Tribal Consultation Policy, Addendum 1, for further explanation of TFWG. B. ACF has a standing internal working group made up of staff representatives from each ACF program office. This Native American Affairs Workgroup meets once a month to work on tribal issues at the program, ACF, and HHS level. C. ACF retains the right to meet with various representatives of organizations on an individual basis. D. For policies that impact more than federally recognized Indian tribes 1, ACF will develop forums to provide opportunities for input and dialogue for State -recognized tribes; Native American organizations, including Native Hawaiians and Native American Pacific Islanders; urban Indian centers; tribally controlled community colleges and universities; Alaska Region Corporations; and others as defined in program office guidance. E. Program offices may still convene their individual working groups to work on program specific policies. Program offices will ensure that these working groups operate within the FACA guidelines and requirements. F. ACF does not participate in government -to-government consultation with entities described in Section 12., A -E, and these meetings do not take the place of tribal consultation. 1 These groups, while not federally recognized tribes, are eligible to receive funding under certain ACF programs in the same manner as federally recognized tribes. ACF will make every effort to seek the input of these groups when chan ges to policy impact these groups as well. Appendix III 253 ACF Tribal Consultation Policy 13. DEFINITIONS A.

INT RODUCTION On November 5, 2009, President Obama signed an Executive Memorandum reaffirming the government to government relationship between the Indian Tribes and the Federal Government, and directing each executive department and agency to engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with Tribal officials in the development of Federal policies that have Tribal implications and a substantial direct effect on Indian Tribes. The importance of consultation with Indian Tribes was affirmed through Presidential Memoranda in 1994, 2004 and 2009, and Executive Order (EO) 13175 in 2000. 2. BACKGROUND Since the formation of the Union, the United States (U.S.) has recognized Indian Tribes as sovereign nations. A unique government -to-government relationship exists between Indian Tribes and the Federal Government and this relationship is grounded in the U.S. Constitution, numerous treaties, statutes, Federal case law, regulations and executive orders that establish and define a trust relationship with Indian Tribes. This relationship is derived from the political and legal relationship that Indian Tribes have with the Federal Government and is not based upon race. This special relationship is affirmed in statutes and various Presidential Executive Orders including, but not limited to: Older Americans Act of 1965, Pub . L. 89 -73, as amended; Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act, Pub. L. 93 -638, as amended The Indian Health Care Improvement Act, Pub. L. 94- 437, as amended; Native Americans Programs Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93- 644, as amended Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Pub.

L. 111 -3, 123 Stat. 8 (Feb. 4, 2009); Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, Pub. L. 111 -148, 124 Stat. 119 (Mar. 23, 2010). 3. PURPOSE An integral element of the government to government relationship is that consultation occurs with Indian Tribes. In recognition of this special relationship, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) revised its Tribal Consultation Policy on December 14, 2010. Under the HHS Consultation Policy every operating Division of HHS shares the Department -wide responsibility to consult with Indian Tribes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Tribal Consultation policy hereby incorporates and fully adheres to the HHS Policy as revised on December 14, 2010. The purpose of the CMS Tribal Consultation policy is to build meaningful relationships with Indian Tribes and to establish a clear, concise and mutually acceptable process through which consultation can take place between CMS and Tribes. The CMS Tribal Consultation Policy was developed based upon: Presidential Executive Order 13175 (2000) and Executive Memorandum on Tribal Consultation (November 5, 2009) HHS Tribal Consultation Policy (December 14, 2010) Input from the CMS Tribal Technical Advisory Group (CMS TTAG) Input from Tribes to ensure a consultation policy that reflects the goals of all partners involved Input from the CMS components and CMS regional offices 4. OBJECTIVES In order to fully effectuate this Consultation Policy, CMS will: Formalize CMS' policy to seek consultation and the participation of Indian Tribes in the development of policies and program activities that impact Indian Tribes; Create opportunities for Indian Tribes to raise issues with CMS and for CMS to seek consultation with Indian Tribes and communication with the TTAG and Indian organizations when new issues arise; Establish a minimum set of requirements and expectations with respect to consultation and participation for the levels of CMS management; Conduct Tribal consultation regarding CMS's policies and actions that have tribal implications; Establish improved communication channels with Indian Tribes, TTAG, and Indian organizations to increase knowledge and understanding of CMS' programs; Coordinate with IHS and other Divisions of HHS on issues of mutual concern; Coordinate among CMS Regional Offices and Central Office to assure consistent policy interpretations and interactions of all levels of CMS with Indian Tribes; Appendix IV 258 CMS Tribal Consultation Policy Enhance partnerships with Indian tribes that will include technical assistance and access to CMS programs and resources. 5. TRIBAL CONSULTATION PRINCIPLES CMS and Indian Tribes share the goals of eliminating health disparities for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) and of ensuring that access to Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Exchanges is maximized. To achieve these goals, and to the extent practicable and permitted by law, it is essential that CMS and Indian Tribes engage in open, continuous and meaningful consultation. Consultation is an enhanced form of communication that emphasizes trust, respect, and shared responsibility. It is an open and free exchange of information and opinion among parties, which leads to mutual understanding and comprehension. Consultation is integral to a deliberative process that results in effective collaboration and informed decision- making with the ultimate goal of reaching consensus on issues and better outcomes. To establish and maintain a positive government to government relationship, communication and consultation must occur on an ongoing basis so that Indian Tribes have an opportunity to provide meaningful and timely input on issues that may have a substantial direct effect on Indian Tribes. Consultation with Tribal Governments is especially important in the context of CMS programs because Indian Tribes serve many roles in their tribal communities: Tribal members are beneficiaries of services provided by the Indian Health Services (IHS), by tribal health programs operating under the Indian Self -Determination and Educations Assistance Act, Pub. L. 93- 638, as amended, and by urban Indian health programs operating under Title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. Tribal members are also eligible to enroll in Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Exchanges. Tribal governments operate businesses, are employers, and are health care providers, through administration of hospitals, clinics, and other health programs. In 1976, Congress recognized the need for AI/ANs to have access to Medicare and Medicaid services in IHS and Tribal facilities located in Tribal communities and amended titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to authorize the IHS and Tribal health programs to bill Medicare and Medicaid for services provided in these facilities. Many of the IHS and Tribal facilities are located in remote and isolated locations, experience difficulty in recruitment and retention of health professionals, and endure challenging socio-e conomic conditions. The involvement of Indian Tribes in the development of CMS policy is crucial for mutual understanding and development of culturally appropriate approaches to improve greater access to CMS programs for AI/ANs, to enhance health care payment and resources to IHS and Tribal health providers, and to contribute to overall improved health outcomes for Indian people. An action that triggers consultation is any policy that will significantly affect Indian Tribes. Although determined on a case by case basis, such issues could arise in any policy area for which the CMS has responsibility, such as program eligibility standards, changes in provider payment and reimbursement methodologies, or changes in services covered by CMS programs. To the exte nt practicable and permitted by law, CMS shall not promulgate any regulation that has Tribal implications, or that imposes substantial direct compliance costs on Indian Tribe(s), or that is not required by statute, unless: Funds necessary to pay the direct costs incurred by the Indian Tribe or Indian health provider in complying with the regulation are provided by the Federal Government; or CMS, prior to the formal promulgation of the regulation, Appendix IV 259 CMS Tribal Consultation Policy o Consulted with Indian Tribes throughout all stages of the process of developing the proposed regulation; o Made available to the Administrator any written communications submitted to CMS by Tribal officials and Indian health providers; o Provided a Tribal summary impact statement in a separately identified portion of the preamble to the regulation as it is to be issued in the Federal Register (FR), which consists of a description of the extent of CMS's prior consultation with Indian Tribes, a summary of the nature of their concerns and CMS's position supporting the need to issue the regulation, and a statement of the extent to which the concerns of Tribal officials have been met; and To the extent practicable and permitted by law, CMS shall not promulgate any regulation that has Tribal implications and that preempts Tribal law, unless CMS, prior to the formal promulgation of the regulation, Consulted with Tribal officials throughout all stages of the process of developing the proposed regulation; Made available to the Administrator any written communications submitted to C MS by Tribal officials. Provided a Tribal summary impact statement in a separately identified portion of the preamble to the regulation as it is to be issued in the FR, which consists of a description of the extent of CMS's prior consultation with Tribal officials, a summary of the nature of their concerns and CMS's position supporting the need to issue the regulation, and a statement of the extent to which the concerns of Tribal officials have been met. Nothing in this policy waives the Government's deliberative process privilege. 6. ROLES The government -to-government relationship between the U.S. and Federally recognized Indian Tribes dictates that the principal focus for consultation by CMS is with Indian Tribes, individually or collectively. Consultation parties are: Indian Tribes represented by the Tribal President, Tribal Chair, or Tribal Governor, or an elected or appointed Tribal Leader, or their authorized representative (s). CMS Administrator, CMS Deputy Administrator, CMS Regional Administrators, or their designee. Each party will identify his/her authorized representatives with delegated authorities to negotiate on his/her behalf. CMS Central Office : All of the components at CMS Central Office play a major role in the Department -wide responsibility to consult, coordinate and communicate with Indian Tribes on issues that affect Indian Tribes and CMS programs, services and resources available to Indian Tribes. Within CMS Central, the Tribal Affairs Group, Office of Public Engagement, advises the CMS Administrator, senior staff, and other CMS components on matters affecting American Indian and Alaska Native health, including tribal consultation. The Tribal Affairs Group is the point of contact for compliance with the CMS tribal consultation policy and serves as a resource to assist CMS components and the Administrator in determining whether a new or proposed change in policy or regulations could significantly affect Indian Tribes. The Tribal Affairs Group will assist in coordination of consultation between Indian tribes and various CMS components, including the Office of Strategic Operations and Regulatory Affairs. Appendix IV 260 CMS Tribal Consultation Policy CMS Regional Offices: The ten (10) CMS Regional Offices share in the Department -wide responsibility to consult, coordinate and communicate with Indian Tribes on issues that affect Indian Tribes and HHS programs, services and resources available to Indian Tribes through States. Through Regional Offices, CMS assists Indian Tribes by establishing or maintaining regular communication regarding Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP and Exchanges, policy development and implementation and operational issues, including eligibility, scope of covered services and providers, billing and reimbursement, adequacy of resources, effect of the program on improving health status, and other issues. Further, the CMS Regional Administrators work closely with the respective Indian Tribes and State Governments to ensure continuous coordination and communication between Tribes and States. While not a substitute for Tribal Consultation, the following entities play an integral role in the identification of policies with substantial direct effect and in providing advice and input on complex technical issues that could assist CMS in determining and understanding the impact and scope of the critical event and the extent of and format for Tribal Consultation. Tribal Organizations : Pursuant to the Indian Self -Determination and Education Assistance Act, Pub. L. 93 -638, as amended, Indian Tribes have the authority to delegate their right to carry out programs of the Indian Health Service to a Tribal organization. To the extent this has occurred, as practicable and permitted by law, CMS may provide such Tribal organizations an opportunity to fully participate in Tribal consultation under this policy. Such participation will not substitute for direct consultation with Indian Tribes, but shall occur in addition to consultation with Indian Tribes. Indian Organizations : At times it is useful that CMS communicate with Indian organizations to solicit Indian Tribe(s) advice and recommendations. These organizations represent the interest of Indian Tribes when authorized by those Tribes. These organizations by the sheer nature of their business serve and advocate Indian Tribal issues and concerns that might be negatively affected if these organizations were excluded from the process. Even though some of the organizations do not represent federally recognized Indian Tribe(s), CMS may communicate with these groups as part of the consultation process. While communication and interaction with Indian organizations is critical, it does not substitute for tribal consultation. Urban Indian Organizations: Urban Indian organizations are funded under Title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to provide health services to eligible Indians living in urban areas. As health care providers these organizations advocate for and provide services (directly and through referral) to urban Indians. Urban Indian organizations are represented on the TTAG . While communication with Urban Indian organizations is critical, it does not substitute for tribal consultation. Tribal Technical Advisory Group: (TTAG ): The TTAG serves as an advisory body to CMS, providing expertise on policies, guidelines, and programmatic issues affecting the delivery of health care for AI/ANs served through programs funded in whole or part by CMS. Interaction by CMS with the TTAG does not substitute for Tribal consultation, but assists CMS to make consultation more effective including advising on the type of consultation needed on particular issues. The TTAG plays an integral role in the CMS consultation process by providing technical assistance on complex issues faced by Tribal Governments. 7. CMS TRIBAL CONSULTATION PROCESS Upon identification of a policy that has tribal implications and a substantial direct effect on Indian Tribes or on the relationship between Tribes and the Federal Government, CMS will initiate Appendix IV 261 CMS Tribal Consultation Policy consultation regarding the policy. In order to initiate and conduct consultation, the following serves as a guideline to be utilized by CMS and Indian Tribes: Identify the applicable program, policy, rule, regulation, statute and authorizing legislation; Identify how the policy has Tribal implications and a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian Tribes or on the relationship between Tribes and the Federal Government or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian Tribes. Identify affected/potentially affected Indian Tribe(s). Determine Consultation Mechanism - Upon determination by CMS that consultation is required, CMS will evaluate the nature of the critical event that may have a substantial impact on Indian Tribes to determine the appropriate level of and mechanism for consultation. Such evaluation should include, but is not limited to, a review of the complexity, implications, and time constraints at issue that may impact on policy, funding and/or budget development, programs, services, functions and activities. Consultation mechanisms include but are not limited to one or more of the following: o Mailings; o Teleconferences; o Face- to-face meetings at the local, regional and national levels between the CMS and Indian Tribes; o Roundtables o Annual HHS Tribal Budget and Policy Consultation Sessions. o Other regular or special program level consultation sessions. Communication Methods: The determination of the critical event and the level of consultation mechanism to be used shall be communicated to affected or potentially affected Indian Tribe(s) using methods appropriate to the issue and with as much advance notice as practicable. These methods include but are not limited to the following: Correspondence: Written communications exchanged between CMS and Indian Tribes that clearly provide affected/potentially affected Indian Tribe(s) with details of the critical event, and the manner and timeframe in which to identify concerns and potential impacts, and an opportunity to propose alternatives and other comments. Meeting(s): CMS shall convene a meeting, which may occur by teleconference, webinar, or face- to-face, with affected/potentially affected Indian Tribe(s) to discuss all pertinent issues in a national, regional, and/or local forum, or as appropriate, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, when the critical event is determined to have substantial impact. Official Notification: Upon the determination of the consultation mechanism, proper notice of the critical event and the consultation mechanism utilized shall be communicated to affected/potentially affected Indian Tribe(s) using all appropriate methods including mailing, broadcast e- mail, Federal Register, and other outlets as appropriate. The FR is the most formal CMS form of notice used for cons ultation. Receipt of Tribal Comment(s): The CMS shall develop and use all appropriate methods to communicate clear and explicit instructions on the means and time frames for Indian Tribe(s) to submit comments on the critical event, whether in person, by teleconference, and/or in writing. Reporting of Outcome : CMS shall report on the outcomes of the consultation within 90 calendar days of final consultation. Once the consultation process is complete and a proposed policy is approved and issued, the final policy must be broadly disseminated to Indian Tribes, posted on the CMS AI/AN webpage, and linked to appropriate Indian organization websites. Appendix IV 262 CMS Tribal Consultation Policy 8. BUDGET FORMULATION HHS conducts an annual, Department -wide Tribal budget consultation session to give Indian Tribes the opportunity to present their budget recommendations to the Department to ensure Tribal priorities are addressed. CMS will comply with section 11 of the HHS Tribal Consultation Policy regarding Budget Formulation. CMS will fully consider all reco mmendations for funding priorities and amounts established by the TTAG in its annual plan. The TTAG develops and updates an American Indian and Alaska Native Strategic Plan which focuses on specific policy and annual budget priorities. 9. TRIBAL CONSULTATION PERFORMANCE EVALUATION CMS is responsible for evaluating its performance under this Tribal Consultation Policy. To effectively evaluate the results of the consultation process and the ability of CMS to incorporate Tribal recommendations, CMS will assess its performance on an annual basis based on the reporting requirements outlined in Section 12 of the HHS consultation policy. CMS will include the Tribes and TTAG in this annual review process. 10. MEETING RECORDS AND ADDITIONAL REPORTING. Meeting Records . CMS is responsible for making and keeping records of its Tribal consultation activity. All such records shall be made readily available to Tribes through the Annual HHS consultation report. CMS shall make and keep records of all TTAG proceedings and recommendations and will have these records readily available. Reports to Tribes. CMS will comply with HHS annual reporting requirements as outlined in section 13 of the HHS Consultation Policy. 11. CONFLICT RESOLUTION. The intent of this policy is to promote a partnership with Indian Tribes that enhances CMS' ability to address issues, needs and problem resolution. Nothing in this Policy shall be construed to preclude Indian Tribes from raising issues to responsible officials outside of the consultation process. Nothing in the Policy creates a right of action against CMS or the Department of Health and Human Services for failure to comply with this Policy. 12. TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY CMS will fully comply with Section 3 of the HHS Tribal Consultation Policy on Tribal Sovereignty. This policy does not waive any Tribal Governmental rights and authority, including treaty rights, sovereign immunities or jurisdiction. Additionally, this policy does not diminish any rights or protections afforded other American Indians or Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) or entities under Federal law. 13. TRIBAL WAIVER. CMS will fully comply with Section 15 of the HHS Tribal Consultation Policy on Tribal waivers and process all requests routinely received for waivers under existing program authorities with the statutorily set timeframes. 14.
