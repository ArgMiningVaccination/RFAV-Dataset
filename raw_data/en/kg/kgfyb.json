High Dose Vitamin C Intravenous Ascorbic Acid (IVAA) Therapy (Vitamin C) If used at the proper dosage, Vitamin C can neutralize and eliminate a wide range of toxins. Vitamin C will enhance host resistance, boosting the immune system to neutralize bacterial and fungal infections. As a medical treatment for cancer and life-threatening infections, large doses of ascorbic acid must be administered, often by intravenous injection as well as orally. High doses of Vitamin C are toxic to cells if given intravenously. Cancer patients report that their pain level goes down and that they are better able to tolerate chemotherapy with the use of intravenous Vitamin C. They bounce back quicker since the IVC reduces the toxicity of the chemotherapy and radiation without compromising their cancer cell killing effects. Research shows that the astonishingly high levels of Vitamin C achievable only by IVC not only help fight the risk of infection and the pain of metastasis, they actually aid in the defeat of the cancer cells themselves, but do no harm to healthy cells.
