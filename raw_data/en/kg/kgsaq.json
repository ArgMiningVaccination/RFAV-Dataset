Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent is a vaccine. Vaccines are used to help protect you against infectious diseases. Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent is recommended to help protect you against influenza (flu) and associated pneumonia in persons aged 60 years and older. Influenza (flu) is a disease caused by different strains of the influenza virus. The influenza virus can spread rapidly, especially in homes or institutions, where it can be very easy for someone to catch flu and spread the disease. Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent works by helping the body to make antibodies. These antibodies help the body to recognise the flu virus and help prevent the infection. It takes a few weeks for the body to produce these antibodies. Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent will only help to prevent flu if it is caused by one of the four strains of virus contained in the vaccine or other strains closely related to them. Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent will not prevent flu if you are incubating the disease before vaccination or if it is caused by another virus. Previous injections of flu vaccine are unlikely to give you protection against the current strains of flu virus most common this year, so you will need to receive a vaccine against flu every year especially if you are at risk. Your doctor will be able to recommend the best time for you to be vaccinated. Flu is present every year, even when epidemics or outbreaks are not reported. 2.
