THE FIRST, PUBLISHED BY THE NEWYORKTIMES,WAS TITLED \"NOT Telling Your Doctor You Use Acupuncture and Chiropractic. \"1It referenced a study published in the American Journal of Managed Care. In that study, the researchers reported that of 6,068 chronic pain patients surveyed, an astonishing 47 percent reported using chiropractic care.2 Furthermore, about 30 percent said they used acupunc- ture, and about 20 percent used both chiropractic andacupuncture. Interestingly, the number who used neither of these modalities of care totaled about 40 percent\u2014a number smaller than the chiropractic group. To be clear, this was a cluster of patients in a particular demographic, and not representative ofthe entire population. Still, it's common to hearDCs cite the number of patients who use chiro-practic at about 8 percent of adults (approximately18 million) and some 3 percent of children (about2 million) on an annual basis. But as the abovementioned study shows, among those with chronic back, neck, and joint pain,chiropractic and acupuncture are remarkably popular. And with good reason: Allopathic medicine isn'tvery good at managing painful chronic conditions. With these patients, a medical doctor will normally prescribe some type of NSAID, and possibly an opioidanalgesic. In the short term this strategy offers immediaterelief, but over time the health and psychological conse-quences can be severe. Surgical outcomes for low-back painare frighteningly poor. In an era of dizzyingly high healthcare costs, it's easy to see why patients grappling with chronic pain gravitate towardless-expensive and more conservative care first.

Although national guidelines recommend that adult women get 1,000 to 1,200 milligrams ofcalcium a day, some experts think that's toomuch. In an interview in the August 2015 Harvard Women's Health Watch, Walter Willett, MD, chair of the Department of Nutrition at theHarvard T .H. Chan School of Public Health, saidthat women can do just as well on half that much. \"Essentially, I think that adults do not need 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day. The WorldHealth Organization's recommendation of 500milligrams is probably about right. The UnitedKingdom sets the goal at 700 milligrams, whichis fine, too. It allows for a little leeway,\" Willettsays. The body gets the calcium it needs forbasic functions by releasing calcium stored inbones into the bloodstream.

But it is only as effective as the clinicianusing it. Pointing it at the wrong spotwon't get you far and having thecorrect diagnosis is crucial. The diagnosis is not the cause of the condition. Treating the site of pain withthe proper therapeutic laser dosage is afundamental first step to baselinesuccess. If you don't identify the correctdosage to target tissue, your clinicaloutcomes will be poor. You also needto treat contributing factors outside thesite of pain such as soft-tissue or fascialrestrictions, decreased joint mobility,and trigger points. A linchpin locationfor laser thethoracolumbar fascia (TLF). Why the This area is important for the biomechanics of movementbecause of its unique ability to shiftloads and transfer forces from the lowerextremities to the upper extremities.This is critical to understand if you wantto successfully treat tissue damageanywhere in the body. The TLF has three layers attaching to many other core-stabilizing struc-tures of the central stabilizing zone: Anterior layer: Attaches to the ante- rior aspect of lumbar and the anterior ofthe quadratus lumborum. Middle layer: Attaches to the medial processes, givingrise to the transverse abdominis. Posterior layer: Covers of the muscles from the lumbosacral regionthrough the thoracic region, and as farup as the splenii attachments.The layer movements between theupper and lower extremities, whichmakes walking and running possible.This crosslink is known as the posterioroblique sling. The high number of mechanore- important sensory Releasing fibers and reducing upregulated(facilitated) neural input is a keystrategy for re-establishing movementpatterning efficiency. Laser therapy can reduce fascial adhesions and restrictions in the TLF,helping to optimize force productionacross the body and reducing pain.Studies of the spine show that mechan-ical loads are transferred from the hips,pelvis, and low back across the TLF tothe upper back, shoulders, and arms. They accomplish this in a cross- body, X-shaped pattern. The TLF is the\"punctum fixum\" (fixed end) axis ofrotation. Light touch Laser therapy could be the adjunct yourpractice needs.

Laserlight penetrates deeply into tissue andaccelerates cellular reproduction andgrowth. The same light increases theenergy available to cells so that theycan uptake nutrients faster and expelwaste products. As a result of exposureto laser light, the cells of tendons,ligaments, and muscles are repairedfaster. Recommended dosageparameters are 6-8 joules/cm 2for superficial conditions and 8-10joules/cm 2for deeper tissue injuries. Elbow tendinitis Apply laser to the symptomatic elbowwith 1,000 joules of energy over anarea of 100 cm 2. Then apply laser above and below the site of pain withan additional 1,000 joules of energy ateach location. This is approximately 10joules/cm 2. Apply 3,000 joules to the TLF and follow up with soft-tissue release byhand or with instrument-assisted tools. Knee pain Apply laser to the knee anterior, medial,lateral, and posterior with a total of3,000 joules of laser energy, payingparticular attention to the posteriorknee and the popliteus muscle. Apply 3,000 joules to the TLF and then follow up with soft-tissue releaseby hand or with instrument-assistedtools. Shoulder pain Apply laser to the anterior andposterior lateral shoulder with 3,000joules of energy. Then use laser deepinside the axilla for the subscapularis,with 1,000 joules. Assess the pectoralsas a location for laser application. Apply 3,000 joules to the TLF and then follow up with soft-tissue releaseby hand or with instrument-assistedtools. You will often see an immediateimprovement in shoulder range ofmotion. By now you should be seeing a common theme for the treatmentprocess. No matter what area of thebody you are treating, apply lasertherapy to the TLF with approximately3,000 joules. Pay attention to the lowerthoracic and lumbar region and driftlaterally to the posterior fibers of theinternal oblique. You can also apply laser to the fascial attachments into the gluteus maximusregion with an additional dose of 2,000joules. Laser therapy to the TLF isoften the linchpin of resolving chronicmusculoskeletal pain conditions in thebody. Add it to your protocol todayand see the results for yourself.

But too often,suffering patients are tempted to resortto conventional pain medications,which carry significant risks of sideeffects such as organ damage andaddiction. As a natural healthcare doctor, your challenge is to reduce swelling andalleviate the pain quickly and safely.Delivering speedy relief and correctingthe cause are essential to success. Quick relief to the rescue Homeopathic remedies can bring rapidrelief, as they work bioenergetically,and therefore don't rely on digestion toenter the body. As we know from ourstudies in chiropractic, which also worksbioenergetically, nerve impulses travelat speeds up to 200 miles per hour, sorelief from the proper remedy canseem almost instant. Minute amounts of diluted and potentized natural substances from theplant, mineral, and animal kingdomsare used in homeopathic medicine.These medicines elicit bioenergeticresponses from the body and clear nerveinterferences, quickly overcomingsymptoms while correcting their cause. You may find homeopathy more deeply curative than most othermethods\u2014not only for acute cases butalso for patients with chronic pain.

Because the symptoms that concentrated Arnica produces arethe same symptoms that homeopath-ically prepared Arnica helps. A history of healing Homeopathy was established in 1814.By the early 1900s, there were 22 home-opathic medical schools and more than100 homeopathic hospitals in the U.S. 5It isn't widely known that the first- ever double-blind, cross-over study wasdevised and conducted by homeopathsin 1906. It was performed concurrentlyin 11 different cities on 51 subjects. Thefinal report, a proving of Belladonna, consisted of 665 pages. 6 Homeopathic studies continue worldwide, with more than 200 clinicaltrials published to date. Those whocharge that homeopathy has noscientific basis are not well informed.Only now are scientific instrumentsbecoming sensitive enough to measurewhy and how it works but, historically,practitioners have found that it doeswork\u2014and without side effects. A record of extraordinary safety How many health products andconventional medicines can boast ofhaving no side effects or known drug interactions? Even certain vitamins andherbal supplements are contraindicatedwith conventional medications or forcertain health conditions. Although the FDA technically considers homeopathic remedies as\"medicines\" and \"pharmaceutical drugs, \"they are completely nontoxic. For morethan 200 years, homeopathy has shownto be safe, cost-effective, efficacious, andhighly preferred by consumers. Thiswas the conclusion drawn by the Swissgovernment, which recently conducteda multiyear, meta-analysis of home-opathy and afterward approved it forcoverage under the country's nationalhealthcare program. 7 Although homeopathy has been steadily gaining in popularity in the U.S.since the 1970s, many natural doctorsneither understand nor use it. Somethink it is too time-consuming to learnand too complicated to implement. Classical vs. contemporary Classical homeopathy is based on theearly work of Samuel Hahnemann(1755-1843). It traditionally involvesa lengthy case-taking process, theselection of a single remedy, andproviding that substance in one potencyand dose. Then practitioner and patientwait to see if there is a positive response,which can be time-consuming. Contemporary homeopathy, on the other hand, is based on the later workof Hahnemann as outlined in his text,theOrganon. It promotes multiple remedies used simultaneously, inmultiple potencies, in a watery base,and at repeated doses. 22 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S S e p t e m B e r 4 , 2 0 1 5 C H I R O E CO.CO MRESEARCH RESuLTS Enhancing chiropractic Many chiropractors have been impressed by the natural complementhomeopathy offers to their practice.The breakthroughs and life-changingeffects they see in their patientsconvince them of the potential of thissafe form of medicine.

While bringing on an additional medicaldoctor or expanding current physicianpractice hours may seem like the logicalchoice, nonphysician practitioners, alsocalled physician extenders (PEs), canprovide a sound alternative. PE categories There are two categories of PEs:physician assistants (PAs) and nursepractitioners (NPs). While they cannotpractice independently, PAs and NPscan perform almost all the same tasksas physicians, while providing a compa-rable level of patient care. This caninclude conducting physical examina-tions, ordering diagnostic tests, anddiagnosing and managing conditionssuch as diabetes and high bloodpressure. The American Association of Medical Colleges estimates that theU.S. will face a physician shortage ofmore than 90,000 by 2020. This figureis expected to reach over 130,000 by2025. The trend is likely to continue asthe number of insured patientsincreases under the Affordable CareAct. The looming shortage will call foran increase in PEs serving healthcarepractices. In addition, the level of education required to practice has led to anincrease in the number of PEs, whocan enter the healthcare system afteronly two to three years of professionaltraining, compared to the approximatelyeight years required for medical doctors. Approaches to patient care The primary differences between NPsand PAs reflect the professional educa-tion each receives, which impacts theirresponsibilities in a multidisciplinarypractice. PAs receive training similar to that of medical doctors with an approach tohealthcare that focuses on the study ofdisease. The nursing-centered model ofeducation for NPs entails a morecomprehensive approach that empha-sizes health promotion. This focusmakes the NP an excellent comple-ment to chiropractic and helps the twoprofessions coordinate in a multi-disciplinary setting. NPs can bring a more holistic vision to patient care than PAs by addressingpatients' physical and social needs.This philosophy of care allows NPs toMONKEY BUSINESS IMAGES LTD/THINKSTOCK Healthcare team: Assemble! with physician extenders.

As the healthcare system continues to shift toward a patient-centric modelof care, satisfaction ratings have becomeincreasingly important. Such metricsnot only affect patient retention andthe ability to attract new patients butmay also have a bottom-line impact onreimbursement. While NPs might be a more ideal fit for a holistic multidisciplinary practicemodel, PAs may be a better choice forpractices that focus on specialty areas.Pain management, ambulatory surgicalprocedures, and other subspecialtieswork well for PAs due to their focusedtraining. In adding any new memberto your practice team, clarify yourpractice model and hire appropriately. Extended savings One of the greatest benefits of adding aPE to your multidisciplinary team is theconsiderable financial savings comparedto bringing on a medical physician orextending physician practice hours. Thebase salary for a medical physician ismore than twice that of mid-level chiro-practors. In addition, the cost formalpractice insurance for PAs and NPsis significantly lower than that formedical physicians, due to their lowerrates of malpractice claims and lowercosts per claim. When PE lawsuits do arise, they often involve the failure of the PE tocontact his or her supervising physician.This can be avoided by following theproper steps when integrating a PEinto your multidisciplinary practice. Putting it all together PEs should enhance patients' experiencewith your practice and the care theyreceive. PAs or NPs are not a substitutefor a medical physician\u2014they are anextension of a physician's professionalexpertise. You can avoid potentialproblems and misunderstandings byletting patients know in advance thatthey will be seeing a PE who works inconjunction with a physician. Assurepatients that the medical doctor isnearby and ready to respond should theneed arise. If a patient seems uneasy,let him or her know that you will workto make necessary accommodations. Ensure patients can discern whether they are being seen by a physician orPE by having name badges with NP orPA labels. PEs should identify them-selves using their respective titles. Adifference in uniform (scrubs versus awhite lab coat) can also help withclarification. Both PEs and physicians must recognize the collaborative nature oftheir relationship, their scope ofpractice, and any limitations applying totheir activities. An open-door policy isessential to the clear flow of infor-mation required in a multidisciplinarysetting. Obtain the signatures of both the PE and supervising physician to documenttheir understanding of the correctprotocols. PEs cannot be apprehensiveabout disturbing their supervisingphysician and must always have reliablecontact information. Although mostPEs are highly reliable team members,supervising physicians should regularlycheck on their work habits. Asking patients and other practice team members about their experiencewith a PE can provide important feed-back and prompt a course correctionbefore problems arise. With the rightmanagement, clearly written protocols,and ongoing training and education, aPE can be a strong addition to yourmultidisciplinary team.

So what particularly with omega-3s, probiotics, curcumin and Amazing omega-3s Product delivery systems are advancingto optimize how the body absorbsomega-3 fatty acids, reports Christopher Oswald, DC, CNS, an advisory board member of Nordic Naturals. The bodycan absorb up to 95 percent of healthyfats in a concentrated, triglyceride-formof omega-3. 1But new formulations are on the horizon, such as emulsions,which continue to allow clinicallyrelevant dosing while providing anexcellent tasting and easily absorbedliquid fish-oil supplement. In addition to new formulations, researchers' understanding of howessential fatty acids work in the bodycontinues to expand. Recently, muchstudy has focused on shownto help the body appropriately managethe inflammation cycle. The ability to resolve an inflam- matory event is a key to overall healthmaintenance. There are even linksbetween these SPMs and the healthymetabolism of cholesterol. 2 In practice, a common recommen- dation is 2,000 mg of eicosapentaenoicacid and docosahexaenoic acid (fattyacids in omega-3 fats, found in coldwater fish), but at times higher levelsare indicated. The American HeartAssociation, for example, recognizesthe benefits of up to 4,000 mg forindividuals with hypertriglyceridemia. Terry Lemerond, president of EuroMedica, points out that whileomega-3s are important, they are notthe only nutrient from fish with benefits.\"There are naturally occurring phos-pholipids and peptides to consider aswell,\" he says. \"These components canmake a big difference, but they are notavailable from most supplementalsources.\" You won't find peptides in krill oil or most fish oils. But they are extremelyimportant to support emotional well-being, cognitive health, and blood-vessel flexibility and strength. Phospholipids are already well- studied on their own, and Lemerondbelieves that will continue. \"Theresearch on peptides from foodsources is becoming more aggressive,and could end up being the nextfrontier in natural medicine andsupplement formulations,\" he says. Lemerond is fresh salmon.These polyunsaturated fatty acids(PUFAs) are bound to phospholipidsfor excellent absorption, and providebrain-friendly peptides that have beenshown to relieve anxiety. These supplements are only available in tablet form now, but soon should beavailable as capsules, too. Omega-3sare appropriate for a variety of healthprotocols including cognitive andneurological support; cardiovascularhealth; skin, hair, and nail support; andfor providing essential fatty acids. Professional probiotics In the past several years following thecompletion of the Human MicrobiomeProject, there's been a tremendousincrease in the understanding ofhuman microbiota and how thesebacteria keep the body healthy. 3 \"New formulations focus on core groups of bacteria that are found in thegut, but one thing that has becomeapparent is that variety is veryimportant,\" Oswald says. \"With thevast array of microbiota species foundin the human digestive tract, it isC H I R O E CO.CO M S e p t e m B e r 4 , 2 0 1 5 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S 2930 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S S e p t e m B e r 4 , 2 0 1 5 C H I R O E CO.CO Mimportant to choose a probiotic product with a healthy variety ofbacterial species.\" Among the products currently in development, a select group are\"Certified for Sport\" by NSFInternational. \"With the unique stressorsathletes and active individuals undergo,good digestive health is essential tohealthy immune function and overallwell-being,\" Oswald says. \"An addedbenefit of these products is that theydo not need to be refrigerated, so theyare great for travel.\" In other probiotic news, Ryan Bentley, DC, MD, PhD, chief medical officer atHumarian Research Lab, reports on thenutraceutical industry's first fermentedtoxin-scavenging Lactobacillus. This formula uses a naturally occurringfermentation process that allows forbeneficial modifications to thebacterium's cell wall. During thisprocess, bacteria are trained byrepeated passes of mixed toxins frommold (mycotoxins) and other to called endotoxins, which arealso known as Lipopolysaccharides (LPS). They are released when the bad bacterium ruptures or disintegrates.The strains ultimately selected canthrive in a toxin-challenged environ-ment, as they inherently seek anddestroy toxins. In addition, newly introduced probiotic products have been designedfor women and children. Some aretargeted for overweight and obesewomen, and for those with type 2diabetes. These products can provideclinical vaginal and urinary tractsupport and help with weight loss,Bentley says.

Meanwhile, Ashton Dugger , sales and marketing special projects supervisorfor Master Supplements, acknowledgesthat while the mainstream media ispointing to the relationship betweengut health and mood, there is also asurge in various fields of research forautoimmune diseases and relatedchallenges regarding probiotics. \"While formulations vary across the field of manufacturers, stand-outcompanies focus on a few key things:strain compatibility, inclusion ofprebiotics within a formula, deepdelivery of live strains, and potencyof colony-forming units within eachcapsule to ensure efficacy of strength,\"Dugger says. Another trend is to rotate formulas. \"This is because the microbiome isdiverse and our gut flora is competitive,\"Dugger says. \"This practice maintainsa good balance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains as we aim to colonize the entire gut lining. However,practitioners should look closely atpatients' symptoms to determinewhat strains they need to focus onwith each rotation.\" For example,for patients with a gastrointestinalproblem, you might advise rotatinga supplement aimed at the colonwith one targeted for the entiregastrointestinal tract.Curative curcumin Curcumin was named the top herb of2014 by the American BotanicalCouncil. Given this, Lemerond expectsto continue to see developments incurcumin formulations and deliverysystems throughout the industry. Curcumin's surge in popularity in recent years is for a good reason\u2014itdoes virtually everything. For cellularhealth, it works along multiple pathways,whereas conventional approachestypically work along one. For a healthyinflammatory response due to exercise,it provides a safe and effective form ofpain relief. And for cognitive health, ithas been studied for years as aneuroprotective botanical compound.

Andwhat does get absorbed tends to spikein the bloodstream for only a short time. To maximize curcumin's effective- ness, formulations combining BCM-95curcumin and turmeric essential oilscan boost absorption up to 10 timesthat of plain extracts while helping itstay in the bloodstream longer. The lipophilic components of tumeric (turmerones) not only boost absorp-tion but also enhance the power of Meetthenewdeliverysystems people stress the use of top-quality ingredients in supplements. But one thing that is equally important ispersonalizing nutrition through a variety of reliable deliveryforms. this is particularly essential for practitioners who relyon patient compliance to know if what they are prescribing isindeed working. For example: If someone has trouble swallowing fish oil soft gels, they need a great-tasting liquid alternative. For those who don't like the viscosity of liquid omega oils, emulsionsthat have the consistency of yogurt are now available. thetaste profile of these products can be so good that childrenhave no problem taking them. For good bacteria in probiotics to provide beneficial effects, they must be able to withstand processing conditions, beviable in sufficient numbers during storage, and also be ableto survive the acidity of the stomach and bile secretions.most probiotic supplements claim billions of active cells perdose, but will they be alive and well as they enter yourintestines? Look for products that only activate after theyreach the intestines. this dramatically enhances the survivaland growth of bacteria. Another new delivery system will be familiar to you if you've ever taken Alka-Seltzer. With this type, you simply drop thedissolving tablets in water, let them fizz, and drink them. N-acetylcysteine\u2014the usual prescribed precursor to glutathione\u2014can't always reliably deliver the same benefits ofactual active (reduced) glutathione. In this case, formulationswith protective antioxidants make all the difference. Withclinical glutathione, instruct patients to hold the tablets in themouth and allow them to dissolve before swallowing.34 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S S e p t e m B e r 4 , 2 0 1 5 C H I R O E CO.CO Mcurcumin, in addition to their own health benefits.

It's generally recommendedfor the over-40 set, as CoQ10 levelstend to decrease with age. 9You'll now find a variety of new formulations onthe market that are developed withathletes and active adults in mind. It is known that Q-10 facilitates adenosine triphosphate (ATP)production, which is vital for cellularenergy. Because it shows promise inaddressing certain mitochondrialdisorders, it likewise is aimed atimproving exercise performance.When looking to offer your patients natural medicine in the form of herbsand supplements, always consider thetried and true.

The NCCI editprogram is used by carriers and thirdparty administrators in an effort tothwart abusive billing practices ofcodes that should not be used together. For doctors of chiropractic, three common therapeutic procedure codesare identified by the edits when billedwith chiropractic manipulative treat-ment and 97140 manual therapy.Exceptional circumstances There are exceptions to the NCCIedits. One is when the 59 modifier isused to indicate to the carrier that a\"distinct procedural service\" is involvedand the procedures should be paidseparately. Unfortunately, the 59modifier is also an oft-abused anderroneously used modifier. Thisprompted CMS to release new subsetsof the 59 modifier in January 2015. Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to indicate that aprocedure or service was distinct orindependent from other non-evaluation and management (E/M)services performed on the same day.Modifier 59 is used to identifyprocedures and services, other thanE/M services, that are not normallyreported together but are appropriateunder the circumstances. Documentation should support a different session, different procedure orsurgery, different site or organ system,separate incision or excision, separatelesion, or separate injury (or area ofinjury in extensive injuries) not ordi-narily encountered or performed onthe same day by the same individual. When another already-established modifier is appropriate, however, itshould be used rather than modifier 59.If no further descriptive modifier isavailable, and the use of modifier 59best explains the circumstances, onlythen should modifier 59 be used.

The X subsets are expectedto have initially only limited effect onchiropractic procedures and billing.Although the X subsets apply only toMedicare billing as of the beginning of2015, it is expected that the X subsetswill be adopted by other carriersbecause of the data indicating 59-modifier abuse. If this occurs, it willgreatly affect chiropractic billing forreimbursement with the abovemen-tioned therapeutic procedure codes. The chiropractic manipulative treatment codes (98940, 98941, and98942) consist of three portions orprocedures bundled together. These arethe pre-assessment (history), themanipulation, and the post-assessment.These procedures are inherent andcannot be routinely unbundled. If DCsare performing a distinct procedurethat is not inherent in the manip-ulation, then they have to append amodifier to communicate to the carrierthat an exception exists. It was a controversial decision when NCCI edits deemed services such asmassage and trigger-point therapy to bea bundled procedure with manipulation.The edits contend that procedures suchas massage prepare the patient formanipulation and are therefore notseparately billable. Many carriers donot abide by this policy, but others do. The American Medical Association (AMA) stated in March 2006, in CPT Assistant , that 97110-97124 represent distinctly separate and unrelatedprocedures not considered inclusive ofthe CMT described by 98940-98943.According to the AMA, separate bodyregions are not required. Note that97140 was not mentioned in the CPT Assistant article, and as such it is generally accepted that this procedureis included with a CMT code whenperformed at the NCCI edits, 97112 neuromuscular and 97140 joint mobilization require a 59 modifier if performed at the same encounter asa chiropractic manipulation. If the97140 is performed on the same regionthe same day, then not only will thecarrier not reimburse for both proce-dures but the provider cannot bill thepatient for both procedures either. However, if the payer follows AMA guidelines, 97112 and 97124 do notneed to be in a distinctly separateregion, yet they still need the modifierif the payer follows NCCI edits. Although neuromuscular re-educa- tion, massage, and joint mobilizationare not reimbursable by Medicare whenperformed by a chiropractor, if thepatient needs the claim to be processedand denied by Medicare to be sent to asecondary carrier, the claim must besubmitted to Medicare first. That iswhen the X subsets come into play. 40 C H I R O P R AC T I C E CO N O M I C S S e p t e m B e r 4 , 2 0 1 5 C H I R O E CO.CO MCODING KEYS Also, to ensure that medically necessary services are performed, the provider must document: 1. That the excep- tion exists, 2. The regions where the services were performed,and 3. The diagnosis for each region. Therefore, the X subsetsmust be used. When performing neuromuscular re-education, massage, joint mobilization, or trigger-point therapy and billingMedicare, the 59 modifier is to be used only as a \"lastresort.\" Instead, one of the following XE, XS, XP, or XUsubset modifiers would be more appropriate. Modifier XE: Separate encounter\u2014the service is distinct because it occurred during a separate encounter. Modifier XS: Separate structure\u2014the service is distinct because it was performed on a separate organ or structure. Modifier XP: Separate practitioner\u2014the service is distinct because it was performed by a different practitioner. Modifier XU: Unusual non-overlapping service\u2014the service is distinct because it does not overlap usualcomponents of the main service. The XS modifier will most likely be used in most circum- stances for 97140, but XU may be most appropriate for97112 and 97124, as they do not need to be performed on aseparate structure. But this depends on guidance from payers. Check with your local Medicare carrier for further clarification. Do not use these new modifiers for privatepayers until it is confirmed that they have begun to acceptthem. Some have stated that they will allow either the 59modifier, or one of the X modifiers, but not both. Othershave indicated that they would like to see the 59 modifierfollowed by the appropriate X modifier on the same line. Yetother carriers have remained silent. Further clarification is expected from Medicare, and private payers will probably follow suit. Modifiers are appended to HCPCS and CPT codes when clinical circumstances justify their use. The X-subsetmodifiers are an important tool in clarifying your claims forreimbursement. The modifiers are not there to deny claimsbut rather to get them paid when used properly.

Of the 60,000 chiro-practors in the U.S. today, nearly 70percent do not have an EHR systemand more than 50 percent are currentlyconsidering adding one. Early adopters had the opportunity to receive $44,000 each and more than$3 billion has been paid to Medicareproviders, but the point is now moot\u2014the incentive program is over. Even so,if you don't have an EHR system, youshould still consider making the switch.Why? To achieve paperless conven-ience and efficiency. Used correctly, a good EHR systemwill significantly increase office effi-ciency and reduce the use of paper. Adecent system will eliminate the timewasted by staff looking for lost files orrecords stored incorrectly. If you're stillusing paper, how many times have youexperienced a fire drill because of amissing file? These types of occur-rences can be eliminated with an EHRsystem. And if you choose a Web-based platform, you can access whatyou need in the office, at home, or onthe go. Here are several advantages to adopting an EHR system: 1. Get paid properly. Insurance providers are increasingly requiring the use ofEHR technology for maximum reim-bursement. This is no longer specificto Medicare and Medicaid.2. Appeal to patients with a modern office.A practice overflowing with physical files and papers looks and feels like 1980. EHRs make an officetechnologically appealing. Offices stillusing paper are not attractive to tech-savvy patients or those looking for aprovider who is up-to-date with currenttrends. If you visit an emergency roomor dentist's office, you will notice thatmost documentation is being entereddirectly into a computer of some sort. 3. Save money. An EHR system can save you money in a variety of ways.First, you reduce staff time by elimi-nating the need to create or locate paperfiles. This can lead to a reduction inthe number of required staff members.The program can manage and sendout appointment and recall reminders,Cloud and clear The incentives are over, so why still consider adopting a Web-based EHR system?

Can the provider be trusted? Will data be lost? Today, as cloud computing becomes more popular, there are more storage providersthan ever. Competition is fierce, so to survive companiesmust be dedicated to providing secure and reliable serviceor risk losing business (or worse). While you can no longer receive financial incentives from the federal government to adopt an EHR system,going electronic still offers many benefits.

If you're served with either a subpoena or a search warrant, complywith the request. If you interfere with asearch warrant being served, you maybe arrested or taken into temporarycustody. In either situation, contactyour attorney immediately and explainthe situation, and reach out to yourcompliance officers as well. Who you gonna call? The time to look for an attorney is notwhile the agents are removing recordsand computers from your office. Havean idea of who to call in such asituation ahead of time. What if youcall your attorney and the answeringservice tells you he or she is on aremote island in the Pacific and won'tbe back for a month? What is yourbackup plan? You should also notify your practice's compliance officer. If you arethe only compliance officer for yourpractice, how useful will you be whenstressed out to the max? Have acompliance committee rather than justone person designated as the officer. Lastly, according to federal sentencing guidelines, the only twothings that a judge may take intoconsideration if you are found guiltyof violating a healthcare law include: 1. Did you notify the payer and return any money or payments thatyou received improperly? 2. Did you have a valid, up-to-date and living ethics and Medicare compli-ance program in place before the lawcame to check on you? For a validHIPAA compliance program, a riskanalysis must be completed or theOffice of Civil Rights considers yourprogram nonexistent. Plan now, before the suits show up, because afterward will be too late. DIANE M. BARTON , DC, mCS-p , CIC, is a graduate of palmer College. She has been in practicefor 28 years in the Chicago area.

And what works best for you and yourpractice will reflect your unique styleof chiropractic and your patient base.The following principles are effectiveand tested by time. Limit dialogue Avoid talking about your interests,your vacation, the movie you saw lastnight, or the restaurant you like. Yourpatients don't care about you. Theycome to your office because they arenot feeling well\u2014they want to learnabout their health problem, what youare doing to fix it, and what they cando to get better faster. Patients always want to know the consequences of not fixing theirproblem, e.g., arthritis, disc degen-eration, or nerve compression. It's allaboutthem\u2014 not you. Give reasons to return Schedule your patients for blood andurine test results, to update theirorthotics, to replace their cervicalpillows (they flatten out after sixmonths), and to reorder supplements.These procedures give your patients acompelling reason to come back. Keep them invested in their care Never let your patients get bored.When they get bored\u2014they're gone.D.D. Palmer stressed the importance ofkeeping patients focused. Change what you do each visit to make your patient's office visit excitingand interesting. Give your patients aone-minute mini exam to determinewhere you are going to adjust. Thisshows your patient that you are diag-nosing and treating what you found.Change the order of your adjustments:If you normally adjust the lumbarsfirst, next time do them last. Patientsshouldn't think they are getting aroutine office visit. Other ways of keeping your patients looking forward include mini exams,range-of-motion improvement, post-X-ray examinations, kinesiological checks,analysis of blood and urine tests,dynamometer checks, vital capacityexams, trigger point elimination,bilateral weight balancing, and post-muscle-strength testing to make sure thecorrection hasn't weakened or reversed. Offer a measurable brand Keep your patients interested in theircare by showing them proof of theirprogress. Take pre- and post-treatmentX-rays to show patients their spinalcorrections. Show them the return oftheir spinal curves and the straighteningof their spines. Show them digital proofon-screen to illustrate your findings.Patients will continue with you as longas they can see continual corrections. Provide patient education The more educated your patients areabout chiropractic, the more they willwant your services. Educate them byconducting classes on relief for backpain, neck pain, headaches, and similarhealthcare topics. Provide in-officeeducational videos and healthpamphlets, too. Stop patient attrition Your CAs should be trained in how torecapture a patient when one misses avisit or is dropping out of care. Usemultiple appointment cards orcalendars because patients rarely misstheir office visits when they havepremade appointments. Whenever a patient misses an appointment, your CA should notifyyou so that on the patient's next visityou can discuss the necessity of stayingon the treatment schedule. If a patient misses more than two appointments, give the patient a minireport of findings to reaffirm the seri-ousness of the patient's problem andthe necessity of the treatment frequency. A missed appointment indicates that the bond between you and your patienthas weakened or is broken. PETER G.
