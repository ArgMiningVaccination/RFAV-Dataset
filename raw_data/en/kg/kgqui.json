RECOMMENDED BY DERMATOLOGISTS WORLDWIDE, CRYSTAL TOMATO WHITENING SUPPLEMENT IS A 100% NATURAL PRODUCT DESIGNED TO ALLEVIATE MELASMA AND HYPERPIGMENTATION. ASIDE FROM MELASMA, THE SUPPLEMENTS ALSO HELP TO BEAUTIFY THE SKIN BY PREVENTING THE PRODUCTION OF MELANIN, LIGHTENING ACNE SCARS, DARK SPOTS, FRECKLES, DARK UNDER ARMS AND AGE SPOTS, GIVING YOU A BRIGHTER, MORE EVEN SKIN TONE. [TEO, ET AL., JOURNAL OF PIGMENTARY DISORDERS 2015, 2.2.](https://crystaltomato.com/skin-whitening-supplement/#skin-teo) [Double blind placebo-controlled trial conducted at National Skin Centre, Singapore.](https://crystaltomato.com/skin-whitening-supplement/#skin-double) Our signature Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is clinically proven to treat melasma and pigmentation problems and boost the body's ability to achieve healthy, glowing, blemish-free skin\u2014with improvements in as little as a few weeks. High in antioxidants and rich in colourless carotenoids, this powerhouse in a pill is made from special, non-GMO crystal tomatoes in a unique formulation supported by a decade of research. Safe and effective, with no preservatives and no harmful side effects, Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is dermatologist-recommended and dramatically all-natural. Crystal Tomato\u00ae carotenoids are antioxidants that prevent the formation of free radicals and prolong the longevity of cell DNA. As an anti-inflammatory, they protect skin from premature ageing caused by sun exposure. In the right doses, the supplement absorbs ultraviolet radiation UVA/UVB damage, lightens hyperpigmentation, and produces a more even skin tone. It also inhibits the production of melanin, preventing more pigmentation from forming while working to improve existing melasma spots. Our formulation includes the amino acid L-cysteine, which boosts the liver's production of Glutathione, an antioxidant that converts eumelanin or brown pigment to pheomelanin or pink pigment. Skin becomes rosy, supple, and younger-looking. It is also one of the few amino acids that contains sulphur, which binds with protein to form collagen, an anti-ageing building block for healthy, youthful skin. [A randomised, double-blind study conducted at National Skin Centre in Singapore](https://crystaltomato.com/skin-whitening-supplement/#skin-randomised) on individuals with melasma highlights the potency of Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement. When used in tandem with Skin Clarity Cream, significant improvements were achieved after only 56 days. Improvements further increased to over 50% after 84 days. These results were published in the [peer-reviewed US Journal of Pigmentary Disorders](https://crystaltomato.com/skin-whitening-supplement/#skin-peer), making Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement the only skin whitening supplement proven effective by clinical trial. Available in over 3,000 medical aesthetics clinics and trusted by dermatologists worldwide, Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is a natural, long-term solution for better skin from within. Even-toned, fair, radiant skin can be yours with a daily dose that's right for you\u2014what could be simpler? Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is a natural food supplement made from a special non-GMO varietal of tomato cultivated specifically for skin lightening. We call this varietal Crystal Tomato which is not available anywhere else. Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is natural and preservative-free. Crystal Tomato carotenoids are the key active ingredient in Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement. Carotenoids are a class of natural substances made up of naturally occurring pigments synthesised by plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria. Carotenoids function primarily as antioxidants. Carotenoids are usually coloured, such as beta carotene\u2014the orange in carrots\u2014and lycopene\u2014the bright red in tomatoes. Crystal Tomato carotenoids are colourless and do not absorb the visible light spectrum. They absorb only lower wavelengths like UV or higher wavelengths infrared or IR. A fresh crystal tomato contains 300 times more bio-accessible rare colourless carotenoids than an ordinary tomato. It would take 300 common market tomatoes to produce the equivalent of colourless carotenoids in a single Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement. Because they contain coloured carotenoids, consuming regular tomatoes will not produce the same whitening effect nor protect skin from UV. Furthermore, ingesting large amounts of coloured carotenoids will affect skin colour. Beta carotene, taken in large amounts over a couple of weeks,will eventually give skin an orange tint. Recommended intake is one to two caplets a day. In view that the skin is a large organ, with benefits delivered head to toe, expect visible lightening in two to three months. Some users attest to visible lightening in as early as three weeks of taking one caplet a day. Most can see skin radiance after a couple of weeks. Clinical tests have shown that after 56 days, 76.5% of patients show a remarkable improvement of more than 25% in modified Melasma Area Severity Index or mMASI scores (Study on Melasma, National Skin Centre, Singapore, October 2013 to May 2014). Unless you have a tomato allergy, there are no known side effects. Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is a natural food supplement which consists of natural crystal tomatoes and L-cysteine, an amino acid present in the body as well as a US FDA-approved food additive. Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is as safe as eating a tomato. As a natural food supplement, it is suitable and safe for all\u2014with the exception of those who are allergic to tomatoes or have been advised by their physicians not to consume tomatoes for any reason. As a natural food supplement, you can take Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement indefinitely. If the supplement is stopped, skin will eventually revert to its original state. It will not get worse, but benefits achieved from the supplement will be lost. Yes. It is suitable for vegetarians and vegans. Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement is made from natural crystal tomatoes that have been freeze-dried into powder. As acids are water-soluble, when water is removed, the acids are also removed. No further chemicals are added. L-cysteine is an efficacy booster. This amino acid increases the liver'sproduction of master antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione converts dark brownmelanin to pink melanin. Not all glutathione can be absorbed by the body; only L-cysteine-transformed glutathione is absorbed. In a controlled clinical study, a 20% increase in natural skin SPF occurred in 65% of participants after 12 weeks of taking Crystal Tomato carotenoids. It is necessary to continue using topical sunscreen. Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement provides some protection, but it is not sufficient to completely protect skinfrom direct sun exposure. Just like eating a fresh tomato, Crystal Tomato Whitening Supplement can be taken any time of day or night, before or after food. Whichever way you take it, we recommend that you develop the habit of taking it daily at the same time. |Crystal Tomato\u00ae dioxide, Methocel - E15, PEG - 8000, Titanium Dioxide. "}
