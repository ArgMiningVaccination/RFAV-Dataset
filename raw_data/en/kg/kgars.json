If you have a need for transportation from Ann Arbor, email Craig Regester (regester@umich.edu) Off Campus Location Our Healing Justice as Building Cultural Resistance workshop series is back! Last fall, SiD faculty member Diana Seales coordinated 5 workshops for students and community members to learn about, discuss, and practice healing justice. This time, the series is back with some updates and an additional workshop. All workshops are free and open to the public and include a light dinner. If you are coming from Ann Arbor as a registered student or someone who wants to drop in for one or more workshops, please email Craig Regester (regester@umich.edu) to confirm your transportation. SERIES INFORMATION: Cultural organizing places culture at the center of an organizing strategy. It can be done to unite people through the humanity of culture and the democracy of participation. This series explores the ways in which healing justice, creativity and arts enhance cultural organizing through a series of unique workshops led by Detroiters that are at the forefront of this movement. This type of creative organizing empowers communities to come together in celebration of culture while developing valuable skills that challenge power and oppression. Healing Justice is woven through each of the workshops. Dr. Page of the Kindred Healing Justice Collective (often attributed with coining the phrase) describes Healing Justice as identifying how we can holistically respond to and intervene on generational trauma and violence, and to bring collective practices that can impact and transform the consequences of oppression on our bodies, hearts and minds.\" Additionally, this series is led entirely by indigenous community members and activists. The practice of ritual, which is deeply tied to healing justice and cultural organizing, often comes at the risk of cultural appropriation. As we try to create cross-cultural community healing spaces, it is vital to understand Anishinaabe culture as we stand on their land. This series will struggle with that idea, with the challenge of ritual in the modern era, and will encourage people not familiar with healing justice to get outside their comfort zones and confront the ways in which the destruction of indigenous healing practices and colonization are deeply interconnected.
