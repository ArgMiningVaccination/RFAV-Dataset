An attention to health, then, should take the place of every other object.\" That priority has remained fixed in both the private and public values of our society through generations of Americans since. Our rewards have been immeasurably bountiful. \"An attention to health\"-of the individual, the family, the community and the Nation-has contributed to the vitality and efficiency of our system as well as to the happiness and prosperity of our people. Today, at this point in our history, we are privileged to contemplate new horizons of national advance and achievement in many sectors. But it is imperative that we give first attention to our opportunities- and our obligations-for advancing the Nation's health. For the health of our people is, inescapably, the foundation for fulfillment of all our aspirations. In these years of the 1960's, we live as beneficiaries of this century's great-and continuing-revolution of medical knowledge and capa\u00ad bilities. Smallpox, malaria, yellow fever, and typhus are conquered in this country. Infant deaths have been reduced by half every two decades. Poliomyelitis, which took 3,154 lives so recently as 1952, cost only 5 lives in 1964. Over the brief span of the past two decades, death rates have been reduced for influenza by 88 percent, tuberculosis by 87 percent, rheumatic fever by 90 percent. 35-011 0 2 ADVANCING THE NATION'S HEALTH A baby born in America today has a life expectancy half again as long as those born in the year the 20th century began. The successes of the century are many. The pace of medical progress is rapid. The potential for the future is unlimited. But we must not allow the modern miracles of medicine to mes\u00ad merize us. The work most needed to advance the Nation's health Will not be done for us by miracles. We must undertake that work ourselves through practical, prudent, and patient programs-to put more firmly in place the foundation for the healthiest, happiest, and most hopeful society in the history of man. Our first concern must be to assure that the advance of medical knowledge leaves none behind. We can-and we must-strive now to assure the availability of and accessibility to the best health care for all Americans, regardless of age or geography or economic status. With this as our goal, we must strengthen our Nation's health facilities and services, assure the adequacy and quality of our health manpower, continue to assist our States and communities in meeting their health responsibilities, and respond alertly to the new hazards of our new and complex environment. We must, certainly, continue and intensify our health research and research facilities. Despite all that has been done, we cannot be complacent before the facts that- Forty-eight million people now living will become victims of cancer. Nearly 15 million people suffer from heart disease and this, together with strokes, accounts for more than half the deaths in the United States each year. Twelve million people suffer arthritis and rheumatic disease and 10 million are burdened with neurological disorders. Five and one-half million Americans are afflicted by mental retardation and the number increases by 126,000 new cases each year. in our struggle against disease, great advances have been made, but the battle is far from won. While that battle will not end in our lifetime-or any time to comew-we have the high privilege and high promise of making longer strides forward now than any other genera\u00ad tion of Americans. The measures I am outlining today will carry us forward in the oldest tradition of our society-to give \"an attention to health\" for all our people. Our advances, thus far, have been most dramatic in the field of health knowledge. We are challenged now to give attention to advances in the field of health care-and this is the emphasis of the recommendations I am placing before you at this time. I. REMOVING BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE In this century, medical scientists have done much to improve human health and prolong human life. Yet as these advances come, vital segments of our populace are being left behind-behind barriers of age, economics, geography, or conumunity resources. Today the political community is challenged to help aul our people surmount these needless barriers to the enjoyment of the promise and reality of better health. 3 ADVANCING THE NATION'S BIEALAH A. HOSPITAL INSURANCE FOR THE AGED Thirty years ago, the American people made a basic decision that the later years of life should not be years of despondency and drift. The result was enactment of our social security program, a program now fixed as a valued part; of our national life. Since World War 11, there has been increasing awareness of the fact that the full value of social security would not be realized unless provision were made to deal with the problem of costs of illnesses am Ong our older citizens. I believe this year is the year when, with the sure knowledge of public support, the Congress should enact a hospital insurance program for the aged. The facts of the need are well and widely known: Four out of five persons 65 or older have a disability or chronic disease. People over 65 go to the hospital more frequently and stay twice as long as younger people. Health costs for them are twice as high as for the young. Where health insurance is available it is usually associated with an employer-employee plan. However, since most of our older people are not employed they are usually not eligible under these plans. Almost half of the elderly have no health insurance at all. The average retired couple cannot afford the cost of adequate health protection under private health insurance. I ask that our social security system-proved and tested by three decades of successful operation-be extended to finance the cost of basic health services. In this way, the specter of catastrophic hos\u00ad pital bills can be lifted from the lives of our older citizens. I again strongly urge the Congress to enact a hospital insurance program for the aged. Such a program should- Be financed under social security by regular, modest contribu\u00ad tions during working years; Provide protection against the costs of hospital and post\u00ad hospital extended care, home nursing services, and outpatient diagnostic services; Provide similar protection to those who are not now covered by social security, with the costs being paid from the administra\u00ad tive budget; Clearly indicate that the plan in no way interferes with the patient's complete freedom to select his doctor or hospital. Like our existing social security cash retirement benefits, this hospital insurance plan will be a basic protection plan. It should cover the heaviest cost elements in serious illnesses. In addition, we should encourage private insurance to provide supplementary protection. I consider this measure to be of utmost urgency. Compassion and reason dictate that this logical extension of our proven social security system will supply the prudent, feasible, and dignified way to free the aged from the fear of financial hardship in the event of illness. Also, I urge all States to provide adequate medical assistance under the existing Kerr-Mills program for the aged who cannot afford to meet the noninsured costs. 4 ADVANCING THE NATION'S, HEALTH B. BETTER HEALTH SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH America's tradition of compassion for the aged is matched by our traditional devotion to our most priceless resource of all-our young Today, far more than many realize, there are great and growing needs, among our children for better health services. Acute illness strikes children under 15 nearly twice as fre\u00ad quently as it does adults. One in five children under age 17 is afflicted with a chronic ailment. Three out of every 100 children suffer some form of paralysis or orthopedic impairment. At least 2 million children are mentally retarded, with a higher concentration of them from poor families. Four million children are emotionally disturbed. At age 15, the average child has more than 10 decayed teeth. If the health of our Nation is to be substantially improved in the years to come, we must improve the care of the health of our 75 million preschool and school-age children and youth. There is much to do if we are to make available the medical and dental services our rising generation needs. Nowhere are the needs greater than for the 15 million children of families who live in poverty Children in families with incomes of less than $2,000 are abl to visit a doctor only half as frequently as those in families with incomes of more than $7,000. Public assistance payments for medical services to the 3 million needy children receiving dependent children's benefits through\u00ad out the Nation average only $2.80 a month, and in some States such medical benefits are not provided at all. Poor families increasingly are forced to turn to overcrowded hospital emergency rooms and to overburdened city clinics as their only resource to meet their routine health needs. Military entrance examinations reveal the consequences. Half of those rejected cannot pass the medical tests. Three-fourths of them wvould benefit from treatment, and earlier treatment would greatly increase recovery and decrease lifelong disability. The States and localities bear the major responsibility for providing modern medical care to our children and youth. But the Federal Government can help. I recommend legislation to- Increase the authorizations for maternal and child health and crippled children's services, earmarking funds for project grants to provide health screening and diagnosis for children of preschool and school age, as well as treatment and followup care services for disabled children and youth. This should include funds to help defray the operational costs of university-affiliated mental retardation clinical centers. Provisions should also be made for the training of personnel who will operate medical facilities for children. Broaden the public assistance program to permit specific Federal participation in paying costs of medical and dental care for children in medically needy families, similar to the Kerr-Mills program for the aged. Extend the grant programs for (a) family health services and clinics for domestic agricultural migratory workers and their children and (b) community vaccination assistance. ADVANCING TEE NATION'S HEALTH 5 C. IMPROVED COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES Mental illness afflicts 1 out of 10 Americans, fills nearly one-hall of all the hospital beds in the Nation, and costs $3 billion annually. Fortunately, we are entering a new era in the prevention, treatment, and care of mental illness. Mere custodial care of patients in large, isolated asylums is clearly no longer appropriate. Most patients can be cared for and cured in their own communities. An important beginning toward community preparation has been m~ade through the legislation enacted by the 88th Congress author\u00ad izing aid for constructing community mental health centers. But facilities alone cannot assure services. It has been estimated that at least 10,000 more psychiatrists are needed. Few communities have the funds to support adequate pro\u00ad grams, particularly during the first years. Communities with the greatest needs hesitate to build centers without being able to identify th~ source of operating funds. Most of the people in need are children, the aged, or patients with low incomes. I therefore recommend legislation to authorize a 5-year program of grants for the initial costs of personnel to man community mental health centers which o~ffer comprehensive services. D. A NEW LIFE FOR THE DISABLED Today, we are rehabilitating about 120,000 disabled persons each year. I recommend a stepped-up program to overcome this costly waste of human resources. My 1966 budget will propose increased funds to rehabilitate an additional 25,000. Our goal should be atleast 200,000a year. I recommend legis8lation to authorize- Project grants to help States expand their services. Special Federal matching so that rehabilitative services can be provided to a greater number of the mentally retarded and other seriously disabled individuals. Construction and modernization of workshops and rehabilitation centers. II. STRENGTHENING THE NATION'S HEALTH FACILITIES AND SERVICES In our urbanized society today, the availability of health care depends uniquely upon the availability and accessibility of modern facilities, located in convenient and efficient places, and on well- organized and adequately supported services. The lack of such facilities and services is, of itself, a barrier to good health care. A. MULTIPURPOSE REGIONAL MEDICAL COMPLEXES In this century, we have made more advance than in all other centuries toward overcoming diseases which have taken the heaviest toll of human life. Today we are challenged to meet and master the 3 killers which alone account for 7 out of 10 deaths in the United States each year-heart disease, cancer, and stroke. The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer, and Stroke has pointed the way for us toward that goal. 6 ADVANCING THE. NATION'S HEALTH The newest and most effective diagnostic methods and the most recent and most promising methods of treatment often require equip\u00ad ment or skills of great scarcity and expense such as- open heart surgery; advanced and very high voltage radiation therapy; advanced disease detection methods. It is not necessary for each hospital or clinic to have such facilities, equipment, or services, but it is essential that every patient requiring such specialized and expensive procedures and services have access to them. Multipurpose medical complexes can meet these needs. They would- speed the application of research knowledge to patient care, so as to turn otherwise hollow laboratory triumphs into health victories; save thousands of lives now neediessly taken annually by the three great killers-heart disease, cancer, and stroke-and by other major diseases. A plan to improve our attack upon these major causes of death and disability should become a part of the fabric of our regional and community health services. The services provided under this plan will help the practicing physician keep in touch with the latest medical knowledge and by making available to him the latest techniques, specialized knowledge, and the -most efficient methods. To meet these objectives, such complexes should- Be regional in scope. Provide services for a variety of diseases-heart disease, cancer, stroke, and other major illnesses. Be affiliated with medical schools, teaching hospitals, and medical centers. Be supported by diagnostic services in community hospitals. Provide diagnosis and treatment of patients, together with research and teaching in a coordinated system. Permit clinical trial of advanced techniques and drugs. Medical complexes-consisting of regional organizations of medical schools, teaching hospitals, and treatment centers tied into community diagnostic and treatment facilities-represent a new kind of orgam\u00ad zation for providing coordinated teaching, research, and patient care. When we consider that the economic cost of heart disease alone amounts to 540,000 lost man-years annually-worth some $2.5 billion-the urgency and value of effective action is unmistakable. Action on this new approach, stemming from recommendations of the Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer, and Stroke, will provide significant improvements in many fields of medicine. I recommend legislation to authorize a 5-year program of project grants to develop multipurpose regional medical complexes for an all-out attack on heart disease, cancer, stroke, and other major diseases. B. IMPROVED SERVICES FOR THE MENTALLY RETARDED Mental retardation in any individual is a lifelong problem of the most serious nature for the family and for the community. But we know today that the problem need not and must not lead to tragic hopelessness. Much is being done to provide a decent, dignified, place in society for these unfortunate individuals. 7 ADVANCING THE NATION'S HEALTH The 88th Congress provided a substantial foundation for building an effective national program for the prevention of mental retardation and care of the mentally retarded. Under this authority, grants are authorized- For construction of mental retardation research centers, com\u00ad munity mental retardation centers, and university-affiliated mental retardation centers. For planning by all the States of comprehensive action to com\u00ad bat mental retardation at the State and community levels. The 1966 budget includes $282 million-a $40 million increase-for these programs and other mental retardation services, including pre\u00ad ventive activities and the traininog of teachers of the retarded. I urge that this full amount be appropriated. Extensive resources and programs need to be developed in the States and communities to prevent mental retardation and to care for the mentally retarded. The existing authority for planning grants will end on June .30, 1965. The developmental needs and effective utilization of the construction grants require followup action. I recommend the enactment of mental retardation program development grants for 2 additional years to help the States continue this essential work. C. MODERNIZATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES Great progress has been made throughout the Nation in the provi\u00ad sion of new general hcspitals under the Hill-Burton program. But relatively little assistance has been available for modernization of the older hospitals, found particularly in our large cities. Without aid, deterioration threatens and rapid scientific and technical change is passing by these essential links to health care for millions of our people. The 1966 budget will include funds for a greatly increased hospital modernization effort as well as for expansion in the number and quality of nursing homes. I urge the Gongress to approve the full amount requested for each of these purposes. D. AID FOR GROUP PRACTICE FACILITIES New approaches are needed to stretch the supply of medical specialists and to provide a wider range of medical services in the communities. The growth of voluntary, comprehensive group practice programs has demonstrated the feasibility of grouping health services for the mutual benefit of physicians and patients by- Integrating the burgeoning medical specialties into an efficient and economical system of patient care. Reducing the incidence of hospitalization which may now occur because there are few alternative centers for specialized care. The initial capital requirements for group practice are substantial, and the funds are not now sufficiently available to stimulate the expansion and establishment of group practice. To facilitate and encourage this desirable trend, I recommend legislation to authorize a program of direct loans and loan guarantees to assist voluntary associ\u00ad ations in the construction and equipping of facilities for comprehensive group practice. 8 ADVANCING THE NATION'S HEALTH III. MANPOWER FOR THE HEALTH SERVICES The advance of our Nation's health in this century has, in the final measure, been possible because of the unique quality and fortunate quantity of men and women serving in our health professions. Americans respect and are grateful for our doctors, dentists, nurses, and others who serve our Nation's health. But it is clear that the future requires our support now to increase the quantity and assure the continuing high quality of such vital personnel-. In all sectors of health care, the need for trained personnel continues to outstrip the supply: At present, the United States has 290,000 physicians. In a decade, we shall need 346,000. Today we are keeping pace with our needs largely because of the influx of numbers of foreign-trained doctors. Last year 1,600 came into the United States, the equivalent of the output from 16 medical schools and 21 percent of our medical school graduates. Population growth has badly outpaced the increase in dentists and the shortage of dentists is now acute. To begin to meet the Nation's health needs, the number of new physicians graduated each year must increase at least 50 percent by 1975, and the output of new dentists by 100 percent. The Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1963, authorizing grants to schools for construction of medical and other health education schools and loans to students, will help meet this problem. The mnagnitude of the need is demonstrated by the response: Ninety applications have been received from medical and dental schools, requesting $247 million in Federal aid for con\u00adstruction. t Only $100 million is available in 1965; and the full authorization. for 1966, which I will shortly request in the budget I am sub\u00ad mitting, will provide $75 million more. In the light of these needs, I urge the Congress to appropriate the full amount authorized and requested for the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act program. While we must build new medical and dental schools, we must also retain and sustain the ones we have. To be neglectful of such schools would be wasteful folly. We -must face the fact that high operating costs and shortages of operating funds are jeopardizing our health professions educational system. Tuition and fees paid by medical and dental students meet less than half the institutional costs of their education. Several underfinanced medical and dental schools are threatened with failure to meet educational standards. New schools are slow to start, even when construction funds are available due to lack of operating funds. I therefore recommend legislation to authorize- formula grants to help cover basic operating costs of our health profession schools in order that they may significantly expand both their capacity and the quality of their educational programs; project grants to enable health profession schools to experiment and demonstrate new and improved educational methods. Traditionally, our medical profession has attracted outstanding young talent, and we must be certain that this tradition is not com\u00ad promised. We must draw the best available talent into the medical profession. Half of last June's medical school graduates came from 9 ADVANCING THE. NATION'S HEALTH families with incomes of over $10,000 a year. The high costs of medical school must not deny access to the medical profession for able youths from low- and middle-income families. I therefore recommend legislation to authorize scholarships *for medical and dental students who would otherwise not be able to enter or complete such training. Looking to the future We must also look to the future in planning to meet the health manpower requirements of the Nation. Unmet health needs are already large. American families are demanding and expecting more and better health services. In the past decades the proportion of our gross national product devoted to health has increased by more than 50 percent. The trend is still upward. If we are to meet our future needs and raise the health of the Nation, we must- improve utilization of available professional health personnel; expand the use and training of technicians and ancillary health workers through special schools and under the Vocational Educa\u00ad tion Act and Manpower Development and Training Act programs; expand and improve training programs for professional and for supporting health personnel; plan ahead to meet requirements for which the leadtime is often 10 years or more. With these objectives in mind, I have asked the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfarm to develop a long-range health manpower pro\u00ad gram for the Nation and to recommend to me the steps which should be taken to put it into eflect. IV. HEALTH RESEARCH AND RESEARCH FACILITIES Two decades ago this Nation decided that its Government should be a strong supporter of the health research to advance the well-being of.its people. This year that support amounts to more than two- thirds of the total national expenditure of $1.5 billion for health research. Continued growth of this research is necessary and the 1966 budget includes: Ten-percent growth in expenditures for health research and for the related training. Funds to begin an automated system for processing the ex\u00ad ploding volume of information on drugs and other chemicals related to health. Health research, no less than patient care, requires adequate facilities. Over the past 8 years the Health Research Facilities Act has been highly successful in helping provide research facilities to universities and other nonprofit institutions. Federal grants of $320 million to 990 construction projects have generated over $500 million in matching institutional dollars. This authority expires on June 30, 1966, and I recommend that it be extended for 5 years with an increased authorization and with a larger Federal share for specialized research facilities of a national or regional character. 10 ADVANCING THE, NATION'S HEALTH V. HEALTH GRANTS AND PROTECTION MEASURES Our complex modem society is creating health hazards never before encountered. The pollution of our environment is assuming such important proportion I shall shortly send to the Congress a special message dealing with this challenge. But the protection of the public health also reciuires action on other fronts. A. HEALTH GRANTS TO COMMUNITIES AND STATES In safeguarding and advancing the Nation's health, States and communities have long had special responsibilities. General and special-purpose health grants have proved an effective means of strengthening the Federal Government's partnership with them in improving the public health. I have directed the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to study these programs thoroughly and to recommend to me necessary legislation to increase their usefulness. Authorizations for many of these programs expire at the close of fiscal year 1966. So that a thorough review may be made, I recom\u00ad mend that the Congress extend the authorizations through June 80, 1967. B. CONSUMERS HEALTH PROTECTION Modernization of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is imperative if our health protection program is to keep pace with the technological and industrial advances of recent years. The health of all Americans depends on the reliability and safety of the products of the- food industry which alone generates nearly $100 billion in retail sales each year; drug industry with sales reaching $6 billion; cosmetic industry which markets $2.5 billion of products. All must be operated under the highest standards of purity and safety. Yet, despite recent improvements in food and drug legislation, seri\u00ad ous gaps in our ability to protect the consumer still exist. The law should be strengthened to provide adequate authority in the regula\u00ad tion of nonprescription drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and food. Narcotics are not alone amiongithe hazardous, habit-forming drugs subject to improper use. Barbiturates, amphetamines, andot her drugs have harmful effects when improperly used. Widespread traffic resulting from inadequate controls over the manufacture, distribution, and sale of these drugs is creating a growing problem which must be met. We must also counter the threat from counterfeit drugs. I recommend legislation to bring the. production and distribution of barbiturates, amphetamines, and other psychotoxic drugs under more effective control. For the fuller protection of our families, I recommend legislation to require- Adequate labeling of hazardous substances. Safety regulation of cosmetics and therapeutic devices by pre- marketing examination by the Food andDrug Administration. Authority to seize counterfeit drugs at their source. 1 ADVANCING THE NATION'S HEALTH CONCLUSION I believe we have come to a rare moment of opportunity and challenge in the evolution of our society. In the message I have presented to you-and in other messages I shall be sending-my purpose is to outline the attainable horizons of a greater society whichK a confident and prudent people can begin to build for the future. Whatever we aspire to do together, our success in those enterprises- and our enjoyment of the fruits that result-will rest finally upon the health of our people. We cannot and we will not overcome all the barriers-or surmount all the obstacles-in one effort, no matter how intensive. But in all the sectors I have mentioned we are already behind our capability and our potential. Further delay will only compound our problems and deny our people the health and happiness that could be theirs. The Eighty-eighth Congress wrote a proud and significant record of accomplishment in the field of health legislation. I have every con\u00ad fidence that this Congress will write an even finer record that will be remembered with honor by generations of Americans to come. LYNDON B. JOHNSON.

The Congress hereby finds that (1) the heavy costs of hospital care and related health care are a grave threat to the security of aged individuals, (2) most of them are not able to qualify for and to afford private insur\u00ad ance adequately protecting them against such costs, (3) many of them are accordingly forced to apply for priva~te or public aid, accentuating the financial difficulties of hospitals and private or public welfare agencies a~nd the burdens on the general revenues, and (4) it is in the interest of the gen\u00ad eral welfare for financial burdens resulting from hospital serv\u00ad ices and related services required by these individuals to be met primarily through social insurance.

U) - trt 0C-I CI CD1 CD - H GI~ 30 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE HOSPITAL INSURANCE FOR TH AGED THROUGH THE SOCIAL SE-CURIY SYTEMtheir Cu~rIY SYTF~(Speaker, (Mr. KING of California asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks and Include extrane- ous material.) Mr. KING of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to again today introduce a bill to provide a program of hospital benefits and related health benefits far the elderly thraugh the social security system, to increase social security cash benefits by 7 percent, and make certain other needed improvements in the social security program, and to increase Fed- eral payments toward public assistance, It is fitting that this bill is designated as H-R. 1, because its consideration and en- actment are matters of the utmost ur- gency. HOSPITAL INSURANCE FOR THE AGED Social security hospital insurance for the elderly Is among the proposals to which the President has accorded the January 4 highest priority. This year, mare than 3 million elderly Americans will have to go to the hospital and will be called on to pay individual health bills amounting to hundreds and even thousands of dol\u00ad lars. Almost one-half of these older people will have no health Insurance at all and the great majority will have in\u00ad adequate protection against their un\u00ad budgetable health expenses. Thus, many older Americans will have to use up mea\u00ad ger savings-savings which, once spent, can never be restored. Some older people will be crushed by the burden of expensive illness, their dreams for an independent old age shat\u00ad tered. Others will have to face the pros\u00ad pect of becoming dependent on their children, young people with families of their own to care for; and all too many of them will have to accept public charity and a life of poverty. Mr. Speaker, my conviction that a hospital Insurance for the aged program is needed is shared by the Advisory Coun\u00ad cil on Social Security. As Members of this body know, the Social Security Ad\u00ad visory Council was appointed in accord\u00ad ance with provisions of the 1956 social security amendments and was chargedwith the responsibility of reviewing and making recommendations on all aspects of the social security program, including the adequacy of benefits. The council was composed of distinguished represent\u00ad atives of employers, employees, self-em\u00ad ployed people, and the general public. Only a few days ago, after more than 11/2 years of intensive study, the Council reported as one of its conclusions that security in old age requires the combina\u00ad tion of a cash benefit and insurance against a substantial part of the costs of expensive illness. The Council stated further that social insurance offers the only practical way of making sure that most older people will have hospital Inm surance protection. I will comment fur\u00ad ther on the Council's findings at a later point in my statement. We can no longer permit hospital costs-ar the fear of hospital costs-ta deprive our elderly citizens of the se\u00ad curity and peace of mind that should be due after a lifetime of work. Mr.I am confident that most of my colleagues, and most Americans, share my conviction that the only practical and effective remedy to this critical and wide\u00ad spread problem is hospital insurance through social security. Enactment of H.R. 1, which would provide such insur\u00ad ance, should be our No. 1 objective In the coming months. PROSPECTS FOR ENACTMENT Mr. Speaker, there is no justification f or postponing approval of a social se\u00ad curity hospital benefits program. Dur\u00ad ing the many years that this proposal has been before the Congress, the major Issues that have blocked passage have been resolved. The mounting evidence that has been collected over this period has clearly established that older people have not been able to adequately pre\u00ad pare themselves to cope with their large health costs. Everyone who has oqile into contact with this problem knows that the situation is widespread and 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE 31 serious. The past several years of experi- mentation with private insurance and public welfare programs have also shown that thes6 existing means of financing health care in old age cannot, by them- selves, meet the problem. Over the years, the American public has seen a great deal of controversy over social security hospital benefits for the elderly. They have been exposed to the informational campaigns carried out by proponents and opponents and they have considered the mounting support for the proposal by such nonpartisan groups of experts as the task force that was formed at the request of Senator JAVITS and, of course,- the Advisory Council on Social Security. The American people have also considered the suggestions made during the political campaigns last year that not even the existing social security system-much less the hospital benefit plan-is acceptable and that the system Mr. Speaker. I include In the RECORD Immediately following my statement material describing the provisions of H.R. 1. This will include actuarial tables showing the financial status of the social security system under my bill, At this point, however, I shall sumnmar- ize the hospital insurance provisions. I shall also touch briefly on some of the ways in which these have been improved, While the proposed hospital insurance plan follows the same approach as the predecessor bill, we have continued to evaluate the plan and have been able to make further improvements in it. HOSPITAL INSURANCE PROVISIONS Like my previous proposals, H.R. 1 would utilize the time-tested social se- curity mechanism to enable Americans to contribute during working years to- ward the cost of hospitalization and re- lated care that they will face during their later years. The proposed hos-er people could add to their socal security hospital insurance. The social security program of hospital insurance for the elderly that I propose would, like my previous proposals, rely on the traditional partnership between public Insurance, private insurance, and public assistance that has worked so well in the area of income maintenance. First, basic protection against hospital costs and certain alternatives to hospitaliza\u00ad tion would be afforded the elderly on a paid-up basis through social securitv. Second, private protection would be built upon this base through employer plans and individually. Third, two States, re\u00ad lieved of a substantial portion of their welfare burden, would be placed in a far better financial position to provide ade\u00ad quate medical assistance to help the rel\u00ad atively small residual group whose spe\u00ad cial needs and circumstances make it im\u00ad possible for them to meet their health costs. FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS OF HOSPITAL INSUREANCE PROVISIONS The proposed hospital insurance would be financed on thc same sound basis as the present social security program. The estimate of the cost of the proposed pro\u00ad gram was calculated only after intensive study of all available data, including the experience of private health insurance organizations. The cost of the proposed hospital insurance would be sully fi\u00adnanced by contributions from workers-and matching payments from their em\u00ad ployers. The 'maximum. employee con\u00ad tribution rate would be less than one- half of one percent so that, for example, a worker earning $5,600 a year, the max\u00ad imum amount subject to contributions, wuold pay about $25 per year toward ho.3\u00ad pital insurance; one earning $4,800 would pay about $22 a year; one earning the median amount cf $3,000 would pay $13.50 a year. Under the hospital insurance proposal,the additional contributions for hospitalinsurance would be automatically appro\u00ad priated to a special hospital insurance trust fund, which would be kept separate and operate independently from the existing social security trust funds. All hospital insurance benefits and the ad\u00ad ministrative expenses of the proposed program would be paid only from the new hospital insurance trust fund. IMPERATIVE NEED FOR ENACTMENT The reasons that it is imperative to en\u00ad act a program of hospital insurance for the elderly have been clearly established. Hahcreaseoesoxpnieht virtually no one, not even the person who is working in a well paying job and who is at the height of his earning power, can afford to be without insurance against large health expenses. And the elderly have an even greater need for health insurance than younger people because, on the average, their health care costs are twice as high. The incidence of expensive illness increases greatly in old age. Each year, one out of every six older people Is hospitalized. Practically everyone who reaches age' 65 is hospital\u00ad ized at least once during his later years and most older people are hospitalized two or more times. On the average, clearly in favor~ of my pro- posal. We can now proceed to carry out our mandate without further delay, SIMILASIF TO APPROVED MESUE With the exception of the hospital in- surance provisions, the provisions Of my bill are largely the same as, or similar to, those agreed to by the Committee on Ways and Means in the course of the committee's consideration of the, pro- posed Social Security Amendments ITam proposng issoewhait lacrgers Tholbe resu cltsyotheanovembe elcinpital insurance protection would be made available to virtually all people at age 65 as an earned right. My bill, would accomplish this without interfer- ing with hospital operations or the prac- tice of medicine in any way. The pro- posed program would provide the fol- lowing benefits: First. Payments would be made for up to 60 days of hospital care with the patient paying a deductible amount equal to the national average cost for 1 day of hospital care. There is no pro- vision for a choice among alternative hospital benefit plans, as under my pre- vious proposal, because of problems of advising elderly people about the impli- cations of various options and the dis- satisfaction that would result from \"'-wrong\" choices.

My new bill as in195 proposed increase is needed to bring benefits into line with current prices, The proposed 7-percent increase, the hospital insurance program, and the other social security provisions of the bill would be financed by the contribution increases proposed in the nature of the post- hospital care that would be paid for under the proposed program by using the terms \"posthospital extended care\" and \"extended care facility.\" In addi- tion the bill would make it somewhat easier for these facilities to participate in the program by changing the require- ment that a facility be affiliated with a hospital to one that would require only that the facility have an agreement with a hospital for the timely transfer of raised from $4,800 t 560Yowilpatients and medical information . recall, Mr. Speaker, that the proposedSocial Security Amendments of 1964 were pending in a conference commit- tee when the 88th Congress adjourned, The hospital insurance provisions of the bill I have introduced will be familiar to my colleagues. In all major respects, the proposed hospital benefit plan is the same as the bill I have introduced on be- half of the administration in the preyi- ous Congress and which was considered by the Committee on Ways and Means during the extensive health benefit hear- ings of 1963 and 1964. Similarly, the proposal is much the same as the hos- pital insurance provisions of the pro- posed social Security Amendments of .1964 as passed by the Senate last fall, Thr.PyetwudbmaefraThr.PyetwudbmaefralHatcreaseoesoxpnieht costs above a deductible amount for out- patient hospital diagnostic services fur- nished within a 30-day period; the de- ductible amount would be equal to one- half the deductible amount for inpatient hospital benefits, Fourth.

JarnuarY 4 older person uses almost three times as much hospital care as the younger per- son. it is ironic that, despite this demon- strably great need for protection against, the cost of health care, the elderly have to get along without adequate health in- sukance coverage. only a handful of the aged-perhaps 1 In 20-have Pro- tection against as much as 40 percent or more of their health costs. Only about one-half of the aged have any health insurance at all-even counting those with only meager $10-per-day hos- pital coverage policies or one of the other inadequate plans offered to the aged. Despite the much-heralded introduction over the past 5 years of Blue Cross senior citizen plans, the State-65 plans and the commercial Insurance mass enrollment plans, the number of aged people with- out health insurance Is nearly as large as it was 5 years ago, Over the years that the social security hospital insurance proposal has been studied, it has become increasingly clear to most informed people that the existing health insurance arrangements cannot alone meet the problem of Insuring the elderly. Most people cannot afford to pay for adequate health insurance when they are old, because that is the time of life when health insurance costs are highest and when the individual's finan- cial resources are likely to be lowest. On the average, the older family group has one-half as much income as younger families of comparable size. In all but a few cases, a person will no longer have upon retirement the advantage of em- ployer contributions toward his health insurance premiums. On the other hand, health insurance Is much more expensive for the elderly than for others, primarily because of the high health costs associated with old age, And the health insurance premiums old- er people must pay are pushed even higher, because the elderly are generally not eligible for group coverage. most of the health insurance in force in the United States is purchased for groups of employees through their place of em- ployment. This group health insurance coverage is economical, in part because the sales and premium collection costs are less and in part because some of the administrative costs are borne by the employer, who, for example, collects the premiums, generally by a deduction from wages. When administrative costs are low, almost all of the money workers pay toward their group coverage can be re- turned to them in the form of health benefits. Unfortunately, the elderly, who are generally not employed and do not be- long to a group for which group health insurance could be furnished, cannot ordinarily benefit from the economies of group coverage. They can generally get health insurance only on an individual basis. Individual commercial health in- surance costs, on the average, about 11/2 times as much as group coverage offering the same Protection. Because health costs for older people are about twice and hospital costs close to three times those of Younger People, an individuallywritten health insurance policy for an aged person may cost three or four times as much as the same protection fur- nished under a group coverage plan for younger people. This can mean health, Insurance costs for an adequate policy of $500 a year or more for an aged couple, Health costs have. become the most serious remaining threat to financial security in old age. It is not surprising, then, that health care costs have become the most Important single reason for the continuing need for the aged to resort to public assistance. Over one-third of public assistance expenditures for the aged are for medi- cal costs. As short a time as 12 years ago medical costs were only 1 1 percent of public assistance for the aged, A CONTINUING PROBLEM people, cannot consign all, these people to the welfare rolls. We must adopt the much more suitable alternative of social security hospital insurance. And there are other problems with depending upon public assistance as the basic public pro\u00ad gram to meet this problem. While a few States have fairly liberal Kerr-Mills programs of medical assist\u00ad ance for the aged, a few States have no Kerr-Mills program at all and most States have very stringent ones. Of the States with programs, the majority have established their programs so as to bene\u00ad fit only older individuals whose annual incomes fall below $1,500. Also, the State plans generally give no help to those with very modest bank accounts. Many States do not provide aid if the rel\u00ad ple of this country have demanded, health costs are going to remain a seri. ous threat to the security of elderly Americans for generations to come, There Is little doubt but that the cost of health care will continue to rise faster than other costs for some time to ~come. And, of course, the cost of health insur- ance must follow suit. Moreover, there Is every, likelihood that the elderly will continue to use an increasing volume of health services as medical science ad- vances. And as now, the future aged will have to cope with the substantial re- duction in income that, comes with re- tirement. PUBLIC ASSISTANCE Welfare programs do not offer an ac- ceptable remedy to the problem older people face in meeting the costs of ex- pensive illness. For the problem is not one faced only by the poor, the group for whom public assistance is intended, The problem of paying large health bills In old age hits hardest at the great ma- jority of older people-those who are neither rich nor very poor. These are the people who risk the loss of their fi nancial independence. Giving assistance to people who are already reduced to poverty is necessary, but the prevention of dependency is certainly more in line with the aspirations of the American people. Also, getting help tlirough public as- sistance always depends on meeting a means test-and that of course involves an investigation of the individual's per- 'sonal financial situation. If there is one attitude Americans have in common it is the desire to maintain individual dig- nity and privacy. Most people find it humiliating to undergo a scrutiny of their personal affairs and how they spend their money. In some cases, the means-test investigation takes place while the elder- ly person is lying helpless in a hospital bed. Even the resources of their chil- dren may be investigated, Many of our senior citizens would rather forgo needed medical care-to the detriment of their health-than go before a public welfare agency and ad- mit what they think amounts to social and financial failure. How can we per- mit this to happen to a retired person who has worked hard and been self-sup- porting all his life, when he finds that he has a big hospital bill. We. as a moral Unesw aetesesta h e-atives cannot show they are too poor to Unesw aetesesta h e-help. It is not surprising, then, that while the Kerr-Mills provisions were Intended to help older peoplc who are ordinarily self-supporting, most of the aged who have actually met the eligibility require\u00ad ments were so poor that they met all the requirements for old-age assistance. In other words, essentially none but the very poor have been aided by the Kerr- Mills legislation. Even then the scope of care available Is often quite limited. In some States, for example, medical care is provided under Kerr-Mills only where the applicant's life or sight is endan\u00ad gered, rather than whenever medically required. In a number of States pay\u00ad ment for hospital care under MAA Is very limited-to as few as 15 days. THE SOCIAL SECURITY APPROACH For most Americans, what is needed is not more lenient welfare programs but rather an insurance system under which all workers can, during their productive years, pay contributions toward protec\u00ad tion against thE high health costs that will beset them in later years. Social security, and only social security, would make this desirable, self-help arrange\u00ad ment available to practically everybody. Unlike Public assistance, social secu\u00ad rity hospital insurance would help pre\u00ad vent indigency by helping older people meet their health costs before they have been reduced to indigency. The hospital insurance would be financed through a system which older people have helped to support by their specific earmarked social security contributions. Thus, un\u00ad like public assistance, there would be no humiliating and degrading needs tests; the hospital benefits would be paid as an earned right-the way that preserves in\u00ad dividual dignity and privacy. Further, the details of the proposed hospital insurance would be spelled out by statute so that workers would know what they would get in return for their contributions. Since the funds needed to finance the proposed insurance would be provided In advance, older people would be certain of having the proposed protection when they reach age 65. There would not be the problem that public assistance administrators face of having, every so often, to cut back the medical care provided the needy because of insufficient funds. Unlike voluntary insurance, the so-' cial security mechanism would make __ __ __ --- ---- _______________ 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE 33 health benefit protection available to re- tired People on a group basis-a kind of coverage that is ordinarifly only avail- able to working people. Like the group insurance available to the young, there would be no waiting periods, no exclu- sion of Preexisting conditions, no higher Premiums for poorer health risks, nor 'other devices that now deprive those older People who need it most of hospi- tal insurance protection. Individually Purchased health insurance plans, on the average, provide less than 60 cents worth of protection in return for each dollar of premiums the individual pays, while social security hospital insurance would return 97 cents on the dollar. Social security hospital Insurance would have no fixed dollar benefits that get out of date. And employer contributions, which are not generally available to the aged who buy insurance, would help fi- nance the program.The social insurance mechanism also offers a truly conservative approach to meeting basic costs of illness in old age. The scope of the health insurance pro- tection that would be provided would be clearly defined and limited by law, the logu otoh rga ol e actuarially calculated, and revenue suffi- cient to finance the program would be provided, RECOMMENDATION OF THE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON SOCIAL SECURITY Before -concluding my statement, I would like to call attention to a few of the specific conclusions about the health insurance needs of the elderly that th Advisory Council on Social security reached after Its thorough review of al the evidence. The council concluded that monthly cash benefits are not suf- ficient to provide the economic security in old age that the social security Pro- gram is intended to provide. In the council's opinion, monthly cash benefits can meet regularly recurring expenses suha hsefrfo, hl ltigan manently disabled people shouild have the same hospital insurance protection as the elderly. I commend to Members of this body the thoughtful and thorough report of this knowledgeable and dis- tinguished Council. CONCLUSION Mr. Speaker, as I have said, the bill I have just introduced is basically the same as the hospital insurance amend- ment that the Senate added last year to the proposed Social Security Amelnd- ments of 1964. In approving the previ- ous version of the bill, that body endorsed the idea that workers should have the opportunity to pay in advance, and over their working years, toward the basic hospital insurance they will need during their later years. There is no question in my mind but that most of the Members of this body share that view.

RECORD -HOUSE January i SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Number 20 January 4, 1965 THE SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF 1965 To Administrative, Supervisory, and Technical Employees Representative Cecil R. King of California today introduced a bill-\u00ad expected to be H. R. 1---to provide hospital insurance under the social security program and an increase in social security cash benefits. Senator Clinton P. Anderson of New Mexico will introduce a companion bill --expected to be S. 1--within a few days. The bills contain a number of provisions which were extensively considered by the Congress in 1964. The major provisions of the bills are: 1. Hospital insurance under social security (provisions similar to those included in last year's Senate-passed bill but modified in the direction of the recommendations of the Advisory Council on Social Security); 2. A 7-percent benefit increase (a 5-percent increase was approved by the House and a $7 increase in primary benefit amounts was approved by the Senate last year); 3. A $5, 600 contribution and benefit base (as in the Senate- passed bill); 4. Tax rate increases (similar to Senate-passed bill); 5. Coverage of doctors (as in the House-passed bill); 6. Coverage of tips (similar to House-passed bill); 7. Extension of the period for filing proof of support and filing application for lump-sum death payment (as in the Senate- passed bill); 2 8. Automatic recomputation of benefits (as in the bill passed by both Houses); and 9. Welfare amendments (as in the Senate-passed bill). Enclosed is a brief summary of the major provisions of the proposal. Robert M. Bal Commissioner Enclosure BRIEF SUMMARY OF \"HOSPITAL INJSURANCE., SOCIAL SECURITY, AN]) PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AmvE~mENTs OF 1965\" Title I--Hospital Insurance Act of 1965 Persons Entitled People age 65 and over who are entitled to monthly benefits under the old- age and survivors insurance program or under the railroad retirement system would be provided protection beginning July 1, 1966 (January 1, 1967, for post-hospital extended care) against the cost of inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital diagnostic services, post-hospital extended care, and home health services. The number of people past 65 who would be included in this way is estimated at 16 2/3 million as of July 1, 1966. In addition, the bill would make it possible for essentially all people who are now 65 and over, or who will reach 65 in the next few years but who are not eligible for social security or railroad retirement benefits, to have the same protection. (This provision would not apply to aliens with rela\u00ad tively short residence in the United States or to active or retired Federal employees who already have the opportunity for protection under Federal employee health insurance plans.) The cost of this provision would be met from general revenues. Men and women who will reach age 65 before 1968 and who do not meet the regular insured status requirements of the social security system would be deemed insured for the hospital and related benefits. Uninsured people who reach age 65 after 1967 would need, to be insured for these benefits, 3 quarters of coverage for each year elapsing after 1965 and before age 65. The provision would not apply to women who reach age 65 in 1972 (or later) and men who reach age 65 in 1974 (or later) since in those years the number of quarters that would be required to qualify for hospital benefits would be the same as, or greater than, the number required for social security cash benefits. About 2 million persons would be covered in this way as of July 1, 1966. Scope and Duration of Benefits Provided The services for which payment would be made under the bill include: (1) inpatient hospital services for up to 60 days with a modest deductible amount equal to the average cost of one day of hospital care; hospital services would include all those customarily fur\u00ad nished by a hospital for its inpatients; payment would not be made for the hospital services of physicians except those in the fields of pathology, radiology, physical medicine, and anesthesiology provided by or under arrangements made by the hospital, or services provided by an intern or resident-in-training under an approved teaching program; (2) post-hospital extended care (in a facility having an arrangement with a hospital for the timely transfer of patients and medical information about patients) after the patient is transferred from a hospital, for up to 60 days; 2 (3) outpatient hospital diagnostic services, as required, subject to a deductible amount equal to the average cost of 1/2 day of hospi\u00ad tal care for diagnostic services furnished within a 30-day period; (4i)home health services for up to 2140 visits during a calendar year (120 visits in 1966) for a home-bound person in the care of a physician and under a plan established by a physician for the use of such services; these services would include intermittent nursing care, therapy, and the part-time services of a home health aide. No service would be covered as post-hospital extended care or outpatient diagnostic or home health services if it could not be covered as an inpatient hospital service. An individual would be eligible for 60 days of hospital care and 60 days of post-hospital extended care in each benefit period. A new benefit period could not begin until 90 days had elapsed in which the patient was neither in a hospital nor in an extended care facility. The 90 days need not be consecutive, but they must fall within a period of not more than 180 consecutive days. Free Choice of Physician and Hospital Under the bill, no change would be made in the freedom of choice of physician and hospital. No service performed by any physician at either home or office, and no fee he charges for such services, would be involved or affected. No supervision or control over the practice of medicine by any physician or over the manner in which services are provided by any hospital is permitted. Basis of Reimbursement Payment of bills for hospital and related services would be made in generally the same manner as is now customary in Blue Cross plans. Pay\u00ad ments to the providers of service would be made on the basis of the reasonable cost incurred in providing care for beneficiaries. A provider of services could not charge the beneficiary for services which would be covered under the program, except, of course, that the provider could charge the patient the deductible amounts and extra charges for a private room, unless medically necessary, or private duty nursing. Administration Responsibility for administration of the program (except for railroad retirement annuitants and pensioners) would rest with the Secretary. But the Secretary would use appropriate State agencies and private organiza\u00ad tions to assist in administration. Provision would be made for the establishment of an Advisory Council which would advise the Secretary on policy matters in connection with administration. 3 The administration of' provisions for determining the eligibility of providers of services to participate in the program would be divided among the Federal Government, the States, and. private agencies. Under the bill, conditions of participation for providers of services related to health and safety, in addition to those spelled out in the proposal,, could be established. Before formulating any such conditions the Secretary would consult with appropriate State agencies and recognized national accrediting bodies. In any case, these conditions for hospitals could not be more strict than those required for accreditation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. Accreditation by the Joint Commission would be accepted as meet\u00ad ing all requirements for hospital participation save the requirement that it have a utilization review plan. State agencies would be used in the administration to inspect the providers of service to determine whether or not they meet the specified conditions and are eligible to participate. Role of Private Organizations Any group of hospitals--or group of other providers of covered services-\u00ad could designate a private organization of their own choice, such as Blue Cross, to receive bills for services and to pay these bills for whichever of their members prefer such an arrangement. The Secretary would be able to delegate administrative functions involving relationships with hospitals. Financing A special hospital insurance trust fund would be established for the program. Into the trust fund would be allocated 0.60 percent of taxable wages paid in 1966; 0.76 percent of taxable wages paid in 1967 and 1968; and 0.90 percent of taxable wages paid thereafter. Allocations of 0145, 0.57 and 0.675 percent of self-employment income taxable under social security would be made, respectively, in the taxable years 1966, 1967-68, and 1969 and thereafter. The following examples illustrate the cost of the hospital insurance for the aged program to the employee in 1969 and thereafter (his employer would pay an equal amount): An employee earning $3,000, the average taxable wage per employee, would pay $13.50 a year; an employee earning $4,000 would pay $18.00 a year; one earning $4,800 would pay $21.60 a year; and an employee earning $5,600 a year, the maximum earnings subject to contributions under the bill, would pay $25.20 a year. The cost of providing hospital and related benefits to people who do not meet the regular social security insured status requirement would be met from general revenues. Complementary Private Insurance The bill authorizes creation of associations of private insurance carriers, exempt from anti-trust laws, to sell, on a nonprofit basis,\" approved policies covering health costs not covered under the social security hospital insurance program. '4 Title II--Social Security Amendments of 1965 Seven-Percent Benefit Increase The bill would provide a 7 percent across-the-board benefit increase, effective with respect to all social security insurance benefit payments which would be due for months after December 1964. Increases would thus go to each of the more than 20 million social security beneficiaries on the rolls. The -maximum benefit amount for a family would be increased to $312 per month when the increase in the earnings base (now $4,8o0) to $5,600 would have its full effect on benefits. Also, in the future, the maximum indi\u00ad vidual benefit (now $127) would be increased to $149.90., because of the combined effect of the 7 percent across-the-board increase and the increase in the earnings base. Contribution and Benefit Base Under the bill the contribution and benefit base would be increased from $4,800 to $5,600 (effective for any calendar year after 1965). Tax Rate The tax rate schedule under existing law and the revised schedule that would be provided by the bill follow: Employee-Employer Rate (Each) Self-Employed Rate Years Present Law Proposal Present Law Proposal 1966-67 4.125 4.25 6.2 6.4 19,68-70 4.625 5.0 6.9 7.5 1971 and 4.625 5.2 6.9 7.8 after Improvement of Actuarial Status of Disability Insurance Trust Fund The financing of the disability insurance trust fund would be strengthened by allocating an additional 0.17 percent of taxable wages (and a corre\u00ad sponding proportion of taxable self-employment income) to it. Such a reallocation of contribution income between the disability insurance trust fund and the old-age and survivors insurance trust fund would not affect the over-all actuarial balance of the program, but rather it would provide a more reasonable distribution of such income between the two trust funds. Automatic Annual Recomputation of Benefits The bill would provide for annual automatic recomputation of benefits to take account of earnings after entitlement. 5 Coverage Provisions The bill would make several changes in existing law with respect to coverage requirements, so as to expand the coverage of the existing social security program in the direction of more universal coverage of all individuals. Doctors of Medicine and Interns: The bill would remove the exclusion in existing law with respect to self-employed doctors of medicine and interns. Thus, about 170,000 such individuals who are presently excluded would be covered under the system, effective with taxable years ending after December 31, 1965. Cash Tips and Gratuities: The bill would provide for the coverage, as wages, of cash tips received by an employee in the course of his employ\u00ad ment; however, tips received by an employee which do not amount to a total of $20 a month in connection with his work for any one employer would not be covered. The employee would be required to report to his employer in writing the amount of tips received and the employer would report the employee's tips along with the employee's regular wages. The employer would be required to withhold the employee' s social security taxes and pay the employer tax only on tips reported by the employee to him. He would also be required to withhold income tax on such reported tips. If the employee did not report his tips to his employer within 10 days after the end of the month involved, the employer would have no liability. In such a case the employee alone would be liable for the amount of the combined tax (employee and employer) which should be paid. This amendment would apply only with respect to taxable years ending after December 31, 1965. Extension of period for filing proof of support and application for lump-sum death benefit The proposal would remove the present two-year limit on the additional period within which proof of support and application for~the lump-sum death payment can be filed 'whenthere is good cause for failure to file within the basic two-year period. 6 TITLE III--Public Assistance Amendments of 1965 Increased Federal Payments The matching formula for the needy aged, blind, and disabled (and for the combined program, title XVI) would be revised to provide a Federal share of $31 out of the first $37 (now 29/35ths of the first $35) of average monthly assistance per recipient and the maximum average matched would be increased to $75 (now $70). The bill would also revise the matching formula for aid to families with dependent children so as to provide a Federal share of 5/6ths of the first $18 (now 14./17ths of the first $17) and would increase the maximum matched to $32 (now $30). A provision is included so that States will not receive additional Federal funds except to the extent they pass them on to individual recipients. Earnings Under OAA The earnings which may be excluded in determining eligibility of'the aged for cash assistance would be increased so that a State may, at its option, exempt the first $20 (now $10) and one-half of the next $60 (now $iio) of a recipient's monthly earnings. Removal of Mental Disease and Tuberculosis Limitations The bill would remove the exclusion from Federal matching in old-age assistance and medical assistance for the aged programs (and for the combined program, title XVI) as to aged individuals who are patients in institutions for tuberculosis or mental diseases, or who have been diagnosed as having tuberculosis or psychosis and, as a result, are patients in a medical institution. As a condition of Federal partici\u00ad pation in such payments to, or for, mental patients, certain agreements and arrangements to assure that better care results from the additional Federal money would be required. The bill provides that States will receive no more in Federal funds under this provision than they increase their expenditures for mental health purposes under public health and public welfare program. Eligibility for MAA The bill would modify the eligibility requirements for medical assistance for the aged so as to allow Federal sharing in MAA with respect to aged recipients of cash assistance in the same month provided it was a month in which they were admitted to or discharged from a medical institution. Protective Payments The bill would add a provision under which, for protective purposes, pay\u00ad ments could be made to third persons on behalf of old-age assistance recipients (and recipients under the combined title XVI program) rather than directly to the recipients when these recipients are unable to manage thieir money because of physical or mental incapacity. 89 TH CONGRESS 1ST SE~SSION s IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES JANUARY 6, 1965 Mr. AiNDR11sox (for himself, Mr. GOiRE, Mr. JAVfrs, Mr. Bmim, BREWSTER, Mr. BUIWDicK, Mr. CASE, Mr. CHURCH, Mr. CLAiiK, Mr. DODD, Air.

RIBICOFF, Mrt. TYDINGS, Mr. WILLIAms of New Jersey, Mr. YARBOROUGH, and Mr. YouNG of Ohio I send to the desk, for appropriate reference, a bill to provide a hospital insurance program for the aged under social security, to increase social security cash benefits and to make other needed improvements in the social sec-urity program. I ask 'unanimous consent that the bill be permitted to lie on the desk for 3 days so that Senators who wish to do so may join as cosponsors. \u00ad The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill will be received and appropriately referred and, without objection, the bill will lie -at the table for 3 days, as re- quested by the Senator from New Mexico. The bill (S. 1) to provide a hospital in- surance program for the aged under social security, to amend the Federal old-age, survivors, and disability in- surance system to increase benefits, im- prove the actuarial status. of the dis- ability insurance trust fund, and extend coverage, to amend the Social Security Act to provide additional Federal finan- cial participation in the Federal-State public assistance programs, and for other purposes; introduced by Mr. ANq- DERSON (for himself and other Senators), was received, read twice by its title, and referred to the Committee on Finance, Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. President, I feel certain that historians will mark this year as the turning point in our long struggle to solve the major part of what has become one of the most urgent issues of public policy-the problem of fInanc- Ing the costs of hospital care for the aged, costs wl.ich now represent the major remaining cause of personal finan- 'cial disaster among our aged citizens. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that my bill is designed S. 1, for as one of the major pieces of unfinished business of the previous Congress, social security hospital Insurance has moved to the fore- front of public policy debate, and has unquestionably become a major legisla- tive item on the agenda of this Congress. As Senators will immediately recog- nilze, the bill I have introduced is sub- stantially the same bill which the Senate passed last September 2, by a vote of 49 to 44. I am again proposing the social insurance approach because the need of the aged 'for adequate insurance protec- tion against the costs of expensive illness has not diminished; if anything, the need grows greater and more urgent with each passing day. As the proportion of the aged in the population continues to rise, the problem increases in dimension and the plight of our aged citizens be- comes increasingly a humiliation for our society, Every month that we delay in provid- Ing the needed protection means that more and more elderly persons will be forced to look to public welfare programsfor help in getting the health care they need. Such programs necessarily do lit-prove he can no longer pay his own way. The real tragedy is the hopelessness of his situation, for once an aged personhas exhausted his resources to the point where he can qualify for assistance, It is practically impossible for him to re- plenish them and again become self-reliant, Nostalgic statements about the virtues of individual responsibility for all of one's needs, about the rewards and joys of old age are no substitutes for concrete facts and reasoned programs. For those aged Americans who must face the harsh reality that they many well be reduced to a state of destitution as a result of a prolonged illness-which experience demonstrates that most aged people can expect to occur-benign assurances of those who urge greater thrift or sole re- liance on public assistance and those who tell us private insurance alone can do the job, have a hollow ring. The problem which confronts our sen- ior citizens requires little further docu-mentation-this problem has probably attracted more public attention and in- tensive study than any other current domestic issue. Since 1946, the average cost for 1 day of hospital care has risen from $9 to nearly $40. This situation is compounded by the fact that the agedhospital patient, on the average, spends three times as long in the hospital as a younger person. To make things worse, 55 percent of these aged have annual in- comes of less than $1,000. In their working years, when sickness is less frequent, workers can generally meet costs of current care for themselves and their families-directly or through insurance-out of their current employ- ment income. The aged, however, gen- erally cannot do this because the higher costs associated with old age occur at the very time income is greatly reduced because of retirement, Private health insurance, which has made large health costs manageable for people in the working groups, has not proved to be an effective means of pro- tecting older people against, financial ruin. Despite great efforts and much ingenuity on the part of the voluntary insurance organizations, today only a relatively few older people-perhaps 1 in 20-have insurance covering as much as 40 percent of their average health costs. Almost half of the elderly have no health insurance at all-not even inadequate coverage. The number of older people without any health insur- ance protection at all is nearly as large as it was 5 years ago. Most of the aged who now have some form of health insurance are those who are still working, those in good health, and those in the higher income group, Thus, it is extremely unlikely that many of the elderly people who are not now insured will ever have meaningful health insurance protection through private sources. The result is that an individually written policy for the aged. may cost four times as much as comparable protection fur-. nished under a group coverage plan to younger people. The conclusion appears inescapable. The only solution is to provide a system under which people can contribute from earnings during their working Years to help pay for hospital care and related services that will be needed later on when the risk is higher and income curtailed. The only way such a system can be set up to guarantee that practically every\u00ad one will have hospital insurance protec\u00ad tion in old age is by applying the social insurance method. This is the system that has proved its effectiveness over 3 decades of the social security retire\u00ad ment program. Mr. President, this week the Advisory Council on Social Security, a distin\u00ad guished group of business, labor and pro\u00ad fessional leaders, including a former member of President Eisenhower's Cabi\u00ad net and a former high official in that Re\u00ad publican administration, recommended a Government program of hospital and hospital-related-care insurance. I am in complete agreement with the Advisory Council on Social Security that social'insurance should not cover all the costs of illness during old age. The American approach to income security has traditionally involved a cooperative partnership of private effort and govern\u00ad mental measures. Old-age, survivors, and disability insurance, for example, is supplemented by employer and trade union plans, by private insurance, and by individual savings and investments, and all contribute to the common goal of personal and economic independence throughout the later years. Backing up this combination of measures for indi\u00ad vidual self-support are the Federal-State public assistance programs which aid those who have needs which are still unmet. I believe that this same pluralistic ap\u00ad proach can be used effectively in meeting the costs of major illness in old age. With social insurance meeting, on the average, at least half the costs associated with the most expensive illnesses-that Is, meeting the costs of hospitalization- the older person will be In a much better position than he is today to meet, on his own and through private insurance, the costs of physician services, drugs, and other medical supplies and services. Also, with social insurance providing basic protection, it should be practicable to improve the Federal-State public as\u00ad sistance programs so as to meet more fully the health costs incurred by older people whose needs are not fully met in other ways, the Advisory Council. on So\u00ad cial Security declared. ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN The hospital insurance plan embodied in my bill places primary emphasis on coverage of hospital care. The rea\u00adson for this emphasis is clear in the sons who reach age 65. 9 will be hospitalized at least once during their remaining years and most will be hospitalized two or more times. In the case of aged couples, the ecaue tey tle o rliee elpthe inigecyt~etoreieendgecybeaue he hlp While the much higher hospital costsolder people meet their health care costs of older people as compared with youngeronly after they have used up most of the people is the major reason why hospitalfinancial resources they may have, and insurance rates are higher for the aged, somtiesony cilre hvethe cost of such insurance is further in ftr tei demonstrated that they cannot help fur- creased for most older people because Of ther.

While medical care costs for all aged couplesaveraged about 8442 in 1962, the medical expenses Of aged couples with one or both members hospitalized averaged 81,220; fornonmnarried elderly people, average medical expenses for the year were $270. whereas for those who were hospitalized.-the average was $1,038. Both the averages and the differen-tials would be even higher now. While the greater part of the benefit cost of the program would be for hospitalbenefits, the Proposal also provides coy- erage for three additional types of serv- Ices: First, extended care following hos-pital care in an institution which is equipped to provide high quality con- valescent services and which has an ar- rangement with a hospital for a timelytransfer of Patients and needed medical information; second, home health care services which are furnished by qualified nurses and other specialized medical per- sonnel under a plan established by a Physician covering the use of such serv- ices; and third, hospital outpatient diag- nostic services covering the full use of the hospital's facilities and personnel but not covering the diagnostic services of the patient's private physician, A major consideration that guided the selection of services to be covered by the Plan Was that the program should sup-Port the principle that, in each case,health services should be tailored to the health needs of the patient, Provision for the aforementioned four types of beniefits-hospital care, extended care outside the hospital, organized home nursing care, and hospital outpatient diagnostic services-would make avail-able to the older person the kinds of services appropriate for his individual situation. The benefit structure would thus offer a continuum of institutional and home nursing services and would permit the progressive care of individ-uals who require extended care of a somewhat lesser degree of intensity than that provided for hospital inpatients. Particularly for the aged, the next stepin the care of a person who had been hospitalized for a serious illness may be a period of medically supervised treat- mnent In an extended-care facility rather than the intensive care furnished to hos-pital inpatients. The coverage of Im- portant alternatives to hospitalization would remove some of the undesirable financial considerations from the deci-sion, shared In by the doctor, patient,patient's family and institution, on whether inpatient hospital care or an-other form of care would be best for the patient. The benefits provided in the bill would give financial support to the provision of institutional and nonin-stitutional services' at the most appro-priate level of intensity for patients who require care of extended duration. Covering each of the stages of required care is conducive to careful planning of the long-range treatment of those suffer-Ing serious illnesses. Mr. President, the hospital insurance program provided for in my bill is the culminatioanyo yearslof sicusin sthdy.Agramaypolicuigtoewwho have had objections to one or an-other element of the original proposal,have made a constructive contribution to public understanding of the issues and the formulation of my bill. I have had the benefit of extensive research and study by many experts, within and without the Government. .Independent groups of responsible and knowledgeablerepresentatives of all segments of our Community, like the National Committee on Health Costs of the Aged, sponsored by my colleague, Senator JAVITS, and di- rected by Dr. Arthur Flemming, a former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, have contributed greatly to the fund of knowledge from which I have drawn heavily in preparing my proposal. Moreover, as everyone knows, my pro- posal has been subjected to thorough scrutiny by public and private expertsin insurance, medical economics, and medical care, by committees in both the House and Senate in public hearings and executive sessions, on the floor of the Senate and in conference committee. It has been so shaped and molded in this process that it is fair to say that my bill is the product of an extended, and I believe fruitful, joint effort of scientific research, professional study, an~d public discussion. It Is medically, socially, and financially sound. The list of sponsors. and supporters shows it is bipartisan, Mr. President, even though my pro-posal has now gained such widespread support that I believe its enactment this session is virtually assured, I must saythat we have never ceased trying to per- fect the proposal. Throughout the years of study and deliberation we have sought to preserve an open mind on all elements of the proposal, and we have welcomed constructive comments and criticisms from any source whatever. I believe that our hopes for a sound and justsolution are more likely to be realized because we have taken nothing for granted, left no stone unturned in our search for a sound and meaningful solu-tion to the Problem. The few changes which have been made in the present bill are a result of recommendations which emerged from the deliberations of the Advisory Council on Social Secu-rity and the advice of professional people whose sole interest is to improve the Proposal. The bill, as I have indicated, provides coverage for services furnished in ex- tended care facilities. I agree with the Advisory Council on Social Security that it is necessary to assure the coverage of facilities which are designed primarily to render convalescent services. services of this kind are essential in the overall treatment of many illnesses, includingterminal illnesses, following their acute stage and prior to the time when a per-son can be transferred to his home or to a custodial institution. The bill also pro-vides, as recommended by the Advisory Council, for coverage of hospital care for up to 60 days without a beneficiaryoption. A change has also been made in the utilization review provision to make it clear that reviews conducted by a group etbihdb aloameilscet estadblsed byetal asloal mledicaltoivetyldbacpalesanlentveohospital staff review. in addition, the bill incorporates the proposal to authorize the creation of as\u00adsociations of private insurers to encour\u00adage the development of policies coveringcosts-primarily physician's fees-not met under the Government program. have always tried to assure ample room for private complementary insurance and to provide encouragement for privateinsurers to assume that role. This sug\u00adgestion is therefore a welcome and bene\u00ad ficial addition to the bill. Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD immediately following my statement ma\u00adterial describing the provisions of S. 1. This will include actuarial tables show\u00ad ing the financial status of the social secu\u00adrity system under my bill. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With\u00adout objection, it is so ordered. (See exhibit 1.) Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. President, our 'social insurance system has shown a re\u00ad markable facility for improvement. It has effectively met the successive chal\u00ad lenges involved in the monumental task of providing Americans with protection against some of the major threats to their financial security-loss of Income due to old age, death, or disability. Our social insurance system is a true prod\u00ad uct of the American temper-flexible,humane, responsive to the changing needs of our people and fiscally sound. Despite the anxieties that were expressed in the early days of social security and as improvements were proposed, the pro\u00adgram has performed well every task as\u00ad signed to It. When the disability pro\u00adgram was initiated we took another step toward Preserving individual independ\u00ad ence and security in the face of the severest catastrophes In life. As one physician has said: The fear of Insecurity In old age today has supplanted the fear of death in 1900. We in this Congress must take the remaining major step to relieve in\u00ad security in old age without imposing Federal control over the practice of medicine. Providing a social securityhospital insurance program for the aged Is the only way that we can effectively combine the special contributions of dif\u00adferent elements of the community, pub\u00adlic and Private, to meet this goal. Mr. President, in addition to hospital Insurance for the aged, S. 1 provides for a 7-percent increase in monthiy case benefits for some 20 million social se\u00ad curity beneficiaries. Had the conference committee reached agreement last Oc\u00adtober on hospital insurance, these bene\u00adficiaries would have received increased benefits beginning January 1, 1965. Mybill provides that on passage monthly benefits would be retroactive to that date. In this way, those of us who would not accept a social security bill in con\u00adference that did not include hospital in\u00ad surance and thus barred an increase in cash benefits will be keeping faith with America's aged.

They recommended aninsurance program, under social se- curity, to help Americans pay their health bills by paying their premiums during the years when they are best able to do so. The fact is that expensive illnesses are much more likely and frequent in old ae vr er n u fsxproseeysaeaae vr er n u fsxproseeysaea over 65 is hospitalized. Nearly everyone who reaches age 65 is hospitalized at least once during his later years and most are hospitalized two or more times. On the average, an older person requires almost three times as much hospital care a younger one, Yet, over the last decade, costs of medical care have risen 36 percent and hospitalization expenses have risen 65 percent. The median income of aged culsi 92wsol 285 ayoculsi 92wsol 285 ayopeople, especially in rural areas, must get along on a fraction of that amount. For -cerned many people who might otherwise have supported it on the ground that the process of political \"bidding up\" might cause a far greater intrusion, in their view, into the health field by the govern\u00adment than would be justified either by the social security taxes which were be\u00ad ing paid or by the preservation of the integrity of the doctor-patient relation\u00adship. The private sector amendment tiould provide a built-in guarantee that at fotwudb aetfotwudb aet do that. The private enterprise system can compete in carrying the additional responsibility, and it seems to me that that is one of the surest guarantees and assurances to those who might have some doubts on the question as to whether the tendency will be to limit the Federal Government's role very strongly to the hospitalization provision.Second, the provision would follow the concept gd ae pntericmsh gd reasonable premium for health care coverage-and these are the them, a major ilns11 ee al rIpratwrs-hni saddt similar accident can wipe out the savings of a lifetime because they are no longerable to go to work and use their earning power to replenish savings. Today there are over 18 million per- sons age 65 or older in the United States. These senior citizens deserve and are entitled to the best health care in their later years that our Nation can give the hospitalization feature under social security, which is the most expensiveelement of the whole program.Then, at a modest cost, a possibility would be opened. A great committee which I inspired, which was headed byArthur Flemming, former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, spent a year studying the subject and reported Security. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator from New Mextlco [Mr. ANDERSON) and others in cosponsoring this bill, S. 1 providing hospital and nursing home care for older citizens. It very rightly has priority in the legislative work of the 89th Con- gress because it presents a reasonable and practical solution to the health prob- lems and worries of senior Americans. This bill offers a workable combination of social security protection, private in- surance help, and Federal Government backing. It is based on the sound con--- cept of insurance Programs-that an in- dividual pays a relatively small amount regularly-no more than 5.2 percent of his earnings for all social security cover- age including the added medical bene- fits-throughout his working life. His employer pays the same amount. Then when he retires, he has what amounts to a paid-up insurance policy to cover the hospital expenses that may arise later in life when his income will be smaller but his health expenses will probably be greater. This pay-as-you-go insurance program is a typical example of the prac- tical approach to national- problems which has characterized American growth from earliest pioneer days. It offers people a chance to be self-sufficient without denying them the opportunity to select their own doctors, their own hos- pitals, and their own private insur- ance to supplement the basic social security payments If they wish. This approach was enthusiastically endorsed by the Advisory Council on social Security In its recent report. With only one dissenting voice, the cam-SBasis recommended by Advisory Council on Socialwil them. These citizens are able andwl-acotitharaf$2presnpr ing to pay for such care-not in sudden catastrophic medical bills, during their later years but in regular annual insur- ance payments, through their working years, under the social security system. That is the approach that this bill offers. It has been carefully studied, re- vised, and improved over the last few years. Now, I believe it is a sound plan to help people help themselves, to reduce dependence on welfare and means tests, and to provide better health care for our senior citizens. I am very glad to co- sponsor S. 1. THE PRIVATE SECTOR OF MDCR MEIAEthe Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I assure Senators that I shall take only a mo- ment. I appreciate the presence In the Chamber of the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. ANDERSON], because today he introduced the administration's bill for medical care for the aged, in which I feel it an honor to have joined with MY colleagues the Senator from New Jer- sey [Mr. CASE], and the Senator from California [Mr. KuCHzL]. Mr. President, as introduced, the bill contains the private sector amendment which has been identified with my name. I believe that that fact has not been ade- quately noted in respect to the introduc- tion of the bill today. I believe that it should be very carefully noted because It is a critically important part of the bill. The reason is the following: First, the bill originally, as the King- Anderson bill, provided a limited amount of health care-with nothing more-in the form of hospitalization, and con-acotntharaf 2presnprmonth, which would come within the competence of 80 percent of the aged, leaving the other 20 percent, to the pos\u00ad sibility of the Kerr-Mills bill, if need be. In that way, in the bill introduced by the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. AN\u00ad DERSONI and many other Senators there would be presented a complete program for health care for the aged with a mag\u00ad nificent role for the private sector. Here is the important point, and upon this note I wish to conclude: In my judgment, the proposal offers one of the most challenging opportunities ever ex\u00ad tended to the insurance companies of the United States. The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. ANDERSON] is himself in insurance business and is fully cog\u00ad nizant of it. Something must be done about the problem of medical care for the aged. If we are to keep Govern\u00ad ment within reasonable limits, and 'if we are to keep the social security tax within reasonable limits, only a rela\u00ad tively modest amount can be done by Government. That amount is estimated at about 30 percent of the total cost of health care for the aged. The overwhelming bulk of it must be done by the private enterprise system. I say to all Senators, especially to the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. ANDER\u00ad SON], that at the time when we con\u00ad sider the measur'e-and I have no doubt that this is the most auspicious time we have ever had for its consideration- I shall do everything I can, and I hope other Senators will feel exactly the same way-to bring about a situation in which, when the measure is passed, we shall have before us at one and the same time a Proposal from the great insurers 178 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE January 6 of the united states to pick up the pri-vate sector option and really make the bill operative, so as to provide not only linited health care and hsi hsialization, but total health care, that the over-whelming bulk of the older people,especially people over 65 years of age, can pay for. Mr. ANDERSON. Mr. President, will the Senator from New York yield? Mr. JVITSI yeld.FederalMr. AVIS.Iyied.Mr. ANDERSON. ntorI say to the Senao from New York that the panel which he inspired, organized, and had established was a helpful group, Many of us had tried to find a solu-tion to this problem by seeking a way to encourage insurance companies to par-care plan for the aging are Incorporated In the bill which we will cosponsor. They are: (1) Inclusion of the estimated 2'A mil\u00adlion Americana over 65 not covered by thesocial security system; (2) provision for par\u00adticipation by the private Insurance industry, to make up total health care; (3) provisionfor use of approved private organizations and State bodies In the adminlstratilon of the program; and (4) establishment of a separatehealth'insurance trust fund into which aUl health care funds shall be deposited.We consider the chances for passage of thisbill to be auspicious in this session. We consider the effort to be bipartisan, as It was the private sector provision which providedthat Republican support in 1964 and pro\u00advided the margin required to pas the Ander\u00adson-Gore-Javits amendment in the Senate. We believe this Is the timeticiateIn edlcal areproram ~teffective program to provide anhe for medical for the te n car ticiate meica prgram itaging fully consistent withwas very difficult; ment the encourage-but the panel which the able Senator from New York assem-bled, including Marion B. Folsom, Arthur Larsen, and Arthur Flemming-many of them of a different political belief from my own-have devised a wonderful pro-gram, made great contributions, and reached conclusions with which, al-though I may not finally agree withthem, were the result of a search for a good solution. Many times I have commended pri.-vately, and also in public, the able senior Senator from New York for bringing to-gether this group of men, to make cer-tain that their contributions were ready,Since they were ready, we tried to draft a bill this Year, and we hope that when the bill is finally passed, it will contain the very fine provisions that the Javits panel has worked out. Mr. JAVITS. I am grateful to the Senator from New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous con\u00adsent to have printed as a part of my re\u00admarks a statement issued by the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. CASE], the Senator from California [Mr. KUCHEL], and my\u00adself on yesterday with reference to our cosponsorship. There being no objection, the state\u00adment was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: JOINT STATEMENT BY SENATOPS CASE, JTAvrTs, AND RUCHEm. To MinxcssE BILLz We are Proposing to cosponsor the ad\u00admidnistration's bill for medical care for the aged because we believe it is in substance theplan which passed the Senate in the last session. It contains a major role for the private sector In affording not only limited hospital care under social security financing,but providing the opportunity for total health care for all aging citizens. We consider this plan to be creative and constructive. Such a major role in medical care for the aging on the part of the private sector was the basjes of the Republican initiative taken inthe introduction of our public-private medi\u00adcal care for the aging bill in the last,Congress. T'he private sector provision of the current bill allows private insurance carriers and health service groups to cover medical and surgical costs on a nonprofit basis over and above the limited hospital insurance of the King-Anderson bill, and on a basis of cost low enough to be available to the overwhelm\u00ading majority of our aging citizens. This private sector provision also acts as a built-in Governor against unlimited Federal expan\u00adsion In the medical care for the aging field. The four points which we have long felt should be Included in an acceptable medical of private enterprise, the satisfaction of the national need and the protection against excesses. We believe also that the fundamental structure which this bill pro\u00ad vides is the sound basis upon which private sector interest in medical care for the aging can be enlisted in the total effort.Other Republican Senators are also givingconsideration to cosponsoring this measure. Mr. MONRONEY. I thank the dis\u00adtinguished Senator from New York for his thoughtful approach to this subject.It does much to provide a goad bill and affords an Opportunity to the medical profession to have a privately operated program that can function in harmonywith the proposal which will be made in the Gore amendment to modify the King-.Anderson bill. STATEMENT by Anthony J. Celebrezze Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare before the Committee on Ways and Means on H. R. 1 Hospital Insurance, Social Security, and Public Assistance Amendments of 1965 Wednesday, January 27, 1965 Mr. Chairman: H. R. 1, introduced by the distinguished gentleman from California, Mr. King, incorporates the recommendations of the Administration for changes in the Social Security Act. The bill would establish a program of social insurance for hospital and related care for the aged; it would provide a 7 percent increase in cash benefits and other\u00ad wise improve the benefit and coverage provisions and the financing structure of the Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance system; and it would provide for improvements in the Federal-State public assistance programs. This Committee has heard many hours of public testimony on the proposed hospital insurance in the last 15 months. And there have been a number of studies of the problem by advisory groups, most recently by the Advisory Council on Social Security. Therefore, I will not go into great length on the data substantiating the need for a program of hospital insurance for the aged. Rather, I will summarize the reasons why we support the plan. Basically we urge this program because most elderly people have such modest financial resources that they can neither afford to pay the large expenses accompanying the serious illnesses often occurring in old-age nor afford the cost of adequate insurance against large health expenses. Their incomes are typically one-half as large as the incomes of people under 65 in families of the same size whereas the reduction in the cost of living in retirement is only about 10 to 15 percent. While their incomes are low, the health expenditures of people past 65 are very high--twice as high as those of younger people. In the case of expenditures for hospitalization, the ratio is 2-3/4 to one. Because of their high health costs and because it must usually be sold on an individual rather than a group basis, health insurance for the elderly is necessarily expensive. This can be seen from the rates charged by the \"State-65\"1 plans which are now available in eight states. Under the State-65 policies, administrative and other nonbenefit costs are kept as low as possible. Yet the policies that provide relatively broad coverage-\u00ad perhaps 40 percent of all health costs of the aged are covered under these policies compared with perhaps 20 percent under many widely held commercial policies-\u00ad are very expensive. Under these plans the cost ranges from $420 per year for an elderly couple in Massachusetts to $540 in California, Ohio and New York, amounts which equal 15 to 20 percent of the total income of the typical older couple. In most States, this type of relatively comprehensive protection furnished in as economical a manner as possible is not available at all. -2\u00ad In view of the disparity between their incomes and health insurance costs, it is not surprising that only a little over half of the elderly have any health insurance at all and that many of those who do have some protection have very inadequate protection covering, say, only 50 to 60 percent of hospital charges plus partial allowance for physicians' service in a hospital. Over the past several years, a large and growing proportion of those applying for public aid have been forced to do so only because they cannot meet their health costs. Some three-fifths of the'aged going on public assistance--Old Age Assistance (OAA) and Medical Assistance for the Aged (MAA) together--do so because of health costs. Today over one-third of all public assistance expenditures for the aged are for health costs. We believe that prevention of dependency and destitution through social insurance is greatly to be preferred to confining governmental effort to the relief of poverty after older people, and in many cases their children, have demonstrated that they are no longer able to get along on their own. It seems to us that this principle--the preference for the prevention of poverty--applies as well to providing protection against the high and unpredictable costs of hospital and related care as it does to the provision of regular cash benefits under social security. The proposed program would follow the social security approach. People would contribute from earnings during their working years, when their incomes are highest, and have protection against the costs of hospital and related services after age 65 without having to pay contributions at the time when income is generally curtailed. The proposal is a necessary extension of the monthly cash benefits of social security and adding this protection to cash benefits is the only practical way that economic security can be furnished in old age. Monthly cash benefits alone cannot do the whole job. Such benefits can be effective in helping the elderly to meet the regular, recurring expenses of food, clothing, and shelter but monthly cash benefits cannot practically be made high enough to meet the unbudgetable cost of expensive illness. For this purpose it is necessary to have an insurance program aimed directly at the cost of illness. While neither private insurance nor public assistance, alone or together, can meet the pressing need the aged have for protection against the cost of expensive illness, the proposed program contemplates an important role for both. The proposed program will serve as a foundation on which people can build greater protection through private health insurance and employer retirement plans, just as the present social security cash benefit system is serving as a base on which people build additional protection through private means. With basic protection furnished under social security, and taking into account the role of private insurance, public assistance will be able to assume the role most appropriate for it--that of a program intended for members of -3\u00ad the relatively small group whose hospital needs and circumstances are such that they are unable to meet their health costs through a combination of social and private insurance and individual savings. Hospital Insurance Provisions The hospital insurance provisions of H. R. 1 are largely the same as those in the proposed Social Security Amendments of 1964 as passed last year by the Senate. The proposal however has been subjected to continuing study both within and out\u00ad side Government. Helpful suggestions, leading to a number of changes, were made during the legislative consideration of the bill last year as well as by the Advisory Council on Social Security and other groups and individuals. The current proposal follows a recommendation of the Advisory Council in providing a single package of benefits rather than having older people make a choice among alternative hospital benefit plans with different duration and deductible provisions. Two of the options previously included had deductibles and one did not; in this bill there is a flat deductible for hospital insurance equal to the national average daily cost of hospital care and a deductible of one- half that amount for outpatient diagnostic services. The maximum number of days provided for hospital care in this bill also follows the Advisory Council recommendation for a 60-day maximum. The bill follows another recommendation of the Council in providing for financing that would'cover a substantially larger increase in hospital costs in the next 10 years than had been contemplated in our previous discussion with this Committee. The current bill, through the device of designating the care as \"post-hospital extended care, \" would also more clearly differentiate the post-hospital skilled nursing and rehabilitative care that is intended to be covered from the long-term custodial care furnished in many nursing homes. The bill would make it easier for these facilities to participate in the program. It would do so by substituting for the requirement of affiliation with a hospital a new provision that would require only that the extended care facility have an agreement for the timely transfer of patients and medical information. The cost-sharing provision contained in the Senate bill last year has not been included in the new bill. A new provision has been included that would result in the separate identification of the contributions made toward hospital insurance. Under this provision the W-2, or such other receipt as is required, would show the proportion of social security contributions going into the hospital insurance fund so that each employee would know the cost of the hospital coverage to him. I would like now to discuss with you the major provisions of the hospital insurance title of H. R. 1. Eligibility Under the bill, hospital insurance protection would be provided for all people who are age 65 and over and entitled to monthly social security benefits or to benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act. In addition, with the cost borne by general revenues, protection would be provided under a special transitional provision of the -4\u00ad plan for people now nearing or past age 65 who are not eligible for benefits under these systems. Congress has already provided a health benefit plan for both active and retired Federal employees so that these employees would not be included in this special provision. The few others not included in the transitional plan are aliens with less than 10 years of residence in the United States and members of subversive organizations. Of the 19 million people over 65 in July 1966, just about all, therefore, would be protected against hospital costs: about 16 2/3 million would be covered as persons eligible under the old-age and survivors insurance or railroad retirement programs, about 400, 000 would be eligible for protection under the Civil Service Retirement plan and about 2 million would be covered under the general revenue provisions in H. R. 1. Benefits The major focus of the protection under the bill is on the cost of hospitalization. In addition the bill provides protection against the cost of three other types of services, which can in many cases be a less expensive substitute for inpatient hospital care. The four types of benefits that would be payable under the bill are: (1) inpatient hospital services for up to 60 days in a benefit period, subject to a flat deductible amount equal to the national average daily cost of hospital care-\u00ad about $40 at the beginning, with provision being made to adjust this to keep a constant relationship between the deductible and hospital costs; (2) _post-hospital extended care benefits for up to 60 days following hospitalization; (3) organized home health services for up to 240 visits in a year to a homebound patient; and (4) hospital outpatient diagnostic services furnished in a thirty-day period, subject to a deductible equal to one-half the deductible amount for inpatient hospital services--about $20 initially. The provision of these four types of benefits will enable the aged beneficiary to have the kinds of services and levels of care most appropriate to his needs and will not create an economic incentive to use hospital bed care unduly. Coverage of extended care will help to achieve prompt hospital discharges because the next appropriate step in the care of a person who has been hospitalized for a serious illness may be a period of convalescence and rehabilitation in an extended care facility rather than continued occupancy of a high-cost bed normally used by an acutely ill hospital patient. In essence, the coverage of important alternatives to inpatient hospital care would help subordinate financial considerations to medical considerations in decisions on whether inpatient hospital care or some other form of care would be best for the patient. One of the keys in determining the nature of the health services that will be paid for under the bill is the type of institution which may participate in the program. The requirements for hospital participation are fully in accord with the established principles and objectives of professional hospital organizations. Hospitals accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals--an organization composed of representatives of the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Associ\u00ad ation, American College of Surgeons and the American College of Physicians-\u00ad would be conclusively presumed to meet all the statutory conditions for participation, -5\u00ad save that for utilization review. Moreover, if the Joint Commission should adopt a requirement for utilization review, accredited hospitals could be presumed to meet all the statutory conditions. Unaccredited hospitals, mostly the smaller institutions, could also participate in the program on meeting certain conditions. They would have to meet the conditions set forth in the bill, which constitute the kind of minimum definition of what a hospital is that is used by the American Hospital Association for listing purposes rather than accreditation purposes, and any additional requirements found necessary with respect to health and safety. These health and safety requirements could be no more strict than those used by the Joint Commission on Accreditation. Linking the conditions for participation to the requirements of the Joint Commission provides assurance that only professionally established conditions would have to be met by providers of health services which seek to participate in the program. The proposed program would not cover services furnished in nursing homes generally, many of which are not aimed at providing medical services for curing or rehabilitating the patient but at giving the patient custodial care. The benefits of this program are intended to cover medical services rather than personal care or housing. Participating extended care facilities would therefore have to have adequate nursing care and physician supervision or care as well as to meet necessary health and safety condi\u00ad tions. Extended care facilities would also have to agree with a hospital for the timely transfer of patients and the timely interchange of medical and other informa\u00ad tion about patients transferred between the institutions. This would help to assure the proper level of care as the patient's needs change. All of the institutions and agencies would have to meet State and local licensing requirements in order to be eligible for participation in the program. Hospitals and extended care facilities would have to provide for the review, on a sample or other basis, of their admissions and lengths of stay. In addition, all long stays in a hospital or extended care facility would have to be reviewed. This review would serve the purpose of promoting the most efficient use of services and facilities. The utilization review required is the kind which has been recom\u00ad mended by private groups, such as Blue Cross, State and national medical societies-\u00ad including the American Medical Association and the American Osteopathic Associa\u00ad tion--and State agencies. The utilization review could be conducted by the staff of the hospital. Alternatively, other utilization--review arrangements would be acceptable--review by the local medical society, for example. Moreover, a physician would have to certify, and recertify at times,. the medical necessity of the services provided to the patient. Administration Over-all responsibility for administration of the hospital insurance program would rest with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. The bill provides for the establishment of a 16-member Advisory Council, appointed by the Secretary, to advise him on administrative policy matters. The Secretary would also be required to consult with appropriate State agencies, national and State associations of providers of services, and recognized national accrediting bodies. These efforts would be especially oriented to the development of policies, operational procedures and administrative arrangements of mutual satisfaction to all parties interested in -6\u00ad the program. This consultation at the local and national levels will provide assurance that varying conditions of local and national significance are taken into account. There would be significant roles for State and private agencies in the administration of the proposed program. State governments license health facilities and State public health authorities generally inspect these facilities to determine whether they are conforming with the requirements of the State licensure law. State agencies could, therefore, very appropriately assist the Federal Government in determining what providers of health services meet the appropriate definitions and in furnishing needed consultative services to an institution or agency that has not yet qualified. Private organizations will also play an important role in the administration of the program. Groups of providers, or associations of providers on behalf of their members, could designate an organization, such as Blue Cross, to act as a fiscal intermediary between providers and the Federal Government. The Secretary is authorized to use these agencies for such operations as receiving and reviewing provider bills, determining the amount of payment due and making the payments to the providers of services. In addition, the Secretary could contract with such an organization to perform added administrative duties--for example, auditing provider records and assisting hospitals in the application of utilization safeguards, where there was resultant advantage from simplified operations. Financing The hospital insurance program would be financed by allocating six-tenths of one percent of covered wages paid in 1966; 0. 76 of one percent of covered wages paid in 1967 and 1968; and 0. 90 of one percent of taxable wages paid thereafter, to a special hospital insurance trust fund that would be established for the program. The allocations would be 0. 45, 0. 57, and 0. 675 of one percent in the case of self\u00ad employment income. Contributions would be paid on annual earnings up to $5, 600-\u00ad the proposed new contribution base. The cost of the benefits for persons not insured under the social security or railroad retirement systems would be borne by general revenues. In the first full year of the program, 1967, the cost of benefits to the uninsured is estimated to amount to $255 million, but the Federal savings in MAA & OAA, resulting from hospital benefits to both the insured and uninsured is about $200 million so that the net Federal general revenue cost is about $55 million. Benefits would be payable for covered hospital and related health services furnished beginning July 1, 1966, except for post-hospital extended care, for which the effective date would be January 1, 1967, in order to allow additional time for the provision of these benefits. The allocations to the hospital insurance trust fund from social security contributions would begin on January 1, 1966. The allocation basis for 1966 would thus enable a contingency fund to be built up before benefits become payable in order to assure that from the very beginning the benefits can be paid as they become due. -7\u00ad Under the bill there would be a separate trust fund for the hospital insurance program, in addition to the pres-nWoIF-Iaage and survivors insurance trust fund and the disability insurance trust fund. Under the bill, hospital insurance benefits could be paid only from the hospital insurance trust fund. These financing provisions would cover fully the cost of the proposed program estimated on a basis which makes allowan-ce for future increases in the cost of hospital care. The assumptions underlying the cost estimates are more conserva\u00ad tive than those used in estimating the cost of the hospital insurance bill discussed in the executive sessions of this Committee last year or the bill passed by the Senate last year. We are following assumptions suggested by the Advisory Council on Social Security, which allow for a full 10 years of substantially greater increases in hospital costs than in wages and also for substantially greater increases in hospital costs than other prices indefinitely. I would like to point out that the assumption underlying the cost estimates on the relation of future hospital costs and earnings is that the level of hospital costs will rise more rapidly over the next ten years than the health insurance industry assumed in making their calculations of costs when they testified on the previous Administra\u00ad tion-sponsored hospital insurance bills. The conservative nature of our assumptions is indicated by the fact that the cost estimates also anticipate some increase in hospital usage by the elderly after the bill is enacted. The plan is financed not only to meet the rates figured on these assumptions but also to build up and maintain the contingency reserve. I can assure you that I attach the same great importance to the financial soundness of the proposed program as any member of this Committee. I have asked Mr. Robert J. Myers, Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration, whose sole responsibility it is to make these estimates, to prepare material on the financing of the proposed program and the allowances that have been made for financing rising hospital costs. Mr. Chairman, I ask that his cost estimates for the bill, contained in Actuarial Study No. 59, be distributed for the use of the Committee. Complementary Private Insurance One principle in the formulation of the provisions of the bill is to create a basic bene\u00ad fit program so that private insurance would play the same complementary role to hospital insurance for the aged that it has played under the retirement, death, and disability benefit provisions of the social security program. While the proposed program would pay practically the entire hospital bill, aside from the deductible, for over 95 percent of the hospital stays, it would not cover all of the health costs which should be included if the insured person is to have adequate health insurance protection. To help make available the needed comprehensive protection, the bill authorizes the creation of nonprofit associations of private insurers to develop health benefit plans for aged persons covering costs not met under the Government program. Regardless of what else the plans might cover, to receive the anti-trust exemptions offered under the bill, they would have to cover 75 percent or more of the costs of physicians' services. Except in connection with specific requirements set forth in the law itself, such as the requirement that the operations of the association with -8\u00ad respect to the plan be on a nonprofit basis, there would be no Federal Government regulation of private health insurers as there would have been in earlier proposals of this nature. Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the use of the Committee a detailed explanation of the hospital insurance proposal. Proposed Changes in the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Provisions I would like to discuss now the principal changes that would be made by the bill in the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance provisions. I am submitting for the use of the Committee on Lhis subject also, a supplementary statement containing a complete summary and explanation of the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance provisions. Now, I propose therefore to discuss only the major provisions in the bill. 7-Percent Across-the-Board Increase in Benefit Payments The bill would provide a 7-percent increase in cash benefits to take account of increases in the cost of living. Last year this Committee approved a 5-percent across-the-board benefit increase. The 7-percent increase that the bill would provide retains the percentage-increase principle and follows the general structure of last year's bill, taking into account the changes in the cost of living since 1958, including those which have taken place in the last year. The effect of a 7-percent benefit increase on present and future social security beneficiaries can be seen by comparing the percentage of covered average monthly earnings that is replaced by benefits under present law with the percentage that would be replaced if benefits were increased by 7 percent. At and below the $110 average monthly earnings level, retirement benefits payable at age 65 now replace approximately 59 percent of average earnings and would, under the bill, replace about 63 percent. At the $200 average monthly earnings level (the equivalent of full-time earnings at the Federal minimum wage), the replacement is now 42 percent and, under the bill, would be 45 percent. At the $400 average monthly earnings level, the maximum possible under present law, the percentage replacement is 31 percent under present law and would be 34 percent under the bill. Since the bill would increase the contribution and benefit base from $4800 to $5600, a new maximum average monthly earnings of $466 would become possible at that level the percentage replacement would be 32 percent. The method of figuring maximum family benefits that has been used in H. R. 1 is the same as the one this Committee incorporated in H. R. 11865 last year; that is, the maximum amount of benefits payable to a family is related to the worker's average monthly earnings at all earnings levels, and not just at the lower levels as in present law. Under the bill, the benefit increase would be effective with benefits payable for the month of January 1965. The increase in the benefits would be paid retroactively to anyone who received a monthly benefit in the retroactive period, whether or -9\u00ad not he is still on the rolls at the time of enactment. Lump-sum death payments based on deaths that occurred in the retroactive period, though, would not be increased. Making the payments retroactive will put people in approximately the same position as if action on last year's bill had been completed last year. That bill, you will remember, was reported out by this Committee in July, considered by the Congress in September and October, and the increased benefits under it would have been payable about the first of this year. Increase in the Contribution and Benefit Base An increase in the contribution and benefit base to $5600 (which is the figure in last year's Senate bill) would be comparable now to the $5400 provision agreed to by this Committee last year. Under that provision the base would have been increased, effective January 1965. Because of rising wages, a comparable figure for January 1966 is about $5600. As the Advisory Council on Social Security stated in its recent report, the contribu\u00ad tion and benefit base must be increased from time to time as earnings levels rise in order to maintain the wage-related character of the benefits, to restore a broad financial base for the program, and to distribute the cost of the system among low- paid and higher-paid workers in the most desirable way. A $5600 earnings base will make it possible to provide, for workers at and above average earnings levels, benefits that are more reasonably related to their actual earnings, and, by taxing a larger proportion of the Nation's growing payrolls, will improve the financial base of the program. If benefits were raised without increasing the base, the increases in the contribu\u00ad tion rates would have to be higher than they would have to be if the base were raised, and lower-paid workers as well as those ~earning at or above the maximum would have to pay these higher rates. It is much more desirable to meet in part the cost of increased protection for workers at average or higher earnings levels by increasing the amount of earnings on which those workers contributed than by meeting it entirely through increasing the contribution rates that all workers pay. About 90 percent of the additional income from the increase in the contribution and benefit base will go to the cash benefit program and about 10 percent of the additional income from the base increase will go to the new hospital insurance program. In addition to making higher benefits possible for people at average and above average earnings levels, an increase in the contribution and benefit base results in a decrease in the cost of the program expressed as a percentage of covered payrolls. Raising the base results in a net saving to the program because the law provides benefits that are a higher percentage of earnings at lower earnings levels than at the higher levels, but a flat percentage tax is applied to earnings at all levels. When the base is increased, higher benefits are provided on the basis of the additional earnings that are taxed and credited, but the cost of providing these higher benefits is less than the additional income from the combined employer-employee contributions on earnings above the former base. In other words there is a net gain in income to the system. Under the proposed increase in the base to $5600, the net gain would be equivalent to 0.-31 percent of taxable payroll. -10\u00ad Coverage of Tips The bill provides for covering employees' tips as wages under social security. This provision is the same as the one that was reported out by this Committee and passed by the House of Representatives last year, except that like Mr. Keogh's bill of last year (on which we and the Treasury Department reported favorably), it includes provisions for income tax withholding on tips. Employees' tips constitute one of the few remaining significant gaps in social security coverage. Tip income is estimated to represent, on the average, more than one-third of the work income of regularly tipped employees; in many cases, of course, tips represent a much larger part, or even all, of the employee's income. An example will illustrate the importance of this coverage to people who get a substantial part of their income in tips. Take a waiter who gets $35 a week in wages and $55 a week in tips, a not unusual situation. Under present law, with only his wages counted toward benefits, he would get a monthly retirement benefit, beginning at age 65, of $74. If his tips were also covered, his benefit amount would be $125. As you know, the Advisory Council on Social Security in its recent report recom\u00ad mended coverage of tips. Coverage of Doctors .Like the bill passed by the House last year, H. R. 1 also would extend. coverage to the self-employment income of doctors of medicine, the only self-employed professional group not now covered under social security. A great many physicians, perhaps a majority, want to participate in the social security program, and the benefits provided under social security would be very valuable to them. Since physicians, like all other Americans, benefit from the prevention of dependency through the social security program, they should also share in its support. In its recent report, the Advisory Council on Social Security recommended that self-employed physicians be covered under social security on the same basis as other self-employed people, pointing out that: .failure physicians has the effect that many of them have an unfair advantage under the program, since it is possible for them to acquire insured status through working for a time in covered employment, and then, because those who do so have low average monthly earnings under the program, they get the advantage of the weighted benefit formula that is intended for low-income people.\"1 '' to cover the self-employment income of Financing the Improvements that Would Be Made by the Bill I want to preface my discussion of the financing provisions of the bill by mentioning to the Committee the major conclusion of the Advisory Council on Social Security with respect to the financing of the present program. In the words of the Advisory Council, \"The social security program as a whole is'soundly financed, its funds are properly invested, and on the basis of actuarial estimates that the Council has reviewed and found sound and appropriate, provision has been made to meet -11\u00ad all of the costs of the program both in the short run and over the long-range future.? I know that the Committee is gratified at this finding of the Council in view of the Committee's determination over the years to keep the program sound. Now, what about the program as it would be amended by the bill? As I mentioned earlier, we are no less concerned than is the Committee about the financial soundness of the program, and the bill we are recommending includes provisions for adequate financing of all the changes it would make. Earlier in my statement I discussed separately the financing of the hospital insurance provisions. I want now to turn to the financing of the over-all program, including all three parts--hospital insurance, disability insurance, and old-age and survivors insurance. The estimates of long-range level costs in Mr. Myers' study that I have presented to you are made on two bases, the perpetuity basis that has been used in the past and the 75-year basis recommended by the Advisory Council. The Council, in making its recommendation, stated, \"A period of 75 years would span the lifetime of virtually all covered persons living on the valuation date and is as long a period as can be expected to have a realistic basis for estimating purposes. When costs are reassessed at frequent intervals, as has always been the practice, 75-year projections allow sufficient time to adjust to new and changing experience as it emerges.\"1 Mr. Myers has made the estimates of level costs on both bases to show the differing effect. Now to come to the financial effects of the bill. In addition to the net income of 0. 31 percent of taxable payroll that I mentioned earlier as resulting from raising the earnings base to $5600, a net income of 0. 03 percent of taxable payroll would be obtained from the extensions of coverage in the bill. The additional financing necessary would be obtained by increasing the tax rate for employers and workers. Under the new schedule the rates for employers and employees would be 4. 25 percent each in 1966 and 1967, 5. 0 percent in 1968-70 and 5.2 percent in 1971 and later. Corresponding changes would be made in the tax rate for the sell-employed so that it would continue to be 1 1/2 times the rate paid by employees. The total effect of these changes would be to increase the income to the program by an equivalent of 1. 43 percent of taxable payroll to meet the additional cost of 1. 44 percent of taxable payroll on the into-perpetuity basis, or 1. 42 percent of taxable payroll on the 75-year basis. This increased income would be allocated among the three parts of the program as follows: 0. 89 percent would go to hospital insurance, 0. 34 percent would go to the old-age and survivors insurance part of the program, and 0. 20 percent would go to the disability insurance part of the program. As a result, the actuarial balance of the hospital insurance provisions will be +0. 05 percent of taxable payroll, that of the disability insurance provisions will be +0. 01 percent on the into-perpetuity basis or +0. 02 percent on the 75-year basis, and that of the old-age and survivors insurance provisions will be minus 0. 31 percent on the perpetuity basis and minus 0. 05 percent on the 75-year basis. For the program as a whole, the cost estimates computed into perpetuity show an imbalance of 0. 25 percent of taxable payroll, well within the traditionally accepted figure of 0. 30 percent; the cost estimates over the next -12\u00ad 75 years show an actuarial surplus of 0. 02 percent of taxable payroll. It should be mentioned that under the bill the actuarial balance of the disability insurance part of the program would be substantially improved. As you will recall, this part of the program was out of balance by 0.-06 percent of taxable payroll on enactment of the 1960 amendments. Since that time the estimates have been revised by Mr. Myers to reflect lower disability termination rates than were previously anticipated (the primary factor being that disability bene\u00ad ficiaries have been living somewhat longer than was estimated), and the estimate of the imbalance has increased by 0. 08 percent of taxable payroll to a total of 0. 14 percent of taxable payroll on the into-perpetuity basis. The 75-year estimates show the imbalance to be 0. 13 percent. In addition the benefit increase contained in H. R. 1 would of course increase the cost of the disability insurance part of the program. These costs would be met by increasing the allocation to the dis\u00ad ability insurance trust fund from 0. 5 percent of wages and 0. 375 percent of self\u00ad employment income to 0. 67 percent of wages and 0. 5 025 percent of self-employ\u00ad ment income. This is the same allocation provided under H. R. 11865 as passed by the Senate last year. Financing is, of course, always a limiting factor on the improvements that can be made in the program. In order to hold the rates to the levels provided for in the bill, it was necessary to set priorities and exclude improvements that, while they have merit in themselves, seem to us less urgent than the improvements included in the bill. We propose to give further consideration to additional improvements. Public Assistance Amendments Title III of H. R. 1 includes four amendments to the public assistance titles of the Social Security Act. These amendments are substantially identical with amend\u00ad ments contained in the bill as passed by the Senate last year and were considered by the Senate-House conferees on that bill. Under the provisions of H. R. 1 all of the amendments would become effective January 1, 1966. Their aggregate cost in fiscal year ending June 30, 1966 would be approximately $114 million to be paid out of general revenues. The first of these amendments would remove existing limitations on Federal participation in assistance to aged persons in mental or tuberculosis institutions or in other medical institutions as a result of a diagnosis of psychosis or tuber\u00ad culosis. In order to qualify for Federal participation in such payments, a State welfare agency would have to have in effect arrangements with the State authorities for mental diseases and tuberculosis that would assure individual planning in the best interest of the aged patient. There would also have to be alternate plans of care available such as nursing home care when this would best serve an aged individual. The State would also have to show that it was developing a compre\u00ad hensive plan for the mentally ill. Moreover, a State would not receive more in additional Federal funds than it had increased its total expenditures for mental health purposes. The estimated cost in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966 is $38 million. -13\u00ad The amendment also would remove limitations on Federal sharing in payments for blind or disabled persons with mental illnesses or tuberculosis who are in general hospitals. However, it would not make such persons under the age of 65 eligible for payments including Federal funds if they were in mental or tuberculosis institutions. The amendment would also authorize protective payments for aged persons who are unable because of a physical or mental condition to manage money. These payments would be made to another individual concerned with the welfare of the aged person. This is similar to the amendment made to Title IV--aid to families with dependent children--in the 1962 amendments which authorize protective payments under that title. The second amendment would increase the Federal share of public assistance payments of each of the public assistance titles. For adults--the aged, blind and disabled--the increase would amount to an average of about $2.50 per recipient. For recipients of aid to families with dependent children, the increase would average about $1. 25 per recipient per month. These increases would be avialable to States only if they increased their total expenditures by at least as large an amount. This amendment would account for a major part of the total cost of the public assistance amendments--approximately $150 million on a full-year basis, or $75 million for the last half of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966. A third amendment would liberalize the amount of earnings of a person applying for or receiving old-age assistance that may be disregarded in determining need. At the present time up to $30 of earnings may be disregarded if an aged individual is earning $50 or more. Under the amendment $50 could be disregarded for individuals earning $80 or more. The fourth amendment would modify slightly the definition of medical assistance for the aged. Under existing law a person may not receive old-age assistance and medical assistance for the aged for the same month. Under the amendment both types of assistance might be received in the month that an individual entered or left a medical institution. This would facilitate the provision of assistance to persons entering or leaving a hospital or nursing home during the course of a month. This amendment and the preceding one have an estimated cost of slightly more than $1 million in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966. Mr. Chairman, we believe on the basis of careful study that the proposals in the bill are the ones for which there is the greatest need and ones that we can afford now. We commend them to the Committee's favorable consideration. Statement by Anthony J. Celebrezze Secretary of Health, Education, and. Welfare before the Committee on Finance U.S. Senate Thursd~ay, April 29, 1965 10:00 a.m.., DST Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I welcome this opportunity to discuss H.R. 6675, the Social Security Amendments of 1965, as passed by the House of Representatives, and. to urge the enactment of the many significant improvements that this bill would make in the Social Security Act. The major purposes of H.R. 6675 are to provide protection for the Nation's workers and their families against the high cost of health care in old age, to increase cash benefits under social security and make other substantial improvements in the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program, to provide for more adequate medical and monetary assistance for the needy, and to improve the health care of handicapped children. No other social security amendments have approached the scope of these proposed amendments. For older people, for widows and orphans, and for the disabled and their families, the payment of benefits where none is now available would turn despair into hope. Every community in our Nation would share in the good that the bill would do. This proposed legislation will lift from the shoulders of our senior citizens a heavy burden of fear--fear that their lifetime savings will be wiped out by the heavy costs of major illness or that they will have to turn to welfare or private charity or sons and daughters for help in meeting these costs. It is my view that this bill, if enacted, will make the most important contribution to security in old age since the social security program was enacted 30 years ago. It is one of the unfortunate facts of life that in old age, when people are living on substantially reduced incomes., health costs are much higher than in younger years. And since, as a general rule, old people have relatively little in the way of resources that can be readily converted into cash and little or no possibility of gaining new income or assets, many find that their high health costs are too imuch for them. The years of security and independence that they had hoped for and planned for are spent in a losing battle against dependency. 2 Despite commendable efforts by the private insurance industry, the voluntary health insurance effort has not proved adaptable to the almost universal need of the aged for adequate health insurance; few of the aged can afford to pay the premiums which older people must be charged for broad health insurance protection. Nor does the solution to the problem lie in public assistance. Though necessary and desirable, public assistance is not acceptable as the first line of defense against insecurity, whether that insecurity is caused by high health costs or other factors. Unlike social insurance, the public assistance program- -even though strengthened and improved as proposed in H.R. 6675--cannot prevent dependency; it can only provide for relief after the dependency has occurred. A key to the solution of the problem lies in the approach taken by our well-established contributory social security program. I would like to emphasize, though, that the health benefit provisions in the bill are built around the idea of using the several resources that can contribute the most, each in its own way, to fortifying ourselves against the insecurity that stems from illness in old age. A system financed by earmarked employee, employer, and self-employed contributions would serve as the foundation. It would assure that practically everybody has basic hospital insurance in old age. Only such a system can provide this assurance. Under this method, people can contribute during their productive years toward the hospital insurance that they 'Willneed in later years when their incomes will generally be reduced. After they retire, they need make no further contributions. The bill would also make provision for those relatively few people who are already in advanced years and not eligible for social security benefits. These people would be afforded the same hospital insurance protection., but it would be paid for out of general revenues. The proposed hospital insurance protection would serve as a base on which the aged could build supplementary health insurance in much the same way as social security cash benefits now serve as a base on which the individual is encouraged to build additional retirement income through private pension plans, individual savings, private insurance, and other programs, both public and private. A supplementary health insurance program for the aged is one of the important features of H.R. 6675. After a deductible of $50 per year this program would cover 80 percent of the cost of phscas services and certain other health and medical services that are not covered under the hospital insurance program. The supplementary protection would be provided through a plan of voluntary insurance that would be open to all older people who choose to enroll and pay the required 3 premiums. It would be financed, in equal shares, by the older persons who elect to participate and by their Government through general revenues. And it would be administered through private carriers, thus bringing into play their experience in the medical insurance field. Such a supplementary plan would meet an important need. It would also meet a major objection raised against past health insurance proposals in that it would assure that protection against the costs of physicians' services as well as protection against the cost of hospital and related care would be available to virtually all older Americans. While the proposed programs of basic and supplementary protection would, in combination,, provide relatively complete coverage, there still would be ample opportunity for continuing growth of the private effort in the health insurance field since the 90 percent of the population who are under 65 would not be affected by the proposed programs. The third resource that the bill would bring into play in solving the problems caused by high health costs in old age is public assistance. The bill would make a number of improvements in the assistance provisions which, together with the two health insurance plans, would enable the medical assistance program to be more effective in the role most appropriate for it--that is, it would enable the medical assistance effort to be focused more successfully on the relatively small number of the aged whose nursing home needs or other circumstances are such that they will be unable to meet their health costs through a combination of social and private insurance and individual savings. Mr. Chairman, I would like next to outline the major features of the two health insurance plans. Basic Health Insurance Plan The basic plan--which follows the social security approach--is, with certain exceptions, essentially the same as the hospital insurance program passed last year by the Senate. Beginning in July 1966, hospital insurance protection would be provided as a part of the social security system but with separate contributions and a separate trust fund. It would apply to all people who are aged 65 and over and entitled to monthly benefits under the social security program or the railroad retirement program. As I indicated earlier, the same protection would also be provided for practically all people who are now nearing or past age 65 and who are 4~ not eligible under one of these programs, but the cost would be borne by general. revenues. The basic plan would cover: Up to 60 days of hospital care less a deductible amount that would be $40. at the beginning of the program; up to 100 days of post-hospital care in a qualified skilled-nursing home or other extended-care facility; up to 100 home health-care visits to a homebound patient following discharge from a hospital or extended-care facility; and hospital outpatient diagnostic services subject to a deductible amount equal to one-half the deductible for inpatient hospital benefits. The provision of these four types of benefits w~ould enable the aged beneficiary to have the kinds of services and levels of care most appropriate to his needs. The benefits other than those for inpatient hospital care are essentially less expensive alternatives to inpatient hospital care and are included for this reason. By providing insurance protection against these various other health costs, the bill would promote the most efficient and economical use of existing health-care facilities and reinforce the efforts of the health professions to reserve hospital beds for acute illnesses requiring the intensive treatment that can be provided only in a hospital. The coverage of services in an extended-care facility would pay for the cost of followup convalescent and rehabilitation services which are often required after hospitalization. The extended-care provision, however, would not permit payment for services of a custodial nature. The provision in the bill passed by the Senate last year which required the extended-care facility--the skilled-nursing home--to be affiliated with a hospital in order to participate in the program has been removed. In its place is a provision under which the extended-care facility would be required to have an arrangement with a participating hospital for the timely transfer of patients and an interchange of medical information between the two institutions. The transfer agreement would help assure that the proper level of care is provided as the patient's condition and health needs change but, at the same time, would be much easier to meet than the prior affiliation requirement. Under the provisions for basic insurance against the cost of care in hospitals and extended-care facilities, the payment would'be made on the basis of the reasonable cost of the covered services furnished. The reimbursement of hospitals by third parties on a reasonable cost basis has been the subject of extended and painstaking consideration for more than a decade, and principles governing such reimbursement 5 have been developed which have been widely used and which have met with a large measure of acceptance. The bill contemplates that full advantage would be taken of the experience of private agencies and that payment to hospitals will be fair to the institutions, to the contributors to the hospital insurance trust fund., and to the hospitals' other patients. The hospital insurance program would be fully financed through contributions of emnployees, employers, and the self-employed plus the general revenue contributions for aged persons not insured under social security or rail-road retirement. These contributions would be similar to the present social security contributions. However, they would be levied under a separate provision of the Internal Revenue Code. Also., while the present social security contribution rate applicable to the self-employed is higher than that for the employee or the employer, the hospital insurance contribution rate would be the same for the self-employed as for the employee and employer. The proceeds of this new earmarked contribution would be deposited in a newly established hospital insurance trust fund. The financing of the basic plan is based on very conservative cost estimates. The cost estimates used by the House Committee assume., for examp~le, that earnings will continue to rise over the 25-year period as they have in the past but that the annual limitation on taxable earnings will not be increased beyond the $6,600 level pro\u00ad vided for in the bill for 1971 and thereafter. Thus, even if the contribution base should not be adjusted after 1971, the hospital insurance provisions would be amply financed. If the contribution base is increased after 1971, the rates in the contribution schedule could be revised downward. In fact, keeping all other assumptions the same, if the contribution base is kept up to date with the general earnings level, the hospital insurance contribution rate for employees, employers, and the self-employed could be held at 0.55 percent of taxable payroll instead of being scheduled to rise, as in the bill, to 0.80 percent by 1987. H.R. 6675 adds to the provisiorsof 8.1 the payment for the cost of services in qualified tuberculosis hospitals and in Christian Science sanatoria. Another significant change from S.l adopted in H.R. 6675--and one with which., as I will explain shortly, I cannot concur- -is the transfer of the coverage of services of certain medical specialists from the hospital insurance plan to the supplementary plan. 6 Supplementary Health Insurance Plan The supplementary health insurance plan embodied in H.R. 6675 would be one providing voluntary medical insurance that would be adminis\u00ad tered through private carriers and would be available to virtually all older people who wish to enroll and pay the required premiums. The major emphasis of the supplementary plan is on protection against the cost of physicians' services both in and outside the hospital. In addition, payment would be made toward the costs of inpatient care in psychiatric hospitals, of home health visits in addition to those covered under the basic plan, of radiation and other medical therapy, of diagnostic tests., of ambulance services, and of other specified health care items and services. Beginning July 1966 the beneficiary would pay the first $50 of expenses he incurs each calendar year for services of the type covered under the plan and 20 percent of the balance; the supplementary plan would pay the remaining 80 percent. The vast majority of aged people would pay their contributions toward the program by having $3 per month, beginning July 1966., deducted from their social security and railroad retirement benefits. This premium ratE~would be in effect until 1968; thereafter, the rate would be subject to biennial adjustment., based on experience. The minimum increase that the bill would make in cash social security benefits- -$4 for a retired person aged 65 or over and $6 for a couple aged 65 or over--would fully cover the monthly premiums that an aged person would pay for the supplementary plan. These payments would be matched by equal payments from Federal general revenues. A part of these general revenue expenditures would be recouped by modifying the income tax provisions that apply to medical expenses of the aged. Under the bill, aged people could deduct only medical expenses in excess of 3 Percent of income and drug expenses in excess of 1 percent of income for income tax purposes. Of course, only aged persons whose incomes are high enough so that they must pay income taxes would pay additional taxes under this provision of the bill. Aged recipients of cash public assistance payments who are not entitled to social security benefits could be enrolled in the supplementary plan by the public assistance agency. The State would pay contributions on behalf of the recipients out of its State-Federal assistance funds, and these payments would be matched by Federal contributions, as in the case of other enrollees. Various protections against adverse selection are included in the enrollment provisions of this program. For example, provision is made 7 for a waiting period,before a newly enrolled person could become eligible for payments so that it would not be possible for him to delay enrollment until expensive health services were required. We anticipate that a very high percentage of the aged would enroll because the general revenue subsidy of 50 percent makes partici\u00ad pation in the program very advantageous. As under the basic plan, payments for covered services provided by hospitals, extended-care facilities, and home health agencies would be based on reasonable costs and would be made to the provider of services. In the case of all other covered ser-vices--physicianst services, for example--benefits would be based on reasonable charges and wduld be paid to the beneficiary or., alternatively, under certain circumnstances, could be assigned to the physician or other person or organization which furnished the covered services. In deciding whether a charge for a covered item is reasonable, the carriers responsible for administration of the payment provisions of the supplementary plan would consider the customary charges of the physician and the prevailing charges in the community for the services furnished. The carriers would make payment on the basis of charges which are no higher than the charges used for reimbursement on behalf of their own policyholders. If the benefits are assigned to the physician or organization that rendered the services, the reasonable charge for the services rendered would have to be accepted by the physician or organization as payment in full for those services; in other cases, reimbursement would be made on the basis of receipted bills. Administration of the Two Health Insurance Plans Overall responsibility for administration of the basic and supplementary plans would rest with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. The bill provides for the establishment of two advisory groups made up of experts from outside the Government: one to advise the Secretary on general policy matters in the administration of the health insurance programs and the other to study and report on utilization of hospital and of other medical care and services. The Secretary would also be required to consult with appropriate State agencies, national and State associations of providers of services, and recognized national accrediting bodies. State governments license health facilities, and State public health authorities generally inspect these facilities to determine whether they are conforming with the requirements of the State licensing law. The proposal would put this experience to use by giving State agencies important duties in assisting the Federal Government in determining which 8 providers of health services meet the appropriate definitions and also by furnishing consultation to hospitals and other facilities that wish to participate in the program. Private organizations would also play an important role in the administration of both the basic and supplementary plans. Under the basic plan, groups of hospitals, or associationsof hospitals on behalf of their members, could nominate an organization to act as a fiscal intermediary between providers and the Federal Government. Similarly, other providers of services, such as extended-care facilities, could have fiscal intermediaries. This arrangement would permit the same organizations that now reimburse hospitals and other providers of health services to perform a similar function under the hospital insurance program. As I indicated earlier., the services covered under the supplementary plan are primarily those provided by physicians. The bill requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to the extent possible to contract with health insurance carriers for the performance of functions related to such coverage--for example,, determining the amounts to be paid for physicians' services and making the payments. The Secretary would enter into such a contract with a carrier only if he finds that the carrier can carry out the required functions efficiently. The Secretary would contract with a sufficient numiber of carriers,, selected on a regional or other geographical basis, to permit a comparative analysis of their performance. Ancillary Hospital Services Mr. Chairman,, itwould be a mistake, in my opinion, to exclude from coverage under the basic hospital insurance plan, as H.R. 6675 does, the services furnished hospital patients under arrangements with the hospital, by medical specialists in the fields of radiology, anesthesiology,, pathology, and physical medicine. These services should be covered under the basic hospital insurance plan subject to the conditions set forth in the Senate-passed bili of last year and in the bill introduced in this Congress by the distinguished senior Senator from New Mexico. Our primary concern is that medical services furnished to hospital patients in these fields be covered under this bill in a way that is in accord with the practices that hospitals and the health professions have developed over the years. Thus', we believe that the services in question should be covered as part of the hospital benefit if the specialist-hospital arrangement calls for the bill to be paid through the hospital. 9 Conversely, we believe that, where the arrangements are that the specialist is not paid. by or through the hospital, reimbursement for the specialist's services should be made under the supplementary plan. The specialists in these fields work in hospitals under various kinds of arrangements. Some work as hospital employees and are paid a salary, while others receive agreed-upon percentages of the hospital's receipts for the services they furnish. Some of these specialists bill their patients directly. The approach we suggest would follow whatever practices now exist or whatever practices may be arranged in the future in this field. On the other hand., the provisions in H.R. 6675 which exclude the hospital-related services of these specialists from coverage under the basic hospital insurance provisions would require substantial changes in the way these services are now paid for. The billing for the nonphysician components of the affected hospital department would have to be entirely separate from the billing for the physician services in the department. There are very few hospitals in the country that operate today on such a basis in the fields of pathology and radiology. Nor is there a health insurance plan, so far as we are aware, which requires the separation of the services of these specialists from the services provided by the hospital generally irrespective of the arrangements agreed upon by the hospital and the specialists. , We urge, therefore., Mr. Chairman, that the bill be modified to restore the provisions for covering these services made in last year's Senate bill and Senator Anderson's bill of this year. We will also have some clarifying and technical changes in the bill we would like to bring to the Committee's attention at a later point. Changes in Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance In addition to the very important insurance proposals for protecting older people against high health costs, many other important changes in the social security program are included in the bill. These changes would modernize and improve the program of cash benefits under social security to take account of changes in economic and other conditions that have taken place over the last several years and to fill gaps in the protection of the program. The bill provides a 7-percent across-the-board increase in benefits, with a minimum increase of $4 guaranteed for retired workers aged 65 and over and for disabled workers. The last general benefit increase was enacted in 1958, and the 7-percent increase takes into account the increases in prices since that time. 10 Monthly benefits for workers now on the rolls who retired at or after age 65 would range from $4i4 per month at the minimum to $135 .90 at the maximum., as compared to $40 to $127 per month under present law. The initial increase in the contribution and benefit base provided by the bill--the increase to $5,600 a year--would make possible a maximum benefit of $149.90 per month for those who continue to work and pay on the higher amount. Under the second-step increase in the contribution and benefit base that the bill would make--the increase to $6.,600 a year--a maximum benefit of $167.90 per month would be possible after the new earnings base has been in effect for some time. The bill uses the same method for computing maximum family benefits that was used in last year's bill. Specifically, the bill provides a different family maximum amount at every average monthly earnings bracket in the benefit table. The maximum, for families now on the rolls, is raised from $254 per month to $286.80 per month. In the future,, the maximum family benefit payable per month would be $312 under the $5,600 contribution and benefit base and $368 per month under the $6,600 contribution and benefit base. The benefit increase would be retroactive to January 1965. As this Committee stated last Augu~st in its report on H.R. 11865, a general increase in social security benefits was needed at that time. H.R. 11865, as passed by both Houses last year, provided for increased social security benefits that would have been effective at about the beginning of 1965 if the bill had been enacted. Paying the increased benefits retroactively to January, then, would put beneficiaries in the same position they would have been in if H.R. 11865 had been enacted. With passage of the bill, some 20 million people will be immediately eligible for increased benefits under this provision. An estimated $1.2 billion in additional cash benefits would be paid in 1965 and $1.4 billion in 1966, as a result of the benefit increase. The proposed increase in the contribution and benefit base to $5.,600 is scheduled for 1966, and the increase to $6,,600 is scheduled for 1971. This increase in the base is very much needed. It has not been increased since 1958., and periodic adjustment of the base as earnings rise is of fundamental importance not only to the preservation of the wage-related character of social security benefits but also to the maintenance of a broad financial base for the program. Another important change that H.R. 6675 would make in social security cash benefits is provision for the payment of child's insurance benefits to children between the ages of 18 and 22 who are attending school. Last year both the House and Senate passed a similar provision. The provision for children reflects the fact that we can no longer assume that a child has finished his education and is ready for self-support when he has attained age 18. Like the provision for the general increase in benefits, it would be retroactive, with the first benefits payable for January 1965. About 295,000 children would be eligible for benefits for a typical school month in 1965; in 1966 about $195 million in benefits would be paid. The disability insurance protection provided under social security would also be improved. The bill would remove the requirement that to be eligible for benefits a worker's disability must be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration. The effect of this change would be to make disability benefits avail\u00ad able to insured workers without requiring that it be found that they canniot be expected to recover in the foreseeable future. This provision is along the lines of most private long-term disability insurance provisions. Another change in the disability insurance provisions would enable the disabled worker, and those who are dependent on him, to become eligible for benefits after 6 months rather than after 7 months as in present law. About 155,000 people--disabled workers and their dependents- -would become immediately eligible for benefits, with $105 million in benefits payable in 1966 because of the changes. The bill also provides for covering employees' tips that are $20 or more in a month as wages under social security. This provision is the same as the one that was in the bill considered by your Committee last year, except that it includes provisions for income tax withholding on tips. Failure to credit tips toward benefits constitutes one of the few remaining significant gaps in social security coverage. Tip income is estimated to represent, on the average, more than one-third of the work income of regularly tipped employees; in many cases, of course, tips represent a much larger part, or even all, of the employee's income. The amount of tips received by employees who regularly receive tips is estimated at more than $1 billion a year. Coverage of tips would provide better protection under the social security program for more than a million employees and their dependents. A waiter, for example, who receives $35 a week in wages and $55 a week in tips--a not unusual situation--would, under present law, receive a monthly retirement benefit., beginning at age 65,, of $74. If his tips were covered, his benefit amount would be $125 per month. 12 The responsibility is put on the employee to report his tips to his employer. If he fails to do so within 10 days after the close of the month in which the tips are paid, the employer is relieved of all liability. The employee is then responsible for paying the employer's contribution as well as his own. Tips would be covered also for income tax withholding purposes, so that tipped employees would pay their income taxes on tips on a pay-as-you-go basis. Under present law, employees who receive tips pay the income tax due on their tips on an estimated quarterly basis or in a lump stum at the end of the taxable year in which the tips were received. The provision for income tax withholding on tips would make it more convenient and easier for them to pay their income taxes and would improve the collection of income taxes. Another important provision of the bill would extend coverage to the self-employment earnings of physicians. Self-employed doctors of medicine- -the only group of significant size whose self-employment income is excluded from coverage under social security- -would be covered under the program on the same basis as other professional self-employed groups. In addition, the bill increases the proportion of gross income which may be reported by low-income farmers in place of net Income and also makes it possible for the Amish to elect not to be covered by the program. Certain other minor changes in the present coverage provisions are included. The bill also provides benefits for certain aged people who have had some social security coverage but not enough to qualify for benefits under present law., and for certain aged divorced women who were married for many years prior to being divorced. In addition,, benefits are provided for widows at age 60, payable in reduced amounts so as not to increase the cost of the program. The bill also liberalizes the retirement provision in present law under which there is a $1 reduction in benefits for each $2 of earnings above $1,,200 and up to $1,700 to provide for a $1-for-$2 reduction for earnings between $1,,200 and $2,,400. Benefits would continue to be reduced by $1 for every $1 of earnings above $2,400, as they are now on earnings above $1,700. Still other changes included in the bill are: --A provision for automatically recomputing benefits to take account of earnings that a beneficiary may have after~he comes on the rolls and that would increase his benefit amount; 13 --A provision permitting an unlimited time for filing proof of support for husband's, widower's, ana parent's insurance benefits and applications for lu~mp-sum death payments where there is good cause for failure to file these documents within the initial 2-year period provided under the law; and --A provision allowing a person to become entitled to disability benefits after he has become entitled to monthly benefits that are paid on the basis of his age. The bill also tightens up the provisions governing the payment of child's benefits to a child adopted by a retired worker in order to provide safeguards against possible abuse. Social Security and Health Insurance Financing Obviously the proposed hospital insurance provisions for the aged and the significant improvements that would be made in social security cash benefits would add to program costs. The bill faces up squarely to the need for providing sufficient funds to pay for these improvements. It provides sufficient income to pay all the costs of the changes proposed in the present social security program as well as the costs of the proposed hospital insurance program. Each of the two existing social security trust funds and the proposed new hospital insurance trust fund would be assured not only of adequate short-range income but also of long-range financial soundness. In arriving at the social security contribution schedules included in the bill, particular attention was given to the effect of social security contributions on the individual taxpayer and the economy as a whole. The bill provides a more gradual attainment of the full rates needed to support the cash benefits than does present law. Under present law the rates for employees and employers would go to 4.125 percent in 1966 and 4.625 percent in 1968. Under the bill the rates that employees and employers would pay under the cash social security program would not exceed 4percent until 1969. Moreover, they would not exceed the rates now scheduled for 1968 until the ultimate rate scheduled under the bill--4.8 percent--goes into effect in 1973. The rates for the self-employed would be held at 6 percent until 1969 and would not exceed the 6.9-percent rate now scheduled for 1968 until the ultimate rate scheduled under the bill--7 perdent--goes into effect in 1973. The separate contribution to finance the new hospital insurance program would also be put into effect under a graduated schedule. The rates are scheduled to begin in 1966 at 0.35 percent each for employees., their employers, and self-employed people and to rise in five steps to 0.80 percent each in 1987. On the basis of conservative assumptions, the contribution rate would provide adequate income to the hospital insurance trust fund over the entire 25-year period for which estimates were made. The contribution rates in the bill have been set so as to avoid undesirably and unnecessarily large trust fund accumulations in the near future. Under the bill the social security trust funds would of course increase- -that is., income would generally exceed outgo- \u00ad but the contribution rates are designed to avoid the large increases in the trust funds in the next few years that would have occurred under present law. Under present law the combined assets of the old-age and survivors insurance and the disability insurance trust funds would grow from $21.2 billion at the end of 1964 to $32.8 billion by the end of 1969. Under the bill the combined assets of the three trust funds supported by payroll contributions--of the two existing funds and the new hospital insurance trust fund- -would grow, but only to $23.5 billion by the end of 1969. The cost of the voluntary supplementary health insurance program would., of course,, be met by contributions made by the participants and the Government. It would be financed through a separate trust fund but,, unlike the other parts of the program, it would be financed on a short-range basis, with the contributions adjusted to the cost. The contribution rate would not be changed more often than once every 2 years. The regular social security contribution rates scheduled under the bill provide more favorable treatment for the self-employed than previous schedules, which set the tax rate for the self-employed at about 1lff times the employee rate. Under the bill, the final self- employed rate for the cash benefits would be somewhat less than 11 times the final employee rate, and, as I said before, self-employed people would pay for hospital insurance at the same rate as employees. Child Health and Medical Assistance The child health and medical assistance provisions of the bill would carry out recommendations that President Johnson made in his health 15 message. These provisions are also included in S.970, the Child Health and Medical Assistance Act of 1965, introduced by Senator Ribicoff and pending before your Committee. Under these provisions a new title of the Social Security Act would be established under which all vendor payments for health care- \u00ad such as payments to hospitals, doctors, druggists,, nursing homes-\u00ad in behalf of public assistance recipients would be made. States could include under the title all the recipients of money payments for old-age assistance, aid to the blind, aid to the permanently, and totally disabled., and aid to families with dependent children. They could also include medically needy persons who would qualify for these programs if their income and resources were so small that they needed payments for basic maintenance costs--food, clothing, shelter, etc. The medically needy group could include not only the present recipients of medical assistance for the aged but comparable groups of persons under 65 who are blind, disabled, or dependent children and relatives. The title thus represents a substantial broadening of the existing Kerr-Mills law. The greatest number of new potential beneficiaries under the expanded benefits would be the 3.2 million dependent children now receiving financial aid and any other children from broken families who need help iftheir medical needs are to be met. When these programs are placed under a single new title, States would receive increased matching on a uniform basis for all groups. Increases at least as large as those contemplated by the \"Eldercare\" bill would be available to all States and would apply not only to aid provided in the form of insurance premiums but to all medical costs. Under the new title., comparable eligibility requirements would apply to all groups and comparable medical benefits would be available to each of them. With States relieved of much of their existing cost of hospital care for the aged through the health insurance provisions of the bill, sufficient State funds would become available in many States together with matching Federal funds to provide significant health care programs for all needy persons on an equitable basis. By July 1, 1967, a minimum program would be required to include at least some inpatient hospital services., outpatient hospital services, laboratory and X-ray services, skilled nursing-home services., and physicians' services regardless of where they are provided. States could at their option include a broad range of additional services. 16 The program could be adopted by the States as early as January 1., 1966, and would be the only basis on which vendor payments for medical care could be made after June 30, 1967. Costs on a full-year basis are estimated at about $200 million, with $100 million being the estimated cost in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966. In addition., improvements would be made in the child health programs. The amount authorized to be appropriated for maternal and child health services would be increased by $5million in the fiscal year ending June 30,, 1966., and by $10 million in each subsequent fiscal year. The same increases in authorizations would be made for the program of crippled children's services. In each of these programs, States would have to show progressive expansion of the availability of services with the objective of making them available to children in all parts of a State by 1975. Provision would be made for a separate authorization beginning in 1967 for the training of professional health personnel to deal with crippled children, particularly mentally retarded children and children with multiple handicaps. Such training is closely related to the development of university-based mental retardation centers authorized by the Congress in 1963. A new authorization for project grants to establish comprehensive health projects for children of school and preschool age would be provided. These health projects would be in areas with concentrations of low- income families, and,, while all children in such an area might receive screening, preventive, or diagnostic services, only those children who would not otherwise receive such care would be eligible for treatment,, correction of defects, and aftercare. In addition., grants of $2.75 million per year for 2 years would be authorized to assist States in following up and beginning to implement the comprehensive mental retardation plans that they have been developing under grants made available under legislation enacted in 1963. Other medical assistance changes in the bill were also included in H.R. 11865 as it passed the Senate last year and were contained in S. 1 introduced this year by Senator Anderson and others. Among these is the removal of limitations on Federal participation in public assistance for aged persons in mental and tuberculosis 17 hospitals. This was Senator Long's amendment, adopted last year with safeguards to assure that additional Federal funds resulting from it would go into improvement of mental health programs. Changes in Cash Public Assistance The bill provides for an increase in the public assistance formulas which averages about $2.50 per recipient per month for aged, blind, and disabled recipients and averages about $1.25 for recipients under the program of aid to families with dependent children. This is the same formula which was proposed by Senator Long and adopted by the Senate last year. The additional Federal funds received under the new formula would be required to be passed on to the recipients. A similar pass-on provision has been included in Senate-passed amendments to public assistance programs on a number of prior occasions. This provision would apply to increases in Federal funds under all the provisions of the bill. Another provision of the bill permits payments to be made to a third party in behalf of aged persons who are unable to manage money because of physical or mental impairment. This amendment contains appropriate safeguards and is similar to the one which the Congress adopted for the aid to families with dependent children program in 1962. Senator Douglas' amendment of last year, liberalizing the amount of earnings of old-age assistance recipients which a State may disregard, is also included in the bill. Under the amendment a State might disregard $50 of earnings for aged persons earning $80 or more per month. Furthermore, provision is included authorizing States to disregard the retroactive portion of the increase in OASDI benefits or the child school attendance benefits under that program. A provision of the Economic Opportunity Act which requires compliance by State public assistance plans by July 1, 1965, is rendered inoper\u00ad ative for States which are unable to comply because of State law and have not yet had regular legislative sessions since the Economic Opportunity Act was passed. The bill would take care of the period until the legislature may act for any State in this situation. A provision is included permitting judicial review of the Secretary's decisions regarding the State public assistance plans or amendments and affording administrative reconsideration of decisions on audit exceptions. 18 H.R. 6675 also contains a substantial num~ber of' other minor changes. Among these provisions is one which, while not increasing the dollar limitations on grants to Puerto Rico, Guam., and the Virgin Islands, will af'ford some help to these jurisdictions by providing that all their medical-care payments would be outside the existing ceilings on cash assistance. Only their medical assistance for the aged program is outside the ceiling at present. H.R.1 6675 is truly a landmark bill. Its passage will be a tremendous step toward preventing insecurity and want anong the aged,, disabled, widows, and the orphaned. As a result of' this bill,, people who are still working will be able to look forward to their retirement years with a sense of' security never before possible. The extensions and improvements in our social insurance and public assistance programs that are embodied in the bill would bring new security and hope to millions of Americans of' all ages. Mr. Chairman, I would like to call to the attention of the Committee the charts that are attached to this statement and to ask that they be inserted in the record at this point.

This Study is a revision and expansion of Actuarial Study No. 52, and Actuarial Study No. 57, which dealt with earlier versions of the Administration proposal for hospitalization and related benefits. This Study also presents the cost estimates for the proposed changes in the cash benefits program. It is the policy of the Division of the Actuary to make its methods and procedures available to those interested. It is our hope that this Study will provide the information not readily available in other published reports. Robert J. Myers Chief Actuary Social Security Administration A. Introduction This Study presents long-range actuarial cost estimates for the Hospital Insurance Act of 1965 and the Social Security Amendments of 1965, contained in H.R. 1, introduced by Congressman King on January 4 (an identi\u00ad cal bill, S.* 1, was introduced by Senator Anderson on January 6). H.R. 1 contains provisions establishing a hospital insurance program for bene\u00ad ficiaries aged 65 or over under the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance system. In addition, the proposal would provide similar protec\u00ad tion for beneficiaries under the Railroad Retirement system and for most persons aged 65 and over in 1966 (and for those attaining this age in the next few years) who are not insured under either of these social insurance systems. As to OASDI beneficiaries, this bill would provide a specific pro\u00ad gram of hospitalization and related benefits for all persons who are (1 aged 65 and over and (2) \"entitled\" to monthly benefits. *The term \"entitled\" means that the individual meets all the statutory provisions governing eligi\u00ad bility for monthly benefits (old-age, dependent, or survivor) and has filed an application therefor (which may be concurrent with application for hospitali\u00ad zation benefits). The term thus includes not only beneficiaries in current- payment status, but also those who are not drawing monthly benefits because they are continuing in substantial employment. The following benefits would be provided: (a) 60 days of semi-private hospital care within a \"'benefit period\", with a flat deductible in an amount equal to the average daily hospital cost under the program. (b 60 days of post-hospital extended care within a \"benefit period\", when such services are furnished following transfer from a hospital and are necessary for continued treatment of a condition for which the individual was hospitalized. Such care would be furnished in an \"extended care facility\", which is an institution that has in effect a transfer agree\u00ad ment with a hospital (or is under common control with a hos\u00ad pital) and that is, in essence, a skilled nursing facility (as defined in detail in the bill). (c) 240 home health service visits during a calendar year. (d Outpatient hospital diagnostic services in excess of a deductible equal to 50% of the hospitalization deductible during a 30-day period. The term \"benefit period\" means the period beginning with the first day that an individual receives hospitalization benefits and ending with the 90th day thereafter during each of which he has not been a patient in a hospital or an extended care facility (but such 90 days must occur within a 180-day period). The benefits would first be available in July 1966, except for post-hospital extended care benefits, which would first be available in January 1967. These hospitalization and related benefits for OASDI beneficiaries (and the accompanying administrative expenses) would be financed, on a long-range basis, by an allocation from the overall contribution rate for the OASDI system, as modified by this bill (see Table i), of .60% of taxable payroll as to the combined employer-employee rate for 1966, .76% for 1967-68, and .90% thereafter. This income would be channelled into the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which would be established on a basis similar to that of the existing OASI and DI Trust Funds. The same hospitalization benefit protection would be available to beneficiaries under the Railroad Retirement systern. Persons who are beneficiaries under both systems would, of course, not receive \"double\" benefits. The employer and employee contribution rates would be increased by the same amount as under the OASDI system, but the taxable wage basis would not be chan\u00a79d from the present $450 per month. The financial inter\u00ad change provisions-:' would apply so that, in essence, the OASDI system would be \"reinsuring\" the hospitalization benefit experience of the Railroad Retirement system, which would neither gain nor lose as a result of the actual experience. The Railroad Retirement system would, of course, have to provide out of its existing financing the equivalent income arising from raising the OASDI earnings base to $5,600. Likewise, the hospitalization benefit protection would be provided to any person aged 65 and over on July 1, 1966 who is not eligible as an OASDI or Railroad Retirement beneficiary and who (a)is not an employee of the Federal Government or a retired Federal employee eligible for health benefits under the plan established by the Federal Government for such persons, (b)is not a member of a subversive organization and has not been convicted of subversive activities, and (c is a citizen or has had at least 10 years of continuous residence. Persons meeting such conditions who attain age 65 before 1968 also qualify for the hospitalization benefits, while those attain\u00ad ing age 65 after 1967 must hale some OASDI or Railroad Retirement coverage to qualify--namely, 3 quarters of coverage (which can be acquired at any time after'1936) for each year elapsing after 1965 and before the year of attainment of age 65 (e.g. 6 quarters of coverage for attainments in 1968, 9 quarters for 1969, etc.). This transitional provision \"washes out\" for men attaining age 65 in 1974 and for women attaining age 65 in 1972, since the fully-in\u00ad sured-status requirement for monthly benefits for such categories is then no greater than the special-insured status requirement. The benefits for the \"non-insured\" group are paid from the HI Trust Fund, but with full reim\u00ad bursement therefor from the General Treasury. a]However, Railroad Retirement beneficiaries would have certain additional benefit protection in that, under certain circumstances, the benefits would be available in Canada. bJ For a description of these provisions, see pages 74 and 80-82 of the 24th Trustees Report (House Document No. 236, 88th Congress). -2\u00ad From an actuarial-cost standpoint, the major features of this bill as they relate to the cash benefits under the OASDI program are as follows: (1) Monthly benefits for all types of beneficiaries would be increased by 7% on that portion of the benefit that is derived from the first $400 of average monthly wage (AMW). This would make the benefit formula underlying the benefit table be as follows: 62.97% of the first $110 of AMW, plus 22.90% of the next $290 of AMW, plus 21.4% of the next $66 of Aw (the maximum AM4W possible being $466,based on annual earnings of $5,600), effective retroactively to January 1., 1965. (2) The underlying basis for the family maximum benefit pro\u00ad vision would be changed so that it would be earnings-related at all earnings levels. The present basis is the smaller of 80% of AJMW or $254 (twice the maximum Primary Insurance Amount; the PIA is the monthly benefit payable to a worker retiring at or after age 65, or to a disabled worker, without considering benegits for dependents), but in no case less than l21 times~the PIA. Under the proposed basis, the dollar-limit amount ($254) would be eliminated, and instead the maximum would be determined from a weighted formula--80% of the first $x of AMW, plus 40% of Amw in excess of $x (where x is 2/3 Of the maximum possible AMW--i .e., 1/12 of the maximulm annual earnings base), effective retroactively to January 1, 1965. (3) Coverage would be extended to self-employed doctors and to tips., effective January 1, 1966. (4) The maximum earnings base would be increased from $4,800 to $5.,600 per year, effective January 1,, 1966. (5) The contribution schedule and the allocations to the Trust Funds would be revised in the manner shown in Table 1. (6) A new basis of reimbursing the Trust Funds for the cost of noncontributory military service wage credits (as they increase benefit amounts) would be provided--in essence, by spreadingthese costs in equal annual installuents over the next 50 years. Section B gives the basic data utilized, the assumptions made, and the com\u00adputation procedure in regard to the cost estimates for the hospitalization and related benefits. Section C presents the cost estimates, along with discussion of changes made in the hospitalization-benefits cost estimates in recent years. Finally, Section D outlines the problems involved in making actuarial cost estimates for hospitalization and related benefits. -3\u00ad Table 1 EARNINGS BASE, CONITRIBUTfION RATES, AND AILLOCATI(RKS TO TRUST FUNDS UNDER H.

Data, Assumptions, and Procedures in Cost Estimates for Hospitalization and Related Benefits for OASDI Beneficiaries The various cost factors involved for each of the types of hospitalization and related benefits (such as probabilities of becominghospitalized and average length of hospitalization,, varying by age and sex) have been developed by the Division of the Actuary in collaboration with the Division of Research and Statistics. These factors have been applied to the estimated nunmbers of OASDI eligibles, which are available from the long-range actuarial cost estimates for the existing cash-benefits system. The latter are summarized in the 24th Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund., pages J45-55 and 64-~75 (H. Doc. No. 26,1r 86th Congress) and in Actuarial Study No. 58; the general assump\u00ad tions and procedures used in developing them are described in Actuarial Study No. 4i9. I. Factors Affecting Hospitalization-Benefits Costs The elements affecting the costs of hospitalization benefits may be itemized as follows: (1) Number of eligible beneficiaries and their age-sex composition; (2) Rates of hospital admission; (3) Average duration of hospitalization; (4) Average daily per capita hospital costs; and (5) Effect of maximwn-duration and deductible provisions. Hospitalization-benefit costs for various future years are obtained by multiplying the estimated number of eligibles by a factor representing the average annual per capita cost of hospitalization (after taking into account any maximum-duration and deductible provisions). This is done separately by sex and by age groups, since hospital utilization varies significantly by age and sex. The per capita hospitalization-cost factor is derived in relation to all eligibles in the age-sex group, including those who are not hospitalized. The age-sex composition of the eligible group will vary over the years. For this reason, the average per capita cost for the total group of noninsured persons eligible for HI benefits is significantly higher than for the insured group (since the former has a much higher age distribution). The per capita hospitalization-cost factor consists of two elements, the average length (in days) of compensable hospitalization (considering all eligibles, and including the effect of any deductible, as well as any maximum-duration provisions) and the average daily cost of hospitalization (including both room and board, and all other hospital services--averaged out on a daily basis). -5\u00adII. Average Hospital Utilization First, considering the element of average hospital utilization,the basic procedure is to make the detailed calculations for a 60-day maximum provision and then to modify the overall results for the differ\u00ad ences in the provisions of the particular proposal. The basic data used for these cost estimates are presented in Table 21, which shows hospital utilization rates on both low-cost and high-cost bases. The \"hospital utilization rate\" is defined as the average number of hospital days ex\u00ad perienced per person exposed to risk. In other words, such rates are the result obtained by multiplying the proportion of persons experiencing hospitalization by the average duration of hospitalization for those hospitalized. (a) Source of Basic Data The basic data are from the 1957 Survey of Beneficiaries conducted by the Social Security Administration., but with modifications to recognizethat the availability of benefits will result in greater utilization than that reported in the Survey. In addition., the basic data have been ad\u00adjusted upward to allow for hospitalization of persons dying during the year,, who were not reported in the Survey. The adjustments for the availability of hospitalization benefits were made in the following manner (dg~cribed in more detail on pages 77-78 of the 1959 Hospitalization Report~'). For the high-cost estimate, the ad\u00admission rate used was the same as the rate reported in the Survey for those with insurance (approximately 60% higher than the reported rate for those without insurance). The average duration of hospitalizationfor the high-cost estimate was taken to be the same as that reported in the Survey for those with insurance and those without insurance combined (the average duration for the latter category was about 50% higher than for the former)--this assumption is, of course, a 'conservative\" one. For the low-cost estimate, the hospital utilization rate was obtained by weighting such rate for insured persons in the Survey by the proportion of insured persons and by weighting the average hospital utiliza\u00adtion rate for all persons in the Smnvey (about 5%higher t1han the actual experience for the uninsured group) by the proportion of those in the Survey without inswance. Also, a downward adjustment of the hospital utilization rate was made for men aged 65-69 to reflect the fact that utilization is substantially lower among employed persons than among retired persons(a large proportion of the eligibles in this age group will be employed).In connection with the latter point., it should be noted that the beneficiary group surveyed consisted of retired persons; thus., making no such down\u00ad ward adjustment in the high-cost estimate added an element of conservatism. Operating in the other direction,, however,, is the factor that utilization of the proposed health benefits by persons with insurance in the past maybe somewhat increased because of the greater protection available in many CSJ \"Hospitalization Insurance for OASDI Beneficiaries\", a Report Sub\u00admitted to the Committee on Ways and Means by the Secretary of Health, Education., and Welfare, April 3., 1959. -6 \u00adTable 2 HOSPITAL UTI~IZ~ATION~ RATES FOR OASDI BENEFICIARIES AGED 65 AND OVER., 60-DAY MAXDIU4M, ACCORDING TO 1957 BENEFICIARY SURVEY (average days per person per year) Law-Cost Estimate High-Cost Estimate Before Cor- Correc- Cor- 2.61 1.66 .48 2.14 2.01 .6o 2.61 75 and .93 3.37 4.63 65 and over- 1.85 .55 2.40 2.49 .69 3.18 65-69 1.59 .20 1.79 1.73 .25 1.98 70-74 2.42 .31 2.75 2.65 .38 3.03 75 and overb 2.53 .78 3.31 3.11 .740 65 and over- 2.09 .38 2.47 2.36 .47 2.85 Total Persons 65 and over-, 1.97 .47 2.44 2.43 .58 3.01 (2.08) (.52) (2.60) (2.57) (.66) (3.23) a] Based on average stay-of 8 days for low-cost estimate and 10 days for high-cost estimate and on death rates from U.

Note: The figures shown above for \"corrected rates\" are the same (except for one correction) as those in the table on page 101 of the 1959 Hospitalization Report. -7\u00ad instances (where the deductible does not have an offsetting effect). Also, the Survey data included hospital utilization in Veterans Administration hospitals; this factor results in an overstatement of the estimated utilization that would arise under HI proposals, since a significantproportion of persons would continue to use the VA facilities (the use of which involves no cost to the individual for deductibles or maximum limits and which also provide free medical care)., rather than draw the HI benefits. The assumptions in the low-cost estimate produce costs only slightlyabove the Beneficiary Survey experience. This basis seems plausible for the near-future (and is used in the cost estimates in the first few years).For the long-range future, this low-cost assumption may be said to give recognition to the possibility of success of current efforts for progressive patient care., for reductions in hospitalization costs resulting from de\u00ad velopment of outpatient hospital diagnostic facilities, and for progressive cost-reducing trends in medical practice. .(b) Comparison of Basic Data with Those from Other Sources Hospital utilization data from the National Health Survey, for July 1958 to June 1960 (\"Hospital Discharges and length of Stay: Short-Stay Hos\u00adpitals., United States, 1958-196o\", Health statistics from the U. S. National Health Survey, Series B -No. 32,, April 1962, Public Health Service,U. S.Department of Health, Education, and Welfare), have been used to de\u00ad velop utilization rates comparable with those obtained from the Beneficiary Survey data. These data for hospital utilization rates (average days per person per year) are shown in the following table (without adjustment for decedents): National Health Survey Low-Cost Category As Shown in Report Adjusted 60-day to muaEstimate a xifrom Table 2 Men, aged 65-74 2.54 2.21162 Men, aged 75 and over 2.78 2.42 2.44 Women, aged 65-74 Women., aged 75 and over 1.61 2.18 1.40 1.90 l.94bj 2.55 Tibtal, aged 65 and over 2.10Y 1.91 l.99~ a/ Based on total hospital utilization with no maximum limitation being 15% higher than with 60-day maximum. bJObtained by weighting the rates by age (and, where applicable, by sex) by the estimated OASDI \"eligible\" population as of the beginning of 1960. -8\u00adIn the aggregate, the hospital utilization rates derived from the N411 data are very close to those developed from the 1957 Beneficiary Survey On the \"low-cost\" basis. Furthermore, it should be noted that the NHS1 data have some upward bias since they include utilization of Federal hospitals, which would not be covered under the bill (about 10% of all hospital days--for persons of all ages--were in Federal hospitals). Hospital utilization data have also been derived from the 1963 Survey of the Aged. The scope of this Survey is described in an article by Lenore A. Epstein, \"Income of the Aged in 1962: First Findings of the 1963 Survey of the Aged\",, Social Security Bualletin, March 19641. A considerable amount of the findings in regard to hospitalization is contained in an article by Dorothy P. Rice, \"Health Insurance Coverage of the Aged and Their Hospital Utilization in 1962: Findings of the 1963 Survey of the Aged\"., Social Security Bulletin, July 1964. In order to make a valid comparison with the hospital utilization data that are used in these cost estimates, the data from the Survey of the Aged have been adjusted so that hospitalization in short-stay hospitals that is in excess of 90 days has been eliminated. Table 3compares the hospital utilization rates for OASDI bene\u00ad ficiaries aged 65 and over as derived from the Survey of the Aged (with\u00ad out correction for decedents) according to whether the individuals had insurance. Unlike previous studies, there appeared to be no significant difference in hospital utilization depending upon whether or not the in\u00ad dividual had insurance. For men, the weighted rate for all ages combined was virtually the same as between those that had insurance and those that did not have insurance. Although the aggregate rate for women with in\u00ad surance was about 20% higher than for women without insurance, this was apparently due to the sizable differential for age group 80-84; in fact for three of the other four age groups the \"without insurance\" category showed higher utilization. Table 4 presents the hospital utilization rates for OASDI beneficiaries aged 65 and over for the data from the Survey of the Aged., combining the data for those with and without insurance. The intermedi\u00ad ate correction for decedents is made in order to obtain corrected rates that will be on a comparable basis with those shown in Table 2. The aggregate weighted utilization rate is 5.15 days, but this should be further adjusted because of the 90-day limit, since in Table 2 the data are based on a 60-day limit. When such an adjustment is made for Table 3, the utilization rate becomes 2.89 days. This is about 10% higher than the utilization rate in Table 2 based on the low-cost estimate (taking the comparable weighted average on the basis of the stationary population of the U.S. Total Population Life Tables for 1949-51) and is slightly lower than the intermediate-cost estimate based on the data in Table 2 (autilization rate of 2.92 days, being the average of 2.60 days and 3.25 days). In the aggregate, it may be said that the hospital utilization rates derived from the 1963 Survey of the Aged are very close to those developed from the 1957 Beneficiary Survey, which are used as the fundamental basis of the cost estimates in this report. Again, it should be pointed out that there is a certain margin of safety in the utilization rates devel\u00ad oped from both the Beneficiary Survey and the Survey of the Aged. The data for these rates are based on the experience of beneficiaries -9\u00ad Table 3 COMPAEISON OF HOSPITAL UT7ILIZATION RATES FOR OASDI BENEFICIARIES AGED 65 AND OVER, 90-DlAY MAX IMT, SUBDIVIDED BY WHETHER WITH INSURANCE, ACCORDING To 1963 SURVEY OF THE AGED (average days per person per year) Age With Insurance Men Without Insurance With Insurance Women Without Insurance 65-69 1.77 2.35 18 2.05 2.08 2.67 3.00 14.63 2.08 2.641 2.68 2.214 a] Based on age distribution of stationary population in U.S. Total Population Life Tables for 19149-51. -10\u00adTable 4+ ACCORDIW3 To 1963 SURVEY OF THE AGED (average days per person per year) Ae Survey Rate Correction for Decedentsa Corrected Rate 65-69 2.01 .37 2.38 .68 3.30 2.44 75-79 2.82 .61 3.43 8o-84 3.29 .96 4.25 85 and over 2.53 1.84 4.37 65 and over_/ 2.44 .59 3.03 Total Persons 65 and over_/ 2.52 .63 3.15 a/ Based on average stay of 9 days and on death rates from U.

Also,, the data in the surveys include utiliza\u00ad tion of Federal hospitals, which would not be covered under the bill. (c Modification of Survey Data to Allow for Decedents The hospital utilization rates derived from the Beneficiary Survey., modified as described above to allow for the effect of benefits being available as a right,. must be corrected to allow for hospitalization used by persons dying during the survey year.,who were not included in the Survey. For both cost estimates,, this correction was obtained for each age-sex group by applying to the estimated proportion dying in a year an assumed average number of days of hospitalization for decedents (8 days for the low-cost estimate and 10 days for the high -cost estimate). As indicated by Table 2,, the relative size of this correction naturally varies considerably by age and sex. For both cost estimates, the correction amounts to about 211% of the rate derived from the Beneficiary Survey for all ages combined,, but it is as little as about 15% for women aged 65-69 and as much as 35% for men aged 75 and over. The absolute amount of the cor\u00ad rection for decedents averages .53 days for a cost estimate intermediate between the low-cost and high-cost ones. An extensive study on the general subject of correcting hospital utilization rates derived from surveys so as to allow for decedents has been conducted by the Public Health Service, based on data from New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania during 1957. (\"H~ospital Utilization in the Last Year of Life,\" Health Statistics from the U.S. National Health Survey, Series D -No. 3,, January 1961). On the whole, after modifications to obtain comparability, the results of this survey agree reasonably well with the adjustments made in the cost estimates for the effect of the exclusion of decedents from the Beneficiary Survey. The aforementioned MOH report shows that for persons aged 65 and over., the unadjusted utilization rate was 1.67 days Per person per year, while the rate adjusted for decedents was 2.33 days. This is a difference of .66 days., or a relative increase of 39%. The absolute correction for decedents of .66 days in the NHS report is somewhat higher than used in these cost estimates (.53 days on the basis of the current age-sex dis\u00ad tribution of the eligibles). The correction based on NHS.data, however,, did not include the effect of a 60-day maiuwhich of course would have the effect of reducing the absolute corrcin(in days) and also the unadjusted utilization rate. Furthermore., it was derived from a popula\u00ad tion that is somewhat older on the average than the present OASDI eligible population (which includes those who are not current beneficiaries because of the retirement test)., since, the latter includes a higher proportion of the total aged population at the ages just beyond 65 than it does at the oldest ages. -12 \u00adThe percentage increase due to this correction factor was higher in the NMH report than in-these cost estimates (39% vs. 241$), both because of the foregoing two elements and because the absolute increase of the \"decedent' adjustment (interms of days) was measured against a lower un\u00ad adjusted rate, computed solely on the basis of reported experience of persons alive at date of interview (namely, 1.67 days in the NHS report as compared with the 2.21 days in the Beneficiary Survey). Current NIES statistics on hospital utilization by the population alive at date of interview are higher than formerly reported--as a consequence of the im\u00ad proved data-collection procedures now followed. Accordingly., when measured against this higher base., the days used by decedents would raise the estimated days used by all the aged (derived from the experience of sur\u00ad vivors) by a significantly lower amount than 39%,, especially after further adjustment for a 60-day limit and for age distribution. Therefore, the use of a 241$ correction factor for the data used in this Study appears reasonable. As a further point of comparison, the'NHS data shows that the average number of days of hospitalization per decedent is 9.57. After allowing for the effect of the 60-day maxinmum, this tends to confirm the~ assumption inthese cost estimates of 8 days for the low-cost estimate and 10 days for the high-cost estimate. A growing body of additional data on hospitalization experience of persons aged 65 and over, subdivided by health-insurance ownership and other relevant characteristics, is available from the National Health Survey. In some respects these findings are at variance with those from the Beneficiary Survey., partly because of the later time period and differ\u00ad ing population groups represented., and partly because of differences in survey techniques. On balance, the present cost estimates would be little changed if NHES data were substituted for corresponding Beneficiary Survey data. (d) Effect of Various Maximum-Daration Provisions The foregoing discussion has related to the derivation of hospital utilization rates on the basis of a 60-day maximum provision. It is as\u00ad sumed that such rates apply with equal accuracy whether the maximum relates to a calendar year, a benefit year, or a benefit period as defined in the bill. Proceeding from those basic cost factors, modifications have been made for proposals considered from time to time in the past that have had different maximum-duration periods or that introduced deductibles (whether expressed in terms of the first \"n\" days of hospitalization, a flat dollar deductible regardless of length of hospitalization, or a uniform dollar deductible per day for the first \"n\" days of hospitalization). The relative effect on the cost factors of increasing the maximum duration of benefits from 60 days to various other durations is as follows: 90 days -9%; 120 days -10O1%; days -12%; and 360 days -15%. Con\u00ad versely,, ifthe maximum duration is reduced from 60 days to 21 days,, the cost islowered by 15%. These factors have been derived from consideration of data from the National Health Survey and from private insurance experiences. -13\u00adInconsidering the cost effects of maximum-duration and deductible provisions on hospitalization-cost factors, it is necessary to have what is termed a hospitalization continuance table applicable to the particular beneficiary group involved. Such a table for persons aged 65 and over was derived from data from the National Health Survey (\"Hospitalization: Patients Discharged from Short-Stay Hospitals., United States, July 1957\u00ad June 1958\", Health Statistics from the U.S. National Health Survey., Series B -No. 7, December 1956, Pu.blic Health Service, U.S. Department of Health, Education., and Welfare) and is summarized in Table 5. III. Average Daily Cost of Hospitalization The second element in hospitalization-benefit cost estimates is the average daily cost (including both room and board and other hospital costs). (a) Past Increases in Hospital Costs and in Earnings Table 6 presents a summary comparison of the annual increases in hospital costs and the corresponding increases in earnings that have occurred since 19541 and up through 1963. The annual. increases in earnings are based on those in OASDI covered. employment., as indicated by first quarter taxable earnings, which by and large are not affected by the maximum taxable earnings base. The data on increases in hospital costs are based on a series of average daily costs (including not only room and board,, but also other charges) as prepared by the American Hospital Association. The annual increases in earnings have fluctuated somewhat over the 10-year period, although there have not been too large deviations from the average annual rate of 4i.0%; no upward or downward trend over the period is discernible. *The annual increases in hospital costs likewise have fluctuated from year to year around the average annual rate of 6.7%; the increases in the last 2 years were relatively low as compared with previous years. Hospital costs then have been increasing at a faster rate than earn\u00ad ings. The differential between these two rates of increase has fluctuated widely., being as high as somewhat more than 5%in some years and as low as a negative differential of about 1% in 1956 (with the next lowest dif\u00adferential being a positive one of about 1% in 1962). Over the entire 10-year period, the differential between the average annual rate of in\u00ad crease in hospital costs over the average annual rate of increase in earnings was 2.7%. It is conservative to assume t1at earnings will increase in the future at about 3%per year. It is difficult--and perhaps impossible--to predictprecisely what the corresponding increase in hospital costs wili be.* It would appear that,, at the least, hospital costs would,, on the average,, increase perhaps 2% per year more than earnings for a few years and that at the most., hospital costs would increase in the near future at an average annual rate that is 3%in excess of that for wages. It is recognized,, of course,, that these 'minimum\" and \"maximum\" assumptions result in a relatively wide spread in the cost estimates for hospital insurance proposals if the estimates are carried out for a number of years Into the future. -14 \u00ad0 tp~ L-J~CU c o\" qq u o KN W 4 \\r_: < o $ r 4@ P4 40 \" .O V clIHA\\ r-0 r1 4) co ci ;L 0 r. @5 P4NN 4) q-I 4 ci *1-4) P 0 1 EQ W 0 0 0 0,41.40 4 )0 )W'fl O e 00000 \\ *** *oC\\ @5 to 0 .4> 4) a.t\\ 4-0 i 0 0> 00 0)4\u00ad 4) t - 6) 0 H r C c \\10 0 'IOH IN\\~o 001 0o 4) 04 -15\u00adTable 6 COM4PARISON OF ANNUAL INCREASES IN HOSPITALIZATION COSTS AND IN EARNINGS Increase Over Previous Year Average Earnings Average Daily Calendar in Covered Hospitalization Ye ar Emnployment Costs 1955 3.8% 6.3% 1956 5.7 4.5 1957 5.5 7.7 1958 3.3 8.6 1959 3.3 6.8 1960 4.3 6.8 1961 3.1 8.5 1962 4.2 5.3 1963 2.4 5.6 Averagea/ 4.o 6.7 a/ ]Rate of increase compounded annually that is equivalent to total relative increase from 1954 to 1963. -16\u00ad(b) Assumptions in Cost Estimates Made Before 1963 The 1959 Hospitalization Report derived a figure of *21 a day for persons aged 65 and over in 1956 (see pp. 79.80). This figure was used as the basis for the long-range actuarial cost estimates made for that Report., since all the actuarial cost estimates for the OASDI system made at that time used the 1956 general. earnings level. The figure, however, was adjusted upward by 14% (to $24) to take into account the fact that., before 1956, hospital charges had been increasing more rapidly than the general wage level and would probably do so for at least a few more years. *The basis of the 14% increase was the assumption that over the next 4 or 5 years after 1956, hospital charges might increase at an average rate of about 6% (perhaps 7-8% in the beginning and lessening amounts thereafter) before an assumed leveling-off so as to have the same rate of increase as the general -wage level. It should be noted that by \"leveling off\" is meant that such effect would occur as an average trend in the future period, and not exactly in each and every year. Thus, during this short-run period, the cost estimates made in 1959 assumed that the \"real increase\" of hospital costs in relation to the general wage level might begin at 3-4% a year and then decline, so that a cumulative relative increase of 14% would precede the leveling-off at the end of the 4-5 year period. An analytical study was made in 1959 as to the reasonableness of assuming that after this 14% relative increase, there would be a leveling- off as between hospitalization costs and the general wage level. The data seemed to indicate that in the years since World War II, hospital daily costs have been increasing in a linear manner (at a rate of about *1.60 per year), and that wage rates have been increasing geometrically. Accordingly, although in the recent past the difference between these two trends series has been about 3-4% per year, this difference seemed to be declining somewhat. In early 1962,, the long-range cost estimates for the hospitalization benefits were again re-examined,, this time on the basis of the 1961 earn\u00ad ings levels and with consideration of the relative recent trends of hos\u00ad pital costs, taxable wages, and total wages. Inbrief, the results of this reconsideration were that both hospital-benefit costs and the \"savings\" to the OASDI system from raising the earnings base were increased--the former rising somewhat more than the latter. The long-range cost estimates of Actuarial Study No. 57 were based on level-earnings assumptions., at the 1961 level. Another--and equally acceptable--way of describing the earnings-assumption basis of these long-range cost estimates insofar as the resulting level-cost figures are concerned is to state that they are based on the assumption that if earnings rise, the deductible provisions and the earnings base will be kept up-to-date with their relative positions in 1961. Such assumed keeping up-to-date would not, of course., have to be done every year inthe future that earnings rose.,but would--in order to be consis\u00ad tent with the cost-estimate assumptions--have to be done at intervals of every few years, when such rises in earnings occur. It should be strongly emphasized that the savings resulting in the cash-benefits portion of the system when earnings rise and when the earnings base is increased would not need to be used to keep the HI portion of the system soundly financed., but rather the need would be fulfilled by having the HI contribution rate applied to a larger taxable payroll. -17 \u00adFurther, it may be noted that., for at least a number of years, the financial soundness of the program as determined under level-earnings assumptions would be maintained even though the earnings base and the deductibles were not kept up-to-date if the gains resulting under the OA.SDI cash-benefits portion of the system as wages rise were used.,, at least in part, to offset the increased cost (as a percentage of taxable payroll) arising for the hospital-benefits portion of the system and that hospital-benefit costs do not increase more than OASDI cash-benefit costs decrease. This., however., would require repeated legislative action to increase the allocation rates for the HI Trust Fund and at the same time to decrease correspondingly the allocation rates for the OASI and DI Trust Funds. If this practice is followed, it would mean that over the long run there would not be available sufficient funds for the cash benefits to be kept up-to-date with changing earnings levels. At this point., it may be worthwhile digressing to discuss the effect on the cost of the OASDI cash benefits of increasing-earnings trends. The benefit formula is \"weighted\" so that relatively higher benefits are paid to those with low earnings than to those with higher ones. For example., under present law the primary benefit for an average monthly wage of $300 is $105 per month (or 35.0% of average wage), while the corresponding benefit for an average monthly wage of $360 is $118 per month (32.8% of average wage). Thus., for an average wage that is 20% higher., the primary benefit increases only 12.11%. The effect on the financing of the program is evident., since contributions increase directly proportionately with increases incovered earnings., whereas benefits rise less than proportionately. In addition, there is the decreasing-cost effect that results from the lag involved when earnings levels rise,, since the average wage is,in essence, a lifetime one and thus is affected by the lower earnings levels of the past. The long-range actuarial cost estimates for the OASDI system always have assumed that earnings would be level in the future at about the level currently prevailing at the time the estimates were made. It has been recognized that if earnings levels rise in the future--as they have in the past- -the benefit level and the taxable earnings base will undoubtedly be modified. Rising earnings will automatically \"generate\" savings to the system that can be utilized for such purposes as keeping it up-to-date, although the savings may not be sufficient to do this completely. Another factor that results in \"automatic generation\" of savings to the OASDI system of cash benefits is the effect of raising the earnings base for tax and benefit-computation purposes. The reason for this effect is also due to the \"weighted\" nature of the 49nef it formula. Such changes have been made a number of times in the past=/for the purpose of keeping this element of the program up-to-date. qJ The earnings base was $3,000 during 1937-50, $3.,600 during 1951-54, and $11,200 during 1955-58, and it has been $4&,800 since 1959. -18 \u00adIn the past., the savings to the OASDI system resulting from the above two factors (rising-earnings levels considered alone, and increases in the maximum earnings base) have been utilized to keep the benefit structure up-to-date by such changes as increasing the general benefit level, adding new types of benefits, and liberalizing existing benefit Provisions. Ic) Assumptions in Cost Estimates Made for 1963 Administration Proposal In the long-range cost estimates of Actuarial St~ud No. 57 the average hospital daily cost for OASDI beneficiaries aged 65 and over was taken to be *3.1.30 (on the basis of 1961 price and earnings levels and on the basis of the 1961 age and sex distribution of the beneficiaries); this includes a 3%allowance for administrative expenses of the OASDI system for the hospitalization and related benefits (as discussed sub\u00ad sequently). This average hospital daily cost is adjusted in future years for the changing age-sex distribution of the beneficiary roll (thus, allow\u00ad ing for the \"aging\" of this group). The figure of *31.30 was derived in the following manner. *The average hospital-expense per patient-day in short-term general and special non-Federal hospitals for 1961 was estimated by the American Hospital As\u00ad sociation at *34.98 (see Health, Education, and Welfare Trends, 1962 Edition U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare., page 24). In accordance with adjustment procedures described in the 1959 Hospitalization Report (Page 79) and for reasons indi~,\u00a7\"d subsequently in this report,, this figure should be reduced by 13%~'-'to yield the estimated average reimbursable hospital daily cost for persons aged 65 and over. The resulting figure of *30.40 was then increased by 3%to yield the hospital daily cost for persons aged 65 and over, including allowance for administrative expenses. It should be pointed out that the foregoing figure for the average hospital daily cost for persons covered by the proposal did not include an allowance for a \"catching-up\" factor., as was previously done. In other words, the assumption made was that., following 1961, hospital costs would, on the average, increase no more rapidly than the general earnings level (as indicated previously, if such changes do occur, then it is further hypothesized that the system will be kept up-to-date insofar as the maxi\u00ad mum earnings base and the deductibles are concerned). Although it seemed likely that hospital costs would increase somewbat more rapidly than the general earnings level in the next few years,, it was presumed that any such differential would., over the long run, be counterbalanced by hospital costs rising less rapidly than the general earnings level (thus reflecting, although not nearly to the same extent as in other areas of economic activity, some productivity gains in the work -forceinvolved). eJ This isthe decrease from the 1956 figure of $24.15 in the AHAL series to the adjusted figure of *21.00 used for OASDI beneficiaries. -19\u00ad'The short-range cost estimates in Actuarial Study No. 57 assumed that hospitalization costs would increase from the actual 1961 level at an annual rate of 4%--part of this representing the increase in the general earnings level,, and the remainder reflecting the higher differential rate of increase of hospital costs relative to the general earnings level. The resulting estimated average hospital daily costs for persons aged 65 and over who are OASDI beneficiaries., exclusive of the 3% allowance for ad\u00ad ministrative expenses, were $355.60 for 1965 and $37.00 for 1966. The latter figure was the basis for the rounded figure of $37 that was the presumed average daily hospital charge used in the \"180-day maximum hospital duration\" alternative. The foregoing figures for average hospital daily costs for OASDI beneficiaries aged 65 and over are not completely comparable with similar figures inthe annual series issued by the American Hospital Association for persons of all ages because of three reasons: (1) The average daily cost for persons aged 65 or over is lower than for persons of all ages. The hospitalization experience data on which the cost estimates are based Indicate that, on the average, persons aged 65 or over have significantly longer durations. Accordingly, since the generally high costs for hospital exctras (such as use of operating room, laboratory tests, etc.), which most often occur in the first few days of hospitalization, are averaged over longer periodsconsisting generally of room-and-board costs only in the later days., the overall average will be lower than for younger persons. (2) The reimbursable costs under the bill would not include all the costs that go into the AHA figures (such as those for research, outpatient services, and public dining facilities). (3) The average daily cost developed by the AMA isbased on all hospital facilities--private rooms, semi-private rooms, and wards--whereas the various HI proposals,, inessence., provide semi-private room care. (d) Assumptions in Cost Estimates Made for Legislation in 1964 As indicated in the previous subsection., the assumption as to average daily cost that was made in connection with the 1963 Administration proposal was that., over the long range, hospitalization costs would increase after 1961 at the same rate as the general wage level. In the legislative con\u00ad sideration of the HI proposals during 1964,, itwas decided that, although the previous assumptions were reasonable, it would be equally reasonable to make somewhat more conservative assuurptions--namely, that the estimated 10% differential of hospitalization costs over wages in 1961-65 would be incorporated and thatover the next few years after 1965, hospitalization costs would rise more rapidly than wages and that thereafter they would -20 \u00adincrease at the same average rate., with the aggregate differential amount\u00ad ing to 10%. in essence then., this revised assumption meant about a 20% increase in the long-range cost estimates for HI proposals. (e)Assmptonsin Cost Estimates of This Report The Advisory Council on Social Security Financing., which was appointed in 1963 and completed its work by the end of 1964., considered the subject of hospitalization benefits and made significant recommenda\u00ad tions in this area ~at were quite simi.lar to the corresponding provisions contaiiied in H .R. l1-. The Advisory Council stressed that the assumptions used in estimating HI costs should be conservative (i.e., where judgement issues arise, they should be resolved in a direction that would yield a higher cost estimate). The assumptions suggested by the Advisory Council were that the estimated 1965 hospitalization costs should be assumed to increase in the future in relation to total earnings rates by a net differential of 2.7% per year for the first 5 years after 1965, with this differential than being assumed to decrease to zero over the next 5years; then during the following 5 years, the differential is assumed to reverse and then earnings are assumed to rise at an annual rate that is 0.5% greater than the increase in hospitalization costs. The net effect of these modified cost assumptions made by the Advisory Council, for 'purposes of the long-range cost estimates, is to produce level-costs that are about 20% higher than those resulting from the assumptions used in Actuarial Study No. 57 and that are about the same as those resulting from the assumptions used in connection with the estimates made for the 1964 legislative activity. For short-range pur\u00ad poses, however, the modified assumptions produce significantly higher estimates than either of the other two sets of assumptions. The cost estimates contained in this report are based on the same assumptions as to the relationship of long-range hospitalization cost trends and general earnings trends as was done in the Report of the Advisory Council. For the long-range cost estimates, the base figure for average daily hospitalization cost was taken for the year 1963, since the cost estimates for both the cash benefits and the HI benefits are founded on this basic assumption (which, in turn, means that there is also the coordinate assumption that the earnings base will, in the future, keep up-to-date with what $5,600 represented in 1963). The average daily hospitalization cost shown by the AHA series for 1963 was $38.91 (see He-alth, Education, and Welfare Trends, 1964 Edition, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,, page 23). When this is adjusted by the fJFor further details on this matter and on the cost assumptions made, see 'The Status of the Social Security Program and Recommendations For Its Improvement--Report of the Advisory Council on Social Security,, 1965\". This report has been published as a separate document, but it will be an appendix to the 25th Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Funid and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund,, scheduled to be published in March 1965. -21 \u00ad13% reduction f'actor mentioned previously, so as to give an appropriate figure for the HI proposal, it becomes $33.85 (before allowance for administrative expense, which is estimated at 3%of the benefit cost). It is then assumed that this average daily cost will increase by 2.7% per year (the average differential between hospitalization costs and earnings during 1954!-63) until 1965 and that thereafter the assumed differentials recommended in the Advisory Council assumptions prevail. For the purposes of the short-range cost estimates, which allow for an increasing trend in general earnings (as well as the aforementioned differential between hospitalization costs and general earnings)., the assumptions made result in an estimated average daily cost of $4i0.06 for 1966 and $Ii2.38 for 1967. IV. Intermediate-Cost Estimates for Hospitalization Benefits As indicated previously, low-cost and high-cost factors were developed for hospital utilization rates. An intermediate-cost factor is necessary for purposes of determining the financing basis of the program. In order to arrive at such a factor for the long-range estimate, the low-cost and high-cost factors were averaged and were applied to the intermediate estimate of persons aged 65 and over who are entitled (or could become entitled upon application) to monthly cash benefits under the OASDI system. Inconsidering the figures actually presented for the intermediate- cost estimate, it should be kept inmind that a considerable range of variation ispossible. The spread from the intermediate-cost estimate to the high-cost estimate (or to the low-cost estimate) isapproximately 10% due to the hospitalization element alone, and perhaps another 15% due to the range of variation inherent in the basic OASDI cost estimates. The cost figures shown for the first few years incorporate the low- cost assumptions as to hospital utilization (to allow for the normal lag in making \"use\" of insurance benefits), but thereafter the intermediate- cost factors are used. V. Cost Estimates for Post-Hospital Extended Care Benefits It is very difficult to make estimates for post-hospital extended care benefits because currently such facilities are not uniformly available in adequate amount in all sections of the country, and even more so be\u00ad cause there are a number of different concepts under which these benefits might be operative or be utilized by the medical profession. At the one extreme, such a benefit might be utilized almost entirely for very limited convalescent care and be applicable to only a relatively few cases. At the other extreme., the benefit might be utilized so broadly as to provide care that tends to emphasize the domiciliary element far more than ex\u00ad tended care (naturally,, both elements must be present., but much importance hinges on the relative predominance of one feature or the other). In fact, there is the question of whether, with the availability of this benefit, hospitalization will occur that, under present circumstances, -22 \u00adwould not be considered necessary and proper, and whether then post\u00ad hospital extended care benefits will be provided following these hospital stays. The bill provides that post-bospital extended care benefits be available only upon transfer from in-patient status in a hospital for further treatment of the condition that resulted in the hospitalization. It is not po~sible to know from the written definition exactly what the actual admitting and transfer-king practices may be. In the early years of operation, one limitation on the costs for this benefit will, of course, be the limited availability of qualifying facilities. In the long run, however, this cannot reasonably be regarded as a cost-control factor. In the 1959 Hospitalization Report, cost estimates were made for a strictly administered \"recuperative care only\" skilled-nursing-home benefit (and also for much broader provisions)--see pages 83-84. The original cost estimates for this ver~y limited benefit were based on the experience of a few Blue Cross plans having such a benefit. *The available data suggested that there might be annual utilization of 10 days of such care per 100 beneficiaries protected by this type of benefit. Since the average daily cost would be about $10, this produced, for the original cost estimates, an aggregate average cost of $1 per year per person aged 65 and over entitled to monthly OASDI cash benefits applicable to the initial years of operation. Subsequent staff consideration of skilled-nursing-home benefits analyzed the various elements involved in the cost of this type of benefit, namely: (1) Present number of skilled-nursing-home beds; (2) Number of such beds that are acceptable according to reasonable standards; (3) Estimated needed beds; (4) Proportion of beds occupied; (5) Proportion of occupied beds used by aged persons; (6) Proportion of the aged occupants of beds that consists of OASDI beneficiaries; (7) Proportion of occupants with duration less than 6 months; (8) Proportion of occupants who entered the nursing home by transfer from a hospital; and (9) Average daily cost. Use of the above data and analysis can produce a wide spread in the cost estimates--both short-range and long-range. This is particularly the case under the limited benefit protection provided by the current bill. -23 In the first full year of operation, the cost would be relatively low because of absence of facilities and because of lack of knowledge of the benefits available. Inthe next few years of operation., the cost would rise steadily as new facilities are built to meet the demand or as exist\u00ad ing facilities are improved to meet the qualifying conditions (and in recognition of the money available from the benefits). The long-range cost of these benefits would be higher than the early-year costs for a number of reasons--an increase in the number of available beds to meet the demands, OASDI beneficiaries being a larger proportion of the total population aged 65 and over, and a greater utilization of the benefits available. The cost estimates of Actuarial Study No. 522 Actuarial Study No. 57, and this report recognize these factors that produce higher long- range costs, and they also recognize the differences in the concept of this benefit and of the eligible facilities for furnishing them that exist as between the various legislative proposals. Also, they take into account the fact that part of the cost arising for these benefits., when more widely utilized,, will be an offset to the cost for hospitalization benefits. In the present estimates, it is assumed that this offset repre\u00ad sents 33% of the cost of the post-hospital extended care benefits and is taken as an offset against the hospitalization-benefits cost. VI. Cost Estimates, for Home Health Services Benefits \u00b6Lhe original estimates for home-health-service benefits were based on an assumed annual cost of $i per eligible beneficiary. This assump\u00ad tion was based on such limited experience with this benefit as was avail\u00ad able., taking into account also the limited general availability of such services at present. For the foregoing reason., it is likely that this is the cost that will develop in the early years of operation of the program. In later years,, however, it seems reasonable to assun that this type of service wili become generally available throughout the country., since there will be the money to pa~y for it. A study made by the Kansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield indicates that for persons aged 65 and over, the annual per capita cost was almost $6. Over the long-range,, for the country as a whole., it seemed that this was a much better figure to use than the previous figure of $1, and so this figure was used in Actuarial Study No. 52, Actuarial Study No. 57., and this report. If there are significant expenditures for home health services benefits, this should mean somewhat lower hospitalization and post-hospital extended care benefit costs. In fact, in cases where a person would other\u00ad wise be in the hospital but is instead receiving the much less expensive home health services., there would actually be a net savings in cost to the Program, or in other words the program would cost less because of the in\u00ad clusion of this type of benefit. It is believed., however., that any such savings-will be more than offset by the home health services being made available to people who would not otherwise be in hospitals or extended care facilities. Nonetheless., with the availability of these home health services on an expanded national) basis, there shoul~d be some offset taken against the hospitalization-benefits costs that would otherwise occur if there were no home health services benefits. This adjustment has been taken as 40% of the estimated cost for home health services benefits and is taken as an offset against the hospitalization-benefits cost. VII. Cost Estimates for Outpatient Hospital Diagnostic Services Benefits The cost estimate for the outpatient hospital diagnostic services benefits was first made on the basis that there would be no deductible. Relatively little experience is available in regard to the cost of this benefit for a group consisting of persons aged 65 and over. Such Blue Cross and insurance company experience as there isseems to indicate that the annual cost per capita will be about $7.50 (spread over the total pro\u00ad tected population and not merely among those who will.use this benefit). From a cost standpoint., the effect of amonthly deductible equa-l to 50% of the average daily hospitalization cost will be significant. This deductible provision will reduce the aggregate cost by an estimated 80%, since most of the charges for these services will be relatively small amounts, such as $10 for an X-ray. The number of claims will also be reduced by about 80% by the deductible provision, and thus a considera\u00ad ble amount of the administrative costs otherwise involved inpaying a large number of small claims will be eliminated. *The relative magnitude of the reduction arising from such a deductible tends to be verified by a study of the actual charges of hospital outpatients covered under group insurance policies (see \"eA Reinvestigation of Group Hospital Expense Ex\u00ad perience\" by S.W. Gingery in Transactions., Society of Actuaries, Vol. X1I, 1961, which gives data on such claims by size intervals). VIII. Estimated Administrative Expenses It is assumed that the administrative expenses that will be charge\u00ad able to the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for processing the benefit claims and for a pro-rata share of the cost of maintaining the earnings records and collecting the contributions will represent 3%of the benefit disburse\u00ad ments. This 3%element is included inthe cost figures for each of the various types of benefits, as described previously. This figure is con\u00ad sistent with the relative administrative costs of the most efficiently- run Blue Cross plans. The latter generally have administrative costs somewhat above 5%of premium collections, but this isbecause they have expenses that would not arise in connection with hospital benefits under OASDI--such as those for selling individual enrollments., collection of health insurance contributions alone., and maintenance of the rolls of in\u00ad sured persons solely for purposes of health insurance. Inthe early esti\u00ad mates for HI benefits., a 5%allowance for administrative expenses had been made., but studies by administrative personnel of the Social Security Ad\u00ad ministration now indicate that this is too high a figure for the type of program under consideration. -25 \u00adThe administrative expenses for the proposed benefits that are chargeable to the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund do not., of course., include the administrative expenses of the hospitals and other health agencies supplying the benefits., which are included as part of the benefit disburse\u00ad ments. Also not included are the record-keeping and tax-payment expenses incurred by employers in connection with the OASDI program. 1] -26\u00adC. Results of Cost Estimates This Section first discusses various matters relating to the actuarial cost estimates (such as the underlying assumptions and methodology) and then presents the cost estimates for the hospitaliza\u00ad tion and related benefits (considering also those made in regard to the 1961 and 1963 Administration proposals). Finally, it gives the cost estimates for the cash-benefits portion of the OASDI system, as well as the summarized estimates for the system as a whole. I. Concept of Actuarial Balance of System The concept of actuarial balance as it applies to the OASDI system differs considerably from this concept as it applies to private insurance and private pension plans, although there are certain points of similarity with the latter. In connection with individual insurance, the insurance company or other administering institution, in order to be in actuarial balance, must have sufficient funds on hand so that if operations are terminated, it will be in a position to pay off all the accrued liabilities. This requirement, however, is not necessary for a national compulsory social insurance system. It might be pointed out that well-administered private pension plans have frequently not funded all their liability for prior service benefits. It can reasonably be presumed that, under Government auspices, such a social insurance system will continue indefinitely into the future. The test of financial soundnessthen~is not a question of whether there are sufficient funds on hand to pay off all accrued liabili\u00ad ties. Rather, the test is whether the expected future income from tax contributions and from interest on invested assets will be sufficient to meet anticipated expenditures for benefits and administrative costs. Thus, since the concept of \"unfunded accrued liability\" does not by any means have the same significance for a social insurance system as it does for a plan established under private insurance principles, it is quite proper to count both on receiving contributions from new entrants to the system in the future and on paying benefits to this group. These additional assets and liabilities must be considered in order to deter\u00ad mine whether the system is in actuarial balance. The question of whether the OA~SDI program is in actuarial balance depends upon whether the estimated future income from contributions and from interest earnings on the accumulated trust fund investments wVill, over the long run, support the disbursements for benefits and administra\u00ad tive expenses. Obviously, future experience may be expected to vary from the actuarial cost estimates made now. Nonetheless, the intent that the system be self-supporting can be expressed inlaw by utilizing a contribution schedule that, according to the intermediate-cost estimate, results in the system being in balance or substantially close thereto. The congressional committees concerned with the program have., for many years, expressed the belief that it Is a matter for concern if any portion of the OASDI system shows any significant actuarial in\u00ad sufficiency. Traditionally, the view has been held that for the OASI portion of the program., if such actuarial insufficiency when measured over perpetuity has been no greater than 0.25% of taxable payroll, it-is at the point where it is within the limits of permissible variation. Th~e corresponding point for the DI portion of the system isabout 0.05% of taxable payroll (lover because of the relatively smaller financial magni\u00ad tude of this program). Thusfor the OASDI program as a whole, the permissable limit of actuarial balance is 0.30% of taxable payroll. Furthermore, traditionally when there has been an actuarial insufficiency exceeding the limits indicated, any subsequent liberalizations in benefit provisions were fully financed by appropriate changes in the tax schedule or through raising the earnings base, and at the same time the actuarial status of the miroaram vas imnroved. The 1963-64I Advisory Council on Social Security Financing (see footnote f) recamunded that long-range costs should be measured over a 75-year period, rather than over perpetuity., and that then the estimated actuarial status of each trust fund should be reasonably close to an exact balance., and much closer than has been the standard in the past. The cost estimates have been made on this basis,, with the assumption that., if the estimates show an exact balance,, at the end of the 75-year period the balance in the trust fund should approximate 1 year's benefit payments. II. Actuarial Status After Enactment of 1961 Act The changes made by the 1961 Amendments involved an increased cost that was fully met by the changes in the financing provisions (namely., an increase in the combined employer-employee contribution rate of t%., a corresponding change in the rate for the self-employed, and an advance in the year when the ultimate rates would be effective--from 1969 to 1968). As a result, the actuarial balance of the program remained unchanged from what it was before this legislation. Subsequent to 1961, the cost estimates were further reexamined in the light of developing experience. The earnings assumption was changed to reflect the 1963 level, and the interest-rate assumption used was modified upward to reflect recent experience. At the same time, the retirement- rate assumptions were increased somewh~at to reflect the experience in respect to this factor. The further developing disability experience indicated that costs for this portion of the program were significantly higher than previously estimated (because benefits are not being terminated by death or recovery as rapidly as had been originally assumed). Accordingly, the actuarial balance of the DI program was shown to be in an unsatisfactory position, and this has been recognized by the Board of Trustees, which recamnended that the allocation to this trust fund should be increased (while, at the same -28\u00ad time, correspondingly decreasing the allocation to the OASI Trust Fund, which under present law isestimated to be in satisfactory actuarial balance after such a reallocation).:W III. Basic Assumptions for Cost Estimates This subsection will consider various aspects of the cost assumptions. (a) General Basis for Long-Range Cost Estimates Benefit disbursements under OA.SI may be expected to increase con\u00ad tinuously for at least the next 50 to 70 years because of such factors as the aging of the population of the country and the slow but steady growth of the benefit roll. Similar factors are inherent in any retirement program, public or private, that has been in operation for a relatively short period. Estimates of the future cost of the OASDI program are affected by many elements that are difficult to determine. Accordingly, the assump\u00ad tions used inthe actuarial cost estimates may differ widely and yet be reasonable. The long-range cost estimates (shown for 1975 and thereafter) are presented on a range basis so as to indicate the plausible variation in future costs depending upon the actual trends developing for the various cost factors. Both the low-and high-cost estimates are based on high economic assumptions, intended to represent close to full eempployment, with average annual earnings at about the level prevailing in 1963. In addition to the presentation of the cost estimates on a range basis, intermaediate estimates developed directly from the low-and high-cost estimates (by averaging their components) are shown so as to indicate the basis for the financing provisions. The cost estimates for OASI are extended beyond the year 2000, since the aged population itself cannot mature by then. The reason for this is that the number of births in the 1930's was very low as compared with subsequent experience. As a result, there will be a dip in the relative proportion of the aged from 1995 to about 2010, which would tend to result in low benefit costs for the OASI system during that period. Accordingly, the year 2000 is by no means a typical ultimate year insofar as these costs are concerned. The cost estimates have been prepared on the basis of the same assumptions and methodology as those contained in the 214th Trustees Report (see footnote g). These estimates and their underlying assumptions are given in more detail in Actuarial Study No. 58. The underlying assumptions have not been revised., and new detailed cost estimates prepared, because preliminary study indicates that the changes that would be made would be largely counterbalancing from a cost See \"Annual Report of Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds, Fiscal Year 1963\" (House Doc.* No. 236, 88th Congress), pp. 61-62. -29 \u00adstandpoint. For example, lover costs would result from using the higher earnings level of 1964., but higher costs would arise from considering the higher retirement rates of the last few years and other factors. Besides, there isthe advantage of consistency and comparability inusing the same cost bases for a period of a few years, when no significant net changes in the results would occur. (b) Measurement of Costs in Relation to Taxable Payroll In general, the costs are shown as percentages of covered payroli. This is the best measure of the financial cost of the program. Dollar figures taken alone are misleading. For example, a higher earnings level will increase not only the outgo of the system but also, and to a greater extentj, its income. The result is that when earnings rise, benefit costs interms or dollars wifllalso rise., but the cost relative to payrofl wifl decrease. (c General Basis for Short-Range Cost Estimates The short-range cost estimates (shown for the individual years 1965\u00ad 72) are not presented on a range basis since--assuming a continuation of present economic conditions--it isbelieved that the demographic factors involved can be reasonably forecast, so that only a single estimate is necessary. A gradual rise in the earnings level isassumed for the future, paralleling that which has occurred inthe past few years. As a result of this assumption, even though all provi~sions of the system including the earnings base are assumed to remain unchanged in the future at what the bill provides, contribution income is somewhat higher than if-level earnings were assumed, while benefit outgo under the cash- benefits progra~m is only slightly affected. The short-range estimates presented here are consistent with those that will be shown in the 25th Trustees Report (to be submitted to Congress by March 1, 1965) and are slightly different from those in the Advisory Council Report (see footnote f), which were consistent with those of the 24th Trustees Report. (d) Comparison of Bases for Short-Range and Long-Range Cost Estimates Since the long-range cost assumptions do not involve an increasing- earnings assumption, the short-range and long-range cost estimates do not \"link up\" as between the 1972 data for the former and the 1975 data f or the latter. Thus, for the cash-benefits program the balances in the trust funds at the end of 1972 according to the short-range estimates are higher than what the long-range estimates would show for that year. Onx the other hand, for the hospital-benefits program the balance in the trust fund at the end of 1972 according to the short-range estimates is lover than what the long-range estimates show for that year (since the hospital benefit costs are assumed to rise as earnings increase--see subsequent discussion). -30 \u00ad (e) Level-Cost Concept An important measure of long-range cost is the level-equivalent contribution rate required to support the system over a long-range future period, based on discounting at interest. If such a level rate were adopted, relatively large accumulations in the trust funds would result, and in consequence there would be sizable eventual income from interest. Even though such a method of financing is not followed, this concept may be used as a convenient measure of long-range costs, which permits comparison of various possible alternative plans, with weight being given to both early-year and deferred benefit costs. (r Future Earnings Assumptions The long-range estimates are based on level-earnings assumptions at the level prevailing in calendar year 1963. This, however, does not mean that covered payrolls are assumed to be the same each year; rather, they are assumed to rise steadily as the population at the working ages is estimated to increase. If in the future the earnings level should be considerably above that which now prevails, and if the cash benefits are adjusted upward so that the annual costs relative to payroll will remain the same as now estimated for the present system, then the in\u00ad creased dollar outgo resulting will offset the increased dollar income. This is an important reason for considering costs relative to payroll rather than in dollars. The long-range cost estimates have not taken into account the possibility of a rise in earnings levels, although such a rise has char\u00ad acterized the past history of this country. If such an assumption were used in the cost estimates, along with the unlikely assumption that the benefits, nevertheless, would not be changed, the cost relative to taxa\u00ad ble payroll would, of course, be lower for the cash benefits, but the reverse would be so for the hospitalization and related benefits (as will be discussed inmore detail later). It is important to note that the possibility that a rise in earnings levels will produce lower costs of the cash-benefits program in relation to taxable payroll is a very important safety factor in the financial operations of this system. Its financing isbased essen\u00ad tially on the intermediate-cost estimate, along with the assumption of level earnings; if experience follows the high-cost assumptions, and earnings do not rise, additional financing will be necessary. However, if covered earnings increase in the future as in the past, the resulting reduction in the cost of the program (expressed as a percentage of taxable payroll) will more than offset the higher cost arising under experience following the high-cost estimate. If the latter condition prevails, the reduction in the relative cost of the program coming from rising earnings levels can be used to maintain the actuarial balance of the system, and any remaining savings can be used to adjust the cash -31 \u00adbenefits upward (to a lesser degree than the increase in the earnings level). The possibility of future increases in earnings levels should be considered only as a safety factor and not as a justification for adjusting benefits upward in anticipation of such increases. If benefits are adjusted currently to keep pace with rising earnings trends as they occur, the year-by-year costs as a percentage of taxable payroll would be unaffected. If benefits are increased in this manner, the level-cost of the program would be higher than now estimated, since, under such circumstances, the relative importance of the interest receipts of the trust funds would gradually diminish with the passage of time. If earnings and benefit levels do consistently rise, thorough consideration will need to be given to the financing basis of the system because then the interest receipts of the trust funds will not meet as large a proportion of the benefit costs as would be anticipated if the earnings level had not risen (under the present law, for example, for the OA~SI system, under level-earnings assumptions this proportion would average about 15% over the long range). (g) Interrelationship With Railroad Retirement System An important element affecting OASDI costs arose through amendments made to the Railroad Retirement Act in 1951. These provide for a combination of railroad retirement compensation and OASDI covered earnings in determin\u00ad ing benefits for those with less than 10 years of railroad service (and also for all survivor cases). Financial interchange provisions are established so that the trust funds are to be placed in the same financial position in which they would have been if railroad employment had always been covered under the program. It is estimated that, over the long range, the net effect of these pro\u00ad visions will be a relatively small loss to the OASDI system since the reimbursements from the railroad retirement system will be somewhat smaller than the net additional benefits paid on the basis of railroad earnings. (h) Reimbursement for Costs of Military Service Wage Credits Another important element affecting the financing of the program arose through legislation in 1956 that provided for reimbursement from general revenues for past and future expenditures in respect to the non\u00ad contributory credits that had been granted for persons in military service before 1957. The cost estimates contained here reflect the effect of these reimbursements (which are included as contributions), based on the provisions of the bill. Wi, Purposes of intermediate-Cost Estimates The long-range intermediate-cost estimates are developed from the low-and high-cost estimates by averaging them (using the dollar estimates and developing therefrom the corresponding estimates relative to Payroll). The intermediate-cost estimate does not represent the most Probable estimate, since it is impossible to develop any such figures. Rather, it has been set down as a convenient and readily available single set of figures to use for comparative purposes. -32 \u00adThe Congress, in enacting the 1950 act and subsequent legislation, was of the belief that the OASDI program should be on a completely self- supporting basis. Therefore, a single estimate isnecessary inthe development of a tax schedule intended to make the system self-supporting. Any specific schedule will necessarily be somewhat different from what will actually be required to obtain exact balance between contributions and benefits. This procedure, however, does make the intention specific, even though in actual practice future changes in the tax schedule might be necessary. Likewise,, exact self-support cannot be obtained from a specific set of integral or rounded fractional tax rates increasing in orderly intervals, but rather this principle of self-support should be aimed at as closely as possible. IV. Cost Estimates for 1961 Hospitalization-Benefits Proposal Long-range actuarial cost estimates for the 1961 proposalhj (as presented in Actuarial Study No. 52) that were made at about the time the 1961 bill was introduced indicated that the benefits provided ( and the accompanying administrative expenses) would be exactly financed, on a long-range basis, by the two sources of revenue to the Health Insurance Account. These two sources were an increase Of 1% inthe combined employer- employee contribution rate (and a corresponding inrease of 3/8% for the self-employed), effective in1963., and the net \"gain\" to the OASDI system resulting from increasing the maximum annual earnings base from $4800 to $5000, effective in 1962. The latter \"gain\" was estimated to be equivalent, over the long run, to the effect of a rise in the combined employer-employee contribution rate of .10% of taxable earnings. The bill provided that the equivalent of this level contribution rate was to be continuously appropriated to the Health Insurance Account. As indicated inthe previous section, these estimates were revised somewhat during the first half of 1961, as a result of the continuous process of study and investigation of all factors involved inthe actuarial cost estimates. Inparticular, this reexamination was focused on the three \"$subsidiary\" benefits (i.e.*, other than hospitalization benefits), which are less important cost-wise. The revised estimates for these benefits also included certain partially offsetting reductions inhospitalization- benefits costs, as discussed previously. hJThis Administration proposal vas contained in H.R. 14222, introduced by congressman King on February 13, 1961 (and in S. 909, introduced by Senator Anderson on the same date). -33\u00ad- -The folloI~ing table shows the original and revised estimates of itie 1.6vel-costsYI of the various types of benefits (plus administrative expenses) payroll: under the 1961 proposal, expressed as percentages of taxable Original Revised Type of Benefit Estimate Estimate* Hospitalization Skilled Nursing Facility .56% .01 .52% .08 (.57%) (.05) Home Health Services ..

Figures inparentheses are on the basis of \"net additional cost\" for the three auxiliary benefits. As will be seen from these figures, the level income of .60% of taxable payroll provided under the proposal would have been just sufficient to finance the benefits on a long-range basis according to the original intermediate-cost estimate, but would have fallen about 10% short rela\u00ad tively according to the revised figures. For this reason., the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in his testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee on this legislation inJuly 1961 recommended raising the earnings base from the $5,000 inthe bill to $5,,200; this change would have resulted in total financing of .66% of taxable payroll being available, or just sufficient to support the cost of the proposal, since the \"gain\" from raising the earnings base was estimated at .16% of taxa\u00ad ble payroll (on the basis of 1959 earnings levels). When the actuarial cost estimates (both for the cash benefits and the hospital benefits) were revised in 1962 to take into account 1961 earnings levels and other factors (as described previously), the finan\u00ad cing available under a $5,200 earnings base was estimated at .68% of taxable payroll (because of a larger \"gain\" from raising the earnings base), but the benefit cost wa estimated at .72% of taxable payroll. The Anderson-Javits Amendmenta/ that was considered by the Senate inJuly ~/The level-cost is the average long-range cost, based on discounting at interest, relative to effective taxable payroll (which isthe total earnings of all covered workers, reduced to take into account both the maximum taxable earnings base and the lower contribution rate for the self-employed as compared with the combined employer- employee rate so that, in effect, only 3/14 of the earnings of the self- employed within the maximum base are counted). For more details on this concept, see Section E of Actuarial Study No. 4.9. For cost estimates for proposals made before 1965, these level-costs are determined over perpe\u00ad tuity, while for the current proposal a 75-year period isalso used.a! For more details on this proposal and legislative action thereon, seeWilbur J. Cohen and Robert M. Ball, \"Public Welfare Amendments of 1962 and Proposals for Health Insurance for the Aged, \"Social SecurityBulletin, October 1962. 1962 was the same as the 1961 version of the King-Anderson Bill insofar as OASDI beneficiaries were concerned, except for having a $5,200 earnings base and except for restricting the skilled nursing home benefits to such services provided by hospital-associated facilities (just as in the 1963 Proposal). This change in the benefits reduced their estimated level-cost to .68% of taxable payroll, so that the financing was estimated to be just sufficient to support the benefits. V. Cost Estimates for 1963 Hospitalization-Benefits Proposal, Insured Persons Cost estimates for the 1963 proposalW were made on the same general basis as those described above for the Anderson-Javits Amend\u00ad ment. The following table shows the estimated long-range level-costs and first year costs (i.e., for 1965 on an accrual basis), by type of benefit, including the accompanying administrative expenses: Level-Cost* First-Year Cost Type of Benefit (as %of payroll) (in millions) Hospitalization .59% (.62%) $1,315 Skilled Nursing Facility .03 (.02) 30 Home Health Services .05 (.03) 10 Outpatient Diagnostic .01 (.01) 10 Total .68 $1,365 *Cost for hospitalization benefits is shown after offset for reduced cost because of availability and use of skilled nursing facility and home health service benefits. Figures in parentheses are on the basis of \"net additional cost\" for the three auxiliary benefits. The above figures for the first year of operation take into account the estimated actual price and earnings-level situation in 1965 (rather than the long-range assumptions in these respects). During the consideration of the 1963 proposail' by Congress in 19 6i4 , the underlying assumptions as to the relationship between hospitalization costs and the general earnings level were revised (as described in Sub\u00ad section III(d) of the preceding Section). As a result the estimated level-~cost of this proposal was increased to .82% of taxable payroll. kJThe 1963 Administration proposal was contained in H.R. 3920, introduced by Congressman King on February 21, 1963 (and in S. 880, introduced by Senator Anderson on the same date). See Actuarial Study No. 57 for the cost estimates for this bill. -35 \u00adThe version of H.R. 11865 (the Social Security Amendments of 19641 bill) that was approved by the Senate (but died in Conference) contained provisions for hospitalization and related benefits that were somewhat different from those of the 1963 proposal (H.R.3920) that was analyzed in Actuarial StuLdy No. 57. The cost of the Senate-approved bill was somewhat lower than that of the 1963 proposal because the maximum number of days of skilled nursing facility benefits was reduotd from 180 to 60 per benefit period; because a potential dynamic cost-sharing provision was introduced as an offset to the factor of hospitalitation costs possibly rising more rapidly than the general earnings level (as assumed in the cost assumptions); and because the taxable earnings base was higher (although, on the other hand,there was a small increase in cost due to the so-called \"transitional insured\" group). The estimated level-cost of this Senate-approved bill was .76% of taxable payroll (see \"Actuarial Cost Estimates for the Old-Age, Survivors,andDisability Insurance System as.Modified by H.R. 11865, as p?.assed by the House of Representatives and as According to the Action of the Senate\", issued by the House Ways and Means Committee). VI. Cost Estimates for 1965 Hospitalization-Benefits Proposal, Insured Persons Cost estimates for the cu~rrent Proposal have been made on the same general. basis as previously,. except that the assumptions as to the relationship between hospitalization prices and the general earnings level that were made by the Advisory Council (see Subsection III(e) of the preceding Section) have been used. Insofar as level-costs are con\u00ad cerned, these assumptions produce the same result as those used in connection with the legislation considered in 19641. The folio0ving table shows the estimated long-range level-costs and first-year costs (i.e.,, for fiscal Year 1967 on an accrual basis) bytype of b~enefit, including the (.02) 30 Home Health Services .05 (.03) 10 Outpatient Diagnostic .01 (.01) 10 Total .81i 1,720 *Cost for hospitalization benefits is shown after Offset for reduced cost because of availability and use of extended care facility and home health service benefits. Figures in parentheses are on the basis of\"A~tt additional cost\"for the three auxiliary benefits. -36\u00ad The figures for the first year of operation take into account the estimated actual price and earnings-level situation in 1966-67,, rather than the long-range assumptions inthese respects. The following table compares the estimates of the number of persons aged 65 and over affected by the proposal as of the middle of 1966 (in millions., rounded to nearest 50,000): Category Estimates Total Population 19*05a/ OASDI Insured 2.00 a/ 500,000 underenumeration in the pro\u00ad jected census estimates. bJ Does not include about 250.,000 individ\u00ad uals who are \"insured\" under both OA.SDI and Railroad Retirement (shown inthe preceding line). cJ Consists primarily of those who are pro\u00ad tected under the Federal Enployees Health Benefits Act or the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (also includes certain non-insured persons who do not meet the residence or citizenship requirements or who are members of a subversive organization or have been convicted of a serious offense involving subversive activities). -37 \u00adThe year-by-year costs of the benefit payments and the accompanying administrative expenses, according to the long.-range cost estiuates are as follows: Calendar Cost as Percentage Year of Taxable Payroll 1975 .8 1980 .91 1985 .93 1990 .94 2000 .86 2020 8 Unlike the trend for the cash-benefits portion of the program (which increases steadily in the future for at least the next 75 years, although reaching somevhat of a plateau in the two decades following 1990), the HI cost as a percentage of taxable payroll increases until 1990 and declines somewhat thereafter. This trend results from the fact that the increasing number of persons eligible for HI benefits is more than offset by the decreasing average daily hospitalization cost that results from the assumption of a continuing negative differential of J* between hospitalization costs and the level of general earnings, following 1975 (see Subsection III(e) of the preceding Section). Infact, as it so happens, the level-cost of the HI benefits isabout .84% of taxa\u00ad ble payroLl whether it is determined over a 75-year period or vhether it is determined over perpetuity. Table 7 shows the estimated operations of the HI Trust Fund in various future years, according to both the short-range and long-range cost estimates. Under the latter, the'trust fund grows steadily over future decades, although somewhat slowly between 1975 and 1990--such trend resulting from the assumptions made as to average daily hospitalization costs. Under the short-range estimate, the trust fund increases slowly for the first few years and represents somewhat more than I year's outgo at the end of 1970. A decline in the trust fund balance is indicated after 1971,, resulting from the fact that in this estimate, not only hoes\u00ad pitalization costs, but also earnings levels, are'assumed to increase steadily, but no change is assumed to be made in the earnings base to keep it up-to-date. Table 8 shows corresponding figures for the low-cost and high-cost estimates. These have been derived merely by assuming a 15% range in benefit costs around the intermediate-cost estimate. About 10% of this range can be attributed to the spread between the low-cost and high-cost estimates of hospital utilization rates (see Table 2)., and the remainder can be attributed to other factors that arise in relation to other factors (including those prevailing in the cash-benefits portion of the program). -38 \u00adTable 7 ESTIMATED PROGRESS OF HOSPITAL INSURANCE TRUST FUND UNDER H.R. 1, INTERM4EDIATE-COST ESTIT (in millions) Benef it Balance Payments and Interest in Fund Calendar Administra ve ona at End Year Contributions ExpenseT- FQn-a/ of Estimated a/ An interest rate of 3.5% is used in determining the level-costs, but in developing the progress of the trust fund., a varying rate in the early years has been used, which is equivalent to such fixed rate.

Note: Contributions include reimbursement for additional cost of noncon\u00ad tributory credits for military service. It should especially be noted that the operations of the HI Trust Fund are shown on the basis that they do not include the transac \u00ad tions for the \"nozi-insured\" or blanketed-in group. Fuirthermore, the benefit disbursement figures include only the net effect of the coverage of the beneficiaries of the Railroad Retirement system for the HI benefits, while the contribution figures do not include the HI contributions collected on railroad payrolls. Table 9 shows the actuarial balances of the various portions of the OASDI system under H.R. 1, expressed as percentages of taxable pay.\u00adroll for both the perpetuity basis and the 75-year cost basis (shown for purposes of comparability). On both bases, the HI program is shown to have a favorable actuarial balance of .05% of taxable payroll, since the level-equivalent of the-contribution schedule exceeds the level-cost of the benefit payments and administrative expenses. Most of this margin is., however, necessary so that there will be a satisfactory financial. relationship between income and outgo during the 2 or 3 decades following 1980 (when, as indicated previously, benefit disbursements relative to taxable -payroll reach a maximum and then decline). If the actuarial balance is computed over the 25-year period beginning with 1966, the level-equivalent of the contribution schedule is .87% of taxable payroll, while the level-equivalent of the benefits and administrative expenses is .85% of taxable payroll, or slightly above the figure for computations on both a perpetuity basis and a 75-year basis.. Thus, under this 25-year cost basis, the HI program has a favorable actuarial balance of only .02% of taxable payroll. VII. Cost Estimates for Cash-Benefits Portion of OA.SDI System Under H.R 1 This subsection presents the cost estimates for the cash-benefits portion of the OASDI system, as it would be revised by H.R. 1. Table 9 sumimarizes the actuarial balance of the existing OASDI program in terms of percentages of taxable payroll according to the intermediate-cost estimate and gives corresponding information for this program, as it would be changed by H.R. 1, showing the cost effect of each of the major changes. For purposes of comparability, the presenta\u00ad tion is in terms of both measuring the costs over perpetuity and of measuring them over only a 75-year period. On the 75-year cost basis, the QA~SI portion of the cash-benefits program is out of actuarial balance by . 05% of taxable payroll, while the DI program has a favorable balance of .02% of taxable payroll. Both of these differences areI small relatively so that itmay be said that the program as a whole, as well as each of its constituent parts, are in actuarial balance. Table 10 gives more detail about the actuarial balance of the several portions of the program as it would be modified by H.R. 1 according to the low-cost and high-cost estimates, as well as the intermediate-cost estimate, by analyzing the actuarial balances by considering their component parts--the level-costs of the benefits and the level-equivalents of the contributions.

The trust fund is estimated to show a decrease of somewhat over $900 million in calendar year 1965, which is caused by the benefit increases due to H.R. 1 being retroactive to the be\u00ad ginning of the year,. with no additional financing being provided over present law. In 1966 and 1967, however, the trust fund isestimated to show annual increases of about $500 million, so that its balance at the end of 1967 will be about the same as at the end of 1961.. Thereafter, very substantial increases (of about $4billion annually in 1968-70) are estimated to occur as a result of the larger allocation to the OASI Trust Fund resulting from the increase inthe combined employer-employee contribution rate from the 8j% scheduled for 1966-67 to the 10% rate scheduled for 1968-70. The effect of the increases in the contribution rates scheduled for 1968 and 1971--combined with the fact that the program is in substantial actuarial balance over the long- range--is that the OASI Trust Fund is estimated to increase significantly in the future, reaching somewhat more than $100 billion by the year 2000. Table 12 shows corresponding figures for the DI Trust Fund. In calendar year 1965, this trust fund is estimated to decrease by about $1130 million (as a result of the benefit increase occurring without any additional financing). A decrease of about $25 million isestimated for 1966., since the increase inthe allocation to this trust fund isnot fully effective in1966 (because of lag incontribution collections). Following 1966., however, according to the short-range estimate, the trust fund increases by approximately $100 million per year. The long-range estimate similarly shows that the DI Trust Fund will increase over the years, and by the end of the century its size is estimated at $5.6 billion. Tables 13 and 141present data on the progress of the OASI and DI Trust Funds, respectively, according to the low-cost and high-cost estimates. As would be anticipated, the balances in the trust funds under the low-cost estimate increase rapidly over the years, whereas under the high-cost estimate the trust funds are exhausted after some, time (inabout 30 years for the OASI Trust Fund and in somewhat more than 10 years for the DI Trust Fund).

The figures indicate the amount of money that would flow through the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund on the assumption that the General Treasury would reimburse the trust fund immediately after it had made its payments to the providers of the benefits. The table also shows the savings to the General Treasury and to State and local funds under the Medical Assistance for the Aged and the Old-Age Assistance programs (with respect to both insured and noninsured individuals receiving hospital and related benefits through the trust fund that would otherwise have been paid under the two assistance programs) under the assumption that the ser\u00ad vices under these programs would not be expanded; of course, if the States utilized such savings as indicated in the table to broaden their medical services, then the Federal savings shown would not materialize. The figures (in millions) are as follows: If No Blanketing-In If Blanketing-In MAA and OALA Savings Federal MAA adOASavings Net Calendar State and Cost State and Federal Year Federal Local for HI Federal -Local Cost 1966 $50 $6o $125 $90 $110 $35 1967 120 150 255 200 230 55 1968 130 14.0 250 205 255 4.5 1969 14.0 150 2415 215 2115 30 It will be observed that for the first full calendar year of operation (1967)., the estimated Federal savings in MAA and OAA would be about $120 million with respect to insured OA.SDI beneficiaries (in other words, assuming that there would be no blanketing-in), while the corresponding State and local savings would be slightly higher. On the other hand., if there is blanketing- in', the corresponding figures would be a cost to the General Treasury of about $255 million for the HI benefits (which would flow through the HI Trust Fund), but that this would be largely offset by Federal savings for MAA and OAA of about $200 million (again, $120 million with respect to OA~SDI beneficiaries and $80 million with respect to the blanketed-in group), leaving a net Federal cost of $55 million--as against a Federal savings of $120 million if there were no blanketing-in. Of course, the blanketing-in would have a favorable effect on State and local finances, since then their savings in MAA and OAA.would be about $100 million higher. Since the blanketed-in group is a closed one (with no new entrants after 1973), the cost therefor eventually disappears. The initial number of persons included in this category decreases slowly from the estimated 2.0 million in 1966 to about 1.1 million in 1970, since the effect of mortality more than off\u00ad sets the increments from new persons becoming eligible as they attain age 65. The estimated cost, under dynamic-economic assumptions, remains relatively -49\u00adlevel from 1966 to 1970--despite fewer potential beneficiaries--because of the rise in the estimated per capita cost and usage. After 1970, the number in the blanketed-in group is estimated to decrease rapidly- -to about .7 million in 1975 and .3 million in 1980,.and then is virtually negligible after 1990. -50\u00ad D. Problems Involved in Cost Estimates for Hospitalization and Related Benefits Long-range actuarial cost estimates, by their very nature., can present the general range of future costs but cannot be a precise fore\u00ad cast of future experience. This fact has been taken into consideration in the cost estimates for the OASDI program over the more than quarter century of its operation. From time to time the assumptions underlying the actuarial cost estimates have been revised to take into account later available data and indications of trends. The cost estimates for the proposed program of hospitalization and related benefits are subject to similar revisions. There is a somewhat greater relative range of probable costs for the proposed hospital benefits than for the OASDI cash benefits, which system has been paying monthly benefits for 25 years. Not only are the data in\u00ad complete for some of the various cost aspects and factors underlying the proposed hospitalization benefits as they would be provided under a social insurance system., but also service benefits quite obviously do not have costs as readily determinable as cash benefits that are directly related to covered earnings. But it should be recognized that, similarly., when the present OASDI cash benefits program was enacted in 1935, little was known about many of the factors entering into the actuarial cost estimates. Then, as now., assumptions had to be made on the basis of the data available,, using the best possible actuarial judgment. From a cost standpoint, the major benefit in the bill isthe pro\u00ad vision of hospital care. A great amount of data is available inregard to hospitalization experience of aged persons. Principal sources include the 1957 Beneficiary Surveys made by the Social Security Administration,, the continuing investigations made by the National Health Survey of the Public Health Service., the 1963 Survey of the Aged made jointly by the Bureau of the Census and the Social Security Administration, and the experience of various insuring organizations such as the Blue Cross and private insurance companies. Much of this information has previously been summarized in the 1959 Hospitalization Report. Nonetheless, precise estimates are not possible because of such unknowns as the extent of hospital utilization by persons who have not had insurance inthe past, but who would have benefit coverage under the provisions of the bill. Another major difficulty in making cost estimates for hospitalization benefits isthe extent to which hospital costs will rise in the future. The long-range actuarial cost estimates for the OASDI system have always assumed that earnings would be level in the future--for reasons that are described in detail elsewhere (see Actuarial Study No. 4i9,, page 8, and the Report of the Coummittee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives on the Social Security Amendments of 1961., H. Rept. No. 216, 87th Cong.., April 7, 1961, pp. 14-16). This assumption means that benefit costs relative to payroll will not be affected by any rising-earnings trend that may develop, because it is assumed that the benefit structure (including the maximum earn\u00ad ings base that is creditable toward benefits and that is subject to contribu\u00ad tions) wili be adjusted to keep pace with the rising earnings. -51\u00ad When earnings levels have increased in the past (increasing both benefit outgo and tax income--the latter more than the former, because of the weighted benefit formula), this factor has been recognized in subsequent cost estimates. Any resulting net reduction in cost has been made available for the financing of the program, including proposed bene\u00adfit liberalizations. idberalizations financed entirely in this manner tend to keep the system up to date*. In considering the hospitalization-benefit costs in conjunction with a level-earnings assumption for the future, it is sufficient for the purposes of long-range cost estimates merely to analyze possible future trends in hospitalization costs relative to covered earnings. Accordingly, any study of past experience of hospitalization costs should be made on this relative basis. The actual.-experience in recent years has indicated, in general, that hospitalization costs have risen much more rapidly than the general earnings level., with the differential being in the neighborhood of 2.7% per year in the past decade. One of the uncertainties in cost estimates for hospitalization benefits, then, is how long and to what extent this tendency of hospital costs to rise more rapidly than the general earnings level will continue in the future--and whether or not itmay, in the long run be counter\u00ad balanced by a trend in the opposite directions. factors to consider *Some are the relatively low wages of hospital employees (which have been rapidly \"catching u\" with the general level of wages and obviously may be expected to \"catch up\" completely at some future date, rather than to increase in\u00ad definitely at a more rapid rate than wages generally) and the development~ of new medical techniques and procedures., with resultant increased expense. In connection with the latter factor, there are possible counterbalancing factors, in that the higher costs involved for more refined and extensive treatments may be offset by better general health conditions., the development of out-of-hospital facilities (which involve lower costs)., shorter durations of hospitalization, and less expense for subsequent curative treatments as a result of preventive measures. Also, it is possible that at some time in the future,, the productivity of hospital personnel will increase significantly, and accordingly, as in other fields of economic activity., their wages will increase more rapidly than prices charged for hospitalization. Perhaps the major difficulty inmaking., and in presenting,, these actuarial cost estimates for hospitalization benefits is that--unlike for the OASDI monthly benefits--an unfavorable cost result isshown when total earnings levels rise unless the provisions of the system Far kept up-to-date (insofar as the maximum taxable earnings base is concerned~j'). 'The reason for this isthat there isthe fundamental actuarial assumption that the aJIf the deductibles were expressed in terms of dollars (instead of in terms of average daily hospital cost, as in the bill), there would also be the requirement that these would have to be kept up-to-date. -52\u00adhospitalization costs will rise at a slightly lover rate over the long run as the total earnings level, whereas the contribution income rises less rapidly than the total earnings level since it depends on the covered earnings level, which is dampened because of the effect of the earnings base. Accordingly, it is necessary in the actuarial cost estimates for hospitalization benefits to assume either that earnings levels will be unchanged inthe future or that, if earnings continue to rise (as they have done inthe past), then from a given point of time, the system will be kept up-to-date insofar as the earnings base is concerned. The other three benefits provided by the bill would have a far lower relative cost than the hospitalization benefits (assuming that the types of services provided by the different facilities remain approximately the same as at present). Accordingly, even relatively large variations in the cost estimates for these benefits would have much less effect on the overall costs of the proposal. Although these services are now being ex\u00ad tensively provided in a number of areas, comparatively little data are available inregard to their cost for aged persons., when provided in the manner set out by the bill.. Inmany instances, these services are not currently available because of lack of facilities (or insufficient facilities). Accordingly, the early-year costs for these benefits will be relatively low. The long-range costs, however, are determined on the assumption that suf\u00adficient, adequate facilities will be available to supply the benefits pro\u00ad vided. Another important factor in connection with the actuarial analysis of proposals for various types of hospitalization and related benefits is their cost-interplationship. For example, ifhospitalization benefits were provided, but post-hospital extended care were not, there would tend to be more utilization of the hospitalization benefits because an individual would be more likely to stay longer in a hospital (at little or no cost to him) rather than to enter an extended care facility operating at lower cost, but with the full amount to be paid by him. Similarly, if there were no out\u00ad patient hospital diagnostic benefits provided in the bill:, and if there were no deductible inthe hospitalization benefits, there would be a financial incentive for an individual to enter a hospital (with resulting higher cost) to obtain these services without cost to him. idkewise, the availability of home health services can reduce hospitalization-benefit costs in certain cases. Otherwise, an individual might enter a hospital, or stay in it longer, if indoing so there were less cost to him personally than inobtaining home health services. On the other hand, the home health services, when available, will undoubtedly be utilized by many persons who would not otherwise have been inhospitals. Inthe same way, the presence (or absence) of a deductible provision for one benefit can influence not only the cost of that benefit, but also the costs of other types of benefits.

SCHNEEEELI, of Pennsylvania; Hon. HAROLD R.-COLLIER, of fllinois; Hon. MELVIN R. LAIRD, of Wisconsin; Hon. BEN REIFEL, of South Dakota; Hon. WILLIAM L. DICKINSON, of Alabama. The plan will more adequately meet the medical needs of the aged than the administration's medicare proposal. It will be more equitable. It will not en- danger the soundness of the social se- curity system. It will be voluntary in- stead of compulsory, The administration plan is generally limited to hospital and nursing home ax- penses. This plan will cover both hos- pital and nursing home care and surgical and medical expenses. It is both com- prehensive in scope and comprehensive In effect. It will cover up to $40,000 Of expenses.The administration plan is compulsory. This plan is voluntary and every citizen over 65, without a means test, will be eligible for coverage under it. The administration plan is inequitable. It requires wage earners to pay a regres\u00ad sive payroll tax chargeable to the lowest levels of income to provide medical bene\u00ad fits for others--a tax misleadingly justi\u00ad fied on the basis that workers are Prepay \u00ad ing for their own care. This plan will mainly be financed from two sources- the beneficiaries themselves based upontheir ability to pay, and by the Federa] Government through general revenues derived from taxes collected on the same principle. In addition, provision will be made for the States to share in financ\u00ad ing full participation for the medically indigent. The administration plan endangers the adequacy of retirement, death, and disability benefits under the social secu\u00ad rity system by pushing the regressive payroll tax to the limits of acceptability. The insurance concept of this plan, its method of financing, and its administra\u00ad tion are completely independent of the social security system. Social security benefits are used merely as a test of abil- Ity to pay the individual contribution. The social security system's only in\u00ad volvement is the assignment of a speci\u00ad fied percentage of an individual's social security benefits to a health insurance fund administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. In summary, the administration's medicare proposal is unsound and dangerous. Its enactment would start us down a path from which there is no returning-the path toward regimented and deteriorating medical care. We propose a solution which we believe is typically American--comprehensive, fair, voluntary, and oriented to individual freedom and initiative. This is the way to meet the urgent needs of our elder citi\u00ad zens in the financing of medical care. In brief outline, the plan would work as follows: All Persons aged 65 or over would be eligible, on a uniform basis, for insur\u00ad ance protection equivalent to the Gov\u00ad ermient-wide indemnity benefit plan. Their participation would be voluntary; there would be no means test. Enroll\u00ad ment would be during an initial enroll\u00ad ment period, followed by periodic enroll\u00ad ment periods. For those under social security-or railroad retirement-enrollment would be exercised by an assignment of a Premium contribution to be taken out of, or checked off, the individual's current social security benefit. Those not under social security would execute an applica\u00ad tion accompanying it with their initial premium contribution. State agencies would be granted an option to purchase the' insurance for their old-age assist\u00ad ance and medical assistance for the aged recipients at a group rate. Premium contributions by individuals would be based upon the cash benefits which they would either receive, or be entitled to receive, upon reaching age 65. 2016 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE FebruarY 4 The premium would be 10 percent of the minimum social security benefit and 5 percent of the balance. Theme receiving the lowest social security benefits would pay the least. The average premium contribution on the basis of today's ben- efit -levels would be $6 per month per person. Persons not under social secu- rity would pay a premium equivalent to the maximum contribution of an indi- vidual 'under social security. The re- mainder of the cost of the insurance would be paid by the Federal Govern- ment out of general revenues. Benefits would be paid out of a na- tional health Insurance fund. The fund would receive as deposits the contribu-tions of individuals, contributions from the -social security system and Railroad Retirement Board on behalf of indi- viduals covered under those systems, State contributions for OAA and MAA recipients, and annual Except for the liberalization of the coverage of hospital room and board to include nursing homes, the Program is in all respects identical to the high option of the governmentwide indemnity plan offered to Federal employees. This means that an individual can undergo major surgery and have paid in full the first $1,000 of hospital room and board plus 80 percent of all other hospital and medical expense incident to that opera- tion after a deductible of not more than $50. In addition, the program will cover 80 percent of all posthospital medical ex- pense after the deductible of $50 ha been exceeded by prior expense, includ- ing the $25 deductible applicable to the hospital charges. MgrHOD OF FINAN2CING The program would be financed by a graduated premiu~m contribution by the Individual participants based on ability to pay, supplemented by an annual ap- propriation from the general revenues, BY including a contribution Or Pre-mium charge, the cost of the program is shared by those who receive the benefits and by the Government. unlike the King-Anderson bill, the program does not rely upon a regressive payroll tax for financing. The program thus avoids the dangerous fiction inher- ent In the King-Anderson bill that, through the use of a payroll tax, today's workers and their employers are prepay- ing the cost of health protection for their later years. The fact is that the regres-exercised by authorizing a \"check-off\"1 or assigrunent of the prescribed premium contribution out of the individual's cur\u00ad rent monthly social security benefit. An election by those not under social se\u00ad curity-or railroad retirement-will be evidenced by execution of an application for participation in the program and the payment of premium contributions. BAS3B FO PRMU CONTUIBUTIONS The premium contributions by the par\u00ad ticipants are graduated according to abil\u00ad ity to pay as evidenced by their old-age insurance benefit. The premium is an amount equal to 10 percent of the mini\u00ad mum cash benefit of a primary benefl\u00ad cay-crety$0prmnhpuperycntreftth $40itiper month-plusfi5 payable to the primary beneficiary and his spouse-if over age 65. This Will re\u00ad sult in an average premium contribution of $6 per month per person. If an individual otherwise entitled to receive cash benefits under social se\u00ad curity is ineligible for such benefits--orsuch benefits are reduced-on account of the earnings test, this will not affect the individual's contribution. The amount of the individual's contribution will be, paid by the Social Security Administra\u00ad tor to the Insurance program irrespec\u00ad tive of earnings. To this extent, there is an automatic liberalization of the earnings test.

The program provides for full coverage of the first $1,000 of hospital-_or nursing home-room and board plus 80 percent of any balance. This is the equivalent to 50 days In the hospital or IOO-days of a qualified nursing home without a de- ductible. In addition, the program provides for 80 percent of all other hospital, surgical. and medical expenses, after a deductible of $50, of which only $25 will apply to other hospital charges. This includes professional services of doctors, such as surgery, consultations, and home, office, and hospital calls, professional services of registered nurses, diagnostic services, rental of medical equipment, ambulance service, and prescribed drugs and medicines, The program covers the catastrophic illness, with up to $40,000 in benefits, No longer will the life savings of an el- derly person be wiped out because of a major illness, The program will pay the actual charges for the service, subject to the reasonable and customary test used by private Insurers.

Since there is a cost to the insured, those who already have ade- quate programs paid for by their former employers or through associations and the like, may decide not to participate in the GOVernment-sponsored Program, The automotive workers, the chemical workers, and other large industrial groups, have. fully paid comprehensive health plans for retired workers.

A couple receiving the mini\u00ad mum social security benefit-currently $60--will be able to buy the same health insurance at a cost of $5 per month. The amount of the Government subsidy thus varies with the economic status of the individual, as measured, by social secu\u00ad rity benefits. At the conference on the social secu\u00ad rity amendments bill of 1964, it was vir\u00ad tually agreed that OASI cash benefits should be increased by 7 percent with a minimum increase of $5 per month. We can assume that an increase will be en\u00ad acted this year at least~equal in amount. This will provide the QASI beneficiaries with additional funds required to par\u00ad ticipate in the Insurance program. Persons who are not under social secu\u00ad rity may Participate by a premium con\u00ad tribution equal in amount to the maxi\u00ad1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE 2017 mum contribution of those eligible under social security. Where payment of the Premium would represent an undue hardship, such as in the case of a per- son under old-age assistance, the in- dividual could be included under the group buy-in option extended to the States. The insurance concept is completely independent of the social security sys- tern. Social security benefits are used merely as a test of ability to pay in deter- mining the amount of the individual con- tribution.

The State agency will have considerable flexibility in meeting the requirements of these groups. If the in- dividual is a social security beneficiary, Presumably the State would require the individual to elect the benefits through the assignment of social security benefits and increase the individual's old-age as- sistance cash allowance to make up the difference. Other recipients of State aid could be blanketed in at the group rate. Thus, while the individual contribu- tions will vary, all persons over 65 will be eligible for the identical comprehen- sive Protection. No distinction is made between the person covered on an indi-vidual basis, the recipient of OAA or the recipient of MAA. ADMINISTRATION OF PROGRAM There will be established a national health insurance fund. The fund will be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. Premium contributions of the individual participants will be deposited directly to the credit of the fund. An appropriation will be made annually to provide for the additional amount re\u00ad quired by the fund in order to finance benefits for the, ensuing benefit period. The general administration of the in\u00adsurance program will be entrusted to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. That Department will be charged with the responsibility of mak\u00ad ing known the program to those pres\u00adently over age 65; notifying those reach\u00ad ing age 65 in the future of their rights to participate; maintaining records; pre\u00ad paring actuarial studies; and presenting the appropriation requests for the pro\u00adgram to the committees of the Con\u00ad gress, and so forth.

The historic legislation, Public Law 89-97, establishes two coordinated health insurance programs for the aged and makes a number of substantial improvements in the existing old-age, survivors, and disability insur- ance (OASDI) program and other programs under the Social Security Act. The most significant changes in the social security system are the following: 1. Establishment of two related national health insurance programs for the aged-(a) a basic plan affording protection against the costs of hospital and related care, and (b) a voluntary supplementary plan covering payments for phy- sicians' services and other medical and health services. 2. A 7-percent increase in OASDI benefits. 3. Liberalization of the definition of disability. 4. Liberalization of the retirement test. 5. Payment of benefits to eligible children aged 18-21 who are attending school. 6. Payment of benefits to widows at age 60 on an actuarially reduced basis. 7. Coverage of self-employed physicians. 8. Coverage of tips as wvages. 9. Liberalization of insured-status require- ments for persons already aged 72 or over. 10. Increase to $6,600 in the contribution and benefit base. 11. Increase in the contribution rate schedule. The amendments include the following import- ant changes in the public assistance titlcs of the Social Securit~y Act.' * Mr. Cohen is Under Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and Mr. Ball is the Commissioner of Social Security.

The major changes in the maternal and child health and child welfare services are the follow\u00ad ing: 1. Increase in the annual authorizations of 'Federal funds for the three programs. 2. Authorization of special project grants to provide comprehensive health care for children of low-income families. Background and Legislative History of the Insurance Provisions The Social Security Amendments of 1965 em\u00ad body the most far-reaching social security legis\u00ad lation to be enacted since the original Social Security Act was passed 30 years earlier. The law closes one of the major gaps in the economic security of the elderly by providing protection against the high costs of hospital and medical care, and it brings the existing OASDI program more in line with current economic and social conditions. Bills to provide hospital insurance and related health benefits as part of the social security sys\u00ad tem have been introduced in every Congress sne15.TepooasddntrcieatvsicgessionalTh c roonsieats io nowevereuntiv58 ogesolcnidrtohwvutl198 1 when Representative Forand (D., R.I.) intro- duced a bill that became the subject of testimony in public hearings before the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives on the Social Security Amendments of 1958. The Committee concluded that more information was needed before legislation could be recommended, and no further action was taken on the proposal at that time. In 1959 and 1960 the Committee on Ways and Means held public hearings on several proposals to amend the Social Security Act, including another bill (H.R. 4700) introduced by Repre- sentative Forand to provide \"insurance against the costs of hospital, nursing-home, and surgical services for persons eligible for old-age and sur\u00ad vivors insurance benefits.\" The Committee, after careful review of the many proposed solutions to the problem of meeting health costs in old age, concluded that Federal action was necessary but did not. recommend adoption of the proposal for hospital insurance under the social security sys- tern. Instead, the Committee recommended addi- tional medical assistance for the needy aged through liberalizations in the Federal-State pub- lic assistance programs. This proposed medical assistance legislation wvas later modified by the Senate Finance Committee, and the result was a new program of medical assistance for the aged. Before its passage, Senator Clinton P. Anderson (ID., N. Mex.), Senator John F. Kennedy (D., Mass.) and eight other Senators proposed adding a program of hospital insurance for persons aged 68 and over who were eligible for OASDI bene- fits. The amendment was defeated by ia vote of 51 to 44. The medical assistance legislation -often referred to as the \"Kerr-Mills\" program-won bipartisan support and was enacted on Septem- ber 13, 1960, as part of H.R. 12580 (P. L. 86- 778). These amendments made Federal matching grants available to the States to help finance programs of medical assistance for older per- sons who do not receive old-age assistance pay- ments but who cannot afford necessary medical care. The legislation also provided increased Fed- eral grants to help the States furnish more nearly adequate medical aid to old-age assistance recipients. With the election of President Kennedy in 1960, t~he proposal for hospital insurance for the 2 aged under the Social Security Act became part of the Administration's legislative program. In 1961 the Administration-sponsored hospital in\u00ad surance proposal was contained in bills intro\u00ad duced by Representative King (D., Calif.) and by Senator Anderson (D., N. Mex.) and Senator Javits (R., N.Y.). In 1962, Senator Anderson proposed, as an amendment to the public welfare bill, hospital insurance as part of the social security system. The Senate voted 52 to 48 to table the amend\u00ad ments, and no further action was taken on the proposal by the Eighty-seventh Congress. ACTION IN THE EIGHTY-EIGHTH CONGRESS In his State of the Union Message of January 14, 1963, President Kennedy urged the new Con\u00ad gress to enact a program of health insurance for the aged under the Social Security Act. He elab\u00ad orated on this theme in both his special Message on a Health Program, submitted to Congress on February 7, and in his special Message on El\u00ad derly Citizens of Our Nation, submitted on Feb\u00ad ray 2.In the latter message, the President recommended not only t~he enactment of a pro- grain of hospital insurance for t~he elderly but also numerous improvements in the OASDI pro\u00ad gram, such as increases in benefit amounts and in the contribution and benefit base. Representative King and Senator Anderson again introduced the proposed hospital insurance legislation on behalf of the Administration; the two compan\u00ad ion bills were introduced on February 21, 1963. On July 7, 1964, the House Committee on Ways and Means reported out H.R. 11865, which pro\u00ad vided for a number of major improvements in the social security program, including a 5-per\u00ad cent increase in cash benefits and extension of coverage to additional groups. Although propos\u00ad als for a hospital insurance program for the aged were considered by the Committee, the propo\u00ad nents did not, request that the Committee vote either on the hospital insurance measure or on any changes in medical assistance for the aged. H.R. 11865 was passed by the House by a vote of 388 to 8. The Senate Finance Committee rejected pro\u00ad posals to add to H.R. 11865 hospital insurance for the aged within the framework of the social SOCIAL SECURITY security program. During the Senate debate on H.R. 11865, however, an amendment to provide such a program was adopted by a vote of 49 to 44, and the Senate subsequently passed the bill by a vote of 60 to 28. The Conference Committee failed to reach agreement on the hospital insur\u00ad ance part of the bill as passed by the Senate, and H.R. 11865 died in the Conference Committee when the Eighty-eighth Congress came to an end on October 3, 1964. CONGRESSIONAL ACTION IN 1965 As the Eighty-ninth Congress convened on .January 3, 1965, there was every indication that major social security legislation related to both health insurance and increased cash benefits would be on its agenda for early consideration. The improvements in OASDI that had failed to be enacted 3 months earlier because the Confer- ence Committee did not agree on the hospital insurance provisions of H.R. 11865 were con- sidered to be noncontroversial. It was also gen- erally conceded that the November elections had ensured passage by the House of any hospital insurance legislation that the Committee on Ways and Means might report out. Finally, the House, in an unusual action, changed the composition of the Ways and Means Committee-shortly after Congress convened-to reflect the large majority that the Democrats held in the House of Repre- sentatives. On January 4, 1965, Representative King intro- duced H.R.. 1-the Administration's proposals for hospital insurance and improvements in the OASDI program as well as in the public assist- ance programs. Senator Anderson introduced the companion bill, S. 1. The King-Anderson bills contained a number of the provisions that had been considered by Congress in 1964. The major provisions of H.R. 1 were: 1. Hospital insurance for the aged. 2. A general increase of 7 percent in cash benefits. 3. An increase to $5,600 in the contribution and benefit base. 4. An increase in the contribution schedule. ,5. Coverage of self-employed doctors, 6. Coverage of tips. 7. Extension of the period for filing proof of BULLETIN, SEPTEMBER 1965 support and filing application for lump-sum death payments. 8. Automatic recomputation of benefits. Action of Ways and Moans Committee On January 27 the Committee on Ways and Means began executive sessions on the King- Anderson bill and other bills, particularly H.R. 288, which was introduced by Representative Byrnes (R., Wis.)-the ranking minority mem\u00ad ber of the Committee. The OASDI provisions of H.R. 288 were similar to those in H.R. 11865, but there was no provision for hospital insurance. Two other bills, which would have provided health insurance oenefits for the aged under a system not related to social security, also received the Commnittee's attention. The by Representative Herlong (D., Fla.) and Representative Curtis (R., Mo.). This pro\u00ad posal would have modified the provisions of the Kerr-Mills program to encourage the States to provide medical assistance for the aged, the blind, and the disabled in the form of private health insurance coverage. The second proposal, H.R. 4351, was intro\u00ad duced by Representative Byrnes and was sup\u00ad ported by five of the eight Republican Commit\u00ad tee members. It would have established a Federal health insurance program for the aged, financed from Federal general revenues and from premi\u00ad ums paid by participants. Enrollment would have been voluntary, and premium amounts would have been scaled to the amount of the partici\u00ad pant's OASDI benefits. After 2 months of deliberations, Chairman Mills introduced H.R. 6675, embodying the'de\u00ad cisions made dluring the executive sessions of the Committee. The new bill provided for two related health insurance programs. The first was a basic program, under the social security system, of pro\u00ad tection against hospital and related health costs, similar to the program proposed by the King- Anderson bill. Unlike that bill, however, the Committee's bill called for financing by an earn\u00ad ings tax id~entified separately from the present social security taxes. The second health program for the aged pro\u00ad posed in the Committee's bill was a voluntary 3 program of protection against the cost of phy- sicians' and certain other medical and health services not covered under the basic program. The supplementary program was to be financed by premiums from enrollees and a matching amount paid by the Federal Government from Federal tax revenues. The Committee's reasons for recommending the health insurance programs were stated in its re- port2 as follows: Although your committee believes that the Kerr-Mills legislation as a whole has been very beneficial to the needy aged in our country, it has now concluded that the overall national problem of adequate medical care for the aged has not been met to the extent desired under existing legislation because of the 'failure of some States to implement to the extent anticipated and thus the existing Ipragram is inadequate to solve the prob- lem. Your committee, therefore, has concluded that a more comprehensive Federal program as to both per- sons who can qualify and protection afforded Is required. Therefore, a threefold approach to meet this nationalgproblem has been developed. First, since your commit- tee believes that Government action should not be lim- ited to measures that assist the aged only after they have become needy, your committee recommends moreadequate and feasible health Insurance protection under two separate but complementary programs which would contribute toward making economic security in old age more realistic, a more nearly attainable goal for most Americans. In addition, your committee recommends . .. a strengthening of the medical assistance provisions of the Social Security Act so that adequate medical aid may be provided for needy people. In addition to the OASDI provisions of H.R. 1, te Cmmitee te ro- doped fllowng1,sithe Committee adpedtefolwngpo 1. Payment of actuarially reduced benefits to widows at age 60. 2. Payment of child's insurance benefits after attainment of age 18 and up to the age of 22 for a full-time student. 3. Payment of benefits to certain uninsured persons already aged 72 and over who have fewer than 6 quarters of coverage under transitional provisions that would permit benefits to be paid on the basis of 3, 4, or 5 quarters of coverage. 4.

An increase from $1,700 to $2,400 in the span of earnings over which $1 in benefits is withheld for each $2 in earnings. The Committee also adopted the following pro\u00ad visions: 1. Payment of wife's or widow's benefits to a divorced wife aged 62 or over if she had been I married to the worker for at least 20 years and if her divorced husband was making a substantial contribution to her support when he became en\u00ad titled to benefits or died, and restoration of bene\u00adfit rights that were terminated by remarriage if the marriage ended in divorce after 20 years. 2.

H.R. 6675 was reported to the House of Rep\u00ad resentatives on March 29. On April 8, after 2 days of debate on H.R. 6675 under a closed rule, the House passed the bill, without amendment, by a vote of 313 to 115. Action of Senate Finance Committee TeSnt iac omte ed1 aso TulcheSeatering(Ance 2 held of Committe 159ay H.R. 6675. In testifying for the Administration the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, Anthony J. Celebrezze, endorsed the proposedhealth insurance programs for the aged and rec\u00adommended adoption with only one major change. SOCIAL SECURITY The Secretary recommended that physicians' services in the fields of radiology, anesthesiology, pathology, and physical medicine be covered under t~he hospital insurance program rather than the supplementary program, where the serv- ices are furnished through an arrangement under which the physician bills for his services through the hospital. Throughout the public hearings of the Senate Finance Committee, testimony centered on the proposed health insurance programs. Opposition to the programs came largely from the American Medical Association and various State and local medical societies. The American Medical Asso- ciation based its opposition on the belief that the programs would eventually lead to Govern- ment intervention into the practice of medicine, Some medical groups, however, testified in sup- port of the health insurance provisions of the bill. During executive sessions, the Senate Finance Committee adopted the Secretary's recommenda- tion, as proposed in an amendment by Senator Douglas (D., Ill.). Under this proposal,- the pro- fessional services of radiologists, anesthesiolo- gists, pathologists, and physiatrists, when pro- vided under arrangements with hospitals, would be covered under the hospital insurance plan rather than under the supplementary plan (as the House bill had provided). The Committee also increased the maximum duration of hospital benefits from 60 days to 120, wvith the last 60 days of benefits subject to coinsurance payments by the beneficiary, and adopted several changes that liberalized benefits under the two proposed health insurance programs. In addition, the Committee adopted a number of changes in the cash benefits provisions of the bill, including the following: 1. Liberalization of the House-approved retire- ment test provision by increasing to $1,800 the annual amount, of earnings exempt from the test, by extending the $1-for-$2 adjustment span to $3,000 with a $1-for-$1 adjustment on earnings above $3,000, and by raising to $150 the amount that a beneficiary may earn in a month and still get full benefits for that month. 2. Amendment of the definition of disability to require that a qualifying disability be one that has lasted or can be expected to last at least 12 months (instead of 6, as tinder the House bill). BULLETIN, SEPTEMBER 1965 3. Deletion of the House provision under which payment-of disability benefits would have started with the sixth full month of disability rather than the seventh month, as under present law. 4. Addition of a provision under which dis\u00ad ability benefits under the Social Security Act would be reduced to take account of workmen's compensation payments when the combined monthly benefits exceed 80 percent of the recipi\u00ad enit's average monthly earnings before his dis\u00ad ablement. 5. Coverage of tips as self-employment income rather than as wages. 6. Payment of benefits to a child based on his father's earnings, without regard to State law, if the father was supporting him or had a legal obligation to do so. 7. Continuation of benefit payments based on a former spouse's earnings record, at the rate of 50 percent of his or her primary insurance amount, to widows aged 60 or over and to wid\u00ad owers aged 62 or over who remarry. 8. Restoration of the benefit rights lost because of remarriage for divorced wives, widows, sur\u00ad viving divorced wives, and surviving divorced mothers who are not currently married. 9. Addition of a provision authorizing limited expenditures from social security trust funds to reimburse State agencies for vocational rehabili\u00ad tation services furnished to selected disability insurance beneficiaries. 10. Addition of a provision for payment of dis\u00ad abled child's benefits to a child who is disabled before reaching age 22 (instead of age 18, as under present law). 11. Addition of a provision under which an affiliated group of corporations would be con\u00ad sidered a single employer for purposes of deter\u00ad mining the maximum amount of annual wages subject to the employer tax. 12. Addition of a provision authorizing the Secretary to make disability determinations in those cases that can be promptly adjudicated on the basis of readily available medical and other evidence. 13. Revision of the financing provisions of the House bill to provide. a $6,600 contribution and benefit base, effective for 1966, and a contribution rate schedule under which rates would be some\u00ad what lower in the immediate future than under 5 the House-passed bill but higher over the long run. The Finance Committee reported the bill on June 30. Senate Floor Debate Anuberofmendent wee payment of $10 a day. 2. Elimination of the requirement under the basic hospital insurance plan that a person must have been in a hospital or extended-care facility in order to be eligible for home health benefits. 3. Appointment, to be made by the Secretary, of an Advisory Council on Social Security to make a comprehensive study of nursing homes and other extended-care facilities, 4. Provision for the Secretary to study the feasibility of covering prescription drugs under the supplementary medical insurance plan. 5. Reduction in the age of eligibility for cash benefits to 60 for everyone, with the benefits re\u00ad duced to take account of the longer period over which they will be paid.COFRNEOMITEA 6. Exclusion of the increase in benefits under the Social Security Act from income considered for purposes of determining a person's eligibility for, or the amount of, a veteran's pension. 7. Payment of disability insurance benefits to blind persons on the basis of 6 quarters of coy- erage, without respect to their capacity to work. 8. Requirement that the most recent addresses of husbands and parents who have deserted their families be disclosed to a State public welfare agency or a court. 9. Addition of a provision under which adop- tion by a brother or sister would not terminate a child's benefits. 10. Revision of the contribution schedule to provide for slightly higher rates to meet the cost of the changes made on the Senate floor, The Senate rejected a number of amendments. They included proposals to (1) provide for an automatic 3-percent OASDI benefit increase whenever there is a 3-percent increase in the cost of living, by a vote of 21 for and 64 against; (2) provide under the two health insurance programs for alternate variable deductible amounts related to a person's income-tax liability, by a vote of 40 for and 52 against; (3) delete the health insur\u00ad ance provisions, by a vote of 26 for and 64 against; (4) delete the provision for compulsory coverage of self-employed physicians and interns, by a vote of 41 for and 50 against; and (5) pro\u00advide that a worker under age 31 may qualify for disability insurance benefits if he had been in covered work for at least half the period between the date he attained age 21 and the time he be\u00adcame disabled, by a voice vote. The Senate 're\u00ad jected, by a vote of 26 for and 63 against, a motion to recommit the bill to the Finance Corn\u00ad mittee, with instructions to report the bill back immediately after eliminating the health insur\u00ad ance provisions and report later a bill providing medical insurance for the aged patterned after the health insurance program now in effect for retired civil-service employees, with premiums paid by those covered except t~hose unable to pay. On July 9 the Senate passed H.R. 6675, with amendments, by a vote of 68 to 21. INAD CONFERENCECMITTATO N ENCM T On July 14 the House and Senate conferees met to settle the differences betweenn the two versions of H.R. 6675. On July 26 the conferees filed their report. The bill as reported by the conferees departed from the Senate version in the following signifi\u00ad cant respects: 1. Adoption of the House provisions for coy\u00ad ering the professional services of certain hos\u00ad pital-based specialists under the, supplementary medical insurance program rather than under the hospital insurance plan. 2. Adoption of a compromise provision under which inpatient hospital benefits can be paid for a maximum of 90 days in a spell of illness; bene\u00ad fits for the first 60 days would be reduced by a $40 deductible amount, and benefits for each day beyond the sixtieth would be reduced by a coin\u00ad surance payment of $10. 3. Adoption of the House provisions requiring SOCIAL SECURITY 6 t~hat a person must, have been in a hospital or extended-care facility in order to be eligible for home health benefits under the hospital insurance program. 4. Rejection of the Senate provisions under which a study of nursing homes and other ex- tended-care facilities would have been made by an Advisory Council on Social Security and under which the Secretary would have been re- quired to make a study of the feasibility of coy- ering the cost of drugs under the supplementary medical insurance plan. 5. Adoption of a compromise provision under which the amount that a beneficiary may earn in a year and get full benefits for the year is in- creased from $1,200 to $1,500, with an increase from $100 to $125 in the monthly measure; $1 in benefits is withheld for each $2 of earnings above $1,500 and up to $2,700 a year and for each $1 of earnings thereafter. 6. Deletion of the Senate provision under which the eligibility age for cash benefits would have been reduced to age 60 for everyone. (The provision under which widows can elect to get benefits at age 60 was retained.) 7. Adoption of a compromise provision under which cash tips are covered as wages for social security and income-tax withholding purposes, except that employers are not required to pay the social security employer tax on tips. 8. Deletion of the Senate provision under which the increase in benefits under the Social Security Act would have been excluded from countable income in determining eligibility for and the amount of a veteran's pension. 9. Deletion of the Senate provision under which an affiliated group of corporations would have been considered a single employer in deter- mining t the emaximum tamoun oanulwgs subjct t ax.lated theemplyer 10. Deletion of the Senate provision under which childhood disability benefits would have been payable to a child who became disabled before reaching age 22. 11. IDeletion of the Senate provision under which the Secretary would have been authorized to make disability determinations in certain cases. 12. Adoption of a compromise providing for (a) the payment of benefits to blind workers aged 55-65 who are unable to engage in their usual occupation and who are not doing substantial BULLETIN, SEPTEMBER 1965 work; and (b) an alternative disability insured- status requirement, applicable to workers who become blind before reaching age 31, under which such workers are insured if they have quarters of coverage in half the quarters elapsing after age 21 up to the time of disablement or, for those becoming disabled before age 24, quarters of coverage in at least half the 12 quarters pre\u00ad ceding the quarter in which they become disabled. 13. Adoption of a compromise provision under which the most recent address of a deserting parent would be disclosed to a State or local wel\u00ad fare agency if the children are applicants for or recipients of assistance, if there is a court order for the support of the children, if the agency has attempted to obtain the information from all other reasonable sources, and if the information is to be used (by the agency or court) to obtain support for the children. On July 27 the House adopted the conference report by a vote of 307 to 116. On July 29 the Senate approved the report by a vote of 70 to 24, and the bill was cleared for the President's signature. On July 30, 1965, H.R. 6675 was signed by President Johnson and became Public Law 89-97. Summary of Major Provisions HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THE AGED Public Law 89-97 adds to the Social Security Act a new title XVIII establishing hrospials protection against the costs of hospital and re- care, and (2) a medical insurance plan coy\u00ad ering payments for physicians' services and other medical and health services to cover certain areas not covered by the hospital insurance plan. The hospital insurance plan is financed through a separate earnings tax and a separate trust fund. Benefits for persons who are currently aged 65 and over who are not insured under the social security or the railroad retirement systems will be financed out of Federal general revenues. Enrollment in the medical insurance plan is voluntary, and the plan is financed by a small 7 mnonthly premium ($6 a month initially-$3 paid 1by enrollees and an equal amount paid by t~he Vederal Government from general revenues), The premiums for social security and railroad retirement beneficiaries and for civil-service re- ilrement. annuitants who enroll will be deducted from their monthly benefits. Uninsured persons desiring the medical insurance plan will make rlie periodic premium payments to the Govern- nient. State welfare programs may arrange for ,in nsured assistance recipients to be covered. Hosptal nsurnceb. Hosptal nsurncefacility Protection, financed by means of an earnings tax, is provided against the costs of inpatient hospital services, posthospital extended care, posthospital home health services, and outpatient hospital diagnostic services for beneficiaries under the social security and railroad retirement systems when they attain age 65. The same pro- tection, financed from general revenues, is pro- vided under a special transitional provision for essentially all persons who are now aged 65 or who will reach age 65 before 1968, but who are not eligible for social security or railroad retire- ment benefits. Together, these two groups make up virtually the entire aged population. The persons not protected are Federal employ- ees who are covered under the Federal Employ- ees Health Benefits Act of 1959 or who, if they were retired after February 15, 1965, were coy- ered or could have been covered under that act. Others excluded are aliens who have not been residents of the United States for 5 years, aliens deucae, and become available January 1, 19617. Benefits.-The services for which payment is to be made under the hospital insurance plan in- clude: a. Inpatient hospital services for a maximum of 90 days in each spell of illness. The patient will pay a deductible amount of $40 for the first 60 days, plus a coinsurance payment of $10 a day for each day in excess of 60 during each spell of illness. Covered hospital services include almost all those ordinarily furnished by a hospital to its 8 inpatients. Payment will not be made, howvr for private-duty nursing or for the hospital serv\u00ad ex\u00ad cept those provided by interns or residents in training under approved teaching programs. In\u00ad patient psychiatric hospital services are covered, but a lifetime limitation of 190 days is imposed. Inpatient services in Christian Science sanatori\u00ad ums are covered as inpatient hospital services, but only under such conditions and limitations (in lieu of or in addition to those applicable to hospitals) as are provided by regulations. Posthospital extended care (in a qualified having an arrangement with a hospital for the timely transfer of patients and for fur\u00ad nishing medical information about patients and meeting certain other requirements) after the pa\u00ad tient is transferred from a hospital (after at least a 3-day stay) for a maximum of 100 days in each spell of illness. After the first 20 days of care, the patient wvill pay $5 a day for the remaining 80 days of extended care in a spell of illness. Under a special provision, extended care in Christian Science sanatoriums is covered for a maximum of 30 days, with the patient paying $5 a day. c. Outpatient hospital diagnostic services, with the patient paying a $20 deductible amount and making a 20-percent coinsurance payment for each diagnostic study (that is, for diagnostic services furnished to him by the same hospital during a of a new spell of illness. The person must be in the care of a physician and under a plan calling for such services that, wvas established by a phy\u00ad sician within 14 days of the patient's discharge, and the services must be provided by a qualified home health agency. These covered services in\u00ad eueitritn usn aeadpyia cueitritn usn aeadpyia therapy. The patient must be homebound except that payment may be made for services furnished at a hospital or extended-care facility or rehiabil\u00ad itation centert.hat requires the use of equipment that cannot ordinarily.:.be taken to the patient's home. No service is covered as posthospital extended SOCIAL SECURITY care or as outpatient diagnostic or posthospital home health services if it is of a kind that could not be covered if it were furnished to a patient in a hospital. A spell of illness is considered to begin when the individual enters a hospital and to end when he, has not been an inpatient of a hospital or ex\u00ad tended-care facility for 60 consecutive days. The deductible amounts for inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital diagnostic services will be icresed f ncesary o kep ace ithin- creases in hospital costs, but no increase will be made before 1969. For administrative simplicity, increases in the hospital deductible will be made only when a $4 change is called for, and the outpatient deductible will change in $2 steps. Basi~s of reimbutrsem~ent.-Payment of bills under the hospital insurance plan will be made to the providers of service on the basis of the \"rea- fciable cst\"icre.npoiigcr o ee ficiaies.a Admii~tatio.-Bsic espnsiblit forad- ministration rests with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. The Secretary will use appropriate State agencies and private organi- zations (nominated by providers of services) to assist in administering the program. Provision etablshmnt is te mde or o th inacin same contribution rates apply equally to em- ployers, employees, and self-employed persons and ae 1980-96 -------------------------------------. 70 1987 and thereafter -------------------------. 80 The schedule of contribution rates is based on cost estimates that assume that the earnings base will not be increased above $6,600. If Congress, in later years, should increase the base, the contri- BULLETIN, SEPTEMBER 1965 bution rates established can be reduced under the cost assumptions underlying the law. The cost of hospital insurance benefits for persons who are not beneficiaries under the social security or rail\u00ad road retirement systems will be paid from general funds of the Treasury. Medical Insurance Plan Apcaeo eeissplmnigtoepo vided under the hospital insurance plane is avail\u00ad able to all persons aged 65 and over. Individuals incash soia svecriwenty benefits o increase is effective for them is $4 a month ($6 month for man and wife receiving benefits based on the same earnings record), the benefit increase fully covers the amount of monthly pre\u00ad aus Enolet-o persons aged 65 1, 1965, and end March 31, 1966. Per\u00ad sons attaining age 65 after December 31, 1965, will have enrollment periods of 7 months begin\u00ad ning 3 months before they attain age 65. In the future, general enrollment periods will be from October 1 to December 31, in each odd year, be\u00ad ginning in 1967. No person may enroll more than 3 years after the close of the first enrollment period in which he could have enrolled. Persons who are in the plan but drop out will have only one chance to reenroll, and reenrollment must occur within 3 years of termination of the pre\u00ad vious enrollment. Coverage may be terminated by the individual, who must file notice during a enrollment period, or by the Govern\u00ad ment for nonpayment of premiums. A State can provide the medical insurance protection for its pulcastnewh arrcivg pbi sstcerecipientswo rreivg cash assistance if it chooses to do so. Benefits will be available beginning July 1, 1966. Beneflts.-The medical insurance plan covers physicians' services, home health services, and numerous other medical and health services in and out of medical institutions. The plan covers 80 percent of the patient's bill 9 (above an annual deductible of $50) for the fol- lowing services: a. Physicians' and surgeons' services, whether furnished in a hospital, clinic, office, in the home, or elsewhere. b. Home health services under an approved plan (with no requirement of earlier hospitaliza- tion) for a maximum of 100 visits during each calendar year. c. Diagnostic X-ray and laboratory tests, and other diagnostic tests. d. X-ray, radium, and radioactive isotope therapy. e. Ambulance services, f. Surgical dressings and splints, casts, and other devices for reduction of fractures and dis- locations; rental of durable medical equipment, such as iron lungs, oxygen tents, hospital beds, and wheelchairs used in the patient's home; pros- thetic devices (other than dental) that replace all or part of an internal body organ; and braces and artificial legs, arms, eyes, etc. There is a special limitation on outside-the- hospital treatment of mental, psychoneurotic, and personality disorders. Payment for such treat- ment during any calendar year is limited, in effect, to $250 or 50 percent of the expenses, whichever is smaller. Administration by carriers: basis for reim- bursement.-The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare is required, to the extent possible, to contract with carriers to carry out the major administrative functions of the medical insurance plan, such as determining rates of payments, holding and disbursing funds for benefit pay- ments, and determining compliance and assisting in utilization review. No contract can be entered into by the Secretary unless he finds that the carrier will perform its obligations efficiently and effectively and will meet requirements, such as those relating to financial responsibility and legal authority and other matters as the Secretary finds pertinent. The contract must provide that the carrier take necessary action to see that, where payments are made on a cost basis, the cost is reasonable. Where payments are on a charge basis the car- rier must see that such charge will be reasonable and not higher than the charge applicable, for a comparable service and under comparable cir- cumstances, to the carrier's other policyholders and subscribers. In determining reasonable charges, the carriers will consider the customary charges for similar services generally made by the physician or other person or organization furnishing the covered services and also the pre\u00ad vailing charges in the locality for similar serv\u00ad ices. Payment by carrier for physicians' services will be made on the basis of a receipted bill or an assignment under which the reasonable charge will be the full charge for the service. The requirement that the reasonable charge must be the full charge where an assignment pro\u00ad cedure is used and that otherwise a receipted bill must be submitted would (1) assure t~hat the amount shown on the bill was the actual charge for the services and (2) provide a safeguard especially for the less well-to-do who are covered under the plan, for whom it is probable that col\u00ad lection would normally be made through an as\u00ad signment. Finanwcing.-Aged persons who enroll in the medical insurance plan will pay monthly premi\u00ad ums of $3. If the individual is currently receiving monthly social security, railroad retirement, or civil-service retirement benefits, the premiums will be deducted from his benefits. The Government will help finance the medical insurance plan through a payment from general revenues of $3 a month per enrollee. To provide ain operating fund when t~he medical insurance plan is first effective and to establish a contin\u00ad gency reserve, a Government appropriation will be available (on a repayable basis) equal to $18 per aged person estimated to be eligible in July 1966, when the supplementary plan goes into ef\u00ad fect. The individual and Government contribu\u00ad tions will be placed in a separate trust fund for the medical insurance plan, and all benefit and administrative expenses will be paid from this trust fund. The provision in the income tax law limiting medical expense deductions to amounts in excess of 3 percent of adjusted gross income for persons under age 65 will be reinstituted for persons aged 65 and over. Thus, partial or full recovery of the Government contribution will be made from en\u00ad rolled persons with incomes high enough to re\u00ad quire them to pay income taxes. A special deduc\u00ad tion (for taxpayers who itemize deductions) of half the amount of premiums for insurance covering medical care will, however, be added. SOCIAL SECURITY 10 This deduction, applicable to taxpayers of all ages, cannot exceed $150 a year. Premium rates for enrolled persons (and the matching Government contribution) will be in- creased from time to time if costs rise, but not more often than once every 2 years. The premium rate for a person who enrolls after the first period when enrollment was open to him will be in- creased by 10 percent for each full year he stayed out of the program. Cost of the Hospital Insurance and Medical Insurance Plans Benefits under both plans become payable for services furnished in July 1966, except services in extended-care facilities, for which benefits be- come payable in January 1967. Benefits and ad- ministrative expenses under the hospital insur\u00ad ance plan will be about $2.2 billion for the first year of operations. For those uninsured under the hospital insurance plan the annual cost (paid from general revenues) will be about $290 mil- lion in the early years, with a substantial offset for public assistance savings. Benefit payments of the medical insurance plan will be about $1.2 billion in the first year of operation. Railroad Retirement Health Insurance Provisions The basic administration of the health insur- ance benefits program will be handled by the Social Security Administration in much the same way for railroad retirement beneficiaries as for social security beneficiaries. That is, the Ad- ministration will be responsible for making pay- ments to providers of services and carrying out related administrative functions. The law contains provisions designed to ensure that the hospital insurance taxes paid on em- ployment covered under the railroad retirement program will be the same as those paid on em- ployment covered under social security. For years in which the annual earnings and tax bases of the two programs are equal, hospital insurance taxes on railroad employment will be levied under the railroad retirement taxing provisions of the law and then transferred to the Federal hospital insurance trust fund, with payments BULLETIN, SEPTEMBER 1965 made from that fund. In these years the Railroad Retirement Board will determine the rights of railroad retirement beneficiaries to hospital in\u00ad surance benefits and provide hospital insurance protection, financed from the railroad retirement account., for railroad retirement beneficiaries in Canadian hospitals. These provisions presumably anticipate the enactment of legislation making and keeping the railroad retirement wage and tax base equal to that under the Social Security Act. Should there be years, however, in which the tax and wage bases of the two programs are not equal, hospital insurance taxes for those years would be levied under the social security taxing provisions and hospital insurance protection for railroad benefi\u00ad ciaries would be provided under social security on the same basis as that for social security bene\u00ad ficiaries. OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS, AND DISABILITY ISRNEAEDET ISRNEAEDET Benefits Increase in monthly cash benefits.-The law provides a 7-percent across-the-board benefit in\u00ad crease, effective retroactively beginning January 1965, with a minimum increase of $4 for retired workers aged 65 and older. Benefits are increased for the 20 million social security beneficiaries on the rolls at the time of enactment and for all future beneficiaries. The minimum monthly benefit for workers re\u00ad tiring at or after age 65 is now $44. For the present, the maximum benefit will be $135.90 (based on average monthly earnings of $400, the highest amount possible under the $4,800 base for contributions and benefits). In the future, the higher creditable earnings resulting from raising the base to $6,600 a year will make possible a maximum benefit of $168. The maximum amount of benefits payable to a family on the basis of a single earnings record is related, at all earnings levels, to the worker's average monthly earnings with an ultimate fam\u00ad ily maximum of $368. The benefits of persons on the rolls will be re\u00ad computed automatically each year to take account 11 of any covered earnings that the worker might have had in the preceding year that can increase his benefit amount. The ,amendment is effective for calendar years after 1964. Change 'in the retirement test.-Effective for taxable years ending after 1965, a beneficiary may have annual earnings of $1,500 and still get all his benefits for the year; if his earnings ex- ceed $1,500, $1 in benefits will be withheld for each $2 of annual earnings up to $2,700 and for each $1 of earnings thereafter. He will get bene- fits, regardless of the amount of his annual earn- WgS, for-anyI month in which hie earns $125 or less in wages and does not render substantial services in self-employment, Certain royalties that are received in or after the year in -which a person reaches age 65 from copyrights and patents that were obtained before he reached that age are not counted as earnings for purposes of the test. This provision is effective for taxable years beginning after 1964. Paymnent of child's insurance benefits to child- ren aged 18-21 and attending school or college.- Child's insurance benefits are payable until the child reaches age 22, provided the child is attend- ing a public or accredited school as a full-time student after hie reaches age 18. Children of de- ceased, retired, and disabled workers are in- eluded. No person will be paid mother's or wife's benefits solely on the basis of having in her care a child who has attained age 18 and is in school. The change is effective for months after Decem- ber 1964. Chavges in the disability prograrn.-The law eliminates the requirement that a worker's dis- ability must be expected to be of long-continued a~nd inidefinite duration. It provides instead that itlinsured worker is eligible for disability bene- fits (payable after the sixth month, as in the past) if hie has been under a disability that can be expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 calendar months. Benefits pay- able because of this change are payable beginning with benefits for September 1965. The disability benefit under the Social Security Act for any month for which a worker is receiv- ing a periodic workmen's compensation benefit will be reduced to the extent that the total bene\u00ad fits payable to him and his dependents under both programs exceed 80 percent of his average monthly earnings before the onset of disability, but with the reduction periodically adjusted to take account of changes in national average earnings levels. Under this provision, the work\u00ad er's average monthly earnings are defined as the higher of (a) his average monthly wage used for purposes of computing his disability benefit under the Social Security Act or (b) his average monthly earnings in covered employment during his highest 5 consecutive years after 1950. This offset provision applies to benefits payable after December 1965 on the basis of disabilities com\u00ad mencing after June 1, 1965. Reimbursement will be made from the social security trust funds to State vocational rehabil\u00ad itation agencies for the cost of rehabilitation services furnished to selected individuals who are entitled to disability insurance benefits or to disabled child's benefits. The total amount that may be made available from the trust funds for purposes of reimbursing State agencies cannot, in any year, exceed 1 percent of the disability benefits paid under the Social Security Act in the preceding year. This provision is effective immediately. The disability provisions with respect to the blind are modified in two respects. First, the def\u00ad inition of disability now provides that an individ\u00ad ual is considered to be disabled for purposes of entitlement to disability benefits if he is between the ages of 55 and 65, meets the definition of \"blindness\" (as provided for purposes of the disability \"freeze\") and is unable, because of such blindness, to engage in substantial gainful activity requiring skills or abilities comparable to those required in his past occupation or occu\u00ad pations. He will receive no payment, however, for any month in which he engages in substantial gainful activity. Second, an alternative insured-status require\u00ad ment is provided for persons who are disabled before they reach age 31 because of \"blindness\" as defined. Under this provision, the blind indi\u00ad vidual would be insured if he has quarters of coverage in half the quarters elapsing after at\u00ad tainment of age 21 and up to the point of dis\u00ad ability, or, for those becoming disabled before they reach age 24, for at least half the 3 years SOCIAL SECURITY 12 --preceding the quarter in which he becomes dis- abled. A person who becomes entitled before ae6 to a benefit payable on account of old age could later become entitled to disability insurance bene- fits. The ,amendment is effective beginning with monthly benefits for September 1965 on the basis of applications filed in or after July 1965. Benefits for widows at age 60.-Widows can elect to receive benefits at age 60. The benefits payable to those who claim them before age 62 will be actuarially reduced to take account of the longer period over which they will be paid. This provision is effective beginning September 1965. Trasitonainure sttus-Th la ses u of coverage (in 1965) required Men : 76 or over -------------------------------------\u00ad 75 ----------------------------------------- 4 74 ----------------------------------------- 5 Women: 73 or over -------------------------------------\u00ad 72 ----------------------------------------- 4 71 ----------------------------------------- 5 Wiesbenefits are payable at age 72 to a wife's s ubndqaife o bnft under the transitional provision if she attains age 72 before 1969. Widow's benefit will be payable at age 72 to a woman who reaches age 72 before 1969 if her husband was living in September 1965 ,and if he met the work requirements of the provision. A widow who reaches age 72 before 1969 but whose husband died before September 1965 can qualify if her husband attained age 65 or died before 1957 and if he had a specified number of quarters of coverage, as shown in the following tabulation.

These provisions are effective for September 1965. Dependents' beneflts.-Under the new law a child can be paid benefits based on his father's earnings without regard to whether hie has the status of a child under State inheritance laws if the father was supporting the child or had a legal obligation to do so. Benefits will be paid to at child on his father's earnings record, even though he cannot inherit the father's intestate personal property, if the father (1) had acknow]\u00ad edged the child in writing; (2) had been ordered by a court to contribute to the child's support.; had been judicially decreed to be the child's father; or (4) is shown by other satisfactory evidence to be the child's father and was living with or contributing to the support of the child. amendment is effective with respect to monthly benefits beginning September 1965. Benefits are payable to widows (and widowers) even though they have remarried if the remar\u00ad riage was after they reached age 60 (age 62 for widowers). The amount of their benefit equals 50 percent of the primary insurance amount of the deceased spouse rather than 821/2 percent of that amount, which is payable to widows and widowers wvhile they are not married. The change is effective with respect to monthly benefits be\u00ad gnigwt hs aal o etme 95 The law authorizes payment of wvife's or wvid\u00ad ow's benefits to the divorced wife of a retired, deceased, or disabled worker if she had been married to the worker for at least 20 years he- fore the date of the divorce and if her divorced husband was making (or was obligated by a court to make) a substantial contribution to her sup\u00ad port when hie became entitled to benefits, became disabled, or died. It also provides that a wife's benefits will not terminate when the woman and 13 _____ her husband are divorced if the marriage has been in effect for 20 years. Provision is also made for the re-establishment of benefit rights for a divorced wife, a widow, a surviving divorceddiocdProvisionmother, or a surviving diocdwife who has remarried if the subsequent marriage has ended. These changes are effective for September 1965. Theprvison rlatngtothe payment ofTh rvsos eaigt benefits to children who are adopted by old-age insurance beneficiaries are changed to require that, if the adoption occurs after the worker be- comes entitled to an old-age benefit, (1 the child be living with the worker (or adoption proceedings have begun) in or before t~he month the application for old-age benefits is filed; (2) the child has been receiving half his support for the year before the worker's entitlement; and (3) the adoption be completed within 2 years after the worker's entitlement. The amendment is ef\u00ad fective with respect to applications filed on or after July 30, except that the 2-year time limit will not apply to adoptions completed within the 12 months following t~hat date. A wife, husband, widow, or widower may get benefits without regard to the generally appli- cable requirement that a marriage must have lasted at least a year, if, in the month preceding the marriage he or she was actually or potentially entitled to a widow's, widower's, parent's, or (if over age 18) child's annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act. Also, a woman worker's hus- band or widower who was entitled to a specified railroad retirement annuity before marriage to a person insured under the Social Security Act may get benefits without regard to the generally applicable requirement that the wife be currently insured and have provided at least half her hus- band's support. The amendment will be effective beginning with monthly benefits payable for September 1965. The law extends indefinitely the period for filing proof of support for dependent husband's, widower's, and parent's benefits and applications for lump-sum death payments, where good cause exists for failure to file within the initial 2-year period. The amendment is effective for lump-sum payments and monthly benefits based on applica- tions filed in or after July 1965.

The amendment is effective with respect to monthly benefits beginning August 1965. Coverage Physicians and interns.-Coverage is extended to self-employment as a doctor of medicine, ef\u00ad fective for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1965. The employment of interns is covered, beginning on January 1, 1966, on the same basis as that of other employees working for the same employer. Tips covered as wage8.-Cash tips received after 1965 by an employee in the course of his employment are covered as wages for social secur\u00ad ity and income-tax withholding purposes, except that employers are not required to pay an em\u00ad ployer tax on the tips. The employee must give his employer a writ\u00ad ten report of his tips within 10 days after the end of the month in which the tips are received. To the extent that unpaid wages due an employee and in his employer's possession are insufficient to pay the employee social security tax due on the tips, the employee may make available to the employer sufficient funds to pay the tax. If an employee fails to report some or all of his coy- SOCIAL SECURITY ered tips to his employer, he is liable not only for the employee tax but also for an additional 50 percent of that tax. The employer must withhold the employee tax only on tips reported to him within the specified time and for which he has sufficient funds of the employee out of which to pay the tax. He will be liable for withholding income tax on only those tips that are reported to him within 10 days after the end of the month in which the tips were re\u00ad ceived, and then, in general, only to the extent that he can collect the tax (at or after the time the tips are reported to him and before the close of the calendar year in which the tips were re- ceived) from unpaid wages (not including tips), or from funds turned over to him for that pur- pose remaining after the amount equal to the amount due for the social security tax has been subt~racted. Exeemption of Amish and other religious sects. -Under specified conditions, members of reli- gious sects may obtain exemption from social security self-employment taxes upon application accompanied by a waiver of benefit rights. To be eligible for exemption an individual must be found to be a member of a recognized religious sect (or a division of a sect) and to be an ad- herent of the established tenets or teachings of the sect by reason of which he is conscientiously opposed to accepting any private or public insur- ance benefits paid in the event of death, disabil- ity, old-age, or retirement, or paid toward the cost of, or providing services for, medical care (including the benefits of any insurance system established by the Social Security Act). It must be found that the sect has such teachings and has been in existence at all times since December 31, 1950, and that it is the. practice for members to make provision for their dependent members that is reasonable in view of their general level of living. The application for exemption for taxable years ending on or before December 31, 1965, must be filed by April 15, 1966. The exemption may become effective as early as the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1950. Farmers.-Farm operators whose annual gross earnings are $2,400 or less may report either their actual net earnings or two-thirds of their gross earnings, for taxable years beginning after De- cember 31, 1965. When gross earnings are more BULLETIN, SEPTEMBER 1965 than $2,400 they must report their actual net earnings if $1,600 or more; if actual net earnings are less than $1,600, they may report either that amount or $1,600. (For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1966, farmers whose annual gross earnings are more than $1,800 must report their actual net earnings if $1,200 or more, but if actual net earnings are less than $1,200, they may report either their actual net earnings or $1,200.) Ministers .-For ministers who have been in the ministry for at least 2 years since 1951 the yeiddrn hc th ymyfl avrcri ficates electing coverage is reopened, through April 15, 1966. Coverage for ministers whose eli\u00ad gibility to file waiver certificates is reopened will ordinarily begin with 1963. In addition, social security credit may be obtained for the past earn\u00ad ings of certain ministers who die or file waiver certificates before April 16, 1966, where such earnings were reported for social security pur\u00ad poses but could not be credited. Employees of nonprofit organizations .-Non\u00ad profit organizations may file a waiver certificate and make it retroactive up to 5 years (formerly 1 year) before the quarter in which the certifi\u00ad cate is filed. If an organization files a waiver certificate before 1966, the certificate may be amended during 1965 or 1966 to begin coverage as early as 5 years before the quarter in which the certificate is amended. Those employees to whom additional retroactive coverage is appli\u00ad cable (because the organization amends its cer\u00ad tificate) are given an individual choice of such additional coverage. Employees who were re\u00ad ported erroneously and who are no longer em\u00ad ployed when an organization files or amends its waiver certificate may validate the erroneous re\u00ad portings for periods during which the certificate or amended certificate is in effect. In addition, certain employees whose wages were erroneously reported by a nonprofit organization during the period its waiver certificate was in effect may validate the erroneously reported wages. These provisions are effective immediately. District of Columbia employees.-Coverage is provided for employees of the District of Colum\u00ad bia who are not covered by a retirement system. 15 The District of Columbia Commissioners may arrange also for the coverage of temporary and intermittent employees to be shifted from the Federal civil-service retirement system to the social security system. Coverage begins after the calendar quarter in which the Secretary of the Treasury receives a certificate from the District of Columbia Commissioners expressing their de- sire to have coverage extended to the affected employees, State and local cove'rage changes. -Another opportunity is provided, through 1966, for the election of coverage by members of State and local government, retirement systems who orig- inally did not chose coverage under the divided retirement. system provision, under which current employees have a choice of coverage. Alaska is added to the list of States that may use the di- vided retirement system provision. These pro- visions are effective immediately. Iowa and North Dakota are permitted to mod\u00ad ify their coverage agreements with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to exclude from coverage services performed by students, including services already covered, in the employ of a school, college, or university in any calendar quarter if the remuneration for such services is less than $50. The modification may specify the effective date of the exclusion, but it may not be earlier than July 30, 1965. The past coverage under the social security system of employees of certain school districts in Alaska that have been included in error as separate political subdivisions under the Alaska social security coverage agreements is validated. (The employees of the school districts involved should properly have been covered as employees of the political subdivisions of which the school districts are integral parts.) The provision is effective for 1965 and earlier years; coverage for ~..years after 1965 must be under the general pro- visions of the law. California is permitted to modify its coverag agreement to extend coverage to certain hospital employees whose positions were removed from a State or local government retirement system. The State will have until the end of January 1966 to take action under this provision. Maine is given until July 1, 1967 (rather than July 1, 1965), to treat teaching and nonteaching employees who are in the same retirement system 16 as though they were under separate retirement systems for social security coverage purposes. Miscellaneous Changes The law also includes a number of adminis\u00ad trative and technical changes, including pro\u00ad visions relating to the length of time an appli\u00ad cation for benefits is effective, treatment of underpayments and of payments to two or more members of the same family, attorney's fees, and disclosure of the whereabouts of a beneficiary. In addition to these changes, the legislation revises the provisions authorizing reimbursement of the social security trust funds out of general revenue for gratuitous wage credits for service\u00ad men so that reimbursement will be spread over the next 50 years, rather than 10 years. Financing Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Amendments The old-age, survivors, and disability insurance provisions of the law are financed by (1) an in\u00ad crease in the earnings base from $4,800 to $6,600', effective January 1, 1966, and (2) a revised tax rate schedule. The revised schedule is shown below: _____________-________ ___ Year Employee Employer Semloye ___ ___ ___mployed______ 1966--------------------------------- 3.85 3.85 5.8 1967-68--------------------------------- 3.9 3.9 5.9 11969-72 ------------------------------- 4.4 4.4 6.6 1973 and after ------------------------ 4.85 4.85 7.0 An additional 0.20 percent of taxable wages and 0.15 percent of taxable self-employment in\u00ad come will be allocated to the disability insurance trust fund, bringing the total allocation to 0.70 percent of wages and 0.525 percent of self -em\u00ad ployment income SITNEAEDET PBI SITNEAEDET MdclAssac rga MdclAssac rga To provide a more effective program of medi\u00ad cal care for needy persons, the law establishes SOCIAL SECURITY a Program of medical assistance under a new title of the Social Security Act-title XIX. This title is intended to replace the Kerr-Mills law-medical assistance for the aged-and the provisions for direct payments to suppliers of medical care and services under. old-age assist- ance, alid to the blind, aid to families with de- pendent children, aid to the permanently and totally disabled, and the consolidated programr for the aged, the blind, and the disabled. The program may be administered by a State agency designated for the purpose, but eligibility is to be determined by the State agency responsible for administering old-age assistance. The program is to include all persons now re- ceiving assistance for basic maintenance under the public assistance titles and also may include persons who are able to provide their mainte- nance but whose income and resources are not sufficient to meet their medical care costs. Serv- ices offered the former group may be no less in amount or scope than those for the latter group. If the medically needy are included, comparable eligibility provisions are to apply so that all per- sons similarly situated among the aged, the blind, the disabled, and dependent children would be included in the program. Other medically needy children could be included. No age requirement may be imposed that would exclude any person over age 65 or, after July 1, 1967, under age 21. A flexible income test taking medical expenses into account would be used. The old provisions in the various public as- sistance titles of the Act providing vendor medi- cal assistance terminate upon the adoption of the new program by a State but no later than Decem- ber 31, 1969. Scope of medical assist ance.-Under the old provisions, the State has had to provide \"some institutional and noninstitutional care\" under the program of medical assistance for the aged. There have been no minimum benefit require- ments with respect to vendor medical payments under the other public assistance programs. For the new program a State must, by July 1, 1967, provide inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, other laboratory and X-ray services, skilled nursing home services for indi- viduals aged 21 and over, and physician's services (whether furnished in the office, the patient's home, a hospital, or a skilled nursing home) in BULLETIN, SEPTEMBER 1965 order to receive Federal participation in vendor medical payments. Other items of medical serv\u00ad ice are optional with the States. Eligibility.-The law improves the program for the needy elderly by requiring that the States establish a flexible income test that takes into account medical expenses; it may not set up rigid income standards that arbitrarily deny assist\u00ad ance to persons with large medical bills. In the same spirit the law provides that no deductible, cost-sharing, or similar charge may be imposed by the State for hospitalization under its pro\u00ad gram and that such a charge on other medical services must be reasonably related to the recip\u00ad ient's income or resources. Elderly needy recipi\u00ad ents under the State programs must be provided assistance to meet the deductibles imposed by the new basic program of hospital insurance. *Where a portion of any deductible or cost-sharing under either program is met by a State program, it must be done in a manner reasonably related to the individual's income and resources. No income can be imputed to an, individual unless it is actually available, and the financial responsibility of an individual for an applicant may be taken into account only if the applicant is the individ\u00ad ual's spouse or child who is under age 21 or blind or disabled. Increased Federal matching. -The Federal share of medical assistance, expenditures under the new program is determined by .a uniform formula, with no maximum on the amount of expenditures subject to participation-the pro\u00ad cedure followed for medical assistance for the aged. The Federal share varies in relation to a State's per capita income; States with a national average income receive 55 percent (rather than the 50 percent formerly received for medical as\u00ad sistance for the aged), and States at the lowest level receive as much as 83 percent (in contrast to 80 percent). To receive any additional Federal funds as a result of expenditures under the new program, the States must continue their own expendi\u00ad tures at their present rate. For a specified per\u00ad iod, no State would receive less in Federal funds because of the new formula than it had in 'the past, and any State that did not reduce its own expenditures would be assured of at least a 5\u00ad percent increase in Federal participation in medi\u00ad cal care expenditures. The Federal share in the 17 cost of compensation and training of professional medical personnel is now 75 percent, compared with the 50-50 Federal-State sharing for other administrative expenses. Other Public Assistance Provisions Increased assistance payments.-The Federal share in old-age assistance, aid to the blind, and aid to the permanently and totally disabled is raised, effective January 1, 1966, to $31 of the first $37 of a State's average monthly pay- ment per recipient (instead of $29 of the first $35) plus a proportion of the remainder up to $75 (formerly $70). In aid to families with dependent children the Federal share is increased to $15 of the first $18 of a State's average monthly pay- ment per recipient (instead of $14 of the first $17), plus a proportion of the balance up to $32 (formerly up to $30). States receive no additional Federal funds except tothe extent that they pass them on to individual recipients. Tuberculous and mental patients.-In'old-age assistance and medical assistance for the aged (and the combined program), the law removes the exclusion from Federal matching with respect to payments for aged individuals who are patients in institutions for tuberculosis or mental diseases or who have been diagnosed as having tuberculosis or psychosis and, as a result, are patients in a general medical institution. As a condition of Federal participation in such payments to, or for, mental patients, certain agreements and ar- rangements are required to ensure that better care results from the additional Federal money. States will receive no more in Federal funds under this provision than the increase in their expenditures for mental health purposes under public health and public welfare programs. Re- strictions are removed oii Federal matching in payments for the needy blind and the disabled who are tuberculous or psychotic and are in gen- eral medical institutions. The provision is effec- tive January 1, 1966, and will cost about $75 million a year. Protective payments to third poersons.- The law adds a provision, effective January 1, 1966, for protective payments to third persons on behalf of recipients of old-age assistance, aid to the blind, aid to the permanently and totally disabled (and recipients under the com\u00ad bined title XVI program), who are unable to manage their money because of physical or mental incapacity. Earlnings and income exemptions.-The amount of earned or other income received by assistance recipients that may be disregarded by the States in determining need under various programs was increased by several provisions. A State may, at its option, exempt the first $20 (formerly $10) of earned income received by persons on the old-age assistance rolls (and by the aged in a combined program) and half the next $60 (formerly $40) of a recipient's monthly earnings. This provision is effective October 1, 1965. In aid to families with dependent children the States may disregard up to $50 of earnings per child per month, but not more than $150 in the same family may be exempted in determining need. The amendment, which is wvholly permissive with the States, is effective July 1, 1965. Recipients of aid to the permanently and totally disabled may have the same exemption of earnings that is provided under old-age assist\u00ad ance and the same exemption of income and re\u00ad sources, if they are under an approved rehabil\u00ad itation plan, that is now provided for the blind. This amendment is also wholly permissive with the States and is effective October 1, 1965. In addition to earnings, up to $5 per recipi\u00ad ent per month of any income may be exempted under any of the federally aided public assist\u00ad ance programs. The States may disregard as much of the OASDI benefit increase as is attributable to its retroactive effective date. The law also provides a grace period for action by States that have not had regular legis\u00ad lative sessions and whose public assistance stat\u00ad utes now prevent them from disregarding a recip\u00ad ient's earnings under the Economic Opportunity Act. School attendance for child recipient8.-The definition of a school in which a child aged 18-21 may receive aid to families with dependent chil\u00ad dren, at the State's option, is broadened to in\u00ad dlude colleges. Definition of medical assistance for the aged,\u00ad The law modifies the definition of medical as- SOCIAL SECURITY 18 sistance for the aged, effective July 1, 1965, to allow Federal sharing in payments in behalf of old-age assistance recipients for the month they are admitted to or discharged from a a ppa oth ors for rview.income Alternative form~ula.-Any State, at its option, after adopting title XIX (medical assistance) may claim Federal participation in its money payments under the formula provided under that title instead of under the different formulas in the the pubicssisanc tites.affiliated MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE AMENDMENTS Increase in Annual Authorizations The law increases the amount authorized for maternal and child health services over current ,authorizations 'by $5 million for fiscal year 1965-66 and by $10 million in each succeeding fiscal year, as shown below. Fiscal year Old law New law 1965-66 --------------------------------- $40,000,000 $45,000,000 19667--67---------------------------- --- 40,000,000 50,000,000 Health Care for the Children of Low-income Families A new provision authorizes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to carry out a 5\u00ad year program of special project grants to provide comprehensive health care and services for chil\u00ad dren of school age, or for preschool children, particularly in areas with concentrations of low- families. The grants (not to exceed 75 percent of the cost of the project) will be made to State health agencies, State agencies administer\u00ad ing the crippled children's program, any school gfmdcn wt aprprit gatiiatynb of mdclofdnet(isthy) appropriatepartcipationspiby with such a school. Projects will provide screening, diagnosis, preventive services, treat\u00ad ment, correction of defects, and aftercare, includ\u00ad ing dental services, for children in low-income families. An appropriation of $15 million is authorized for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966; $35 million for the year ending June ~30, 1968; $45 million for the year ending June 30, 1969; and $50 million for the year ending June all these programs, to move towvard the goal of extending services and making them available to children in all parts of the State by July 1, 1975. Training Personnel For Care of Crippled Children The law also authorizes $5 million for the fiscal year 1966-67, $10 million for 1967-68, and $17.5 million for each succeeding fiscal year in grants to institutions of higher learning to be used in training professional personnel for the care of crippled children, particularly men- tally retarded children with multiple handicaps.

R. 6675 To Administrative, Supervisory, and Technical Employees The Senate Committee on Finance voted 12 to 5 on June 24 to report favor\u00ad ably H. R. 6675, the Social Security Amendments of 1965, with amendments. Enclosed is a list of changes in social security and public welfare that were made by the Committee in the provisions of the bill as passed by the House (the latter were described in Commissioner's Bulletins Nos. 23 and 24). A number of minor changes are not included in the listing. The Committee expects to file its bill and the accompanying report in the Senate on Wednesday, June 30. Copies of the bill and the report will be sent to all offices of the Social Security Administration as soon as they are available. The Senate is expected to begin its debate on the bill the week of July 5. We will, of course, keep you informed on congressional action on the bill. Robert M. Ball Commissioner Enclosure SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS oF 1965 CHANGES MADE BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON FINA~NCE IN H.R. 6675 HEALTH INSURANCE 1. Inpatient hospital services would be covered under the basic hospital insurance program for up to 120 days in each spell of illness, rather than the 60 days in the House bill, but the beneficiary would share in the cost of the last 60 days through a coinsurance payment for each such day equal to one-fourth of the inpatient hospital deductible (a $10 daily payment initially). 2. As in the House bill, a maximum of 100 days of post-hospital extended care services would be covered under the basic hospital insurance program during a spell of illness. The Committee bill, however, eliminates the provision of the House bill under which the number of days of inpatient hospital services to which a beneficiary is entitled would be reduced by one day for each two days of extended care services he uses beyond 20 days. The Committee bill provides instead for a coinsurance payment by the beneficiary, for each day of extended care services beyond the 20th day, equal to one-eiglth of the in-patient hospital deductible (a $5 daily payment initially). 3. Post-hospital home health services for up to 175, rather than 100, visits would be covered under the basic hospital insurance program after discharge from a hospital and before the beginning of a new spell of illness. There would be no change with respect to home health services under the supplementary insurance program. 14. The medical services of certain specialists--radiologists, anesthesi\u00ad ologists, pathologists, and physiatrists--would be covered under the basic hospital insurance program where billing is done through the hospital, rather than, as under the House bill, only under the supple\u00ad mentary insurance program. 5. Inpatient psychiatric hospital services would be covered under the basic hospital insurance program, rather than under the supplementary insurance program as under the House bill, and the lifetime limit on such coverage would be increased from 180 to 210 days. 6. Benefits under the supplementary insurance program would be payable for services furnished on or after January 1, 1967, rather than on or after July 1, 1966, as in the House bill. 7. The Committee added provisions to the bill as passed by the House which, subject to an effective date proviso, would make certain changes in the financing and administration of hospital insurance benefits for beneficiaries under the railroad retirement program. The House bill provides that hospital insurance taxes imposed under the Federal Insur\u00ad ance Contributions Act would be imposed on railroad employment in the same amount and in the same manner as hospital insurance taxes on employment covered under social security. Under the committee amendment, 2 the taxes of the hospital insurance program would be levied under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, and financial interchange provisions comparable to those that apply to cash benefits would apply to hospital insurance benefits. Also, under the Committee amendment the Railroad Retirement Board would be authorized to enter into agreements with Canadian hospitals and with hospitals devoted primarily to railroad employees, for the purpose of providing hospital insurance benefits for railroad retirement beneficiaries. However, the amendment would become effective only after the railroad earnings base is raised to at least $550 a month (matching the social security $6600 base provided by the bill) and until that time railroad coverage would be provided in the same manner as social security coverage. 8. The Committee bill omits the provision of the House bill which would amend the income tax law to allow medical expense deductions for the aged only to the extent that the expenses exceed 3 percent of adjusted gross income (under present law, as under the Committee bill, the 3 percent \"floor\" applies only with respect to people under 65). 9. The Committee bill deletes the provision of the House bill which would permit the deductible amount paid by the patient for outpatient hospital diagnostic services to be credited in certain instances against the inpatient hospital deductible where the patient is hos\u00ad pitalized after receiving outpatient diagnostic services. Under the Committee bill, the outpatient deductible would be counted as an incurred expense under the supplementary insurance program--that is, it would count toward the $50 deductible and as an expense for which reimbursement could be made under the supplementary program. Under the House bill the full cost of the outpatient hospital diagnostic services, above the deductible amount, would be covered but under the Committee bill the program wouldi cover only 80 percent of the cost and the beneficiary would pay the remainder. The effect of this change would be to cover outpatient hospital services and other outpatient services on a comparable basis. 10. The Committee bill would add to the House bill, provisions, subject to conditions to be prescribed in regulations, for payment for Christian Science nursing home services under the extended care provisions and for payment for Christian Science visiting nurse services under the home health provisions. 11. The Committee bill would add to the services covered under the supple\u00ad mentary medical insurance program those performed by podiatrists and chiropractors. 12. The House bill provides for the deduction from monthly social security or railroad retirement benefits of premiums under the supplementary medical insurance plan. The Committee bill would provide also for the deduction of such premiums from civil service retirement annuities. 3 13. The House bill would exclude from coverage under the transitional provision for the noninsured all persons who are enrolled or who could have enrolled in a health benefits plan for Federal employees. The Committee bill would modify the provision so that it would exclude only persons who are actually enrolled in such a plan. OASDI Earnings Base The contribution and benefit base would be $6600 in 1966 and all future years, rather than $5600 beginning with 1966 and $6600 beginning with 1971. Retirement Teat The bill substitutes for the provision to extend the ceiling on the $1-for-$2 adjustment span from $1700 to $24100, passed by the House, a provision to (1) increase from $1200 to $1800 the annual amount of earn\u00ad ings a person may have and still get full benefits for the year; (2) extend the ceiling on the $1-for-$2 adjustment span to $3000 (the $1-for-$l adjust\u00ad ment would continue to apply to earnings above $3000); and (3) raise from $100 to $150 the amount that a beneficiary may earn in a month and still get full benefits for that month. Definition of Disability The Committee amended the House bill to provide that an insured worker would be eligible for disability benefits if he has been under a disa\u00ad bility which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can' be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 calendar months. Both the House bill and the Committee bill would eliminate the requirement that a worker's disability must be expected to be of long-con\u00ad tinued and indefinite duration; however, under the provisions of the House bill an insured worker would be eligible for disability benefits if he has been totally disabled throughout a continuous period of at least 6 calendar months regardless of future duration of the disability. As under the House bill, the Committee bill provides that benefits payable by reason of the change in definition of disability would be paid for the second month following the month of enactment. The House bill provided for payment for the 6th month of disability., but the Committee amended bill provides, as under present law, that benefits be first paid for the 7th full month of disability. Workmen's Compensation The Committee bill adds to the House bill a disability benefits offset provision under which the social security disability benefit for any month for which a worker is receiving a periodic workmen's compensation benefit will be reduced to the extent that the total benefits payable to him and his dependents under both programs exceed 80 percent of his average monthly earn:ings prior to the onset of disability, but with the reduction periodically adjUstea to take account of changes in earnings levels. 4I Rehabilitation Services The Committee bill adds to the House bill a provision for reimbursement from social security trust funds to State vocational rehabilitations agencies for the cost of vocational rehabilitation services furnished to disability insurance beneficiaries. The total amount of the funds that may be made available for purposes of reimbursing State agencies for such services could not, in any year, exceed 1 percent of the social security disability benefits paid in the previous year. Childhood Disability Benefits The Committee bill would provide for disabled child's benefits for a child who is disabled before reaching age 22 (rather than before age 18 as in present law)., should his parent die, become disabled or retire. The mother otf the child would also be eligible for benefits so long as she continued to have the child in her care. Disability Determinations The Committee bill would add to the House bill provisions authorizing the Social Security Administration to make disability determinations in those cases which can be promptly adjudicated on the basis of readily available medical and other evidence furnished by or on behalf of the applicant from existing sources of information and to terminate entitlement to disability benefits in cases of recovery based on such evidence or on evidence received that a beneficiary has returned to gainful work. Under present law disability determinations., including determinations that a disabled person had recovered, generally must be made by State agencies under agreements with the Social Security Administration. Life of Applications The House bill would not change the provisions of present law under which the life of an application for benefits is 3 months (9months for disa\u00ad bility benefits)--i.e., an applicant has-3 months from the date of applica\u00ad tion to qualify for benefits before his application expires. The Committee bill would extend the life of applications for social security benefits to the date of the final decision thereon by the Secretary. Tips The bill substitutes for the provision to cover tips as wages that was passed by the House of Representatives a provision to cover tips as earnings from self-employment. Physicians The Committee amended the provision in the House bill which would extend social security coverage to self-employed doctors of medicine by making such coverage effective for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1965j, rather than for taxable years ending after December 31, 1965, as 5 provided by the House bill. This change would provide social security coverage for most self-employed doctors a year earlier than under the House bill. Definition of Child The Committee adopted the Advisory Council's recommendation that benefits be paid to an illegitimate child if the father had acknowledged the child in 'writing, had be~en ordered by a court to contribute to the child's support, had been judicially decreed to be the child's father, or had been shown by other satisfactory evidence to be the child's father and was living with or contributing to the support of the child. Remarriage of Widow or Widower Benefits based on a prior spouse's earnings record would be payable to widows age 60 or.;over and to widowers age 62 or over who remarry. The amount of the remarried widow's or widower's benefit would be 50 percent of the primary insurance amount of the deceased spouse, rather than 82 1/2 percent as in the case of unremarried widows and widowers. If a larger benefit would be payable based on the new spouse's earnings record, the excess of that benefit over the benefit based on the prior spouse's earnings would be paid to the remarried widow or widower. Restoration of Benefit Rights H.R. 6675 as passed by the House contains several complex provisions relating to special treatment in cases where a divorced woman remarries. The Senate bill simplifies and extends the House bill so that an aged divorced wife, widow, or surviving divorced wife who is not married would be eligible for benefits regardless of intervening marriages. Similar changes would be made in the case of mother's insurance benefits for young widows and la-sr\u00ad viving divorced mothers\" Over~payment, Waiver, and Underpayments The bill adds a provision to (1) authorize the recovery of an overpayment of benefits to one person by withholding benefits of others getting bene\u00ad fits on the same earnings record in cases where the overpaid person is alive; (2) authorize the waiver of recovery of an overpaid amount if -the person liable for repayment was without fault, even if the overpaid person was at fault; and (3)authorize the DHEW to settle claims for all under\u00ad payments. Attorneys' Fees The bill adds a provision to authorize a Federal courtthat renders a favorable decision to a claimant in an action arising under the social security program to set a reasonable fee (not in excess of 25 percent of past due benefits which become payable as a result of the decision) for the attorney who repre\u00ad sented the claimant, and authorizes the Secretary to certify payment of the fee to the attorney from past-due payments. 6 Combined Check The bill adds a provision under which the Secretary may authorize temporary overpayment to permit a surviving spouse to cash a benefit check issued jointly to a husband and wife if one of them dies before the check is negotiated, on the condition that any resulting overpayment would be recovered. Ministers The Committee added a provision to the House bill to permit social security credit to be obtained for the earnings of certain ministers who died or filed waiver certificates before April 16., 1965, where such earnings were reported for social security purposes but cannot be credited under present law. Controlled Corporations The bill would provide that when a person works for more than one corpora\u00ad tion in a controlled group of corporations the controlled group would be considered as a single employer for purposes of determining the maxizmum amount of wages subject to employer taxes. State and Local The House bill would add Alaska and Kentucky to the present list of 18 States which may extend social security coverage to only those current members of a retirement system who desire such coverage, with compulsory coverage for all persons who later become members of the retirement system. The Committee deleted the provision adding Kentucky to this list of States. Nonprofit Organizations The House bill would permit nonprofit organizations that have already filed waiver certificates to amend such certificates to secure additional retroactive coverage. The Committee anended this provision to give those employees to whom the additional retroactive coverage is applicable an individual choice of such additional coverage. The Committee also adopted a provision which would permit social security credit to be given for erroneously reported wages of certain employees of a nonprofit organization in cases where the organization elected social security coverage but did not fulfill all of the requirements which must be met in order for coverage to be effective for the employees in question. Administration The bill contains a provision for an additional Under Secretary and two Assistant Secretaries of Health, M~ucation, and Welfare. FInancing The Committee has approved a new schedule of contribution rates. These rates, and the rates in the bill as passed by the House, are shown in the following tables: 7 Present and Proposed Contribution Rates for Employees and Employers Each H.R. 6675 H.R. 6675 Present As Passed by the As Amended by the Year Law House of Representatives Committee on Finance ____ ___ OASDI HI Total OASDI HI Total 1966 3.85 3.85 4.8 0.8 5.60 '4.90 0.85 5.75 after Present and Contribution Rates for the Self-Employed H.R. 6675 H.R. 6675 Present As Passed by the As Amended by the Year Law House of Representatives Committee on Finance ____ OASDI HI Total OASDI HI Total 1966 6.2 6.0 0.35 6.35 5.8 0.325 6.125 1967 6.2 6.0 0.50 6.50 5.8 0.50 6.30 1968 6.9 6.0 0.50 6.50 5.8 0.50 6.30 1969-70 6.9 6.6 0.50 7.10 6.7 0.50 7.20 1971-72 6.9 6.6 0.50 7.10 6.7 0.55 7.25 1973-75 6.9 7.0 0.55 7.55 7.0 Mo. 7.60 1976-79 6.9 7.0 M.o 7.60 7.0 0.65 7.65 1980-86 6.9 7.0 0.70 7.70 7.0 0.75 7.75 1987 and 6.9 7.0 0.8 7.80 7.0 0.85 7.85 after 8. PUBLIC WELFARE PROVISIONS 1. Provision for States to purchase supplemental medical assistance for money payment recipients. The final dates in this section have been changed from July 1, 1967 to July 1, 1968. 2. Medical assistance. The bill permits a State to designate any single State agency for administration but requires determination of eligibility be made by the State or local agency administering the plan under title I or XVI (special provision is made for States with separate blind agencies). 3. Standards for institutions will, after June 30, 1967, have to include standards established by the Secretary relating to protection against a fire and other hazards to health and safety. 4. States desiring to include aged patients in mental and tuberculosis institutions will not have to include similar care and services for persons under age 65. This is an exception to the requirement that the amounts, scope and duration of benefits under title XIX be the same for all groups. 5. Provision is included for a description in State plans of items relating to quality of medical assistance--kinds and numbers for medical personnel and their responsibilities', standards for public and private institutions, cooperative arrangements with health and vocational rehabilitation agencies,, and other standards and methods designed to assure quality. 6. 75 percent reimbursement is provided for training as well as compensa\u00ad tion of skilled, professional medical personnel and supporting staff. 7. The special requirements contained in the House bill relating to pay\u00ad ments inmental or tuberculosis institutions have been limited to mental institutions. Aged persons may be cared for in tuberculosis hospitals without any special plan provisions. 8. The medical assistance title has been made optional with States. Accordingly, vendor payments can be made indefinitely under existing vendor payment provisions. 9. The requirement for comprehensive medical care for all medically ncedy has been made effective 10 years after a State's plan becomes effective instead of on July 1, 1975. 9 10. Skilled nursing home services as a required service have been limited to individuals 21 years of age or over. Dental services are requi.red for individuals under the age of 21. 11. The provision that if income is exempted for ani individual it also be exempted for any other individual has been extended to cover all titles. 12. A provision ismade for special projects for emotionally disturbed children as a part of the project grants for health of school and preschool children. Authorizations for the project grants have been increased by $5million for fiscal years 1968, 1969 and 1970 to cover the cost of the special projects for emotionally disturbed children. A study of resources relating to child~ren's emotional illness (under NIIIH) is also authorized. 13. Protective payments are authorized under title X and XIV for the blind and disabled. l14. UP to *50 of earnings for each of not more than three children in the same family may be exempted in determining need. The amendment is wholly permissive with the States. 15. Recipients of APTD may have the same exemoption of earnings as is provided 'under old-age assistance and the same exemption of income and resources if they are under an approved rehabilitation plan that is now provided for the blind. This amendment is also wholly permissive with the States. 16. A limitation of 30 days isplaced under the judicial review section on the time between the Secretary's receipt of a petition from the State and the time that a hearing is set. This was the only interval on which no time limitation was placed in the House bill. 17. The earmarked provision for day-care services was eliminated from child welfare services and the authorization for child welfare services increased to the same level as th~e maternal and child health and crippled children's programs under the bill. This is an increase of $5million for fiscal year 1966 and $10 million for most subsequent years. 18. The definition of a school in which an AFDC child may receive aid at the State's option between the ages. of 18 and 21 was broadened to include colleges. 19. An amendment requiring that an individual be free to select either a physician skilled in the diseases of the eye or an optometrist for services which an optometrist is licensed to perform was made applicable to all parts of the bill and the Social Security Act. SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Number 28 July 10, 1965 SENATE PASSES SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF 1965 To Administrative, Supervisory, and Technical Employees On July 9 the Senate passed H. R. 6675 .by a vote of 68 to 21. The bill now goes to a conference committee to settle differences between the bill as passed by the Senate and the bill as passed by the House of Representatives. Enclosed is a description of the amendments (other than welfare) added on the floor of the Senate to the bill that was reported out by the Committee on Finance. (The latter was described in Commissioner's Bulletin No. 27.) Robert M. Bal Commissioner Enclosure SOCIAL SECURITY AM4EN]I4ENTS OF 1965 CHANGES MADE ON THE SMNATE FLOOR IN H.R .6675* HEALTH INSURAN~CE 1. Removes the 60 day limit in the House bill on payments for inpatient hospital services during a spell of illness. Provides for coinsurance ($10 a day inii6ially) payable by the beneficiary for inpatient hospital services furnished after the 60th day. 2. Deletes the requirement under the basic hospital insurance plan that a person must have been in a hospital or extended care facility in order to be eligible for home health services. 3. Provides that an inidividual who is dissatisfied with a determination that he is not entitled to benefits under the basic hospital insurance plan or the supplementary medical insurance plan, or with a deter\u00ad mination relating to the amount of benefits payable under the basic plan would have a right to appeal (and to judicial review) where the amount in controversy is $100 or more. The House bill provided such appeal rights only where the amount in 'controversy was $1,000 or more. 4i. Provides that the Secretary shall appoint an Advisory Council on Social Security to make a comprehensive study of nursing homes and other extended care facilities-and, before the end of the 1-ye'ar period following Enactment, report its findings and recommendations to the Secretary for transmittal to the Congress. 5. Provides that the Secretary shall study the feasibility of covering prescription drugs under the supplementary medical insurance plan and submit a report, including recommendations, to the Congress on or before June 30, 1966. 6. Reduces from 10 years to 6 months the period during which aliens who have been admitted to the United States for permanent residence are required to have lived in the United States in order to be eligible for hospital insurance benefits under the transitional insured status provision. 7. The House bill provided that the health and safety standards to be prescribed by the Secretary at the request of a State for application within that State could not be higher than those established by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals~ for accreditation purposes. The Senate floor amendment deletes this limitation and provides that the Secretary' s standards may not be lower than those imposed by a State or locality on institutions as a condition to their purchase of institutional services under public medical assistance programs. *This listing was prepared before the printing of the Senate bill so that full assurance of technical accuracy is not possible. 2 8. Requires that the Secretary accept the certification by a State agency that an institution or agency is a hospital, extended care facility, or a home health agency (as these terms are defined in the bill) unless he determines that the institution or agency is so inadequate as to endanger the life or health of patients. OASDI Reduced Benefits at Age 60 Old-age, wife's, husband's., widower's, and parent's benefits could be paid at age 60. (A provision for paying benefits to widows at 60 is included in the House binl.) No change is made in the present law provisions relating to the period over which benefits are computed--up to age 65 for men workers, and up to age 62 for women workers. The benefits would be reduced to take account of the longer period over which they would be paid. The reduction factors now applied-to an old- age, wife's, and husband's benefit taken between age 62 and 65 would be applied to these benefits if taken before age 62; the reduction factor for parent's and widower's benefits would be the sam~e as the old-age benefit reduction factor--five-ainths of one percent a month (62/3 percent for each full year)--and would be applied for those months before age 62 for which the benefit is paid (the same as the reduction provisions for widow's benefits). The maximum reduction--for 60 months-\u00ad in the old-age benefit would be 33 1/3 percent of the primary insurance amount; the maximum reduction in the wife's benefit would be 41i 2/3 percent of the wife's benefit (which, of course, is 50 percent of the primary insurance amount). Thus where the worker's primary insurance amount was $106, his benefit at age 60 would be $70.70; his wife's benefit at age 60 would be $31; and the benefit payable on his account for a sole parent or a widower at age 60 would be $75.90. Disclosure of Information from Social Security Records The bill adds a provision under which the Social Security Administration, at the request of a State public welfare agency or a court of competent jurisdiction would be required to disclose the most recent address contained in the social security records for any person who is certified by the agency or court as failing, without lawful excuse, to provide support for his or her destitute children under age 16 or for his destitute wife. The address would be disclosed only if the request was made by the agency or court on behalf of the wife or children, and it -could be used only on behalf of the wife and children. Adoption of a Brother or Sister The bill would also provide that a child's benefits would not be terminated as a result of his adoption by his brother or sister. Effect of Increased Social Security Benefits on Veterans' Pensions The increase in social security benefits made by H.R. 6675 would not be counted as annual income in determining the amount of a veteran's pension for Veterans Administration purposes. Since eligibility for and the amount of a veteran's pension depend on the amount of total countable income the veteran has, in the absence of such an amendment the social security benefit increase could have resulted in a veteran's getting a smaller pension or none at all. Ministers' Filing Deadline The period during which ministers who have been in the ministry for at least two years since 19541 may file waiver certificates electing social security coverage would be reopened, through April 15, 1966. Coverage for ministers whose eligibility to file waiver certificates would be reopened would ordinarily begin with 1963. Conforming changes were made in the provision, added to the bill by the Senate Finance Committee, which would permit the validation of certain erroneously reported ministerial earnings. Nonprofit Validating Provision A technical correction was made in a pro-vision which had been added to the bill by the Senate Finance Committee, in order to permit the objective of the provision to be properly carried out. The provision would permit certain employees whose wages were erroneously reported by a nonprofit organization during the period the organization's waiver certificate was in effect to validate such erroneously reported wages. School District Employees in Alaska Provision was made for validating the past coverage under social security of employees of certain school districts in Alaska which have been included in error as separate political subdivisions under the Alaska social security coverage agreement. The employees of the school districts involved should properly have been covered as employees of the political subdivisions of which the school districts are integral parts. The amend\u00ad ment would be effective only for periods prior to 1966; coverage for 1966 and later years would be under the general provisions of law. Disability Benefits for the Blind The bill would (a) provide a less strict definition of \"blindness\" than the one used in present law for purposes of the disability freeze (20/100 visual acuity is proposed as against 5/200 under present law); (b)permit an individual who meets the proposed definition of blindness to qualify for disability benefits regardless of his capacity to work; (c)modify the disability work requirements so that persons meeting the proposed definition of blindness could qualify for disability beneflts with 6 quarters of coverage earned at any time, and (d)provide for the payment of disability benefits beyond age 65 for blind persons even though they are not fully insured,, and without regard to the retirement test. Financing The Senate has approved a new schedule of contribution rates. These rates, and the rates in the bill as passed by the House, are shown in the f'ollowing tables: Present and.Proposed Contribution Rates for Employees and Employers Each H.R. 6675 H.R. 6675 Present As Passed by the As Passed by the Year Law House of Representatives Senate ____ ___ OASDI HI Total OASDI HI Total 1966 3.85 3.85 4.0 0.50 4.50 3.85 0.50 4.35 1969-70 4.625 4.4 0.50 4.90 4.50 0.50 5.00 1971-72 4.625 4.4 0.50 4.90 4.50 0.80 5.60 4.95 0.85 5.80 after Present for the Self-Employed H.R. 6675 H.R. 6675 Present As Passed by the As Passed by the Year Law House of Representatives Senate ____ OASD HI Total OASDI HI Toltal 1966 6.2 6.0 0.35 6.35 5.8 0.325 6.125 1967 6.2 6.o 0.50 6.5o 5.8 0.50 6.30 1968 6.9 6.o 0.50 6.50 5.8 0.50 6.30 1969-70 6.9 6.6 0.50 7.10 6.8 0.50 7.30 1971-72 6.9 6.6 0.50 7.10 6.8 0.55 7.35 1973-75 6.9 7.0 0.55 7.55 7.0 0.65 7.65 1976-79 6.9 7.0 0.60 7.60 7.0 0-70o 7.70 1980-86 6.9 7.0 0.70 7.70 7.0 0.80 7.80 1987 and 6.9 7.0 0.80 7.80 7.0 0.85 7.85 after SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Number 29 July 21, 1965 House-Senate Conference Agrees on Provisions of H. R. 6675 To Administrative, Supervisory, and Technical Employees The House-Senate conference committee has reconciled the differences between H. R. 6675 as passed by the House and the Senate. The bill now returns to both Houses, where early passage is expected. Enclosed is a summary of the provisions of the bill. Robert M. Bal Commissioner Enclosure SWMARY OF PROVISIONS OF H.R. 6675 THE \"SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDNENTS OF 1965\" I. MMEAT INSURANCE FOR THM AGED The bill adds a new title XVIII to the Social Security Act establishing two related health insurance programs for persons 65 and over: (1)a basic plan providin prtection against the costs of hospital and related care; and (2) 'avoluntary supplementary plan covering payments for physicians' services and other medical and health services to cover certain areas not covered by the basic plan. The basic plan will be financed through a separate earnings tax and separate trust fund. Benefits for persons currently over 65 who are not insured under the social security and railroad retirement system will be financed out of Federal general revenues. Enrollment in the supplementary plan is to be voluntary and will be financed by a small monthly premium (*6 per month initially-\u00ad *3 to be paid by enrollees and an equal amount to be supplied by the Federal Government out of general revenues). The premiums for social security, railroad retirement beneficiaries and Civil Service Retire\u00ad ment annuitants who enroll will be deducted from their monthly benefits. Uninsured persons desiring the supplemental plan will make the periodic premium payments to the Government. *State welfare programs could arrange for uninsured assistance recipients to be covered. A. Basic Plan -Hospital Insurance 1. General description Basic protection, financed through an earnings tax., will be provided against the costs of inpatient hospital services, post-hospital extended care, post-hospital home health services, and outpatient hospital diag\u00ad nostic services for social security and railroad retirement beneficiaries when they attain age 65. The same protection, financed from general revenues, will be provided under a special transitional provision for essentially all people who are now aged 65., or who will reach age 65 be\u00ad fore 19681, but who are not eligible for social security or railroad retirement benefits. Together, these two groups comprise virtually the entire aged population. The persons not protected would be Federal employees who are covered, or who were covered on February 15,, 1965, or who, if they retired after February 15, 1965, could have been covered, under the provisions of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959. Others excluded would be aliens who have not been residents of the United States for 5 years, aliens who have not been admitted for permanent residence., and certain subversives. I-2 Benefits will be first effective on July 1,, 1966, except for services inextended care facili1ties which will be effective on January 1,1967. 2. Benefits The services for which payment will be made under the basic plan include-\u00ad a. inpatient hospital services for up to 90 days in each spell of illness. The patient will pay a deductible amount of $1i0 for the first 60 days plus a coinsurance payment of $10 a day for each day in excess of 60 during each spell of illness; hospital services include all those ordinarily furnished by a hospital to its inpatients; however, pay\u00ad ment will not be made for private duty nursing or for the hospital services of physicians except-services provided by interns or residents in training under approved teaching programs. Inpatient psychiatric hospital service will be included,, but a lifetime limitation of 190 days will be imposed. Inpatient services in Christian Science sanatoriums will also be covered. b. post-hospital extended care (in a facility having an arrangement with a hospital for the timely transfer of patients and for furnishing medical information about patients) after the patient is transferred from a hospital (after at least a 3-day stay) for up to 100 days in each spell of illness., but after the first 20 days of care patients will Pay $5 a day for the remaining 80 days of extended care in a spell of illness. Under a special provision., extended care in Christian Science sanatoriums will be covered for up to 30 days., with the patient paying $5 a day. c. outpatient hospital diagnostic services with the patient paying a $20 deductible amount and a 20 percent coinsurance for each diagnostic study (that is,, for diagnostic services furnished to him by the same hospital during a 20-day period); and d. post-hospital home health services for up to 100 visits,, after discharge from a hospital (after at least a 3mday stay,) or extended care facility and before the beginning of a new spell of illness. Such a person must be in the care of a physician and under a plan established by a physician within 14 days of discharge calling for such services. These services will include intermittent nursing care., therapy, and the part- time services of a home health aide. The patient must be homebound., except that payment could be made for services furnished at a hospital or extended care facility or rehabilitation center which require the use of equipment that cannot ordinarily be taken to the patient's home. No service will be covered as post-hospital extended care or as outpatient diagnostic or post-hospital home health services if it is of a kind that could not be covered if it were furnished to a patient in a hospital. A spell of illness will be considered to begin when the individual enters a hospital and to end when he has not been an inpatient of a hospital or extended care facility for 60 consecutive days. The deductible amounts for inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital diagnostic services will be increased if necessary to keep pace with increases in hospital costs, but no such increase will be made before I-3 1969. For reasons of administrative simplicity, increases in the hospital deductible will be made only when a $4. change is called for and the outpatient deductible will change in $2 steps. 3. Basis of reimbursement Payment of bills under the basic plan will be made to the providers of service on the basis of the \"reasonable cost\" incurred in providing care for beneficiaries. 14. Administration Basic responsibility for administration will rest with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. The Secretary -will use appropriate State agencies and private organizations (nominated by providers of services) to assist in the administration of the program. Provision is made for the establishment of an Advisory Council which will advise the Secretary on policy matters in connection with administration. 5. Financing Taxes to finance the basic plan,, paid by employrers,, employees., and self-employed persons., will be placed ina separate hospital in\u00ad surance trust fund established in the Treasury. The earnings base-\u00ad the amount of annual earnings subject to the new taxes--will be the same as for purposes of financing social security cash benefits. The sa-me contribution rate will apply equafly to employers, employees, aznd self-employed persons and earnings base will be $6,600 a year. The schedule of contribution rates is based on estimates of cost which assume that the earnings base will not be increased above $6,600. If Congress, in later years, should increase the base above $6,600., the tax rates established can be reduced under the cost assumptions underlying the bill. The cost of providing basic hospital and related benefits to people who are not social security or railroad retirement beneficiaries will be paid from general funds of the Treasury. I-4l B. Voluntary Supplementary Insurance Plan 1. General description A package of benefits supplementing those provided under, the basic plan will be offered to all persons 65 and over. Individuals who enroll initially will PaY $3a month (deducted,, where possi. ble, from social security, railroad retirement, or civil service retirement benefits). The Government would match this amount with $3 paid from general funds. Since the minimum increase in cash social security benefits for workers who are 65 or over when the benefit increase is effective for them will be $4. a month ($6 a month for man and wife receiving benefits based on the same~ earnings record), the benefit increases will fully cover the amount of monthly premiums. 2. Enrollment Persons aged 65 before January 1, 1966, will have an opportunity to enroll in an enrollment period which begins on the first day of the second month after the month of enactment and ends March 31., 1966. Persons attaining age 65 subsequent to December 31, 1965,, will have enrollment periods of 7 months beginning 3months before attaining 65. In the future general enrollment periods will be from October to December 31, in each odd year. The first such period will be October 1 to December 31, 1967. No person may enroll more than 3years after the close of the first enrollment period in which he could have enrolled. There will be only one chance to reenroll for persons who are in the plan but drop out., and reenrollment must occur within 3 years of termina\u00ad tion of previous enrollment. Coverage may be terminated (1) by the individual filing notice during a general enrollment period, or (2) by the Government, for nonpayment of premiums. A State w ill be able to pr.ovide the supplementary insurance benefits to its public assistance recipients who are receiving cash assistance if it chooses to do so. Benefits will be effective beginning July 1, 1966. 3. Benefits The voluntary supplementary insurance plan w i 11 cover physicians' services, home health services., and nlumerous other medical and health I-5 services in and out of medical institutions. There will be an annual deductible of $50. Then the plan will cover 80 percent 'ofthe patient's bill (above the deductible) of the following services: a. Physicians' and surgeons' services, whether furnished ina hospital, clinic, office, in the home, or elsewhere. b. Home health services (with no requirement of prior hospitaliza\u00ad tion) for up to 100 visits during each calendar year. c. Driagnostic X-ray and laboratory tests, and other diagnostic tests. d. X-ray, radium, and radioactive isotope therapy. e. Ambulance services. f. Surgical dressings and splints,, casts., and other devices for re\u00ad duction of fractures and dislocations; rental of durable medical equip\u00ad ment such as iron lungs, oxygen tents, hospital beds, and wheelchairs used inthe patient's home; prosthetic devices (other than dental) which replace all or part of an internal body organ; braces and artificial legs., arms, eyes, etc. There will be a special limitation on outside-the-hospital treatment of mental., psychoneurotic., and personality disorders. Payment for such treatment during any calendar year will be limited., in effect., to $250 or 50 percent of the expenses, whichever is smaller. 4. Administration by carriers: Basis for reimbursement The Secretary of Health., Education,, and Welfare will be required., to the extent possible., to contract with carriers to carry out the major administrative functions of the voluntary, supplementary plan such as determining rates of payments under the program., holding and disbursing funds for benefit payments, and determining compliance and assisting in utilization review. No contract isto be entered into by the Secretary unless he finds that the carrier will perform its obligations under the contract efficiently and effectively and will meet such requirements as to financial responsibility, legal authority, and other matters as he finds pertinent. The contract must provide that the carrier take necessary action to see that where payments are on a cost basis (to institutional pro\u00ad viders of services), the cost is reasonable cost. Correspondingly, where payments are on a charge basis (to physicians or others furnishing noninsti\u00ad tutional services), the carrier must see that such charge will be reasonable and not higher than the charge applicable., for a comparable service and under comparable circumstances, to the other policyholders and subscribers of the carrier. Payment by the carrier for physicians' services will be made on the basis of a receipted bill, or on the basis of an assignment under the terms of which the reasonable charge will be the full charge for the service. In determining reasonable charges., the carriers will consider the customary charges for similar services generally made by the physician or other person or organization furnishing the covered services, and. also the prevailing charges in the locality for similar services. I-6 5. Financing Aged persons who enroll in the supplementary plan will pay monthly premiums of $3. Where the individual is currently receiving monthly social security, railroad retirement or civil service retirement bene\u00ad fits, the premiums will be deducted from his benefits. The Government will help finance the-supplementary plan through a payment from general revenues of $3 a month per enrollee. To provide an operating fund at the beginning of the supplementary plan., and to establish a contingency reserve, a Government appropriation will be available (on a repayable basis) equal to $18 per aged person estimated to be eligible in July 1966., when the supplementary plan goes into effect. The individual and Government contributions will be placed in a separate trust fund for the supplementary plan. All benefit and administrative expenses under the supplementary plan will be paid from this fund. The provision in the income tax law which limits medical expense deductions to amounts in excess of 3 percent of adjusted gross income for persons under 65 will be reinstituted for persons 65 and over. Thus, provision is made for partial or full recovery of the Government contribution from enrolled persons with incomes high enough to require them to pay income taxes. A special deduction (for taxpayers who itemize deductions) of one-half of premiums for medical care insurance will be added, however. This special deduction, which 'willbe applicable to taxpayers of all ages, cannot exceed $150 per year. Premium rates for enrolled persons (and the matching Government con\u00ad tribution) will be increased from time to time in the event that costs rise, but not more often than once every 2 years. The premium rate for a person who enrolls after the first period when enrollment was open to him will be increased by 10 percent for each full year he stayed out of the program. C. Cost of the Basic and Supplementary Plan Benefits under both-plans will become payable for services furnished in July 1966,, except for services in extended care facilities., for which benefits will become payable in January 1967. Benefits and administrative expenses upider the basic plan will be about $2.2 billion for the first year of operations. The costs for the uninsured under the basic plan (paid from general revenues) will be about $290 million per year for early years with a substantial offset for public assistance savings. Costs of the supplementary plan will be .about $1.2 billion in the first year of operations. I-7 D. Railroad Retirement Health Insurance Provisions The basic administration of the health insurance benefits program for railroad retirement beneficiaries would be handled by the Social Security Administration in much the same way as for social security beneficiaries. That is, the Social Security Administration would be responsible for making payments to providers of services and carrying out related adminis\u00ad trative functions. The bill contains provisions designed to assure that the hospital insurance taxes paid on employment covered under the railroad retirement program will be the same as the taxes on employment covered under social security. For years in which the annual earnings and tax bases of the two programs are equal, hospital insurance taxes on railroad employment will be levied under the railroad retirement taxing provisions of law, and transferred to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund., with payments made from such fund. In these years the Railroad Retirement Board would make determinations as to the rights of railroad retirement beneficiaries to hospital insurance bere fits, and would provide hospital insurance benefits., financed from the Railroad Retirement Account, for railroad retirement beneficiaries in Canadian hospitals. These provisions presumably anticipate the enactment of legislation making and keeping the railroad retirement wage and tax base equal to that of social security. However, should there be years in which the tax and wage bases of the two programs are not equal, hospital insurance taxes for such years would be levied under the social security taxing provisions of law, and hospital insurance benefits for railroad beneficiaries would be provided under social security on the same basis as for social security beneficiaries. 7/21/65 II. OLD-AGEj, SURVIVORS., AN~D DISABILITY INSURANCE AMENDHNTS A. Benefits 1. Increase in monthly cash benefits The bill provides a '(-percent across-the-board benefit increase, effective retroactively beginning with January 1965, with a minimum increase of $4 for retired workers age 65 and older. Benefits will be increased for the 20 million social security beneficiaries on the rolls at the time of enactment and for all future beneficiaries. The minimum monthly benefit for workers retiring at or after age 65 is $44; the maximum (based on average monthly earnings of $400, the highest possible under the $4800 contribution and benefit base) is $135.90. In the future., higher creditable earnings under the increase in the contri\u00ad bution and benefit base to $6600 a year will make possible a maximum benefit of $168. The maximum amount of benefits payable to a family on the basis of a single earnings record will be related to the worker's average monthly earnings at all earnings levels, with an ultimate family maximum of $368. The bill also provides for the benefits of people on the rolls to be recomputed automatically each year to take account of any covered earnings that the worker might have had in the previous year and that can increase his benefit amount. The amendment is effective with respect to calendar years after 1964. 2. Change in the retirement test The bill provides that a beneficiary may have annual earnings of $1500 and still get all of his benefits for the year; if his earnings exceed $1500, $1 in benefits will be withheld for each $2 of annual earnings up to $2700 and for each $1 of earnings thereafter. The bill also provides that a beneficiary will get benefits, regardless of the amount of his annual earnings., for any month in which he earns $125 or less in wages and does not render substantial services in self-employment. These provisions are effective for taxable years ending after 1965. The bill also exempts certain royalties that are received in or after the year in which a person reaches age 65 from copyrights and patents that were obtained before age 65 from being counted as earnings for purposes of the test. This provision is effective for taxable years beginning after 1964. 3. Payment of child's insurance benefits to children attending school or college after attainment of age 18 and up to age 22 The bill provides for the payment of child's insurance benefits until the child reaches age 22, provided the child is attending a public or accredited school as a full-time student after he reaches age 18. II-2 Children of deceased, retired, and disabled workers are included. No person will be paid mother's or wife's benefits solely on the basis of having in her care a child who has attained age 18 and is in school. The change is effective for months after December 1964.. 11.Changes in the disability program a. Definition of disability.--The bill eliminates the requirement that a worker's disability must be expected to be of long-continued and indefinite duration and provides that an insured worker is eligible for disability benefits if he has been under a disability which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 calendar months. Benefits payable by reasion of this change inthe definition of disability will be paid beginning with benefits for the second month following the month of enactment. b. Workmen's compensation offset.--The bill provides that the social security disability benefit for any month for which a worker is receiving a periodic workmen's compensation benefit will be reduced to the extent that the total benefits payable to him and his dependents under both programs exceed 80 percent of his average monthly earnings prior to the onset of disability, but with the reduction periodically adjusted to take account of changes innational average earnings levels. Under this provision, the worker 'saverage monthly earnings are defined as the higher of (a)his average monthly wage used for purposes of computing his social security disability benefit or (b)his average monthly earnings, in employment covered by social security, during his highest 5 consecutive years after 1950. This offset provision will be applicable with respect to benefits payable after December 1965 on the basis of disabilities commencing after June 1,1965. C. Rehabilitation services.--The bill provides for reimbursement from social security trust funds to State vocational rehabilitation agencies forthe cost of rehabilitation services furnished to selected individuals who are entitled to disability insurance benefits or to disabled child's benefits. The total amount of the funds that may be made available from the trust funds for purposes of reimbursing State agencies cannot, in any year, exceed 1 percent of the social security disability benefits paid in the previous year. This provision is effective upon enactment of the bill. d. 'Disability benefits for the blind.--.The bill modifies the disa\u00ad bility provisions with respect to the blind in two respects. First, it modifies the definition of disability so as to provide that an individual will be considered to be under a disability for purposes of entitlement to disability benefits if he is between the ages of 55 and 65, meets the definition of \"blindness\" (as now provided for purposes of the disability\"freeze\") and is unable, by reason of such blindness, to engage in sub\u00adstantial gainful activity requiring skills or abilities comparable to those required in his past occupation or occupations. No payment would be made to such blind individual, however, for any month in which he engages in substantial gainful activity. Second, the bill provides an alternative insured status requirementfor persons who are disabled before age 31 by reason of \"blindness\" as defined. Under this provision, such a blind individual would be insured if he has quarters of coverage in one-half the quarters elapsing after attainment of age 21 and up to the point of disability, or, in the case of those becoming disabled before age 241, for at least one-half of the 3 years preceding the quarter in which he becomes disabled. II1-3 e. Entitlement to disability benefits after entitlement to bene\u00ad fits payable on account of age.--Under the bill,a person who becomes entitled before age 65 to a benefit payabie on account of old age could later become entitled to disability insurance benefits. The amendment is effective beginning with monthly benefits for the second month after the month of enactment, on the basis of applications filed in or after the month of enactment. 5. Benefits for widows at age 60 Widows can elect to receive benefits at age 60; the benefits payable to those who claim them before age 62 will be actuarially reduced to take account of the longer period over which they will be paid. This provision is effective beginning with the second month after the month of enactment. 6. Transitional insured status The bill sets up a \"transitional insured status\" under which people who reached retirement age in 1955 or 1956 can qualify for benefits if they have one quarter of coverage for each year that elapsed after 1950 and up to retirement age (that is, 4ior 5) and people who reached retire\u00ad ment age in or before 195k can qualify if they have 3 quarters of coverage instead of 6. The following table shows the operation of the \"transitional insured status\" provision for workers: Men Women (In 1965 Age Quarters of Coverag Required e Age (In 1965) Quarters of Coverage Required 76 orover 75 74. 3 41 5 73 orover 72 71 3 14 5 Benefits are not payable under this provision until age 72. Wife's benefits are payable at age 72 to a woman whose husband qualifies for benefits under the transitional provision if she attains age 72 before 1969. Widow's benefits will be payable at age 72 to a woman who reaches age 72 before 1969 if her husband is living when the transitional provision becomes effective and if he meets the work requirements of the provision. A widow who reaches age 72 before 1969 but whose husband died before the transitional provision became effective can qualify if her husband attained age 65 or died before 1957 and if he had a specified number of quarters of coverage., as shown in the following table: ii-4. Year of husband's Quarters of coverage required death (or attain- if the widow attains age 72-\u00ad ment of age 65, In 1966 or if earlier) before In 1967 In 1968 1954e or before 34 1955 '4 '4 5 1956 5 5 5 Under the provision, benefits of $35 will be payable to retired workers and widows; wives of retired workers would receive $17.50. These provisions are effective for the second month after the month of enactment. 7. Dependents' benefits a. Qualification of children not qualified under State law.--Under the bill a child can be paid benefits based on his father's earnings without regard to whether he has the status of a child under State inheritance laws if the father was supporting the child or had a legal obligation to do so. Benefits will be paid to a child on the earnings record of his father, even though the child cannot inherit the father's intestate personal property, if the father had acknowledged the child in writing; had been ordered by a court to contribute to the child's support; had been judicially decreed to be the child's father; or is shown by other satisfactory evidence to be the child's father and was living with or contributing to the support of the child. The amendment will be effective with respect to monthly benefits beginning with the second month after the month of enactment. b. Payment of widow's and widower's insurance benefits after remarriage.\u00ad The bill provides that benefits will be payable to widows (and widowers) even though they have remarried if the remarriage was after age 60 (age 62 for widowers). The amount of the remarried widow's or widower's benefit will be equal to 50 percent of the primary insurance amount of the deceased spouse rather than 82-fi percent of that amount, which is payable to widows and widowers who are not married. This provision will be effective with respect to monthly benefits beginning with those payable for the second month after the month of enactment. c. Wife's and widow's benefits for divorced women.--The bill authorizes payment of wife's or widow's benefits to the divorced wife of a retired, deceased, or disabled worker if she had been married to the worker for at least 20 years before the date of the divorce and if her divorced husband was making (or was obligated by a court to make) a substantial contribu\u00ad tion to her support when he became entitled to benefits, became disabled, or died. The bill also provides that a wife's benefits will not terminate when the woman and her husband are divorced if the marriage has been in effect for 20 years. Provision is also made for the re-establishment of II1-5 benefit rights for a divorced wife, a widow, a surviving divorced mother, or a surviving divorced wife who has remarried if the subsequent marriage has ended. These changes are effective for the second month following the month of enactment. d. Adoption of child by retired worker.--The bill changes the pro\u00ad visions relating to the payment of benefits to children who are adopted by old-age insurance beneficiaries to require that, where the adoption occurs after the worker becomes entitled to an old-age benefit, (1) the child be living with the worker (or adoption proceedings have begun) in or before the month when application for old-age benefits is filed; (2) the child be receiving one-half of his support for a year before the worker's entitlement; and (3)the adoption be completed within 2 years after the worker's entitlement. The amendment is effective with respect to applications filed on or after the date of enactment, except that the 2-year time limit will not apply to adoptions completed within 1 year after the month of enactment. e. Changes in definition of wife, widow, husband, and widower.--Under the bill, a wife, husband, widow, or widower will get benefits without regard to the generally applicable 1-year duration-of-marriage requirement if in the month preceding the marriage he or she was actually or potentially entitled to a widow's, widower's, parent's, or (if over age 18) child's annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act. Also, a woman worker's husband or widower who was entitled to one of the specified railroad retirement annuities prior to marriage to a person insured under social security will get benefits without regard to the generally applicable requirement for husband's or widower's benefits that the wife be currently insured and have provided at least one-half of her husband's support. The amendment will be effective beginning with monthly benefits payable for the second month after the month of enactment. f. Time of filing.--The bill extends indefinitely the period for filing proof of support for dependent husband's, widower's,and parent's benefits,, and applications for lump-sum death payments, where good cause exists for failure to file within the initial 2-year period. The amendment is effective with respect to lump-sum death payments and monthly benefits based on applications filed in or after the month of enactment. g. Adoption by a brother or sister.--The bill adds brothers and sisters to the list of relatives who may adopt a child after the death of the worker on whose earnings record he is getting benefits without causing termination of the child's benefits. The amendment is effective with respect to monthly benefits beginning with the month after enactment. B. Coverage 1. Physicians and interns Social security coverage is extended to self-employment as a doctor of medicine effective for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1965. The employment of interns is covered, beginning on January 1., 1966., on the same basis as that of other employees working for the same employer. ii-6 2. Tips covered as wages Cash tips received after 1965 by an employee in the course of his employment will be covered as wages for social security and income-tax withholding purposes, except that employers will not be required to pay the social security employer tax on the tips. The employee will be required to give his employer a written report of his tips within 10 days after the end of the month in which the tips are received; to the extent that unpaid wages due an employee and in the possession of the employer are insufficient to pay the employee social security tax due on the tips, the employee will be permitted to make available to the employer sufficient funds to pay the employee social security tax. If an employee fails to report some or all of his covered tips to his employer., as required by law., he will be liable not only for the employee social security tax but also for an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the employee tax. The employer will be required to withhold the employee social security tax only on tips reported to him within the specified time and for which he has sufficient funds of the employee out of which to pay the tax. He will be liable for withholding income tax on only those tips that are reported to him within 10 days after the end of the month inwhich the tips were receivedJ, and then only to the extent that he can collect the tax (at or after the time the tips are reported to him and before the close of the calendar year in which the tips were received) from unpaid wages.(not including tips), or from funds turned over to him for that purpose remaining after an amount equal to the amount due for the social security tax has been subtracted. 3. Exemoption of Amish and other religious sects Under specified conditions, members of religious sects may obtain exemption from social security self-employment taxes upon application accompanied by a waiver of benefit rights. To be eligible for exemption an individual must be found to be a member of a recognized religious sect (or a division of a sect) and to be an adherent of the established tenets or teachings of such sect by reason of which he is conscientiously opposed to acceptance of the benefits of any private or public insurance maki ng payments. in the event of death, disability., old-age., or retirement., or making payments toward the cost ofJ or providing services for., medical care (including the benefits of any insurance system established by the Social Security Act). It mast be found that such sect has such teachings., and has been in existence at all times since December 31., 1950,, and that it is the practice for members of such sect to make provision for their dependent members which is reasonable in view of their general level of living. The application for exemption for taxable years ending on or before December 31, 1965, must be filed by April 15, 1966. The exemption may become effective as early as the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1950. II1-7' 14. Farmers Farm operators whose annual gross earnings are $21400 or less (instead of *1800 or less) will be permitted to report either their actual net earnings or 66 2/3 percent of' their gross earnings. Farmers whose annual gross earnings are over *2400 will be required to report their actual net earnings if $1600 or more, but if actual net earnings are less than $1600, they will be permitted to report either their actual net earnings or $1600. (Present law requires that farmers whose annual gross earnings are over $1800 report their actual net earnings if $1200 or more, but if actual net earnings are less than $1200., they may report either their actual net earnings or $1200.) The provision is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31., 1965. 5. Ministers The period during which ministers who have been in the ministry for at least 2 years since 19514. may file waiver certificates electing social security coverage is reopened, through April 15, 1966. Coverage for ministers whose eligibility to file waiver certificates is reopened will ordinarily begin with 1963. In addition, social security credit may be obtained for the past earnings of certain ministers who die or file waiver certificates before April 16, 1966, where such earnings were reported for social security purposes but could not be credited. 6. E~nployees of nonprofit organizations Nonprofit organizations may file a waiver certificate and make it retroactive up to 5 years (rather than the 1 year under present law) before the quarter in which the certificate is filed. If an organiza\u00ad tion files a waiver certificate before 1966, the certificate may be amended during 1965 or 1966 to begin coverage as early as 5 years before the quarter in which the certificate is amended. Those employees to whom additional retroactive coverage is applicable (as a result of the organization amending its certificate) are given an individual choice of such additional coverage. 'Employees who were reported erroneously and who are no longer employed when an organization files its waiver certificate, or amends its certificate., may validate such erroneous reportings for periods during which the certificate or amended certificate is in effect. In addition, certain employees whose wages were erroneously reported by a nonprofit organization during the period the organization's waiver certificate was in effect may validate such erroneously reported wages. These provisions are effective upon enactment. 7'. District of Columbia employees Coverage is provided for employees of the District of Columbia who are not covered by a retirement system. About 600 substitute teachers are not covered under any retirement system. Also, the District of Columbia Commissioners may arrange for the coverage of temporary and ii -8 intermittent employees to be shifted from the Federal civil service retirement system to social security. Coverage begins after the calendar quarter inwhich the Secretary of the Treasury receives a certificate from the District of Columbia Commissioners expressing their desire to have coverage extended to the affected employees. 8. State and local coverage changes Another opportunity is provided., through 1966., for the election of coverage by State and local government retirement system members who originally did not choose coverage under the divided retirement system provision, under which current employees have a choice of coverage. Alaska is added to the list of States which may use the divided retirement system provision. These provisions are effective upon enactment. Iowa and North Dakota are permitted to modify their coverage agree\u00ad ments with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to exclude from social security coverage services performed by students, including services already covered,. in the employ of a school., college., or university in any calendar quarter ifthe remuneration for such services is less than 450. The modification may specify the effective date of the exclusion, but it may not be earlier than the date of enactment. The past coverage under social security of employees of certain school districts in Alaska which have been included in error as separate political subdivisions under the Alaska social security coverage agree\u00ad ments isvalidated. (The employees of the school districts involved should properly have been covered as employees of the political subdivisions of which the school districts are integral parts.) The provision is effective for the year of enactment and prior years; coverage for years after the year of enactment must be under the general provisions of the law. The State of California ispermitted to modify its coverage agreement to extend coverage to certain hospital employees whose positions were removed from a State or local government retirement system. The State will have until the end of the sixth month after the month of enactment to take action under this provision. The State of Maine is given until July 12 196T (rather than until July 1, 1965) to treat teaching and nonteaching employees who are in the same retirement system as though they were under separate retirement systems for social security coverage purposes. C. Administrative and Technical Changes 1. Life of applications The bill eliminates the provisions under which the life of an application for benefits is 3 months (9months for disability benefits). II -9 Under those provisions, an applicant had to meet all of the eligibility requirements for benefits as of a date not later than 3 months (9 months for disability benefits) from the date of application; if he did not, his application expired, The bill extends the life of applications for social security benefits to the date of the final decision thereon by the Secretary. 2. Underpaymnents The bill authorizes the Secretary to dispose of amounts due a deceased beneficiary, where such amounts do not exceed an amount equal to a single monthly benefit, by making the payment to the widow or widower of the deceased beneficiary who was living in the same household with the deceased, or if there is no such widow or widower, to the legal representative of the deceased person's estate. In all other cases, the amounts due a deceased person are to be paid to the legal representative of the estate. 3. Payments to two or more members of the same family The bill provides, that under regulations to be issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, the surviving payee or payees of a joint benefit check may cash any such check which was not negotiated before one of the payees died., provided that so much of the amount of the check as exceeds the amount due thbe surviving payee or payees shall be recovered.* The amendment is effective on enactment of the bill (although as a practical matter it would become effective only after the necessary regulations have been issued). Ii.Attorneys' fees in court cases A court which renders a decision favorable to a claimant for social security benefits is authorized to set a reasonable fee (up to 25 percent of the past-due benefits resulting from the court's decision) for an attorney who represented the claiment before the court. The Secretary is given authority to certify for payment to the attorney., out of the total of the past-due benefits., the amount of the fee set by the court. Any attorney charging or receiving more than the fee set by the court will be subject to a fine of up to *500, imprisonment up to one year, or both. The amendment is effective on enactment. 5. Disclosure, under certain circumstances, of whereabouts of individuals The bill requires the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to furnish, at the request of a State welfare agency administering a Federal- State program of aid to families with dependent children., the most recent address in the social security records for a parent who has failed without lawful excuse to provide support for his or her destitute child or children under age 16 who are eligible for assistance under the aid to families with dependent children program, where there is a court order for the support of the children. 11-10 6. Reimbursement of trust funds for cost of non-contributory military service credits The bili revises the provisions authorizing reimbursement of the social security trust funds out of general revenue for gratuitous social security wage credits for servicemen so that reimbursement wili be spread over the next 50 years., rather than 10 years. The amendment is effective on enact\u00ad ment. D. Number of People Immediately Affected And Amount of Additional Cash Benefit Payments in First Pull Year., 1966 Provision Amount of Payments Number of People in First Full Year, 196 Immediately Affected 7-percent benefit increase ($11 minimum imprimary benefits). $ 1,4&70o,000000 20.,000.,000 Reduced benefits at age 60............... .. .. .... 1.65.,000,000 ./185,,000 Benefits for people aged 72 and over with limited periods in coveredwork................. 110.,000,000 355,000 Improvements inbenefits for children: Benefits for children to age 22 if 195.,000,00 295.,000 Broadened definition of \"hl\"........ .. 10,000.,000 disability provisions: Change in definition..... 9 .. 110,000,00 60,000 Liberalized requirements for benefits additional benefit payments...9..... *2.,320.,000j,000 ~/No long-range cost to the system because the benefits are actuarially reduced. ?/ Number affected in 1966; modification does not become effective until then. II -11 E. Financing of Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Amendments The old-age, survivors, and disability insurance provisions of' the bill are financed by (1) an increase in the earnings base from $4f,800 to $6,600, effective January 1, 1966, and (2) a revised tax rate schedule. The revised tax rate schedule provided by the bill for the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program follows: Year Emuployer-employee rate Self-employed rate (each) 1966 3.85% 5.8% 3.9 5.9 1969-72 4f.4 6.6 1973 and after 4i.85 7.0 An additional 0.20 percent of taxable wages and 0.15 percent of taxable self-employment income will be allocated to the disability insur\u00ad ance trust fund, bringing the total allocation to 0.70 percent of wages and 0.525 percent of self-employment income beginning in 1966. 7/21/65 III. WELFARE AMENDMENTS A. Improvement and Extensi.)n of Kerr-Mills Program 1. Purpose and -scope In order to provide a more effective Kerr-Mills program and to extend its provisions to other needy persons, the bill establishes a single and separate medical care program to replace the differing provisions for the needy which currently are found in five titles of the Social Security Act. The new title (XIX) extends the advantages of an expanded medical assistance program not only to the aged who are indigent but also to needy individuals on the dependent children, blind, and permanently and totally disabled programs and to persons who would qualify under those programs if in sufficient financial need. Other medically needy children may also be included. Inclusion of the medically indigent aged is optional with the States but if they are included, comparable groups of blind, disabled, and parents and children must also be included if they need help in meeting necessary medical costs. Moreover, the amount and scope of benefits for the medically indigent can not be greater than that of recipients on the cash assistance programs. The old provisions of law in the various public assistance titles of the act providing vendor medical assistance terminate upon the adoption of the new program by a State but no later than December 31, 1969. 2. Scope of medical assistance Under the old provisions, the State had to provide \"som~e institutional and noninstitutilonal'car6\" under the medical assistance for the aged program. There are no minimum benefit requirements at all under the other public assistance vendor medical programs. The bill requires that by July 1, 1967, for the new program a State must provide inpatient hospital services, outpatient hospital services, other laboratory and X-ray services, skilled nursing home services for individuals 21 and over, and physicians services (whether furnished in the office, the patient's home, a hospital, or a skilled nursing home) in order to receive Federal participation in vendor medical payments. Other items of medical service are optional with the States. 3. Eligibility The bill makes improvements in the program for the needy III-2 elderly by requiring that the States provide a flexible income test which takes into account medical expenses and does not provide rigid income standards which arbitrarily deny assistance to people with large medical bills. In the same spirit the bill provides that no deductible, cost sharing, or similar charge may be imposed by the State as to hospitalization under its program and that any such charge on other medical services must be reasonably related to the recipient's income or resources. Also important is the requirement that elderly needyr people on the State programs be provided assistance to meet the deductibles that are imposed by the new basic program of hospital insurance. Also where a portion of any deductible or cost sharing under either program is met by a State program it must be done in a manner reasonably related to the individual's income and resources. No income can be imputed to an individual unless actually available; and the financial responsibility of an individual for an applicant may be taken into account only if the applicant is the individual's spouse or child who is under age 21 or blind or disabled. Ii.Increased Federal matching The Federal share of medical assistance expenditures under the new program is determined upon a uniform formula with no maximum on the amount of expenditures which are subject-to participation.. This currently is done for the medical assistance for the aged program. The Federal share, which varies in relation to a State's per capita income, is increa.sed over current medical assistance for the agedi matching so that States at the national average receive 55 percent rather than 50 percent, and States at the lowest level receive as much as 83 percent as contrasted with 80 percent under existing law. In order to receive any additional Federal funds as a result of expenditures under the new program, the States -need to continue their own expenditures at their present rate. For a specified period, no State would receive less in Federal funds than under current provisions of law because of the new formula and any State that did not reduce its own expenditures would be assured of at least a 5-percent increase in Federal participation in medical care expenditures. As to compensation and training of professional medical personnel, the bill provides a 75-percent Federal share as compared with the 50--50 Federal-State sharing for other administrative expenses. 5.Administration The program can be administered by any State agency established or designated for the purpose but the law requires that eligibility be determined by the welfare agency. The bill specifically provides as a State plan requirement that cooperative agreements be entered into with State agencies providing health services and vocational III-3 rehabilitation services looking toward maximum utilization of these services in the provision of medical assistance under the plan. 6.Effective date January 1, 1966. 7. Cost It is estimated that the new program will increase the Federal Government's contribution about $200 million in a full year of operation over that in the programs operated under existing law. B. Child Health Program Amendments 1. Maternal and -chld health, crippled children, and child welfare services The bill increases the amount authorized for maternal and child health services over current authorizations by $5million for fiscal year 1966 and by $10 million in each succeeding fiscal year, as follows: Fiscal year Existing children's services and child welfare services are increased to the same amounts. Such increases will assist the States, in all these programs, in moving toward the goal of extending services with a view of making them available to children in all parts of the State by July 1, 1975. 2. Crippled children-trai-ning personnel The bill also authorizes $5 million for the fiscal year 1967, $10 million for fiscal 1968, and $17.5 million for each succeeding fiscal year to be for grants to institutions of higher learning for training professional personnel for health and related care of crippled children, particularly mentally retarded children 'With multiple handicaps. 3.Health care for -needy -children A new provision is added authorizing the Secretary of Health, III.-I' Education, and Welfare to carry out a 5-year program of special project grants to provide comprehensive health care and services for children of school age, or for preschool children, particularly in areas with concentrations of low-income families. The grants are to State health agencies, to the State agencies adminis\u00ad tering the crippled children's program, to any school of medicine (with appropriate participation by a school of dentistry), and any teaching hospital affiliated with such school, to pay not to exceed 75 percent of the cost of the project. Projects -will provide screening, diagnosis, preventive services, treatment, correction of defects, and aftercare,, including dental services, for children in low-income families. An appropriation of $15 million is authorized for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966; $35 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1967; $4i0 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1968; $14.5 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969; and $50 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970. 4. Mental retardation planning This title authorizes granwts -totaling $2,750,000 for each of 2 fiscal years--the fiscal year ending June 30, 1966, and fiscal yearending June 30., 1967. The grants will be available during the year for which the appropriation is authorized and during the succeedingfiscal year. They are for the purpose of assisting States to imple\u00ad ment and followup on plans and other steps to combat mental retardation authorized under section 1701 of the Social Security Act. 5.Health study A health study of children's emotional illness is authorized. C. Public Assistance Amendments 1.Increased assistance payments The Federal share of payments under all State public assistance programs is increased a little more than an average of $2.50 a month for the needy aged, blind, and disabled and an average of about $1.25 for needy children, effective January 1, 1966. This is brought about by revising the matching formula for the needy aged, blind, and disabled (and for the adult categories in title XVI) to provide a Federal share of $31 out of the first $37 (now twenty-nine thirty-fifths of the first $35) up to a maximum of $75 (now $70) per month per individual on an average basis. Revises matching formula for aid to families with dependent children so as to provide a Federal share of five-sixths of the first $18 (now fourteen-seventeenths of the first $17) up to a maximum of $32 (now $30). A provision is included so that States will 111-5 not receive additional Federal funds except to the ext'ent they pass them on to individual recipients. Effective January 1, 1966. Cost: About $150 million a year. 2. Tuberculous and mental patients. The bill removes the exclusion from Federal matching in old-jage assist\u00ad ance and-medical assistance for the aged programs (and for zombined program, title XVI) as to aged individuals who are patients in institutions for tuberculosis or mental diseases or who have been diagnosed as having tuberculosis or psychosis and, as a result, are patients in a medical institution. It requires as a condition of Fedgral participation in such payments to., or for, mental patients certain agreements and arrangements to assure that better care results from the additional Federal money. It provides that States will receive no more in Federal funds under this provision than they increase their expenditures for mental health purposes under public healthl and public welfare programs. Also it removes restrictions as to Federal matching for needyr blind and disabled who are tubercular or psychotic and are in general~medical institutions. Effective January 1, 1966. Cost: About $75 million a year. 3. Protective payments-to third persons The bill adds a provision for protective payments~to third-persoas on behalf off recipients of old-age assistance,, aid to the blind, aid to the permanently and totally disabled (and recipients on combined title XVI program) unable to manage their money because of physical or mental incapacity. Effective January 1, 1966. 4~. Earnings exemption under old-age assistance The bill increases the e~arnings e~xempticjn und~er old-age assistance (and t4he aged in combine~d program) so that 'a Sta~te may, at its option, exempt the first $20 (now $10) and one-half of the next $60 (now $40.)of a recipient's monthly earnings. Effective October 1., 1965. Cost: About $1 million first year. 5. Exemption of children'-s earnings Up to $50 of earnings per child per month but not more than $150 in the same family may be exempted in determining need. The amendment is wholly permissive with the States. Effective July 1, 1965. 6. Exemption-of earnings and resources of disabled persons Recipients of APTD may have the same exemption of earnings as is provided under old-age assistance and the same exemption of income and resources if they are under an approved rehabilitation plan that is now provided for the blind. This amendment is also wholly permissive with the States. Effective October 1, 1965. III -6 7. Definition of medical assistance for aged The bill modifies the definition of medical assistance for the aged-so as to aflow Federal sharing as to old-age assistance recipients for the month they are admitted to or discharged fran a medical institution. Effective July 1, 1965. Cost: About $2 million. 8. Retroactive benefit increase The bill adds a provision which allows the States to disregard so much of the OASDI benefit increase as is attributable to its retroactive effective date. 9. Economic Opportunity Act earnings exemption The bill also provides a grace period for action by States that have not had regular legislative sessions, whose public assistance statutes now prevent them from disregarding earnings of recipients received under the Economic Opportunity Act. 10. School attendance for AFDC children The definition of a school in which an AFDC child may receive aid at the State's option between the ages of 18 and 21 is broadened to include colleges. 11. Exemption of income UP to $5per recipient per month of any income may be exempted under any of the Federally-aided public assistance programs in addition to exemption of earnings. 12. Judicial review Judicial review of the Secretary's decision with respect to State public assistance plans is provided. 13. Alternative formula for Federal participation Any State, at its option, after adopting Title XIX (Medical Assistance) may clai'm Federal participation in its money payments under the same formula provided under Title XIX instead of under the different formulas in the other public assistance titles. 7/21/65 LISTING OF REFERENCE MATERIALS 89th Congress, first session, 1965 The Status of the Social Security Program and Recommendations for Its Improvement, A Report of the Advisory Council on Social Security--January 1, 1965 Vital and Health Statistics Data from the National Health Survey, National Center for Health Statistics, Series 10, Number 16, Health Insurance-- type of insuring organization and multiple coverage--United States--July 62-June 63, USDHEW, PHS--April 1965 U.S. Congress.

The amendment is as follows: On the first page, line 4, strike out \"228(e)\" and insert \"228b(e)\". EXPLANATION OF THE BILL This bill amends section 2(e) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937to ofa railroad employee to receive a spouse's ermt te sous annutyndertha secionconcurrently with the receipt of social secuityor etiemet benefits earned in her own right with\u00ad ailrad outredctin n te sous'sannuity. Under existing law, social securtyand raira retieet benefits received by the spouse in her on right are deducted from her railroad retirement spouse's benefits. The bill will benefit approximately 41,000 spouses; 40,000 of whom are soeial security beneficiaries, and 1,000 of whom are railroad retirement beneficiaries. A similar bill, H.R. 12362, was reported favorably by this com\u00ad mittee on August 14, 1964 (H. Rept. No. 1807, 88th Cong.), and passed unanimously by the House on September 3, 1964, but the Senate adjourned before taking final action on the measure. Many bills to the same general effect have been introduced in Congress in *recent years. Other bills having a similar purpose have been intro\u00ad 85-OW 2 SPOUSES' ANNUITIES UNDER RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT duced in this session. Mr. Poff, Mr. Beckw.orth, Mr. Ashley, Mr. Blroyhill of North Carolina, and Mr. Mathias have respectively introduced, The. bill amends section 2(e) of the Railroad Retirement Act by removing provisions which require that the annuity of a spouse be -reduced by. the amount of certain benefits -under the Social. Seeurity Act for which she is eligible and certain annuities under the Railroad Retirement Act. The reduction is by the amount of any, benefit for which the spouse is eligible under the Social Security Act except a. wife's or husband's benefit. Further in tlhe case of social security benefits- the reduction is confined to the -amount, if any, -by..wbith the other benefit exceeds in amount, the wife's or husband's benefit to which the spouse would be entitled but for section 202(k) of the Social Security Act (sec. 202(k) in effect provides that an individuaJ. can be paid only the highest benefit to which he or she is entitled under the Social Security Act). Railroad retirement afinuities which re\u00ad quire a reduction are Any annuity, to which the spouse is eligible based on her own railroad employment and an annuity as a parent of a deceased employee. The bill also applies to spouses' annuities, which have been paid in a single sum equal to the commuted value of the annuity. How\u00ad ever, the amount of the annuity which was paid on a commuted value basis is not to be included in payments to be made because of the bill. The cost of the bill is estimated at $14 million a year on a level basis, which will he. paid out of the railroad retirement account. EXISTING LAW Under existing law, any person who is entitled to railroad retire\u00ad ment benefits whether as an annuitant or. as a survivor of a railroad employee, who is also entitled to social security -benefits based upon his own wage record, may, with one exception, draw full benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, and -full benefits under the Social Security Act, without reduction. The one exception in the fore\u00ad going statement involves women who are entitled to an, annuity -as.the spouse of a retired rail-road employee. Under the third proviso-of sec\u00ad tion 2(e) -Railroad Retirement Act of deductions are mnade from the annuity paid to -thespouse of any railroad employee until -the deductions equal the-total of social security benefits to which she is entitled in her own right. If, however, a women entitled to a spouise's annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 is also entitled to social security benefits as a wife, because of social security wage credits earned by her husband in employment not covered by the Railroad Retirement Act, she may receive fu~ll benefits under both acts. A retired railroad employee who is eligible for social.- security benefits; either based on his. own social security wage. record, or as a survivor, based upon another individual's wage record, may draw full railroad retirement benefits and full: social security benefits without reduction. A.further illustration of the inequity involved in the present provi~ sions of section 2(e) arises out of the different treatment provided the SPOUSES' ANNUITIES UNDER RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT 3 souse of a railroad employee and the widow of a railroad employee. A widow may receive survivor benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act concurrently with any social security benefits to which she is entitled based on her own wage record,. without reduction in railroad retirement benefits; however, the spouse of a living railroad worker has her benefits reduced by social security benefits which she has earned 'based on her own emprloyment. In other words, while her husband is alive, the spouse of a retired railroad employee receives a spouse's benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, reduced by social security benefits which she has earned based on her own wage record; yet, upon the death of her husband she becomes entitled to draw railroad retirement benefits as a widow, and full social security benefits based on her own wage record, without any reduction. The committee feels that this discriminatory treatment, applicable only to the spouses of retired railroad employees, is not warranted, and recommends that this legislation be adopted. JUSTIFICATION FOR THE BILL At one time an employee's annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act was reduced because of his eligibility for a primary benefit under the Social Security Act. The reduction was by the amount of his annuity which was derived from his railroad service rendered before 1937 or the amount of the social security benefit, whichever produced a lesser reduction. Also, a widow's annuity was subject to a reduction because of her rights to a primar benefit under the Social Security Act or an annuity under thie Railroad Retirement Act based on her own railroad service. All of these reduction requirements have long since been removed, the last having been removed in 1955. Thus the spouse's annuity is the only annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act which cannot be paid in full where the spouse has rights to other benefits. The elimination by the bill of the requirement for reduction of a spouse's annuity is but a logical sequence to the other eliminations. It is of some significance to point out that the annuity of a spouse is not adversely affected by retirement income from other sources that she may have even though it is substantial, such as from the civil service retirement system .or from any of various other retirement plans. The committee is, of course, cognizant of the fact that the railroad retirement system must be maintained in a sound financial condition. It has considered carefully the circumstance that the bill would entail added costs to the system of an estimated $14 million a year or 0.32 percent of taxable payroll and increase the existing deficiency In financing Of $19.5 million a year or 0.44 percent of taxable payrol to almost $33 million a year or to about 0.76 percent of taxable payroll. The committee has been informed that a deficit of 0.50 percent or less is well within the range of actuarial tolerance for a system of the size and character of the railroad retirement system. The slight excess above this that the bill would bring about- is, in the committee's opiniion, not dangerous. The committee strongly believes that the considerations in favor of the removal of this discriminatory provision are so compelling as to warrant enactment of the bill despite the relatively small costs it would entail. As compared with the total costs of the railroad retirement 4 SPOUSES' ANNUITIES UNDER RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT system the costs of the bill would not be of major significance, partic\u00ad ularly in light of the purpose to be served. AGENCY REPORTS RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD, Hon. OREN HARRIS, Ciao l. p- 6 95 Chairman, Committ*ee on Inter8tate and Foreign Commerce, Rayburn Houee Office Building, Waehington, D.C. DEAR MR. HARRIS: This is the report of the Railroad Retirement Board on the bill H.R. 3157, which you introduced on January 19, 1965, and the bill H.R. 6296, introduced by Mr. Broyhill on March 15, 1965. The bills are identical. The bills would amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 by repealing the present provision in section 2(e) of the act which re\u00ad quires the reduction of a spouse's annuity by the amount of the spouse's own insurance benefit under the Social Security Act (except for a wife's or husband's insurance benefit) and by the amount of an annuity under section 2 (a) or 5(d) of the Railroad Retirement Act for which the spouse is eligible. The change would be effective with respect to spouses' annuities accruing in months after the month of enactment of the bill. The amendment would apply to annuities paid in lump sums equal to their commuted value because of a reduc\u00ad tion under section 2 (e) of the act as now in effect. It is estimated that the additional costs of the amendment proposed by the bills would come to approximately 0.32 percent of taxable payrlo $14 million a year, on a level basis. Of this, 0 .30 percentof taxable arolr$3mlinaya would be attributable to the removal of the reduction because of social security benefits, and 0.01 percent of taxable payroll or $400,000 a year to the removal of the reduction because of railroad retirement benefits. There is now an actuarial deficit in the financing of the railroad retirement system of approximately 0.44 percent of taxable payroll, or $19.5 million a year, on a level basis. Enactment of either of the bills would increase this actuarial deficiency to approximately 0.76 percent of taxable payroll, or $33.5 million 'a year.1 The Board is opposed to the bills for the folowing reasons: (1) The bills mnake no provision for additional revenue to meet the increase in the costs of benefits which the bills would provide. Even if it were considered feasible to provide for additional revenue in an amount sufficient to cover the added costs of the bills, the Board's position would not change for new income could better be used for improvements in other areas where the need seems greater. (2) The present provision in section 2(e) of the Railroad Retirement Act for reducing a spouse's annuity by the amount of the spouse's own benefit under the Social Security Act is the same, in principle, as the provision in the Social Security Act for reducing a wife's benefit under that act by the amount of such wife's primary benefit under that act. In view of the reduction in a wife's benefit, the reduction of the spouse's annuity under section 2(e) of the act is only in the 'The slight ineonslstencies between figures ure due to rouinding procedures. 5 SPOUSES' ANqNUITIES UNDER RAILROAD RETIREMEINT ACT amount, if any, by which her benefit under the Social Security Act exceeds th wife's benefit under that act to which she would be entitled except for her other benefit. (3) More than one of five women entitled to spouses' benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act are also entitled to primary old-age benefits under the Social Security Act (a total of about 40,000 spouses whose benefits were either reduced or eliminated), and the costs to the railroad retirement system for the nonreduction proposed by th~e bill now and for the future would be about $14 million a year, as previously *etated. The Social Security Act does not require a reduction in a wife's -benefit by the amount of her retirement annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act; however, there are only about 1,000 of the 2,800,000 women entitled to a wife's benefit under the Social Security Act who -are also entitled to an employee annuity under the Railroad Retire\u00ad ment Act, and by reason of the financial interchange between the two systems, the loss to the social security system for this nonreduction is -zero. The railroad retirement account thus absorbs the cost of the failure to reduce the wife's benefit under the Social Security Act by the -amount of her railroad retirement annuity. The estimated cost to the railroad retirement account from this absorption is 0.01 percent ~of taxable payroll, or $500,000 a year. (4) Before the 1951 amendments to the Railroad Retirement Act, there was no provision in that act for a spouse's annuity. The reason for providing a spouse's annuity by such amendments is stated in the -Senate committee report (S. Rept. No. 890, 82d Cong., Ist sess., -p.17) as follows: \"If the finances were adequate to permit doing all-the other things that need to be done and also to increase all retirement annuities by, -say, 65 percent, one might well consider that as an alternative to pro\u00ad viding a spouse's annuity. But since such a course is obviously out of the question, the spouse's annuity affords a means of doing sub\u00ad stantially that in cases of greatest need; i.e., where two adult and aged people rather than just one must live on the annuity. \" The provision for a spouse's annuity was, therefore, in substitution -for an increase in employee annuities in cases where two persons had -to live largely on the income from the one annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act. For this very reason, the 1951 amendments pro\u00ad vided that where a spouse has an income from a railroad retirement -annuity or a social security benefit, the spouse's annuity would not ,be paid except to the extent by which it exceeds such annuity or benefit. (5) There is a general misunderstanding about the purchase of a spoue's annuity through railroad retirement taxes. A railroad em\u00ad ployese with a wife entitled to a spouse's annuity paid no more in taxes than he would have paid if he had no such wife. A Spouse's annuity is no more purchased than is a wife's benefit under the Social Security Act; yet a wife's benefit under that act is reduced by the amount of her own primary benefit. In view of the foregoing, the Board recommends that the bills H.R. 3157 and H.R. 6296 not be reported favorably by your committee. The Bureau of the Budget has no objection to the presentation of this report from the standpoint of the administration's program. Sincrelyors, HOWARD W.

Chairman, Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, House of Representatives, Washin gton, D.C. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This letter is in response to your request of February 15, 1965, for a report on H.R. 3157, a bill to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 to eliminate the provisions which reduce the annuities of the spouses of retired employees by the amount of certain monthly benefits. The bill would delete the provision of the Railroad Retirement Act which requires that a spouse's annuity under the railroad program be reduced by the amount of any benefit which the spouse is eligible to receive under the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance proa. gram, other than a wife's or husband's insurance benefit, and by the amount of any retirement annuity, or parent's insurance annuity, which the spouse is eligible to receive under the railroad retirement program. The amendment would be effective for months after the month of enactment. The deletion of. these reduction provisions of the railroad law would have no. effect on the benefit payments made under the old-age, suv\u00ad vivors, and disability insurance program, or on the operation of the. present provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act which require cost adjustments between the railroad retirement and old-age, sur\u00ad vivors, and disability insurance program~s. The question as to whether to abandon these reduction provisions involves a matter of 7 SPOUSES' ANNUITIES UNDER RAILROAD RETIEMENT ACT railroad retirement policy, and we defer to the Railroad Retirement Board's position on the bill.

Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from New York has ade- quately explained this legislation, (Mr. YOUNGER asked and was given permission to extend his remarks at this Point in the RECORD.) Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. Speaker', the rail- road retirement fund has been.the sub- ject of great concern for some time.. It has been unable to maintain itself on an actuarial basis. The last Congress managed to *get agreement from both management and labor to some basic changes which would eventually bail it out. Many suggestions have been made over the Years for liberalization of pay- ments to retirees and the conditions un- der which they could qualify. All of these have been bypassed because oftjheir disastrous effect on the fund itself. Today we have before us. a proposal to liberalize the provisions under which -the spouse's annuity -may be paid to the wife of a retiree. It is a very small, al- most insignificant change from the standpoint of the tmoney involved-small enough so that It can safely be consid- ered without further jeopardizing the fund itself. On the other hand, it cor- recta what has been recognized by the committee, and last year by the Congress itself, as a gross inequity, As it now stands, the wife of a retiree must forgo her right to the spouse's an- nuity if she has acquired in her own right social security payments in an amount as great as the annuity. On the face of it, it seems unfair and It seems more so when we discover that this is the only incidence in the Federal law which results in this situation. It is well understood that sweeping liberalization of the railroad retirement fund is not possible, even though there is much that might be said in favor of It. We should, however, correct this glar- ingly unfair provision and thereby make -it possible for the spouse to retain those payments which she has earned by her Own endeavors without penalizing her merely because her husband happens to have been covered under the Railroad Retirement Act, rather than some other pension or retirement system, I recommend that the House again ac- cept these provisions and pass H.R. 3157. Mr. POFF. Mr. Speaker, will the gen- tleman yield? Mr. YOUNGER. I will be very happy to yield to the gentleman from Virginia, who has been a longtime proponent of this legislation over a period of years and one of its strongest advocates, Mr. POFF. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation. (Mr. POFF asked and was given per- mission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr' POF'F. Mr. Speaker, in support of H.R. 3157, similar to H.R. 651 which I introduced on the first day of the 89th Congress, I will be brief. This is be- cause the bill itself is brief, the subject matter is brief, and the justification is brief. in -fact, the justification can be stated in one word-fairness, No. 102--3 At one -time, the Railroad Retirement Act carried a dual benefits restriction against all classes of beneficiaries. None were permitted to draw the full amount of railroad retirement benefits if they were also entitled to social security bene- fits. Under the equitable doctrine that what one pays for one should receive, these restrictions, one by one, were stricken from the act. Today, all have been repealed but one, the one which applies to beneficiaries who are wives or husbands of retired railroad workers. This legislation would repeal this last restriction, The restriction against railroad spouses is the rankest sort of discrimination, de- fying the most artful rationalization, Why should a man or women who hap- pens to -be-the husband or wife of a rail- road worker be treated differently than a spouse of another worker? The same social security taxes have been paid in the two cases. If one is to receive less benefits than the other, then why should his taxes not be less? H.R. 3157 elimii- nates this discrimination by guarantee- Ing that when payments are made into two separate retirement systems, benefits will be forthcoming from both systems. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3157 is similar to H.R. 12362 which passed the House last year but which died in the Senate when the Congress adjourned. According to the actuaries, the deficit involved is only thirty-two hundredths of 1 percent of taxable payroll. While this legislation provides no tax increases to provide ad\u00additional revenue to the fund, I agree with the statement in the unanimous bipar- tisan committee 'report last year that \"the equities involved in this legislation are sufficiently compelling to justify the Small added costs to the railroad retire- ment system.\" Mr. Speaker, passage of this bill early this year will give the other body ample tibe to act upon it before the 89th Con\u00ad gress adjourns. I congratulate the chairman and members of the great Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. Mr. BROYHILL of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Mr. YOUNGER. I will be glad to Yield to the gentleman from North Carolina, who is also a champion of this legislation and has introduced bills on this under his own-name, Mr. BROYHILL of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. This bill will amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 to re- move a serious defect in the act. This amendment will permit the husband or wife of a railroad employee to receive a spouse's annuity under the--Railroad Re- tirement Act at the same time he or she is receiving social security benefits earned in his or her own right. These benefits would be received without any reduction in the annuity as is the case under present law, I have had several -letters from wives of railroad employees telling me that they have worked hard and paid their social security tax with the belief they were investing in security for their old age. Then on retirement, they find, that Just because their husband is drawing a pension under railroad retirement. that they cannot receive full social se\u00ad curity benefits. Many of them, who re\u00ad call the sacrifices made to pay social security taxes while they worked, are inclined to highly question this legal technicality in the law. This inequity in the law has been brought bef ore the Interstate and For\u00ad eign Commerce Committee several times in the past 10 years. I am proud to serve as a member of this committee and wish to commend the committee for its prompt consideration of this legislation in this 89th Congress. My bill, H.R. 6296, is similar to H.R. 3157 introduced by the chairman of the full committee, Mr. IHjRuis. When this legislation was con\u00ad sidered by the committee, I made the motion that the chairman's bill, H.R. 3157, be reported to the House, and was gratified that this motion carried by a unanimous vote. I urge the adoption of this bill, hope that it will pass by an overwhelming vote and have early consideration in the other body.

Mr. O'BRIEN. I yield to the gentle\u00ad man from Arkansas. Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I thought perhaps it would be wise to elaborate briefly on the cost features of the bill as was explained by our distinguished col\u00ad league from New York [Mr. O'BRIEN]. Throughout the years of my service in the Congress and on the committee, I have been a strong advocate of keeping the railroad retirement fund on a sound basis. This is imperative. It is abso\u00ad lutely necessary. We had to take into consideration this fundamental policy in -the consideration of correcting the in\u00ad equity which is involved in this legisla\u00ad tion. As Mr. O'BRIEN mentioned a moment ago, this legislation would cost the fund approximately $14 million. Currently the fund is running a deficit of $19 1/2million a year or .44 percent of taxable payroll. This would make the total deficiency about $33 million a year or .76 percent of taxable payroll. I realize that this,- is getting close to the point of being beyond the limits of actuarial tolerance for a sound railroad retirement program. During the years there has been some difference of opinion among the actuaries as to what tolerance 12178 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE June 7, 1965 should be accepted to maintain a sound believe this bill is much needed and Krebs Patman Sisk etmaeIstattus te Ohe bo wllactfaoralyL auirdk Pepper Smith, Iowaif the fund is considered to be deficient upon it as soon as possible.

Calendar No. 627 89TH CONGRESS SENATE REPORT 1st S'e8sio'r No. 645 AMENDING THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT OF 1937 AND THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT TAX ACT AUGUST 25, 1965.-Ordered to be printed Mr. PELL, from the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, submitted the following REPORT [To accompany H~.R. 3157] The Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, to which was referred the bill (H.R. 3157) to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, to eliminate the provisions which reduce the annuities of the spouses of retired employees by the amount of certain monthly benefits, having considered the same, repo-rts favorably thereon with amendments and recommends that the bil as amended do pass. PURPOSE OF THE BILL The purpose of H.R. 3157 (as here reported) is (1) to eliminate the provisions which reduce the annuities of the spouses of retired em\u00ad ployees by the amount of certain monthly benefits; and (2) to increase the maximum creditable and taxable monthly compensation base under the Railroad Retirement Act and Railroad Retirement Tax Act from the present $450 to (i) $450, or (ii) an amount equal to one- twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable \"wages\" as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, whichever is greater, for any calendar month after the month in which this act is enacted. EXPLANATION OF THE BILL The bill would amend section 2(e) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 to permit the spouse of a railroad employee to receive a spouse's annuity under that section concurrently with the receipt of social security or railroad retirement benefits earned in the spouse's own right without reduction in the spouse's annuity. Under existing law, any person who is entitled to railroad retirement benefits (whether as an employee annuitant or as a survivor of a 50-010-05--i 2 AMENDING THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT OF 1937 railroad employee) who is also entitled to social security benefits based upon his own wage record, may, with one exception, draw full benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act, and full benefits under the Social Security Act, without reduction. The one exception is a person entitled to an annuity as the spouse of a retired railroad employee. Under the third proviso of section 2(e) of the Railroad Retirement Act, deductions are made from the annuity paid to the spouse of any railroad employee until the deductions equal the total .of social security -or railroad retirement benefits to which the spouse 'is entitled in his or her own right, except that the reduction is only in the amount, if any, by which the spouse's primary benefit under the Social Security Act exceeds such spouse's wife's or husband's benefit to which he or she would be entitled but for the primary benefit. The annuity of a spouse must, under existing law, also be reduced by the amount of an annuity to which such spouse is entitled as a parent under the Railroad Retirement Act, and by the amount of any social security benefit derived from other than such spouse's own employment to which such spouse is entitled, except a wife's or husband's benefit; the bill would also eliminate the requirement for this reduction. A retired railroad employee who is eligible for social security benefits, either based on his own social security wage record, or as a survivor, based upon another individual's wage record, may draw full railroad retirement benefits and full social security benefits without reduction. A further illustration of the inequity involved in the present pro\u00ad visions of section 2(e) arises out of the different treatment provided the spouse of a railroad employe e and the widow or widower of a railroad, employee. A widow or widower may reIceive survivor benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act _concurrently with any social security benefits to which she. or he is entitled based on her or his own wage record, without reduction in railroad retirement benefits; however, the spouse of a living railroad worker has his or her benefits reduced by social security benefits which the spouse has earned based on his or hier own employment. In other words, while the retired railroad employee is alive, the spouse of such employee receives a spouse's benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act reduced by social security benefits which the spouse has earned based on his or her own wage record;' yet,, upon the death of such employee, the spouse is able to draw railroad retirement benefits as a widow or widower and full social'security benefits .based on his or her own wage record, without any reduction. The bill would benefit approximately 41,000 spouses; 40,000 of whom are social security beneficiaries, and 1,000, of whom are railroad beneficiaries. About 134,000 remaining spouses' annuities would not be affected. NECESSITY FOR AMENDMENT There. is now* an actuarial deficit in the financ Ing of the railroad retirement system' of about,$20 'million a year, and Public Law 89-97 (approved July, 30, 1965) will add about $28 million to the deficit, bringing it to a total of about $48 million a year on a level basis. The enactment of the bill 1I.R. 3157 would add to this deficit about $14 million, a year, briiiging the total deficit to about $62 million a year on a level basis. The increase in the deficit which would result from the enactment of Public Law 89-97, would come abotit chiefly'from in\u00adAMENDING THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT OF 1937 3 creases in maximum annuities to spouses and in annuities computed under the social security minimum provision of the'Railroad Retire\u00ad ment Act. An increase in the deficit to about $62 million a year would obviously confront the railroad-retirement system with serious financial problems. The amendment would solve these problems by increasing the rail\u00ad road retirement monthly maximum taxable compensation base to an amount equa to one-twelfth of the maximum annual social security taxable- wage base; that is, from 'the present $450 a month to $550 which is one-twelfth of the maximum social security creditable and taxable base of $6,600 a year. By reason of such increase in the taxable compensation base, the railroad retirement taxable payroll would be about $4.8 billion a year, and the additional tax income to the system would be. about $87 million a year. About $39 million of this amount would be applied to reducing the $62 million deficit to about $23 million. This deficit, however, would be increased to $24 million because the tax base for the health'insurance program under the railroad retirement system is on a monthly rather than an annual basis. This $24 million deficit represents only about one- half of 1 percent of the new taxable payroll and is considered to be within actuarial tolerance'so that the system would be considered financially sound. The remaining $48 million of additional tax income would be used to increase the annuities of an estimated 487,000 employees who would earn more than $450 a month and upon whom would fall the burden of' paying the additional tax resulting from the increased base; those employees (of whom, there are about 277,000) whose monthly earnings will be $450 or less, will pay no additional taxes by reason of the increased base, and would receive no increase in their annuities by reason thereof.' It is imotant to emphasize that except for a relatively short period in ithe late 1950's the railroad retirement maximum monthly tax base has always equaled or exceeded the social security equivalent monthly taxable wages. In fact, the maximum railroad retirement tax base now is $450 a month (equivalent of $5,400 a year) while the maximum social security taxable wage base is now only $4,800 a year. The amendment would increase the railroad retirement tax base to an amount equivalent to the social security tax base; that is, the maximum monthly railroad retirement creditable and taxable base would be equal to one-twelfth of the maximum annual social security creditable and taxable base. The effect of this would be that any increase in the tax base for social security purposes would auto\u00ad matically result in an increase in the tax base for railroad retirement purposes to one-twelfth of the annual social security base as increased. It is also important to emphasize that when the railroad retirement system was established in 1937, 98 percent of the gross railroad payroll was taxable on a $300 monthly maximum; but only 79 -percent of the gross payroll is now taxable on the present $450 monthly limit; and by increasing the monthly limit to $550, only 87.7 percent of the gross payroll will be taxable-about 10 percentage points lower than was the case when the system was first established. INumber of employees in June 1965 distributed in accordance with earnings' patterns In an average month in 1963 is as follows: Under $450 a month, and more, 273,000; total-764,000. Distribution of employees according to their earnings tn the entire year would differ from the above because many employees have earnings over a specified limit in only part of the months they work. 4 AMENDING THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT OF 1937 Further, under section 5(k) (2) of the Railroad Retirement Act, the social security system, in effect, charges the railroad retirement system with the social security taxes that would be paid on the social security maximum taxable wage base on railroad service the same as if such service were taxable under the social security system, and credits the railroad retirement system with the benefts that would be paid under the social security system if railroad service were covered under that system. Consequently, if the maximum railroad retire\u00ad ment mnonthly taxable base is allowed to remain lower than the equivalent social security maximum taxable wage base, the railroad retirement system would be charged with taxes on a higher base than the base on which railroad retirement taxes are collected. Aside from placing the railroad retirement system in a sound financial condition, the amendment would also increase the annuities of employees who will have paid taxes on the higher maximum. Generally speaking, for each year that the employee pays taxes on the increased base of $550 a month, the additional tax by reason of such increase would be about $100. For this extra cost the employee's annuity would be increased by $1.67 a month, or about $20 a year for each such year. Assume that an employee retires at age 65, in January 1967, after paying about $100 in additional taxes. At the time of his retirement his life expectancy is about 13 years. Since he will receive about $20 a year more in annuities than he would other\u00ad wise have received, his total return for the $100 extra taxes would be about $260 (13 times $20). If he has 2 such years, the total additional taxes would be about $200 and his total return in additional annuities would be about $520 ($260 times 2). Whatever he pays in additional taxes in 1, 2, or more years, he will recover in about 5 years after retirement. Another consideration for the amendment is a provision in Public Law 89-97. This provision confers upon the Railroad Retirement Board the authority to administer the hospital insurance program for railroad retirement beneficiaries. Such authority, however, is con\u00ad tingent upon the monthly taxable base for railroad retirement pur\u00ad poses being equal to one-twelfth of the annual taxable social security wage base. The Board can assume such jurisdiction at the same time that the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare assumes jurisdiction for hospital insurance benefits for all other employees (January 1, 1966), only if the legislation to increase the railroad re\u00ad tirement monthly taxable base, as provided in the amendment, is in effect not later than October 1, 1965, even though the actual increase in the taxable base would not be effective before January 1, 1966. It is, of course, far more preferable that the Railroad Retirement Board administer the hospital insurance program for railroad retire\u00ad ment beneficiaries from the beginning of the program rather than start 1 year later. Unless such legislation (the amendment) is effective on or before October 1, 1965, the Board's administration of the program would be delayed at least until January 1, 1967. The effect of this would be to confuse railroad retirement beneficiaries who would be eligible for hospital insurance benefits and who, for the past 30 years, have been accustomed to looking to the Railroad Retirement Board for the administration of all their benefit programs. Moreover, such delay would result in serious administrative difficulties to both the Railroad Retirement Board and the Secretary of Health, Educa\u00ad tion, and Welfare. AMENDING THE RAILROAD RETIREMENTr ACT OF 1937 5 The propriety and reasonableness of the amendment is shown also by the pertinent fact that it adopts exactly the same financing method employed by the Congress when it enacted Public Law 89-97. To provide the necessary funds for the benefits (other than hospitaliza\u00ad tion benefits) the Congress provided for an increase in the ultimate social security tax rates from 4.625 percent of payroll to an ultimate 4.85 percent of payroll-an increase of only 0.225 percent, but at the same time provided for increasing the maximum social security taxable base by $1,800 a year (from $4,800 to $6,600). Under existing law, the increase in the ultimate social security tax rate by 0.225 percent of payroll results in exactly the same increase by 0.225 percent in the ultimate railroad retirement tax rate; i.e., from an ultimate 9.125 percent of payroll to an ultimate 9.35 percent. Thus, the Congress did not significantly increase the social security tax rates but provided the necessary funds by increasing instead the maximum social security taxable base by $1,800 a year. Since the maximum annual railroad retirement tax base is now $5,400, an in\u00ad crease in that base of only $1,200, as provided in the amendment, is necessary to achieve equality with the social security tax base provided in Public Law 89-97. Enactment of the bill without the amendment would place the railroad retirement account in an unsatisfactory financial condition. Without the amendment the increase in the deficiency resulting from Public Law 89-97 and from the passage of this bill would be of such a serious nature as to result, at sometime in the future, in insufficient funds for the payment of benefits for which the railroad retirement system is obligated. CONCLUSION The committee is of the opinion that the discriminatory treatment now applicable only, against spouses of retired railroad employees should be eliminated, but that an increase in the running actuarial deficit in the railroad retirement system should be avoided by the adoption of such a revenue-producing amendment. Without the amendment, the actuarial deficit in the railroad retirement system would be about $62 million a year, while with such amendment, the deficit would be only about $24 million a-year. It is the conclusion of the committee, therefore, that the bill should be adopted as amended. It is further recognized, because of the matching contribution of industry and labor, that those workers earning more than $45 per month and living more than 5 years after retirement will receive more than they have paid into the railroad retirement fund. This will naturally be a factor bearing on any future decisions in labor-manage\u00ad ment negotiations. HEARINGS Hearings were held by the Subcommittee on Railroad Retirement on June 29, 1965. Prior to the testimony by witnesses, the chairman of the subcomm ittee offered the amendment above described and pre\u00ad pared by the Railroad Retirement Board and-requested the witnesses to direct their testimony to the amendment as well as to the bill. While the Railroad Retirement Board opposed the bill, it desired to keep the deficit as low as possible and, hence, concluded that if the bill is adopted, the amendment thereto must also be -adopted. Of the 6 AMENDING THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACr OF 1937 two groups who have the responsibility for maintaining the railroad retirement system in a sound financial condition, the Railway Labor Executives' Association favored the bill with the amendment, and the Association of American Railroads opposed the bill and the amend\u00ad ment. Considerable efforts were made to find a mutually acceptable formula, but to no avail. Failing in these efforts to reach agreement and because of the mounting deficit, it was believed that there was no alternative to offering this amendment, which, while opposed by, the Association of American Railroads, was supported by the Railway Labor Executives Association and by the Railroad Retirement Board. AGENCY REPORTS RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD, Hon. LISTER HILL, Chicago, 111., June 23, 1965. Chairman, Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR HILL: This is a report on the bill H.R. 3157 which was passed by the House of Representatives on June 7, 1965, and referred to your committee for consideration. The provisions of this bill are identical to those of the bill, S. 1978, which was introduced by Senator Dominick on May 17, 1965. Accordingly, our report on this bill is like the report on S. 1978. The bill, H.R. 3157, would amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 by repealing the present provision in section 2(e) of the act which requires the reduction of a spouse's annuity by the amount of the spouse's own insurance benefit under the Social Security Act (except for a wife's or husband's insurance benefit) and by the amount of an annuity under sections 2(a) or 5(d) of the Railroad Retirement Act for which the spouse is eligible. The change would be effective with respect to spouses' annuities accruing in months after the month of enactment of the bill. The amendment would apply to annuities paid in lump sums equal to their commuted value because Of a reduction under section 2(e) of the act as now in effect. It is estimated that the additional costs of the amendment proposed by the bill would come to approximately 0.32 percent of taxable payroll, or $14 million a year, on a level basis. Of this, 0.30 percent of taxable payroll or $13 million a year would be attributable to the removal of the reduction because of social security benefits, and 0.01 percent of taxable payroll or $400,000 a' year to the removal of the reduction because of railroad retirement benefits. There is now an actuarial deficit in the financing of the railroad retirement system of approximately 0.44 percent of taxable payroll, or $19.5 million a year, on a level basis . Enactment of the bill would increase this actuarial deficiency to approximately 0.76 percent of taxable payroll, or $33.5 million a year.' The Board is opposed to the bill for the following reasons: (1). The bill makes no provision for additional revenue to meet the increase in the costs of benefits which the bill wouldaprovide. Even if it were considered feasible to provide for additiona revenue in an I'The slight inconsistencies between figures are due to rounding procedures. AMENDING THE. RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT'r OF 19 37 7 amount sufficient to cover the added costs of the bill, the Board's position would not change for new income could better be used for improvements in other areas where the need seems greater. (2) The present provision in section 2(e) of the Railroad Retire\u00ad ment Act for reducing a spouse's annuity by the amnount of the spouse's own benefit under the Social Security Act is the same, in principle, as the provision in the Social Security Act for reducing a wife's benefit under that act by the amount of such wife's primary benefit under that act. In view of the reduction in a wife's benefit, the reduction of the spouse's annuity under section 2(e) of the act is only in the amount, if any, by which her benefit under tbe Social Security Act exceeds the wife's benefit under that act to which she would be entitled except for her other benefit. (3) More than one of five women entitled to spouses' benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act are also entitled to primary old-age benefits under the Social Security Act (a total of about 40,000 spouses whose benefits were either reduced or eliminated), and the costs to the railroad retirement system for the nonreduction proposed by the bill. now and for the future would be about $14 million a year, as previously stated. The Social Security Act does not require a reduction in a wife's benefit by the amount of her retirement annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act; however, there are only about 1,000 of the 2,800,000 women entitled to a wife's benefit under the Social Security Act who are also entitled to an employee annuity under the Railroad Retire-~ ment Act, and by reason of the financial interchange between the two systems, the loss to the social security system for this nonreduction is zero. The railroad retirement account thus absorbs the cost of the failure to reduce the wife's benefit under the Social Security Act by the amount of her railroad retirement annuity. The estimated cost to the railroad retirement account from this absorption is 0.01 percent of taxable payroll, or $500,000 a year. (4) Before the 1951 amendments to the Railroad Retirement Act, there was no provision, in that act, for a spouse's annuity. The reason for providing a spouse's annuity by such amendments is stated in the Senate committee report (S. Rept. No. 890, 82d Cong., 1st sess., p. 17) as follows: \"If the finances were adequate to permit doing all the other things that need to be done and also to increase all retirement annuities by, say, 65 percent, one might well consider that as an alternative to providing a spouse's annuity. But since such a course is obviously out of the question, the spouse's annuity affords a means of doing substantially that in cases of greatest need; i.e., where two adult and aged people rather than just one must live on the annuity.\" The provision for a spouse's annuity was, therefore, in substitution for an increase in employee annuities in cases where two persons had to live largely on the income from the one annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act. For this very reason, the 1951 amendments pro\u00ad vided that where a spouse has an income from a railroad retirement~ annuity or a social security benefit, the spouse's annuity would not be' paid except to the extent by which it exceeds such annuity or benefit. (5) There is a general misunderstanding about the \"purchase\" of a souse's annuity through railroad retirement taxes. A railroad em.\u00ad P oyee with a wife entitled to a spouse's annuity paid no more in 8 AMENDING THE~ RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT OF 1937 taxes than he would have paid if he had no such wife. A spouse's annuity is no more. \"purchased\" than is a wife's benefit under the Social Security Act; yet -a wife's benefit under that act is reduced by the amount of her own primnarybenefit. In view of the foregoing, the Board recommends that the bill, H.R. 3157, not be reported favorably by your committee; The Board's report of April 26, 1965, to the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on the bill, H.R. 3157 (the bill as introduced in the House of Representatives is essentially like the bill now before your committee),-which is like this report, was cleared with the Bureau of the Budget. That Bureau had no objection to'the presentation of the report-from the standpoint of the administration's program. Sincerely yours, HOWARD W. HABERMEYER, Chairman. cc: Hon. Charles L. Schultze, Director, Bureau of the Budget, Executive Office of the President, Washington,. D.C. TREASURY DEPARTMENT, Washington, D.C., June 928, 1965. Hon. LISTER HILL, Chairman, Labor and Public Welfare Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: This is in response to your request for the views of this Department on H.R. 3157, entitled \"A bill- to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 to eliminate the provisions which reduce the annuities of the spouses of retired employees by the amount of certain monthly benefits.\" This bill is identical with S. 1978 which was introduced in the Senate on May 17, 1965, and on which the De\u00ad partment reported to your committee by letter of June 17, 1965. This bill would amend subsection (c) of section 2 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 by striking the third proviso of this subsection. The provision which would be repealed provides that the annuity of a spouse of a person receiving railroad retirement benefits is subject to reduction if such spOuse is ato entitled to any social security benefit or any other benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act. The amendment would permit the payment of a Spouse's annuity without reduction on account of any of these other benefits that a spouse may be receiving. * The administration of the provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act is vested in the Railroad Retirement Board. S. 1978 involves a question of benefits payable under the act which are primarily the concern of the Board. Accordingly, the Treasury expresses no views concerning the merits of this bill. The Bureau of the Budget has advised the Treasury Department that there is no objection from the standpoint of the administration's program to the presentation of this report. Sinceely Stanley S. Surrey. yurs,(Signed) STANLEY S. SURREY. AMENDING THE, RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT OF 1937 9 EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT, BUREAU OF THE BUDGET, Washington, D.C., July 6, 1965. Hon. LISTER HILL, Chairman, Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, U.S. Senate, New Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Your committee has under consideration H.R. 3157, a bill to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 to eliminate the provisions which reduce the annuities of the spouses of retired employees by the amount of certain monthly benefits. This office generally concurs in the views expressed by the Railroad Retirement Board on this bill. Primarily for these reasons but also because of the importance of retaining and extending the coordina\u00ad tion between benefits payable under both the Railroad Retirement and the Social Security Acts, we would be opposed to the enactment of this bill. Sincerely yours, PHILLIP S. HUGHES, Assistant Director for Legislative Reference. CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW In compliance with subsection (4) of rule XXIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate, changes in existing law made by the bill are shown as follows (existing law proposed to be omitted is enclosed in black brackets, new matter is printed in italic, existing law in which 110 change is proposed is shown in roman): SECTI-ON 2(e) OF THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT OF 1937 (e) Spouse's Annuity .-The spouse of an individual, if\u00ad (i) such individual h as been awarded an annuity under sub\u00ad section (a) or a pension under section 6 and has attained the age of 65, and (ii) such spouse has attained the age of 65 or in the case of a wife, has in her care (individually or jointly with her husband) a child who, if her husband were then to die, would be entitled to a child's annuity under subsection (c) of section 5 of this Act, shall be entitled to a spouse's annuity equal to one-half of such indi\u00ad vidual's annuity or pension, but not more, with respect to any month, than 110 per~ centum. of an amount equal to the maximum amount which could be paid to anyone, with respect to such month, as a wife's insurance benefit under section 202(b) of the Social Security Act as amended from time to time: Provided, however, That if the annuity of the individual is awarded under paragraph 3 of subsection (a), the spouse's annuity shall be computed or recomputed as though such individual had been awarded the annuity to which he would have been entitled under paragraph 1 of said subsection: Provided further, That, if the annuity of the individual is awarded pursuant to a joint and survivor election, the spouse's annuity shall be computed or recomputed as though such individual had not made a joint and survivor election[: And provided further, That any spouse's annuity shall be reduced by the amount of any annuity and the amount of any monthly insurance benefit, other than a wife's or husband's S.

Other cases decided by the SupremeCourt are in point: In Twin City Bank against Nebeker, a case dealing with a tax on bonds used to secure the national currency, the Court held that revenue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict sense of the word, and are not bills for other purposes which may in\u00ad cidentally create revenue. The purpose of this amendment is corollary to the purpose of the bill, and my principle objective is to provide some method for maintaining the deficit in the Railroad Retirement Flund at a tolerable level. Without this amendment, the deficit will rise to approximately $62 mll\u00ad lion per year; with it, we can reduce the deficit to about $24 million. Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimoms consent to have printed in the RECORD a brief concerning the case I have already cited, Twin City Bank against Nebeker. Another case, too, is cited; that of Millard against Roberts. There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows: EXCERPT PROM THE DECIsION OF TH4E U.S. SUPREME COURT IN THE CASE OF TwIN CITY BANK v.

From. my study of the precedents, it is clear- and I have discussed the question with the Parliamentarians of both the House of Representatives and the Senate-that inasmuch as revenue bills must originate in the House uf Representatives, a bill providing for a tax must be a revenue bill when it comes to the Senate, and the Senate cannot convert a nonrevenue bill to a revenue bill. For the Senate to attach a tax provision to simple leg- islation that has nothing to do with rev- enue when it comes from the Homse of Representatives is not condoned.

Then, Mr. president, I wish to make the point of order that the bill came to the Senate as a bill which was not a tax bill.

To do so would be in violation of our oaths. First, I submit that the amendmentWhtblseontohacasIsaqsin to H.R. 3157, which would raise the tax- able wage base under the Railroad Re- tirement Act from $450 to $550 a month, is incidental to the main purpose of the bill, which is to grant benefits to the spouses of railroad retirees. In fact, in thle annotated copy of the Constitution, which all Senators have, and which was prepared by the legis- lative reference service, I note the state- ment that only bills to levy taxes in the strict sense of the word are compre- hended by the phrase \"all bills raisin revenue.\" Bills for other purposes which incidentally create revenues are not included. As an example, a case 15 cited wherein a bill which provided that the District of Columbia should raise by taxation and pay to designated rail-of such magnitude and importance that it isthe part of wisdom not to attempt, by anygeneral statement, to cover every possible phase of the subject. It is sufficient in the present case to say that an act of Congress providing a national currency secured by a pledge of bonds of the United States, and which, in the furtherance of that object, and also to meet the expenses attending the execution of the act, imposed a tax on the notes In circulation of the banking associa\u00ad tions organised under the statute, is clearly not a revenue bill which the Constitution declares must originate in the House of Rep\u00ad resentatives. Mr. Justice Story has well said that the practical construction of the Con\u00adstitution and the history of the origin of the constitutional provision in question proves that revenue bills are those that levy taxes In the strict sense of the word and are not bills for other purposes which may inciden\u00ad tally create revenue.

The bill will be stated by title, for the information of the Senate. The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. A bill (H.R. 5610) to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, so to provide increases In benefits, and for ter purposes. The PRESIDING OFFICnR. The question is on agreeing to the motion of the Senator from Texas. The motion was agreed to; and the Senate proceeded to consider the bill (H.R. 5610) to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, so as to provide increases in benefits, and for other purposes, which was read the first time by title and the second time at length. Mr. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the Senator from Oregon [Mr. MORSE], let me say that the House passed, on May 4, H.R. 5610, which amends the Railroad Retirement Act. H.R. 5610 is identical with Senate bill 226, which was passed by the Senate on April 29, and which had been reported by the Senator from Oregon [Mr. MORSE]. The House adopted every line, every word, every punctuation mark in the Senate bill- including a misplaced quotation mark. I am Informed that the House took that action because the bill contained a revenue featurIamc stebl nrae h rate of tax on employers and employees under the railroad retirement system. How\u00ad ever, the tax-increase provision is only one of many changes effected by the bill in the railroad retirement law. Senate bill 226, 'as passed by the Sen\u00ad ate, is not primarily a tax measure. The ate, and to sustain the contention appellant submits an elaborate argument. In answer to the contention the case of Twin City Bank v. Nebeker, 167 U.S. 196, need only be cited, It was observed there that It was a Part Of wisdom not to attempt to cover by a gen- eral statement what bill shall be said to be \"bills for raising revenue\" within the mean- Ing of those words in the Constitution, but it was said, quoting Mr. Justice Story, \"that the practical construction of the Constitu- tion and the history of the origin of the con- stitutional provision in question proves that revenue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict sense of the word, and are not bills for other purposes, which may inci- dentally create revenue.\" (I Story on Con- stitution, sec. 880.) And the act of Congress which was there passed on illustrates the meaning of the language used. The act in- volved was one providing a national cur- rency, and imposed a tax upon the average amount of notes of a national banking as- sociation in circulation. The provision was assailed for unconstitutionality because it originated In the Senate. The provision was sustained, this Court saying: \"The tax was a means of effectually ac- complishing the great object of giving to the people a currency that would rest, primarily, upon the honor of the United States and be available in every part of the country. There was no purpose, by. the act or by any of its provisions, to raise revenue to be ap- plied in meeting the expenses or obligations of the Government.\" This language is applicable to the acts of Congress in the case at bar. Whatever taxes are imposed are but means to the purposes provided by the act (pp. 436A437). Mr. PELL. Mr. President, a furtherpoin I hatanyishto riseIsone one raised by this amendment does not go into the General Treasury, but rather goes to a special railroad retirement fund. Revenue is defined in Webster's New International Dictionary as: The annual or periodical yield of taxes, poin I hatany ishto riseis excise, customs, duties, rents, etc., which a nation, State, or municipality collects and receives into the treasury for public use; public income of whatever kind. Insofar as the funds that would be raised by this amendment are for a pri- vate pension fund, I do not see any con- stitutional prohibition against its orig-ination in the Senate. Finally, I submit that from the view- point of precedent, we have already passed legislation similar to this; that in 1959 the Senate originated a raise in the aseof he sent it to the House, which changed it.to a House number but passed a bill in identical form, including a misplaced comma, and sent it back to the Senate. At that point, various Senators rose to dploe te atio nd oftheHoue,to dploe te atio nd oftheHoue, to defend the constitutionality of the original action of the Senate, including the then majority leader, Senator John- son, of Texas, and including the present majority whip, the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. LONG], and other Sena-torstors For these reasons, Mr. President, I submit that we are within our rights in passing this amendment as a method to from Oregon is recognized.Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, in view of the fact that the chairman of the Sub- committee on Railroad Retirement-on which I am privileged to be a member-has made reference to the action in this f a , 99 i egraoshbdofMy5199inrgdtohe ilo htyaS 'alodrtrmn 226, I wish to discuss that precedent briefly. Enactment by the Senate on May 5, 1959, of S. 226, provided for increases in tax rates under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act to cover the additional benefits . provided by the bill. A House companion bill had been reported to, but not enacted by the House. The House reported bill was approved by the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, but was unacceptable to railroad labor because the House approved bill failed to provide sufficient revenue and con- .. tamned other unaceptable provisions. When the satisfactory Senate bill S. 226 reached the House floor, it was adopted by the House in substitution for the House reported bill. No constitutional question was raised by the House, at that time. It was known, however, that President . Esnoe ol eotebl;adi was also known that if the bill were vetoed on its merits, the veto would be overridden by both Houses of Congress- at least, that was the belief, It was feared, however, that if the President were to veto the bill because itha a Snat nuber som Meber ofincrease in tax is only part of a bill which ha a Snat nuber som Meber ofis designed to provide much-needed increases the House might be inclined into fol- lowing the position of accepting the veto, To avoid this, a Member of the House moved, a few days later, to vacate the previous House action, and then moved to strike from the House-reported bill allafter the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the Senate provision. This was done, and the enacted bill with a House number was reenacted by the Senate on May 5, 1959. At that time I was chairman of the subcommittee of the Senate on railroad retiemen,ocupyng te sae . rtrmnocpigtesm posi-tion which the Senator from Rhode 1s- land [Mr. PELL] occupies today, The majority leader was the Senator from Texas, Mr. Johnson. The major- ity leader and I thought that the whole in the benefits under the act. In my mind, there is no doubt about the constitutional power of the Senate to initiate such a mess\u00ad ure. The Supreme Court has long held that the Senate can initiate and can pass general legislation which contains, as an incidental feature, a revenue provision. The case ofMillard v. Roberts, decided in 1906, is ape\u00ad cific on this point. The annotated consti\u00ad tution, compiled by Professor Corwin, con\u00ad tains numerous citations in support of this view. I have conferred with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee who handled the bill, the Senator from Oregon [Mr.MORsE]. It Is our conclusion that we do not wish to quibble over the matter; we are primarily concerned with sending this pro\u00ad posed legislation to the President at an early date. In our judgment, the power of the Senate to initiate and to dispose of proposedprcedre as nneessry rom thelegislation such as Senate bill 226 Is clearprcedre as nneessry romtheand beyond any doubt; and we do not intend standpoint of parliamentary require- to delay the taking of final action on this mnent.: Nevertheless, we agreed to go matter by arguing the procedural question. along with it, because our objective was It is far more important to the railroad to get the bill passed. workers that such a bill be passed and go I believe it is important that there be to the President and be signed by him into rad ntotheRECRD t tis imebe-law, rather than that there he long argu\u00adrad ntotheRECRD t tis imebe-ment over the question of whether the bill cause I believe it is of controlling and bear a House bill number or a Senate bill precedential value-the discussion which number. took place at that time, because in my So, Mr. President, after conferring with judgment, if S. 226 on May 5, 1959, was the Senator from Oregon and other members not unconstitutional, the bill before US of the committee, I urge immediate Senate today is not unconstitutional, consideration of House bill 5610, which is Fo allintnts nd urpoesthe nd urpoesthe ub-226, which was passed by the Senate on stantive objectives are the same.

I read from the RECORD of May 5, 1959, Mr. President, I yield now to the, Senator starting on page 7472: from Oregon, so that he may make whatever September 1, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE 21763 comments he desires to make, and that then the Senate may perhaps take action on the bill, Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, the majority leader has explained the reason why there has been some Confusion in regard to rail- road retirement legislation. In my judg- ment, he has stated the law accurately. There is no question about the fact that it was within the province of the Senate to initiate such proposed legislation and to pitss it. I quite agree with the Senator from Texas that we should proceed to repass the bill, this time in the form of House bill 5610. In making legislative history on the bill, our obligation is to make sure that no ques- tion at all In regard to the legislative process can be raised successfully by anyone In any future litigation, Mr. President, until yesterday we had thought a conference would be necessary in order to resolve a difference between the bill which was passed by the Senate-Senate bill 226, the Morse bill-and the bill which was passed last Wednesday by the House-House bil 560. Yesterday, however, the House passed a new bill, numbered H.R. 5610, with languageidentical to that of the Morse bill, Senate bill 226, as passed by the Senate. It is much to be desired that the Senate now pass House bill 5610, and thus permit a railroad retirement bill to reach the White House as soon as possible. In urging that the Senate take this action, I assure this body that such action by it will merely reaffirm the action the Senate took last week in pass- ing Senate bill 226. Mrt. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. President, I yield to the minority leader first. Then I shall yield to the Senator from Louisiana [Aft. LONG]. Mr. DnRKSEN. Mr. President, I think we had some discussion of this matter when the bill first came up In the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. I did not feel there was any doubt whatsoever that the Senate had authority to consider this bill originally and send it to the House. I do indeed concur in the opinion expressed by the majority leader; but, In the interest of felicity as between the two Houses, if this is what It takes in order to expedite action, certainly I have no objec- tion. Mr. LONG. Mr. President- Mrt. JOHNSON of Texas. I yield now to my friend from Louisiana. Mr. LONG. Mr. President, as one of those who greatly admire the majority leader, ' hope he is not going to permit the House, in matters of this sort, continually to down- grade the Senate. This type of procedure can hardly be more than an excuse for the House to claim to be the author of legislation by acting first. If the House had proceeded ex- peditiously, it could have acted first on this measure, rather than second, as it has. Then the Senate might properly be denied credit for being the body of Congress to act first on this bill. The Senate is already bound in a number of ways when the House insists, unreasonably in some instances, on having its way. For example, the Senator from Louis- iana has several times sponsored legislation involving veterans insurance, which the House has failed to consider because of oh- jection on the part of a single Member of the House. I urge the majority leader to see that the responsibilities, duties, and powers of the Senate are maintained. I hope he will try to do something about it, as time goes on, so that the House will act reasonably In such matters, Mr. JOHNSON of Texas. I appreciate the re- Marks of the Senator from Louisiana. I shall do all I can, in a constructive manner, to see that the responsibilities of the Senate are recognized. In this instance I do not agree with the way the House has acted, but I do not see that there Is any good purpose to be served by further quibbling and delay, and I certainly do not want to emulate the action of the House in this instance. Mr. President, if we can get action on this bill- The PRSIsDING OFFIcER. The bill is open to amendment.

The question is, Shall the bill pass? The bill was passed. Mr. MoasE. Mr. President, I move that the Senate reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed. Mr. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table, The motion to lay on the table was agreed to. That is chapter No. 1 in my argument, Mr. President. I now turn to chapter No. 2. e nw dal iretlywit th cost- tutional question raised in 1959 and tory of the origin of the constitutional pro\u00ad vision In question proves that revenue bills are those that levy taxes In the strict sense of the word, and are not bills for other pur\u00ad poses which may incidentally create revenue. Continuing, Mr. President, I call the attention of the Senate to an excerpt from the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court In the case of Millard v. Roberts, 202 U.S. 429. It is a case that the ma\u00ad jority leader of the Senate in 1959, Mr. Johnson, alluded to. The Court said: The first contention of appellant Is that the acte of Congress are revenue measures, and therefore, should have originated in the House of Representatives and not in the Sen\u00ad ate, and to sustain the contention appellant submits an elaborate argument. Iii answer to the contention, the case of Twin City Bank v. Nebeker, 167 U.S. 196, need only be cited. It was observed there that It was a part of wisdom not to attempt to cover by a general statement what bills shall be said to \"bills for raising revenue\" within the meaning of those wuordsing the Constitutiony, buthit was the subcommittee has already referred to the short legal brief that has been pre- pared in support of the position that the bill before the Senate is constitutional, and that it does not violate the Constitu- tni h es hti iltstepo viinthat requires that revenue-raising vso measures must originate in the House. The chairman of the subcommittee, in citing this brief, calls attention to the U.S. Supreme Court case of Twin City Bank v. Nebeker, 167 U.S. 196. I re-ad t ecrsfomhediinofhe teexcrsfomhediinofheThe Supreme Court. The Court said: The contention in this case Is that the section of the act of June 8, 1864, providing a national currency secured by a pledge Of U.S. bonds, and for the circulation and re- demption thereof, so far as It i~mposed a tax upon the average amount of the notes of a national banking association in circula- tion, was a revenue bill within the clause of the Constitution declaring that \"all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills,\" (art. 1, seec. '7); that it appeared from the official Journals of the two Houses of Congress that while the act. of 1864 originated in the House of Repre- sentatives, the provision imposing this tax was not in the bill as It passed that body, but originated in the Senate by amendment, and, being accepted by the House, became a Cnttto raised n16.Tecara fpacidlquotngsMr.usticesody Strfta the tdy n16.Tecara fpatclcntuto of the origin of the constitu\u00ad tional provision in question proves that reve\u00ad nue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict sense of the word, and are not bills for Other purposes, which may Incidentally create revenue\"~ (1 Story on Constitution, sec. 880). pansd the The act involved was one pro\u00ad viding a national currency, and Imposed a tax upon the average amount of the notes of a national banking association in circulation.

'There was no purpose, by the act or by any of its provisions, to raise revenue to be ap\u00ad pined in meeting the expenses or obligations of the Government.\" This language Is applicable to the acts of Congress In the case at bar. Whatever taxes are imposed are but means to the purposes provided by the act. Without taking the time to read the memorandum, I ask unanimous consent that another memorandum be inserted in the RECORD which discusses this con\u00ad stitutional question, citing additional cases, not only the Nebeker case and j~he part of the statute; that such tax was, there-RoetcabucinglsthHue fore, unconstitutional and void, and that,RoetcabucinglsthHue consequently, the statute did not justify the action of the defendant. The case is not one that requires either an extended examination of precedents, or a full discussion as to the meaning of the words in the Constitution, \"bills for raising revenue.\" What bills belong to that class is a question of such magnitude and import- ance that it is the part of wisdom not to attempt, by any general statement, to cover every possible phase of the subject. It is sufficient in the present case to say that an act of Congress providing a national cur- rency secured by a pledge of bonds of the United States, and which, In the furtherance of that object, and also to meet the expenses attending the execution of the act, imposed of Representatives in regard to this mat\u00ad ter. There Is-a series of precedents, even from the House, which recognize that in a situation such as this, it is not a reve\u00ad nue bill, because the so-called tax or revenue features are not controlling, but incidental thereto. I have no doubt that the Senator from Rhode Island is right when, as chairman of the subcommittee, he asks the Senate to sustain the bill on constitutional grounds, There being no objection, the memo\u00ad randum was ordered to be printed In the REODasflo : a tax on the notes In circulation of theREODasflo , banking associations organized under the MEORAINDUl Tar SENATE CoMMIrrrn'a statute, Is clearly not a revenue bill which AMENI)MENT To H.R. 3157 DOES No'T IN- the Constitution declares must originate In WRDNGE ON THE PREROGATIVE OF THE Housz the House of Representatives.

Article 1, section 7 of the Constitution provides: \"All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives;but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.\" Justice Story, in his \"Commentaries on the Constitution,\" traced the origin of article 1, section 7 to the British Parliamentary sys-tem where tax revenue measures, there known as \"money bills,\" could originate only in theHouse of Commons. The House o od col ny fwtaLogds- poeorcnu lation initiated in the House of Commons. In defining the term \"bills for raisingrevenue,\" Justice Story states: * te \"1* In Msillard v. Roberts, 202 U.S. 429, 50 L. ed. 1000 (1906). the Senate initiated an act which required certain railroads to eliminate grade crossings and to construct a railroad depot. A stum of money was to be paid to the railroads to be raised by the levy of a tax on the property of area residents. The Court, relying on Its decision in Twin CityNational Bank v. Nebeker, supra, held that the tax did not convert the act Into a bill to raise revenue. The Court concluded, \"What-ever taxes are imposed are but 'means to the purposes provided by the act\" (202 U.S. at 437). PRECEDENTS OF THE HOUSE 0O' REPRESENTATIVES 1. On March 29, 1922, a motion was made on the 'loor of the House that a bill author- izing the extension of time for payment of a debt Incurred by Austria be sent to the Ways and Means Committee on the groundthat it was a bill to raise revenue. The Speaker decided that the bill was not priate annually to the railroad retirement account the estimated proceeds of the Rail\u00adroad Retirement Tax Act, and to maske aci\u00adjustments -in. subsequent appropriations to correct any inaccuracy in the estimates. However, by title V of Public Law 452, 82d Congress, 2d session, 1952, it was providedthat there Is appropriated: \"For annual premiums after June 30, 1952, to provide for the payment of all annuities, pensions, and death benefits, in accordance with the provisions of the Railroad Retire\u00adment Acts of 1935 and 1937, as amended (45U.S.C. 228-228s), and for expenses necessaryfor the Railroad account, an amount equal to amounts coy\u00adered into the Treasury (minus refunds) dur- Ing each fiscal year under the Railroad Re\u00ad trmn appro\u00ad priations are then made from the account (not from general funds) for administrative expeses. a ee salihdblwta the Railroad Retirement Act and the Rail\u00ad road Retirement Tax Act are Integral parts of a single insurance system.

After the passage of H.R. 3157 by the House and before its consideration by the Senate committee, Congress had enacted the social security amendments of 1965 (PublicLaw 89-97). The social security amendments had a far-reaching effect on the financing of the railroad retirement system: a. By reason of certain minimum snd maximum provisions in the Railroad Retire\u00ad ment Act that are contingent upon the pro\u00advisions of the Social Security Act, manyrailroad retirement benefits were automati\u00ad cally increased;b. By reason of the railroad retirement tax rates being contingent upon the social security tax rates the scheduled railroad re\u00adtirentent tax rates prior to 1973 were reduced with a consequent reduction in income; C. By reason of the Increase in the social security maximum taxable wage base to $6,600 per year the railroad retirement ac\u00adcount would be adversely affected in the interchange of funds between the two systems so long as the railroad retirement maximum taxable wage base remained at $450 permonth ($5,400 per year); d.

The contention was made that it was a bill to raise revenue since it provided that the Postmaster General was authorized to use a part of the moneys collected to pay post office employees. The Supreme Court. however, applyingJustice Story's definition of what constituted a bill for raising revenue, rejected the con-tention. The Court reasoned that since the primary purpose of the act was not to raise revnu, nded howd ilin- onres a ness to sink money, if necessary, to accom- pls ta heat nt\"ade pros. a for the direct and avowed purpose of crest-ing revenue or public funds for the service of the Government,\" and was, therefore, not a bill to raise revenue within the meaning of article 1, section?7.

On May 4, 1922, the Speaker was called upon to decide whether a bill banning the importation of narcotics was a revenue bill since it also had provision for the'raisingof revenue. The Speaker decided that the bill was not a revenue bill stating:\"The Chair concludes that it is not privi-leged; that while [the bill] relates to rev-enues, yet that that is incidental; that the main purpose of the bill is not to raise reve-nue; and that therefore It is not privileged\" (8 Cannon's Precedents of the House of Rep-resentatives, sec. 2279 (1936)). 3. On December 18, 1920, the Speaker was called upon to decide whether a Senate res-olution reviving the activities of the War Finance Corporation constituted a revenue bill. During the ensuing debate a memberof the House stated: \"[Article 1. section 7 of the ConstitutionT provides that bills for the purpose of raising revenue shall originate in the House of Rep-resentatives. It does not provide that laws which take the effect and which will have the effect either of raising revenue or pro-ducing a deficit shall originate in the House I * * No one can tell whether the passageof this resolution, if it shall be carried out in the spirit of the resolution, will produce revenue Or produce a deficit. But everyoneknows that the purpose of the law is not to produce revenue\" (6 Cannon's Precedents of the House 'of Representatives, sec. 315 (1936)). The Speaker decided that such questions were for the House rather than the Speaker,and the House voted that the bill was one which the Senate could originate.Applying these precedents specifically to Senate commnittee's amendment to H.R. 3157, it would appear that no serious ques-tion arises concerning the infringement of the House prerogative to originate revenue measures. Although the Railroad Retirement Tax Act is a part of the Internal Revenue Code, the proceeds derived from it are devoted exclu-sively to the payment of benefits under and the expenses of administering the Railroad Retirement Act; no part of the proceeds is devoted to general revenue purposes,In the early years of the railroad retire-ment system it was the practice to appro-21765 September 1, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE as railroad employees are concerned by the Railroad Retirement Board, but to became effective Only if and when the railroad retire- mernt monthly tax base should be the equiva-lent of one-twelfth of the social security an- nual tax base, Financially, the effect of the social security amendments was to enlarge the pre-existing deficit and the additional deficit to be cre- ated by H.R. 3157 by an additional $28 mil- lion per year. To deny to the Senate the jurisdiction to Consider and legislate in light of these events, largely supervening House passage of the bill, is to deny to the Senate jurisdiction to legis- late intelligently. Under any such restrictive jurisdiction the only courses open to the Senate in Its con- sideration of H.R. 3157 would be to accept the enlargement of the deficit, even though it might consider the enlargement of the deficit unwise, or to reject the enlargement of bene- fits because it was unwilling to enlarge the deficit.I Furthermore, it is Inherent in the struc- ture of the railroad retirement system that the maximum limit of taxable compensa- tion Is also the maximum limit of creditable compensation for benefit purposes. Certainly no one can deny that the Senate has juris- diction to originate increases in the maximum compensation creditable for benefit purposes. But that jurisdiction would as a practical matter be also effectively negated if It lacked jurisdiction to Increase the corresponding base in the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, M.MORSE.

The decrease in scheduled social security tax rates, and the consequent decrease In scheduled railroad retirement tax rates, was made poseible only by the fact that the social security tax base was increased to $6,600 per year.

In this connection it should be observed that during the last pre- ceding Congress. and without change of poet- tion during the present Congress, the railroad managements agreed with the railway labor organizations that railroad employees should equally with other employees in the benefits of whatever medicare program might be enacted.

When revenues are to be raised, those measures should originate in the House. The Senate Committee on Finance some\u00ad times has to wait 3 Months for the House to send to the Senate revenue bills so the Senate may act on them. Religiously and respectfully, the Finance Committee respects the House of Representatives in respect to the Constitution; and circum\u00ad spect as we are, we feel we should show the same consideration and insist on the same consideration for others who have the same responsibility we have.

It was perfectly obvious that the Senate did not take the position that the House had a constitutional right to originate this particular measure.

The very case the Senator from Oregon cites, includ- ing my statement, shows that the House should act first, If the Senator from Oregon is right in what he says, the Finance Committee would have had a right to originate the Social security bill and the medicare bill. The Senate Finance Committee agreed so strongly to the contrary that our chairman and the committee declined to hold hearings on that bill until the House acted and sent the Senate a bill. This year, in this session, the Senate I 21766 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE September 1, 1965 along with the objections because, in the view of the Esenator from Louisiana, that would be downgrading the Senate. On May 5,1959, the Senator from Loui- siana thought the railroad retirement bill was set out in the proper framework of a Senate bill and he was for passing the Senate bill, not the House bill. The point was raised in that debate very clearly that the Senate did not rec- ognize any constitutional right of the House to originate all those bills in the first instance. It was perfectly clear from the statements of the then major- ity leader, Mr. JTohnson, the chairman of the subcommittee which handled the railroad retirement bill, the senior Sena- tor from Oregon, and the minority lead- er, that we were not -going to take the House bill on any constitutional right of the House, but because we recognized the parliamentary realities that confronted the Senate, and that we had a better chance of getting the bill on the books. But there is no precedent, by the slightest Let us face up to the issue. If there is any real question about the constitution- ality of the bill, let us pass it and let the Supreme Court decide it. I tell Senators, in my judgment, the decision that will be rendered. There will be an even briefer decision than Justice Story ren- dered in the Nebeker case. The Court will dismiss it in a paragraph or two, un- less it recites the Nebeker case and also the Roberts case, at the time the leader of the Senate referred to when the posi- tion was taken on May 5, 1955, that a constitutional question was not involved. It is my opinion-and every Senator is entitled to his opinion-that this adds up to a parliamentary maneuver to avoid a decision on the substantive merits of the amendment. I am ready to vote on the substantive merits of the amendment. I am perfectly willing to vote on the sub- stantive merits because I am satisfied the bill is constitutional, I have great respect for my colleagues in the Senate, but I prefer to walk a few stretch of the imagination, in the May 59, steps from the Senate of the United would have to pay $10 a month more to get the benefits of the medicare pro\u00ad posal that we added to the Social Se\u00ad curity bill, which was passed recently. Am I stating the situation correctly? Mr. PELL. That Is not completely correct. The tax would be paid half and half by the railroad industry and by those workers who earn more than $450 a month. It would not cover hos\u00ad pital care through railroad retirement or social security. There would be, how\u00ad ever, other benefits. Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Would it cover medical benefits? Mr. PELL. It would not. Mr. LONG of Louisiana. In any event, this is a major tax increase. It is something that we can take care of later in the session or next year. It ought to be considered in connection with a rev\u00ad enue bill. The bill before us is not a revenue bill. I hold in my hand another bill, which the House in all propriety, in my judgment, based on the precedents that have been in effect in the time that I have been a Senator, declined to con\u00ad sider. The bill concerns fisheries. We imposed a tax, and the House politely sent the bill back to us. I am sure the Senator would not say that the House took the wrong attitude. The House of Representatives has con\u00ad sistently acted in this fashion, at least while I have been a Member of the Sen\u00ad ate. There is that precedent even in the 1959 debate, to which reference has been made., The House sent S. 1734 back to us with a polite note, rejecting it. Mr. PELL. In this connection there should be printed in the RECORD a letter from the Executive Office of the Presi\u00ad dent, Bureau of the Budget, addressed 1959, case, that there was any admission on the part of the Senate that the House had the constitutional right to originate the bill. This was what we call accom- modation between the two Houses. There was no waiver of the right Of the Senate to originate the legislation. That is perfectly clear. Let me say if that action is a prece- dent-it does not have the slightest rele- vancy, but if the Senate did agree in May 1959, to do that-it does not rewrite the Constitution of the United States. We cannot amend the Constitution of the United. States by decreeing on the floor of the Senate that a bill is a revenue bill. That is a question of law,.hAll the Senate did was to parliamen- tarily accommodate the House of Repre- sentatives; on May 5, 1959, in order to have a railroad retirement bill passed.The haimanof he etie- RilradThe haimanof he etie- Rilrad ment Committee and Mr. Johnson, the then-majority leader of the Senate, and Mr. DiRKSEN, as the minority leader of the Senate, agreed among themselves that that would be an appropriate par- liamentary procedure to follow, Let the senior Senator from Oregon state again for the RECORD, because it will be read 10, 15, 20 years from now, that not a word can be found In the May 5, 1959, RECORD of any admission on the part of the Senate that it had encroached upon the power of the House of Repre- sentatives in that it had initiated a rev- enue bill. To .the contrary, it was our position that it was not a revenue bill within the meaning of article I, section 7 of the CosiuinofteUie Saer-law ferred to by Justice Story in the Nebeker case, from which I have already quoted at length. There is before the Senate the clear issue of whether or not the Senate is going to send the bill back to committee, orto some other committee, or refuse tooramend take action on it because of a point of order, because we have said once again, acting as \"Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court\" that article I, section 7 of the Constitution of the United States would be violated thereby. States to that great cathedral of justice, the U.S. Supreme Court building, for constitutional rulings, I am satisfied what that ruling would be if the bill were passed, and whether or not the Senate, in passing it, acted con- stitutionally. The Supreme Court will render a de- cision that the so-called tax features of the bill are incidental thereto and do not constitute a revenue measure in the sense that a revenue measure must originate in the House.

The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized. Mr. PELT. Mr. President, the bill H.R. 3157, now under consideration by this body, would change the Railroad Retire- ment Act so that payment of an annuity to a spouse of a retired railroad employee could be made in the full amount even though she is at the samie time entitled to monthly benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act or Social Security Act de- rived from her own employment. The present law requires a reduction In the spouse's annuity by the amount of bene- fits derived from her own employment, as well as by the amount of certain other benefits to which she may be entitled. The spouses' annuity is the only benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act which cannot now be paid in full concurrently with other benefits under the Social Security and Railroad Retirement Acts, although in the past there were others. The discriminatory provisions against spouses should be removed, The change in the law as to spouse's annuities would, of course, increase the costs of the railroad retirement system. It is estimated that the added costs of this change would be about $14 million a year on a level basis. When H.R. 3157 passed the House in June of this year, there was a deficit on a long-range actu- arial basis in the financing of the system of about $20 million a year. A deficit tional tax amounts. Those employees, who do not earn over $450 a month, Will pay no additional taxes and will gain no credits toward higher benefits. The increase in the compensation base will reduce the deficit from the projected $62 million a year to approximately $24 million a year. The railroad retirement system would then be in a satisfactory financial condition. It is estimated that the change in base would Produce an ad- ditlonal $87 miilion a year in the tax in come. Over one-half of this amount, $48 million, would be required to pay the additional benefit amounts and the re- mainder, $39 million, would apply to the reduction of the deficit. As I have indicated, the problem can- not be solved without legislative action. Tax revenue to the system can be in- creased only by increasing the taxable wage base, or by raising tax rates. A rate increase would have a harsh impact, particularly on employees with low earn- ings. Their tax amounts would be in- creased and they would get no additional benefits; Congress, to my knowledge, has never increased social insurance taxes without an, accompanying increase in benefit amounts, In the financing of the recent lim- provement of social security benefits, the Congress has relied principally on an in- crease in the wage base for the increase in tax rates wa's relatively slight, Tax rates for the railroad retirement paid into the railroad retirement fund. This will naturally be a factor bearing on any future decisions in labor-management ne\u00ad gotiations. Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, will the Senfitor from Rhode Island yield? Mr. PELL. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Colorado. Mr. DOMINICK. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Rhode Is-. land in yielding to me. As he well knows, the original bill on this Proposal was introduced by me, so far as the Senate is concerned. It was a companion bill to one introduced by Representative HARRis, of Arkansas, in the House of Representatives, which passed without this amendment. My interest, at the time I introduced the bill, was to try to do something about the existing inequities so far as a specific class of railroad employees' spouses are concerned, in that they have their rail\u00ad road retirement reduced by social se\u00ad curity while their spouse is still aive, and yet they get both amounts when one of them has died. It seems to me that this is wrong. This is the reason we included it in the bill. The bill Passed the House, as I recall, almost unanimously, in a form without any taxation being added, to it at all. Mr. President, I suggest that the action which has just been taken by the Senate myesl euti h eeto h entire bill, because I am positive that the House will not absorb this degree of autonomy, by the Senate over what the House considers to be its private reserve. Therefore, I believe that serious trouble lies ahead, so far as the future of the bill is concerned. I intend to vote for it, because this the range of actuarial tolerance, and the system was regarded as being in a satis- factory financial condition. Since that time, Public Law 89-97, the Social Se- curity Amendments of 1965, has been enacted. The changes in the Social Se- curity Act will have the effect of increas- Ing certain direct financial benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act and will add an estimated $28 million a year to the costs of the system, increasing the deficit to about $48 million a year. With a deficit of this amount, the rail- road retirement system is now in an un- satisfactory financial condition and the additional costs of the effect of this bill on spouses' annuities would cause the fi- nancial conditions to be considerably worse. The deficit would then be ap- Proximately $62 million a year. The sys- tem cannot, of course, endure in an un- satisfactory financial condition. The committee is cognizant of the fact the situation cannot be corrected unless additional revenue is obtained. It, there- fore, amended the bill to change the limit on creditable and taxable compen- sation for the railroad retirement system from the present flat $450 a month to an amount equ~al to one-twelfth of the limit On annual taxable wages for the social security system. As we know, the annual taxable wage base for social security has been raised to $6,600 from $4,800, an in- crease of $1,800 a year. The effect of the amendment would be to raise the base for the railroad retirement system to $550 a month from the present $450, an increase of the equivalent of only $1,200 a year. inths i mon t b wthnsystem are, under existing law, auto- cnsdee matically geared to the tax rates for the social security system, although the rail- road rates are approximately twice as large. Therefore, the increases in the social security tax rates will be reflected in the railroad retirement rates. There is not now a coordination as to the earn- ings; base. Historically, the railroad re- tirement base has always, except for a was my original bill. I voted against the few months in the late 1950's, equaled or Pell amendment in subcommittee. I exceeded the social security base. It is~ voted against it again on the floor. I also significant that even with the change, a substantially lower percentage of gross railroad earnings would be tax- able than was the case when the system was first established, and the monthly base was only $300. The increase in the railroad retire- ment tax base will, of course, add to the taxes of railroad companies, but the larger increase In the social security tax base will also add to the taxes for com- panies in industry covered by the social security system. Finally, it is to be noted that if there is a difference in the taxable wage law, those under railroad retirement or cam- pared with those under social security, then the hospital insurance program would be administered by the Social Security Administration rather than by the Railroad Retirement Board as would be the case if this amendment were adopted. In reporting this bill, it is recognized that benefits will accrue to those workers who pay the additional tax. Under the heading of \"Conclusion,\" on page 5 of the report, it is stated: am still going to vote for the bill, in the hope that we can get something out of conference. Perhaps, if the House re\u00ad mains adamant, we can show the Senate that if it is going to do anything for the spouses, it had better take the bill in the original draft as it was first intro\u00ad duced. Mr. President, we are dealing with economic benefits which will accrue to 41,000 persons. Many of them will dis\u00ad appear as time goes on, which is in\u00ad evitable to all of life, so that the drain on the retirement fund, which has been mentioned over and over again, will pro\u00ad gressively decrease as time goes on. It has already been stated that It would be 4 years before we really had to worry about retirement funds in any way whatsoever. Therefore, it seems to me, for us to take the position that we must move now, so far as railroad retirement funds are concerned, is qulte premature. This assumes that Congress would not do anything after full hearings before the proper committee, in order to take care of the problem, if we presented it to them.

Then the tax rate will increase by 0.25 percent as of January 1, 1966; -will Increase by 0.25 percent as of January 1-, 1967: will be increased again by 0.25 percent as of January 1. 1968; and then a final 0.25 percent as of January 1, 1969. These increases will restore the Rail\u00ad road Retirement fund to the Position of actuarial balance in which It stood as of January 1 this year. AMENDING RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT AND RAIELROAD RETIREMENT TAX ACT (Mr. HARR-Is asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and -extend his remarks.) Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I am In\u00ad troducing today a bill amending the Rail\u00ad road Retirement Act and the Railroad Retirement Tax Act. I am scheduling hearings on this bill beginning on Wednesday, September 8, and we expect to proceed expeditiously with the bill. As Members know, a bill-H.R. 3157\u00ad providing benefits for spouses of retired railroad employees passed the House earlier this year, and passed the other body on September 1 with an amendment increasing the base wages subject to tax under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act. There is considerable controversy about this latter amendment and in the opinion of many, the form in which the amaend\u00ad ment is proposed is unconstitutional. I am attempting with this bill which I have introduced today to provide a resolution of the controversies that exist in this area. The bill provides as follows: First. The bill provides exactly the same benefits for spouses of retired rail\u00adroad employees as was provided in the bill as passed by the House and the Sen\u00ad ate this year. Second. The bill increases the base wages subject to railroad retirement tax to $550 a month, effective October 1, this year. Because of some complexities in\u00ad volved in the medicare legislation, this will mean that the medicare program for railroad employees -will be administered by the Railroad Retirement Board, rather than by the Social Security Ad\u00ad ministration. Third. The third provision of the bill provides for an immediate reduction In the rates of tax paid by employees and 89TH CONGRESS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES NEO.R97 AMENDMENTS TO RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT OF 1937 AND RAILROAD RETIREMENT TAX ACT SEPTEMBER 10, 1965.-Committed to the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union and ordered to be printed Mr. HARRIS, from the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, submitted the following REPORT [To accompany H.

Amend the title so as to read: A bill to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 and the Railroad Retirement Tax Act to eliminate certain pro\u00advisions which reduce spouses' annuities, to provide coveragefor tips, to increase the base on which railroad retiremegntbenefits and taxes are computed, and to change the railroad retirement tax rates. PRINCIPAL PURPOSE OF THE BILL The reported bill will accomplish the following: (1) The bill eliminates the provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act which provide for the reduction of the annuities of spouses of retired employees by the amount of social security or railroad retire\u00adment benefits which the spouse has earned in her own right; (2) The bill will increase the maximum creditable and taxable monthly compensation under the Railroad Retirement Act and Rail\u00adroad Retirement Tax Act from the present $450 to $550 per month,,effective January, 1, 1966;7 (3) The bill provides an immediate decrease in the rate of Railroad Retirement taxes by 1 percent, with the rate of tax being increased by one-fourth of 1 percent on January 1, 1966, January 1, 1967,January 1, 1968, and January 1,' 1969; and (4) The bill provides the same treatment of tips for purposes of the Railroad Retirement Act as is provided for tips under the Social Security Act as recently amended. AMENDMENTS TO RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT BACKGROUND On June 7, the House unanimously passed H.R. 3157, a bill am~nd\u00ad ing section 2(e) of the Railroad Retirement Act in exactly the same fashion as is provided by the first section of the reported bill. It was estimated that the cost of that bill was $14 million a year, which, when added to the existing actuarial deficit of $20 million a year of the railroad retirement system, would increase that deficit to a total of $34 million a year, or 0.71 percent of taxable payroll. Subsequent to the passage of the bill by the House, the Congress enacted the Social Security Amendments of 1965 (Public Law 89-97), which, for reasons hereafter explained, will increase the deficit by another $28 million a year, for a total deficit of $62 million a year. H.R. 3157 was reported to the Senate with an amendment increasing the wages subject to railroad retirement tax to the equivalent of the social security base provided in the Social Security Amendments of 1965, or $550 a month, effective January 1, 1966. A point of order was made against this amendment on the ground that this converted the bill into a bill for raising revenue, and that the revenue-raising features must have originated in the House. This point of order was rejected by a very close vote-41 to 44 and the bill was thereafter passed unanimously. Notwithstanding the unanimous votes in both Houses on this bill, in view of the constitutional problem presented, it seems to the com\u00ad mittee that on a matter as important as this, it is better to be on the safe side, and avoid possible constitutional objections to legislation. For that reason, H.R. 10874 was introduced containing the revenue- raising measures required to deal with the deficit. Hearings were held on September 8, the bill was considered in executive session on September 9, and is reported to the House herewith. SPOUSES' BENEFITS This feature of the bill was expla ined in the committee report accompanying. H.R. 3157 (H. Rept. 1807). That report stated as follows: Under existing law any person who is entitled to railroad retirement benefits whether as an annuitant or as a survivor of a railroad employee, who is also entitled to social security benefits based upon his own wage record, may, with one ex\u00ad ception, draw full benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, and full benefits under the Social Security Act, without reduction. The 'one exception in the foregoing statement involves women who are entitled to an annuity as the spouse of a retired railroad employee. Under the third proviso of section 2(e) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 deductions are made from the annuity paid to the spouse of any railroad employee until the deductions equal the total of social security benefits to which she is entitled in her own right. If, however, a woman entitled to a spouse's annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, is also entitled to social security benefits as a wife, because of social security wage credits earned by her husband in employment not covered by the Railroad Retirement Act, she may re\u00ad ceive full benefits under both acts. 6 fNDAENS TO RAILROAD RETIREM:ENT ACT A retired railroad employee who is eligible for social security benefits, either based on his own social security wage record, or as a survivor, based upon another individual's wage record, may draw full railroad retirement benefits and full social security benefits without reduction. A further illustration of the inequity involved in the present provisions of section 2(e) arises out of the different treatment provided the spouse of a railroad employee and the widow of a railroad employee. A widow may receive survivor benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act con\u00ad currently with any social security benefits to which she is entitled based on her own wage record, without reduction in railroad retirement benefits; however, the spouse of a living railroad worker has her benefits reduced by social security benefits which she has earned based on her own employment. In other words, while her husband is alive, the spouse of a retired railroad employee receives a spouse's benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, reduced by social se\u00ad curity benefits which she has earned based on her own wage record; yet, upon the death of her husband she becomes en\u00ad titled to draw railroad retirement benefits as a widow, and full social security benefits based on her own wage record, without any reduction. The committee feels that this discriminatory treatment, applicable only to the spouses of retired railroad employees, is not warranted, and reconmmends that this legisaltion be adopted. INCREASE IN TAXABLE COMPENSATION As was mentioned above, the actuarial deficit facing the railroad retirement fund as of January 1, 1966, assuming the passage of legis\u00ad lation relating to spouses' benefits, will total $62 million. In order to finance this deficit, the bill reported herewith increases the base wages subject to tax of $550 a month, effective January 1, 1966. By reason of this increase, the railroad retirement taxable payroll will be about $4.8 billion a year, and the added income to the fund will ultimately be about $84 million a year, of which approximately $46 million would go to increase annuities of an estimated 487,000 employees who earn more than $450 per month, land the remainder would be applied to decrease the actuarial deficit of the system. The committee recognizes that the immediate impact of an increase in the base wages subject to tax by $100 a month can work a hard\u00ad ship on employees, and has, therefore, provided for a decrease in the rate of railroad retirement taxes of 1 percent, effective the first day of the first month after this bill is enacted, with a one-fourth of 1 percent increase in the rate of tax on January 1, 1966, and with an identical percentage increase on January 1 of each of the next 3 years. Two of the reasons making an increase in the base wages subject to railroad retirement tax necessary a-rise out of the enactment of the recent medicare legislation: One relating to the $28 million annual projected loss to the railroad retirement system from the operation of the financial interchange provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act; and the other relating to the administration of the medicare program for retired railroad employees and their beneficiaries. AMENDMENTS TO RAILROAD RETIREMENTr ACT 7 Firnancial interchange The Railroad Retirement Act contain poionusually referred to as the \"financial interchange\" provisions, under which the railroad retirement system annually pays to the social security system an amount equal to the total of taxes which would be paid under the social security system by all railroad employees if railroad employ\u00ad ment were \"covered employment\" within the meaning of the Social Security Act. Similarly, the social security system annually pays to the railroad retirement system an amount equal to the social security benefits which would have been paid to railroad employees if their railroad service had been covered employment under thle Social Security Act, reduced by the amount of social security benefits actually paid to the employees and their beneficiaries. Because of this financial interchange provision, the base wages subject to tax under the railroad retirement system must equal or exceed the base wages subject to tax under the social security system; otherwise, the railroad retirement system will be required to pay amounts to the social security system as taxes on wages although no taxes are actually collected by the Board on these amounts. The increase in the base uinder social security to $6,600, while leaving the base under railroad retirement at $5,400, then, means that the railroad retirement system will, under the financial interchange provisions, be required to pay to the social security system taxes with respect to each railroad employee based upon his first $6,600 in earnings, while collecting taxes only on $5,400. This wilfl result in a net deficit to the railroad retirement system under the financial interchange provisions of $28 million a year, unless the base wages under each system are identical, in which case there will be no net loss to the railroad retirement system. It is important to emphasize that except for a relatively short period in the late 1950's the railroad retirement maximum monthly tax base has always equaled or exceeded the social security equivalent monthly taxable wages. In fact, the maximum railroad retirement tax base now is $450 a month (equivalent of $5,400 a year) while the maximum social security taxable wage base is now only $4,800 a year. The increase in base would increase the railroad retirement tax base to an amount equivalent to the social security tax base; that is, the maximum monthly raiload retirement cretitable and taxable base would be equal to one-twelfth of the maximum annual social security creditable and taxable base. The effect of this would be that any increase in the tax base for social security purposes would auto\u00ad matically result in an increase in the tax base for railroad retirement purposes to one-twelfth of the annual social security base as increased. It is also important to emphasize that when the railroad retirement system was established in 1937, 98 percent of the gross railroad payroll was taxable on a $300 monthly maximum; but only 79 percent of the, gross payroll is now taxable on the present $450 monthly limit; and by increasing the monthly limit to $550, only 87.7 percent of the gross payroll will be taxable-about 10 percentage points lower than was the case when the system was first established. Admi'n~stration of medicare A second reason why it is necessary to increase the base wages sub\u00ad ject to taxes under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act to $550 a month 8 AMENDMENTS TO RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT arises out of sections 105 and 111 of the Social Security Amendments of 1965. Section 105 of these amendments provides that medicare benefits for retired railroad employees and their beneficiaries are to be paid by the social security system, with the administration of the entire program for railroad employees vested in the Social Security Ad\u00ad ministration. All questions concerning eligibility of beneficiaries, however, must be determined on the basis of information furnished by the Railroad Retirement Board. This will create a very inefficient system for the administration of this program. Section 111 of the Social Security Amendments of 1965 makes a further change in the law, and provides, in substance, that if on or before October 1 of any calendar year the base wages subject to -tax under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act are equal each month to one-twelfth of the maximum annual compensation subject to tax under the social security system, then the medicare program for retired railroad employees and their beneficiaries will be administered during the next calendar, year by the Railroad Retirement Board; otherwise,. the medicare program will be administered by the Social Security Administration. This means that unless the bill herewith reported becomes law on or before October 1 of this year, the medicare program for retired railroad employees and their beneficiaries will be administered during 1966 by the Social Security Administration, and if the base wages subject to tax under the railroad retirement system are increased next year (prior to October 1), then as of January 1, 1967, railroad employees and their beneficiaries will look to the Railroad Retirement Board, rather than to the Social Security Administration, for benefits under the medicare program, with the potentials for confusion and misunderstanding inherent in such a transfer of responsibilities. For these reasons, the committee has voted to provide an increase in the base wages subject to railroad retirement tax-to one-twelfth of the maximum annual compensation subject to social security taxes ($6,600 a year). INCREASE IN ANNUITIES RESULTING FROM INCREASE IN BASE WAGES Aside from placing the railroad retirement system in a sound financial condition, the increase in base would also increase the annui\u00ad ties of employees who will have paid taxes on the higher maximum. Generally speaking, for each year that the employee pays taxes on the increased base of $550 a month, the additional tax by reason of such increase would be about $100. For this extra cost the employee's annuity would be increased by $1.67 a month, or about $20 a year for each such year. Assume that an employee retires at age 65, in January 1967, after paying about $100 in additional taxes. At the time of his retirement his life expectancy is about 13 years. Since he will receive about $20 a year more in annuities than he would other\u00ad wise have received, his total return for the $100 extra taxes would be about $260 (13 times $20). If he has 2 such years, the total additional taxes would be about $200 and his total return in additional annuities would be about $520 (260 times 2). Whatever he pays in additional taxes in 1, 2, or mnore years, he will recover in about' 5 years after retirement. AMENDMENTS TO RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT 9 COVERAGE OF TIPS The recently enacted Social Security Act Amendments of 1965 contain special provisions dealing with the coverage under the Social Security Act of tips, providing special rules for the reporting of tips and the collection of taxes upon them. When H.R. 3157 was considered in the Senate, an amendment was agreed to providing the same coverage with respect to tips under the Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad Retirement Tax Act as is provided with respect to tips under the Social Security Act. The addition of this amendment to the reported bill was recommended during the hearings, and no objections were made to this amendment. It merely extends, to dining car employees, porters, and a relatively few other employees of railroads who receive tips, coverage under the Railroad Retirement Act for these tips. SECTION-B3Y-SECTibN EXPLANATION OF THE BILL AS REPORTED Section 1. Spouses' annuities Section 1 of the bill amends section 2(e) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 to permit the spouse of a railroad employee to receive a spouse's annuity under that section concurrently with the receipt of social security benefits (other than wife's or husband's benefits), or concurrently with the receipt of a railroad retirement annuity in the spouse's own right or as a parent, without any reduction in the spouse's annuity. The amendment made by this section is effective (under sec. 6 of the bill) with respect to annuities accruing in months after the month in which the bill is enacted (with special rules for spouse's annuities paid in lump sums equal to their commuted value). Section 2. Coverage of tips Section 2 of the bill makes various amendments to chapter 22 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (the Railroad Retirement Tax Act) and the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 to provide that cash tips received by an employee after 1965 in the course of his employ\u00ad ment (unless they are less than $20 in a month) will constitute \"coin\u00ad pensation\" both for purposes of railroad retirement benefits and for purposes of the railroad retirement employee tax. No employer tax would be imposed on any tips; and no employer would be required to collect the employee tax on any tips unless they are reported to him by the employee as described below. Each employee would be required to furnish a statement of tips received in any month to his employer by the 10th day of the following month. The employer would deduct the employee's railroad retire\u00ad ment tax on such tips from other compensation due the employee or from funds specially made available to him by the employee for such purpose; to the extent that the employee's funds under the control of the employer during the relevant period are insufficient for collection of the tax by such a deduction, the employee would pay the tax directly. Authority could be provided for employers to estimate the tips which employees will report to them on a quarterly basis, and to deduct the tax (with appropriate adjustments) according to such estimates. H. Rept. 976,859---~2 10 AMAENDMENTS TO RAILROAD RETIREMENTr ACT Tips wou~ld be deemed paid at the time reported to the employer (or at the time actually received if no report is made), and the serv\u00ad ices involved would be deemed to have been rendered at that time. Section $. Increase in base for benefit computation purposes' Section 3 of the bill increases the maximum monthly compensation which may be counted for benefit computation purposes from the present $450 to the higher of (i) $450 or (ii) one-tw~elfth of the current annual social security wage base. Under the Social Security Amend\u00ad ments of 1965, the latter wage base will increase to $6,600 beginning with 1966, with the result that the railroad retirement maximum monthly base will increase to $550 beginning with January 1966. Subsection (a) of section 3 of the bill amends section 3(a) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 to include compensation up to the new limit in the annuity computation formula. Subsection (b) amends sectio n 3(c) of the 1937 act to reflect the increased base in the definition of \"monthly compensation.\" Subsections (c), (d), and (e) amend section 5 of the 1937 act to give effect to the increased base in the computation of survivor bene\u00ad fits under that act. The amendments made by this section are effective (under sec. 6 of the bill) with respect to annuities accruing and deaths occurring after the month in which the bill is enacted. Section 4. Increase in base for tax purposes Section 4 of the bill amends sections 3201, 3202, 3211, and 3221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (the Railroad Retirement Tax Act) to make the same increase in the maximum monthly compensa\u00ad tion which may be counted for purposes of railroad retirement taxes (effective with respect to months after the month in which the bill is enacted) as section 3 of the bill makes for purposes of benefit computa\u00ad tion. These amendments satisfy the requirement imposed by section 111(e)(2) of the Social Security Amendments of 1965; i.e., by in\u00ad creasing the maximum amount of monthly compensation taxable under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act to one-twelfth of the* maximum wages which the Federal Insurance Contributions Act provides may be counted, they permit the program of hospital insurance benefits for the aged (under pt. A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act) to be administered with respect to railroad retirement annuitants by the Railroad Retirement Board rather than by the Social Security Administration. Section 5. Ch~anges in tax rates Subsection (a) of section 5 of the bill amends section 3201 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (the Railroad Retirement Tax Act) to reduce the present basic tax rate on employees from 7~1 percent to 6%4 percent (effective with respect to compensation paid for services rendered after September 30, 1965), with gradual increases in such rate thereafter as follows: (1) To 6% percent with respect to compensation paid for services rendered after December 31, 1965; (2) To 61,. percent with respect to compensation paid for services rendered after December 31, 1966; (3) To 7 percent with respect to compensation paid for services rendered after December 31, 1967; and AMENDMENTS TO RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT 11 (4) To 7% percent with respect to compensation paid for services rendered after December 31, 1968. Under this section, there is added to this basic tax rate an additional tax equal for each month to the excess of social security tax rates over 2%4 percent. Subsection (b) of section 5 makes the same changes proportionately, with respect to tax rates on employee representatives, as were made by subsection (a) with respect to tax rates on employees, beginning with 12' 2 percent for the 3-month period September-December 1965 and ending with 14' 2 percent with respect to compensation paid for serv\u00ad ices rendered after 1968. Subsection (c) of section 5 makes the same changes in tax rates for railroad employers -as were made by subsection (a) for railroad employees. Section 6. Effective dates Section 6 of the bill provides the effective dates for the various amendments made by the preceding sections of the bill. (Each such effective date is indicated in the discussion above of the provision to which it relates.) CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW MADE BY THE BILL, AS REPORTED In compliance with clause 3 of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives, changes in existing law made by the bill, as reported, are shown as follows (existing law proposed to be omitted is enclosed in black brackets, new matter is printed in italics, existing law in which no change is proposed is shown in roman): RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT OF 1937 DEFINITIONS SECTION 1. For the purposes of this Act\u00ad (h) (1) The term \"compensation\" means any form of money remuneration paid to an individual for services rendered as an em\u00ad ployee to one or more employers, or as an employee representative, including remuneration paid for time lost as an employee, but re\u00ad muneration paid for time lost shall be deemed earned in the month in which such time is lost. Such term does not include tips (except as is provided under paragraph (2)), or the voluntary payment by an employer, without deduction from the remuneration of the em\u00ad ployee, of any tax now or hereafter imposed with respect to the compensation of such employee. For the purposes of determining monthly compensation and years of service and for the purposes of subsections (a), (c), and (d) of section 2 and subsection (a) of sec\u00ad tion 5 of this Act, compensation earned in the service of a local lodge or division of a railway-labor-organization employer shall be disre\u00ad garded with respect to any calendar month if the amount thereof is less than $3 and (1) such compensation is earned between December 31, 1936, and April 1, 1940, and taxes thereon pursuant to section 2(a) and 3(a) of the Carriers Taxing Act of 1937 or sections 1500 and 1520 of the Internal Revenue Code are not paid prior to July 1, 12 AMENDMENTS TO RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT 1940; or (2) such compensation is earned after March 31, 1940. A payment made by an employer to an individual through the employer's pay roll shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be compensation for service rendered by such individual as an employee of the employer in the period with respect to which the pay\u00ad ment is made. An employee shall be deemed tobe paid, \"for time lost\" the amount he is paid by an employer with respect to an identifiable period of absence from the active service of the employer, including absence on account of personal injury, and the amount he is paid by the employer for loss of earnings resulting from his displacement to a less remunerative position or occupation. If a payment is made by an employer with respect to a personal injury and includes pay for time lost, the total payment shall be deemed to be paid for time lost unless, at the time of payment, a part of such payment is specifically apportioned to factors other than time lost, in which event only such part of the payment as is not so apportioned shall be deemed to be paid for time lost.

By Mr. HARRIS SEPTEMn3ER 3, 1965 Referred to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce SEPTEMBER 10, 1965 Reported with amendments, committed to the Com\u00ad mittee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, and ordered to be printed 22778 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ---HOUSE September 14, 1965 AMENDMENTIS TO RAILROAD RE9\u00ad TIREMENT ACT OF 1937 AND RAIIROAD RF1IREMENT TAX ACT Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I1 ask unanimous consent that the Committee of the Whale House on the State of the Union be discharged from further con\u00ad sideration of the. bill, H.R. 10874, to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 to-eliminate the provisions which reduce spouses' annuities by the amount of certain monthly benefits, to increase the base on which railroad retirement benefits and taxes are computed, and to change the rates of tax under the Rail\u00ad road Retirement Tax Act, and ask for its immediate consideration. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ar\u00ad kansas? Mr. SPRINGER. Mr. Speaker, reserv\u00ad ing the right to object, will the chairman Please explain the bill? Mr. HARRIS. Very briefly, Mr. Speak\u00ad er, this is an emergency. It may be recalled that some time ago the committee reported and the House approved a bill to do away with the so-called dual provisions applicable to a spouse of a railroad employee. The bill went to the other body. The social security and medicare bill came along, and made modifications which drastically changed some of the provi\u00ad sions of the Railroad Retirement Act. As a result thereof, the Senate commit\u00ad tee conducted hearings and reported what has been commonly referred to as the Pell amendment. That amendment provided an additional tax,, which orig\u00ad inated in the other body. It is well known that under the rules of the House any provision for a tax should initiate in the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives. That created somewhat of a contro\u00ad versy. In addition, the provision in the Pell amendment seemed to be displeas\u00ad ing to a great many people. Under the circumstances, and because October 1 Is the deadline for action to be taken, or the admilnistration of this phase of the medicare program affecting railroad retirees will go to the Social Se\u00ad curity Administration, our committee conducted hearings on this bill and bas reported a bill which has for its pur\u00ad pose a reduction of taxes beginning Oc\u00ad tober 1 for a period of 3 months, of 1 percent on each side, and one-fourth of 1 percent for each year for the following 4 years, to get back to what would be the case under the Pell amendment. At the same time, this would Increase the requirement under the social securi\u00adty medicare program on the taxable base from the present $5,4&0 to $6,600. This will equalize the tax impact on both the employees and the employers, and ultimately, over a period of 4 years,will graduate it to the point that the benefits will remain the same and there\u00ad by meet the requirements of the social security medicare program. It will give us a program which will be satisfactory both to-railroad employers and em\u00ad ployees. 22779 -September 14, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -HOUSE Because of the emergency phase We have ask~ed that it be considered under ts cithisroceure.pears GENtE5AL LEAVE Mr. SPRINGER.

Mr. President, the House passed a bill, H.R. 3157, on June 7, 1965,which would have eliinifated the re- striction placed on railroad retiree's spouzses denying pus' udrthe ul enft Railroad Retirement Act in addition to any benefits under social security due them in their own right, In light of a provision in the recently enacted Social Security Amendments of 1965 relating to the administration of the hospital insurance program, it wasnecssrytoamend H.R. 3157 to increase the taxable wage base unader railroad re-tirement from $5,400 to $6,600 per year. Th Snae tisprpoalfully ebte and passed the bill as amended by a,vote of 88 to 0, on September 1, 1965. During the course of the Senate de- bate, the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. LowG] raised a point of order with regard to the constitutionality of the amend- ment to H.R. 3157. HMs view was that the amendment was a revenue raising measure originating in the Senate and thus violative of article I, section 7 of the U.S. Constitutioh which delegates such authority to the House. It was pointed out by myself and the Senator from Oregon [Mr. MORSE] that the Senate clearly has the constitutional authority to initiate measures which may incidentally raise revenue in pur- suit of some broader objective. There is ample Precedent for such action bythe Senate, and the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld this authority in two cases which I cited during the course of that debate-Twin City Bank v. Nebeker, 167 U.S. 196, and Millard v. Roberts, 202 U.S. 429. The Senate sustained our position byrejecting the point of order, 41 to 44. Now we have before us H.R. 10874, a clean bill introduced after the Senate's action on H.R. 3157, which embodies all of the provisions of the latter plus pro- visions to reduce the tax rate assessed against railroad employers and em- PloYees. This would reduce the finan.. cial impact on both pa~rties of raising the taxabie wage base. In fact, reducing the tax rate by the amount this new bill does, will save both parties $10.7 million in the last quarter of 1965--before the wage base raise becomes effective. This is a sound compromise which will benefit all concerned, and as'such, I urge its adop-tion in this body. I am particularly con- cerned, because of the time factor, that we act quickly so as to meet the statu- tory deadline of October 1 in order to allow the Railroad Retirement Board to administer the hospital insurance pro- gram with regard to railroad retirees. Mr. President, my desire to act favor- ably on H.R. 10874 at this time, should in no way be construed as a change in my position respecting the authority in the Senate to initiate measures which may incidentally raise revenue in the furtherance of their main purpose. Wedo have that authority, and any action that we may take on H.R. 10874, does not have any bearing upon that issue, As the then majority leader, Mr. Johin- son, of Texas, stated with regard, to a similar measure on May 5, 1959: In my mind there is no doubt about the power of the Senate to ini-tiate such a measure. The Supreme Court has long held that the Senate can initiate and can pass general legislation which con- talns, as an incidental feature, a revenue Provision. sousesI am in complete accord with that view. Mr. President, I urge passage of this measure. Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? Mr. PELL. I yield. Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, Ishall be very brief. I took the position during the process of debate on the point Mr. PELL. 'I yield. Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, I extend Once More to the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. PELL] my compliments for the manner in which he has carried this legislation through to the point of final enactment tonight. H-e has done an ex\u00ad ceptionally fine job. As a result of his Perseverence, we are now about to pass a bill that will greatly Improve the retirement benefits for rail\u00ad road workers and for their spouses. Mr. President, what we are doing to\u00ad night is, in effect, somewhat similar to what we did back in 1959 when I was chairman of the Subeomniittee on Rail\u00adroad Retirement. We then passed a billin the Senate. Some question was raised as to whether we had the constitutional Power to pass the bill. Some of us pointed out then that. the so-called rev\u00ad enue features were incidental and sub\u00ad sidiary, and we made our constitutional argument then. The Senator from Rhode Island has already pointed out that the now Presi\u00ad dent of the United States, who has been the majority leader of the Senate of the United States, tobk the position that was no transgression on the con\u00adstitutional prerogative of the House of Representatives so far as the revenue-raising legislative features in article I, section 7, of the Constitution are con\u00ad cerned. A few days ago the constitutional is\u00ad sue was raised again in the Senate in cneto ihtebl htwspseby the winth. the boild that wSepassed from Rhode Island .[Mr. PELL] and of order about whether a point of orderotesitanghepiintatwhd was legitimate, that the bill itself was dead unless that point of order was sustained, Having served in the House, I know how jealous Representatives are of their prerogative on these tax-raising and tax- lowering measures. At least to that ef- fect, I am proved right. The point as to whether It is constitu- tional or unconstitutional because it originated in the Senate has not yet been decided. The bill was rejected by the House and the House sent back to the Senate a new bill, I am delighted that the bill will passshortly. I introduced a companion bill in the Senate originally. I have worked on it and fought for it. The measure is de- signed to try to take care of the particu- lar needs and deficits In the law regard- ing spouses of railroad employees. The measure will cure the defect. it will also do, as I understand it, what the railway labor association 'wants, which i~to raise the taxable base sufficiently so that the administration of the medicare provisions will be under its jurisdiction, We have a rather reasonable com- promise, even though the tax rate over a period of 4 years will go back to where It is now and the burden-on the employeeand the employer will be much higher at that point. During the interim period, there will be opportunity for adjustment. 'I am happy that the bill will pass in this man- ner.- I thank the Senator. Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? the constitutional authority to pass the legislation in the form in which we passed it. That question was put to the SenatefoavtebthPrsdnOfi cer of for aevote. byThe PrnaesidtingeOfi the psthen Senate thoe Seat sustainedh held that we had the constitutional au\u00ad thority to pass the bill. The House has now done pretty much what It did back in 1959, analogously, and now it sends to us a new bill, in effect, with some modifications of the Senate bill. However, the modifications do not in any way detract from the ob\u00ad jectives of the original Fell bill. I believe that it is a fair adjustment of the differences bteween the two bodies In regard to the substantive legislative features of the two bills. I am very much in support of our agreeing, as the Senator from Rhode Island now proposes, to accept the sub\u00ad stance of the House bill. Mrt. President, the pages of the CON\u00ad GRESSIONAL RacoRD that we are now making In this debate will be read for some years to come. They will be read whenever there is raised again the ques\u00ad tion as to whether a bill that is passed by the Senate has, as an Incidental char\u00ad acteristic or provision thereof, some rev\u00ad enue feature that might conceivably be in violation of the Constitution of the United States and an encroachment upon the prerogatives of the House of Representatives. The Supreme Court in the cases that I1 cited the other day made perfectly clear what the answer to the constitui\u00ad tional. question really is. Neither the September 15, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL.

As the ranking majority member of the Committee on F'inance, I -am well aware- and it has been the experience of the. com- mitte-that -the House of Representatives has consistently refused even to consider a tax measure that originated in this body, so much so that I d6 not recall an Instance,during the period of my membership, when the Senate has even made an effort to origi- nate a tax bill. The pending measure is a House bill, but is not a revenue bill. Mr. PELL. The bill is not yet before the Senate.Mr. LoNG of Louisiana. I am sorry; I thought the bill was before the Senate.

Then, Mr. Presi-Act from $450. to $5350 a Month, is incidental to the main purpose of the bill, which Is to grant benefits to the spouses. of railroad retirees.In fact, in the annotated copy of the Con\u00ad stitution, which all Senators 1~ave, and which was prepared by the legislative reference service, I note the statement that only bills to levy taxes in the strict sense of the word are comprehended by the phrase \"all bills raising revenue.\" Bills for other purposes which incidentally create revenues are not included. As an example, a case is cited wherein a bill which provided that the Dis\u00ad trict of Columbia should raise by taxation and pay to designated railroad companies a specific sum for the elimination of grade crossings and the construction of the union railroad station did not have to originate in the House of Representatives.Other cases decided by the Supreme Court are in point: In Twin City Bank v. Nebeker, a case dealing with a tax on bonds used to secure the national currency, the Court held that revenue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict sense of the word, and are not bills for other purposes which may Incidentally create revenue. The purpose of this amendment is corol\u00adlsry to the purpose of the bill, an~d my pmi\u00ad ciple objective is to provide some method for maintaining the deficit in the Railroad Re\u00ad tirement Flund at a tolerable level. With\u00ad out this amendment, the deficit will rise to approximately $62 million per year; with It. we can reduce the deficit to about $24 mil\u00ad-lion. Mr. President, at this, point, I ask unani\u00ad mous consent to have printed in the RECORD a brief concerning the case I have already cited.. Twin City Bank v. Nebeker. Another case, too, is cited; that of Millard v. Roberts. There being no objection, the excerpt was -ordered to be printed in the DCSO FTEUS \"xEP RMTEDcSO FTEU5 SUPREME COURT IN THE CASE OF TWIN CITY SANK V. NV-EEER, 167 U.S. 19e. ..The contention in this case is that the section of the act of June 3, 1864, providing a national currency secured by a pledge of U.S. bonds, and for the circulation and re\u00ad demption thereof, so far as it imposed a tax upon the average amount of the notes of a national banking association in circulation, was a revenue bill within the clause of the Constitution declaring that 'all bills for raising revenues shall originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may pro\u00ad pose or concur with amendments as on other bills' (art. 1, sec. '7); that it appeared from the official- Journals of the two Houses of Congress that while the act of 1864 origi\u00ad nated In the House of Representatives, the provision imposing this tax was not in the bill as it passed that body, but originated in the Senate by amendment, and, being ac\u00ad cepted by the House, became a part of the statute; that such tax was, therefore, uncon\u00adstitutional and void, and that, consequently. the statute did not justify the action of the defendant. \"The case is not one that requires either- an extendled examination of precedents, or a full discussion as to the meaning of thewodinheosiuin,'lsfrriigod nteCnttto,'il o asn revenue.'

Mr. Justice Story has well said that the practical construlctionl of the Constitution and the history of the origin of the constitutional provision In ques- tion proves that revenue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict sense of the word and are not bills for other purposes which may incidentally create revenue. (P. 202.)\" \"EXCERPT FROM THE DECISION OF H u.s. SUPREME COURT IN THE CASE OF MILLARD V. ROBERTS, 202 'U.S. 429 \"The'first contention of appellant Is that the acts of Congress are revenue measures, and therefore, should have originated in the House of Representatives and not In the Sen- ate, and to sustain the contention appellantsubmits an elaborate argument. In answer to the contention the case of Twine City, Bankc v. Nebeker, 167 U.S. 190, need only be cited, It Wan observed there that It Was a part Of wisdom not to attempt to cover by a gea- eral statement what bill shall be said to be 'bills for raising revenue' within the mean- ing of those words in the Constitution, but It wan said, quoting Mr. Justice Story, 'that the practical construction of the Constitu- tion and the history of the origin of. the con- stitutional provision in question proves that revenue bills are. those that levy, taxes in the* strict sense of the word, and are not hills for other purposes, which may inci- dentally create revenue.' (1 Story on Con-stitution, see. 880.) And the act of Congress which was there passed on illustrates the meaning of the language used. The act Iin- volved wan one providing a national cur- rency, and imposed a tax upon the average amount of notes of a national b~anking as-. sociation In circulation. The provision was assailed for unconstitutionality because It originated in the Senate. The provision wan sustained, this Court saying: \"'The tax was a means of effectually ac- complishing the great object of giving to the people a currency that would rest, primarily, upon the honor of the United States an be available in every part of the country, There wan no purpose, by the act or by any of its Provisions, to raise revenue to be ap- plied In meeting the expenses or obligations of the Government.! ,\"Thin language Is applicable to the acts Of Congress in the case at bar. Whatever taxes are imposed are but means to the purposs provided by the act (pp. 436-437?) .\" Mr. PELL. Mr. President, a further point I wish to raise is that any money raised by thin amendment does not go Into the General 'Treasury, but rather goes to a special railrad retirement fund. Revenue is defined in Webster's New International Dictionary as: .,The annual or periodical yield of taxes, exie customs, duties, rents, etc., which a nation, State, or municipality collects and receives into the treasury for public use;public income of whatever kind.\" Insofar as the funds that would be raised byths medmntar pivtepesin fr fund, I do not see any constitutional Pro- hibition against Its origination in the Senate. Finally, I submit that from the viewpoint of Precedent, we have already passed legisla- tion similar to tlhis; that in 1959 the Senate originated a raise in the base of the taxable Income, Passed It, end sent it to the House,which changed it to a House number but -Passed a bill in Identical form, including a misplaced comma, and sent It back to the Sente.move At that point, various Senators rose to de- plore the action of the House, and to defend the constitutionality of the original action of the Senate, including the then majority leader, Senator johnson., of Texas, and in- cluding the present majority whip, the Sen- ator from Louisiana [Mr. LONe] and Other Senators. For these reason$, Mr. President, I Submit that We are Within our rights in pajssing this amendment as a method to keep the system fiscally sound, which it Certainly is not at this time, Mr. President. I yield the floor. Mr. MORSE. Mr. President- The PREsIDiNa OFwxcEa (Wr. JORDAN of Idaho in the chair). The Senator from Ore- gon is recognized. Mr. MOanSE.

Enactmeiit by the Senate on May 5. 1959, of S. 226. provided for increases In tax rates unader the Railroad Retirement Tax Act to cover the additional benefits provided by the bill. A House companion bill had been re- ported to, but not enacted by the House. The House reported bill was approved by the 'H~ouse Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. but was unacceptable to railroad labor because the House approved bill failed to provide sufficient revenue and contained other unac ceptable, provisions. When the satisfactory Senate bill S. 226 reached the House floor, it was F-dopted-by the House in substitution for the House reported bill. NO constitutional question was raised by the House, at that time. It wan known, however, that President Eisenhower would veto the bill; and It wan also known that If the bill were vetoed on its merits, the veto would be overridden by both Houses of Congress--at least, that wan the belief, It was feared, however, that if the Presi- dent were to veto the bill because It had a Senate number, some Members of the House might be inclined into following the position of accepting the veto. Th avoid this, a Mem- ber of the House moved, a few days later, to vacate the previous House action, and then moved to strike from the House-reported bill all after the enacting clause and insert In lieu thereof the Senate provision. This was done. and the enacted bill with a House number was reenacted by the Senate on May 5, 1959. At that time I was chairman of the sub- committee of the Senate on railroad retire- ment occupying the same position which tie Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. PELL] oc- cuples today. The majority leader was the Senator fro Texas, Mr. Johnson. The majority leader and I thought that the whole procedure was unnecessary from the standpoint of parlia- mentary requirement. Nevertheless, we agreed. to go along with it, because our ob- jective wan to get the bill passed. I believe It Is important that there be read Into the RECORD at this time-because I be- lieve It is of controlling and precedentialvalue-the discussion which -took place at that time, because in my judgment, If S. 226 on May 5. 1959, wan not unconstitutional, the bill before us today is not unconstitu- tional. For all intents and purposes, the substan- tive objectives are the same. I read from the RECORD of May 5, 1959, starting on page 7472: \"AMENDMENTr OF THE RILROA Owxcsa. The question Iigon agreeing to the motion of the Senator from Texas. \"The motion was agreed to; and the Senate Proceeded to consider the bill (H.R. 5610) to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, the Railroad Retirement Tax Act, and the Railroad unemployment Insurance Act, so as to provide increases in benefits, and for other purpoes, which wan read the first time by title end the second time at length. \"Mr. JOHNsoN of Texas. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the Senator from Oregon [Mr. MORSE], let me say that the House passed, on May 4, H.R. 5610, which amends the Railroad Retirement Act. Hi.P 5610 is Identical with Senate bill 226, which wan passed by the Senate on April 29, alnd which had been reported by the Senator from Oregon [Mr. MORSE]. \"The House adopted every line, every word, every punctuation mark in the Senate bill- including a misplaced quotation mark. \"I am informed that the House took that action because the bill contained a revenue feature, inasmuch an the bill increases the rate of tax on employers, and employees under the railroad retirement system. How\u00ad ever, the tax-increase provision Is only one of many changes effected by the bill in the railroad retirement law. \"Senate bill 226, as passed by the Sen\u00ad ate, Is not primarily a tax measure. The increase in tax is only part of a bill which Is designed to provide much-needed increases in the benefits under the act. In My mind, there Is. no doubt about the constitutional power of the Senate to Initiate such a mess\u00ad ure. The Supreme Court has long held that the Senate can Initiate and can pass general legislation which contains, an an Incidental feature, a revenue provision. The case of Millard v. Roberts, decided In 1906, Is ape\u00ad cifi on this point. The annotated oonati\u00ad tution, compiled by Professor Corwin, Con\u00ad tains numerous citations in support of this view. \u00ad \"I have conferred with the distinguished chairmen of the subcommittee who handled the bill, the Senator from Oregon [Mr. MoansE]. It Is our conclusion that we do not wish to quibble over the matter; we are primarily concerned with sending this pro- Posed legislation to the President at an early date. In our judgment, the power of the Senate to initiate and to dispose of proposed legislation such as Senate bill 226 is clear and beyond any doubt; and we do not Intend to delay the taking of final action on this matter by arguing the procedural question. It Is far more Important to the railroad workers that such a bill be passed and go to the President and be signed by him into law, conferring with th eao rmOeona1 te ebr of the Committee, I urge immedi5,te Senate consideration of House bill 5010, which Is Identical in every respect with Senate biUl 226, which wan passed by the Senate on April 29, I believe, by unanimous vote. \"Mr. President, I yield now to the Senator from Oregon, so that he may make whatever Comments he desires to make, and that then the Senate may perhaps take action on the bill. \"Mr. JoHNSON of Texas.

The chairman of the subcommittee, in citing this brief, calls attention to the U.S. Supreme Court case of Twin City Bank v. Nebeker, 167 U.S. 196.

The Court said: \"The contention in this case is that the section of the act of June 3, 1864, providing a national currency secured by a pledge of U.S. bonds, and for the circulation,, and re- demption thereof, so far as it imposed a lation.

Whatever taxes are imposed are but means to the purposes provided by the act.\" Without taking the time to read the mem\u00adorandum, I ask unanimous consent that an- Other memorandum be Inserted In the RECORD which discusses this constitutional question, citing additional cases, not only the Nebeker case and the Roberts case, but citing also the House of Representatives in regard to this matter. There is a series of precedents, even from the House, which recognize that in a situa\u00adtion such as this, It is not a revenue bill, because the so-called tax or revenue features are not controlling, but incidental thereto. I have no doubt that the Senator from Rhode Island is right when, as chairman of the subcommittee, he asks the Senate to sustain the bill on constitutional grounds. There being no objection, the memo\u00ad randumn was ordered to be printed In the RECORD, as follows: ,MEMOAosNDUaM: rnTH SENATE COMaMrrrxsa RovidigEa \"It is well established by both judicial and legislative precedents that measures origi\u00adnating in the Senate whose general Purpose is within the jurisdiction of the Senate Government but for a specific purpose related to the general purpose of the measure. \"Article 1, section 7 of the Constitution provides: 'All bills for raising revenue shall originate In the House of Representatives;, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.' \"Justice Story, in his 'Commentaries on the Constitution,' traced the origin of article 1, section 7 to the British Parliamentary'sys\u00adtemn where tax revenue measures, there known as 'money bills,' could originate onlyin the House of Commons.

I did not feel there was any doubt whatsoever that the Senate had authority to consider this bill originally and send it to the House. I do Indeed concur In the opinion expressed by the majority leader; but, In the interest of felicity as between the two Houses, if this is what it takes in order to expedite action, certainly I have no objec- tion. \"Mr. LoNo. Mr. President- \"Mr. JOHNSON of Texas.

Mr. President, as one of those who greatly admire the majority leader, I hope he is not going to permit the House, in matters of this sort, continually to down- grade the Senate. This type of procedure can hardly be more than an excuse for the House to claim to be the author of legislation byacting first. If the House had proceeded ex- peditiously, it could have acted first on this measure, rather then second, as it has. Then for beingathe bodyh ionsits bill first came up In the Committee on Labor -tax upon the average amount of the notes of a national banking association in circula- tion, was a revenue bill within the clause of the Constitution declaring that -all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills,' (art. 1, sec. 7); that it appeared from the official Journals of the two Houses of Congress that while the act of 1864 originated in the House of Repre- sentatives, the provision imposing this tax was not In the bill as it passed that body, but originated in the Senate by amendment, and, being accepted by the House, became a part of the statute; that such tax was, there- fore, unconstitutional and void, and that, consequently, the statute did not justify the action of the defendant. \"The case Is not one that requires either an extended examination of precedents, or a full discusion. as to the meaning of the words In the Constitution, 'bills for raising revenue.'

Norton, 91 U.S. 569, 23 L.. ad. 454 (1876), the Issue arose as to whether the act creating the postal money order system was a bill to raise revenue, under article 1, section 7. The contention was made that it was a bill to raise revenue since It provided .thatI the Postmaster General was authorized to use a peart of the moneys collected to pay poet office employees. .nue; \"The Supreme Court, however, applying Justice Story's definition of what constituted a bill for raising revenue, rejected the con- tention. The Court reasoned that since the primary purpose of the act was not to raise revenue, indeed Congrass showed 'a willing-' ness to sink money, if necessary, to accom.- plish that purpose,' the act was not 'made for the direct and avowed purpose of creat- Ing revenue or public funds for the service of the Government,' and was, therefore, not a bill to raise revenue within the meaning of article 1, section 7. \"In Twin City National Bank v. Nebelcer, 167 U.S. 196, 42 L. ad. 134 (1897), a coniten- tion was made that the act providing for a national currency was unconstitutional since that part of the act which imposed a tax upnteamount of notes held by a national banking association was originated in the Senate and the tax amounted to a bill to raise revenue under article 1, section 7. \"The Court, however, after setting forth Justice Story's definition of a revenue bill, for the use of the Government. and to give to the persons from whom the money is 01- acted no equivalent in return, unless in the enjoyment In common with the rest of the citizens of the benefit of good government.'\"I (8 Cannon's Precedents of the House of Representatives, sec. 2278 (1936)). \"2. On May 4, 1922, the Speaker was called upon to deside whether a bill banning the Importation of narcotics was a revenue bill since it also had provision for the raising of revenue.

On December 18, 1920,.the~ Speaker was called upon to decide whether a Senate res- olution reviving the, activities 'of the war Finance Corporation constituted a revenue bill. During the ensuing debate a Member of the House stated: -[Article 1, section 7 of the Constitution] provides that bills for the purpose of raising revenue shall originate In the House of Rep- resentatives. It does not provide that laws which take the effect and which will have the effect either of raising, revenue or pro- ducing a deficit shall originate in the House * * * No one can tell whether the psae of this resolution, ifi hl ecarried out in the spirit of the resolution, will produce revenue of produce a deficit.

Roberts, 202 U.S. 429, 50 L. ad. 1090 (1908), the Senate Initiated an act which required certain railroads to eliminate grade crossings and to construct a railroad depot. A sum of money was to be paid to the railroads to be raised by the levy of a tax on the property of area residents. The Court, relying on its decision In Twin CityNational Bank v.

Mr. LO6NG of Louisiana. Mr. President. the Senator from Oregon made reference to arguments I made myself. involving thiis general problem. I made that arumn altar hearing the statement by the then majority leader,- Mr. Johnson, in the very case the senator from Oregon is citing as a precedent, but said that where the Senate originated a bill inserting a tax, the House declined to send the bill beck to the Senate, ut, instead, passed its own bill, sent that bill to the Senate, and the Senate pasethat bill. The very case the Senator from Oregon cites, including my statement, shows that the House should ac flrst If the Senator from Oregon in right in what he says, the Finance Committee would have had a right to originate the social se- curity bill and the medicare bill. The Sen-ate Finance Committee agreed so strongly to the contrary that our chairman and the oom- mittee declined to hold hearings onl that bill until the House acted and sent the Senate a binl. This year, in this session, the Senate sent to the House a bill, S. 1734, to conserve and protect domestic fisheries. In connection with that bill the Senate Imposed a 50 per- Cent tax to protect fisheries, The House sent the Senate back a blue sheet, which In pollte language stated that the bill \"in the opinion of this House Con- the first clause of the seventh sec tion. of the first article of the Constitu~tion of the United States, and Is an infringement Of the Privileges of this House, and that the said bill be respectfully returned to the Sen-ate.\"- That is What happened. The Senate sent back a polite message to the effect that this was not correct procedure and \"here is your bill back.\" The House re-turned the bill, which it had a perfect right to do.IthSeaeddgreiMy199too This particular measure imposes a tax of. about $90 million. In my opinion, that in- volves much more than Incidental revenue. I am not arguing about the necessity of the tax. It may well be necessary tW have it, and that we will do it in due course, When revenues are to be raised, those measures should originate In the House. The Senate Committee on Finance sometimes has to wait 3 months for the House to send to the Senate revenue bills so the Senate may act on them. Religiously and respectfully,the Finance Committee respects the House of Representatives in respect to the Consti-tution; and circumspect as we are, we feel We should show the same consideration and lnsist on the same consideration for others who have the same responsibllity we have. Mr. President, this matter. was discussed With the policy committee. Alter we dis\u00adcussed it, it was agreed that a point of Order unuld be made by the polity committee on this side of the aisle. This Senator, as a ranking member of the Pinance Conmmittee, as well as being a mem\u00adher of the policy committee, believes it to be his responsibility and duty to do so. but I do not stand alona. I hope the Senate will stand with those of us-who take this view on revenue bills, in connection with a bill which is not a revenue bil, both in connection with the precedents laid down, which have already been. men\u00ad tioned--and even the Senator's case which he cites as a precedent Sustains that Posd\u00adtlon-and will consider the House's point of view that this is a tax on a nonrevenue bill. Mr. Mossr. Mr. President, I wish to reply briefly to the point made by my friend the Senator from Louisiana. I am completely lost in his maze of comments concerning the action taken on May 5, 1959, as being a prece\u00ad dent for his present position. I read every word spoken on the floor of the Senate on' May 5, 1959. It was perfectly obvious that the Senate did not take the position that the. House had a constitutional right to originate this particular measure. The language of the Senator from Louisiana makes It crystal clear that that was not the position he took on May S. 1959. On -the contrary, the Senator was for leaving the Senate bill. He suggested to the majority leader that we should not go along With the objections because, In the view of the Senator from Louisiana, that would be downgrading the Senate. In May 5, 1959, the Senator from Louisiana thought the railroad retirement bill was set but in the proper framework of a Senate bill and he was for passing the Senate bill, not the House bill. The point was raised in that debate very clearly that the Senate did not recognize any constitutional right of the House to originate all those bills in the first Instance. It was perfectly clear :from thp statements of the then majority leader. Mr. Johnson, the chair\u00adman of the subcommittee which handled the railroad retirement bill. the senior Senator from Oregon, and the minority leader, that we were not going to take the House bill on any constitutional right of the House, but because we recognized the parliamentary realities that confronted the Senate, and that we had a better chance of getting the bill on the books. But there is no prece\u00ad dent, by the alightest stretch of the imnagi\u00adnation, in the May 5, 1959, Case, that there was any admission on the part of the Senate that the Houes -had the constitutional right to originate the bill. This was what we call accommodation between the two Houses. There was no waiver of the right of the Sen\u00ad ate to originate the legislation. That is perfectly clear. Let me say If that action is a Precedent- It doss not have the slightest relevancy, but i h eaeddarei a 99 odthat-it does not rewrite the Constitution of the United States. We cannot amend the Constitution of the United States by decreeing on the floor of the Senate that a bill is a revenue bill. That is a question of law. All the Senate did was to parllamentarily accommodate the House of Representatives On May 5, 1959, In order to have a railroad retirement bill passed. The chairman of the Railroad Retirement Committee and Mr. Johnson, the then-majority leader of the Senate, and Mr. Dmms~ss, as the minority leader of the Senate agreed among themselves that that would be an appropriate parliamen\u00ad tary procedure to follow. 23044 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE September 15, 1965 Let the senior Senator from Oregon state again for the RxcoaD, because it will be read 10, 15, 20 years from now, that not a word can be found in the May 5, 1959, RxCORD Of any admission on the part of the Senate that it had encroached upon the power of 0e, House of Representatives in that it had initiated a revenue bill. To the contrary, it was our position that it was not a revenue bill within the meaning of article I, section '7 of the Constitution of the United States, referred to by Justice Story In the Nebeker case, from which I have al- ready quoted at length. There Is before the Senate the clear issue of whether or not the Senate is going to send the bill back to committee, or to some other committee, or refuse to take action on it be- cause of a point of order, because we have said once again, acting as \"Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court\" that article I, section 7 of the Constitution of the United States would be violated thereby. Let us face up to the issue. If there is any real question about the constitution- ality of the bill, let us pass It and let the Supreme Court decide it. I tell Senators, in my judgment, the decision that will be rendered. There will be an even briefer decision than Justice Story rendered in the Nebeker case. The Court will dismiss it in a paragraph or two, unless it recites the Nebeker case and also the Roberts case, at the time the leader of the Senate referred to when the position was taken on May 5, 1955, that a constitutional question was not involved. It is my opinion-and every Senator IS en- titled to his opinion-that this adds up to a parliamentary maneuver to avoid a deci- sion on the substantive merits of the amend- ment. I am ready to vote on the substan- tive merits of the amendment. I am per- fectly willing to vote on the substantive merits because I am satisfied the bill Is constitutional. I have great respect for my colleagues in the Senate, but I prefer to walk a few steps from the Senate of the United States to that great cathedral of justice, the U.S. Su- preme Court building, for constitutional rulings. I am satisfied what that ruling would be if the bill were passed, and whether or not the Senate, in passing it, acted constitution- ally. The Supreme Court will render a decision that the so-called tax features of the bill are incidental thereto and do not constitute a revenue measure in the sense that a reve- nue measure must originate in the House. Mr. LONG of Louisiana. I do not quarrel with the Senator on this matter, If he had a different interpretation of the Constitution than I hold, when it says reve- nue bills shall originate in the House, so far as I am concerned, that applies to the $90 million tax. He is entitled to his opin- ion, and I am entitled to my opinion. A Senator should vote to uphold the Constitu- tion of the United States. I do not have to vote for something I think is uniconstltu- tional and rely upon the Supreme Court to tell me I did an unconstitutional act and save me from my own mischief. If I believe it is wrong I should abide by my oath. That is my judgment. The Senator said that it did not create a precedent for what we are doing here. I heard the majority leader say that we had not done an unconstitutional act. The House took the attitude that we had. Hay- ing proceeded to say that we had not done anything unconstitutional, we then pro- ceeded to act. as though we had. We passed the House bill. The House bill was enacted into law and signed by the President. We went along with the argument of the House on the House contention that we had done something unconstitutional. We said, in effect, that we had not done something un- constitutional, but said to the House, in effect, \"Even so, we will do It your way.\" So far as the merits of the amendment are concerned, what we are talking about here Is a matter of increasing the tax base and Increasing the tax on the working people and on the railroads. It means that the average workingman would have to pay $10 a month more to get the benefits of the mediCare proposal that we added to the social security bill, which was passed re- cently. Am I stating the situation correctly? Mr. PELL. That is not completely correct. The tax would be paid half and half by the railroad industry and by those workers who earn more than $450 a month. It would not cover hospital care through railroad retire- ment or social security. There would be, however, other benefits, Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Would it cover medical benefits? Mr. PinL. It would not. Mr. LONG of Louisiana. In any event, this is a major tax increase. It is something that we can take care of later in the session or next year. It ought to be considlered In connection with a revenue bill. The bill before us is not a revenue bill. I hold in my hand another bill, which the House in all propriety, in my judgment, based on the precedents that have been in effect in the time that I have been a senator, declined to consider. The bill concerns fisheries. We imposed a tax, and the House politely sent the bill back to us. I am sure the Senator would not say that the House took the wrong attitude. The House of Representatives has consistently acted in this fashion, at least while I have been a Member of the Senate. There is that precedent even in the 1959 debate, to which reference has been made. The House sent S. 1734 back to us with a polite note, re- jecting it. Mr. PELL. In this connection there should be printed in the RaCORD a letter from the Executive Office of the President, Bureau of the Budget, addressed to the committee which says: \"W r poe oti esras is the Railroad Retirement Board. However, we understand that you have Introduced an amendment to this bill which would equate the wage base of the railroad retirement system to that of the social security system. We believe this provision Is desirable not only because it will assist in keeping the rail- road retirement and social security systems in step but because it will assist in main- taining the financial soundness of the rail- road retirement system. We hope that this provision will receive favorable considera- tion by your committee.\" I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD at this point the entire letter from the Bureau of the Budget. There being no objection, the letter was Ordered to be printed in the RmCORD, as follows: EXECUTIVE OrrcE OF THE PRESIDENT, BUREAU OF THlE BUDGET, Washington, D.C., August 31, 1965. Hon.

We believe this provision is desirable not only because it will assist in keeping the railroad retirement and social security systems in step but because it will assist in maintaining the financial soundness of the railroad retire\u00ad ment, system. We hope that this provision will receive favorable consideration by your committee. Sincerely yours, PHILLIP S. HUGHSa, Assistant Director for Legislative Reference. Mr. PELL. That is the administration's views On the merits. Why would it not be appro\u00ad priate to let the bill be passed, without our being the judge of its constitutionality, and let the House politely decide the question? Mr. LONG of Louisiana. We ought to pass on the question ourselves. We ought to ex\u00ad ercise our own best judgment. We have a responsibility. just as the House has its re\u00ad sponsibility. We, should discharge our own responsibility. The PRSIDmING OFrncEs.

Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry. TeP~IIGOrs.TeSntrwl state it. Mr. MORSE. The pending question, as I understand, is the point of order raised by the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. LONG], that the pending legislation is unconstitutional because of the allegation that it violates article I, section 7 of the Constitution, which prescribes that revenue measures shall orig\u00ad mnate in the House. The PRESIDING Omncn. The Senator is cor\u00ad rect. Mr. MORSE. Therefore, a vote of \"nay' against the point of order will be a vote to sustain the constitutionality of the pending proposal offered by the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. PELL]. Is that correct? The PRESIDING Orricra. A vote of \"nay\" would dispose of the point of order, and the amendment would continue to be before the Senate for action. A vote of \"yea\" would sustain the point of order, and the proposal would be removed from the Senate. Aft. MORSE.

Mr. President- The PRESIDING OrrxCEs (Wr. TYDINGS in the chair). The Senator from Rhode Island Is recognized, Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the bill H.R. 3157, now under consideration by this body, would change the Railroad Retirement Act so that payment of an annuity to a spouse of a re- tired railroad employee could be made in the full amount even though she is at the same time entitled to monthly benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act or Social Security Act derived from her own employment. The present law requires a reduction in the the spouse's annuity by the amount of bene- fits derived from her own employment, as well as by the amount of certain other bane- fits to which she may be entitled. The spouses' annuity Is the only benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act which cannot now be paid in full concurrently with other bane- fits under the Social Security and Railroad Retirement Acts, although In the pest there were others. The discriminatory provisionsagainst spouses should be removed, The change in the law as to spouse's an- nuities would, of course, increase the costs of the railroad retirement system. It is esti- that the added costs of this change would be about $14 million a year on a level basis. When H.R. 3157 passed the House in June of this year, there was a deficit on a long-range actuarial basis in the financing of the system of about $20 million a yea. A deficit in this amount Is considered to be within the range of actuarial tolerance, and the system was regarded as being in a satis- factory financial condition. Since that time, Public Law 89-97, the Sociar Security Amend- mente of 1965, has been enacted. The changes in the Social Security Act will have the effect of increasing certain direct finan- cial benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act and will add an estimated $28 million a year to the costs of the system, increasing the deficit to about $48 million a year. With a deficit of this amount, the rail-road retirement system is now in an unsat-isfactory financial -'condition and the addi- tional costs of the effect of this bill' on spouse's annuities would cause the financial conditions to be considerably worse. The deficit would then be approximately $62 mil- lion a year. The system cannot, of course, endure in an unsatisfactory financial condi- tioni. The committee Is cognizant of the fact situation cannot be corrected unless ad- ditional revenue Is obtained. It, therefore, amended the bill to' change the Uimit on effect of the amendment would be to raise the base for the railroad retirement system to $550 a month from the present $450, an increase of the'equivalent of only $1,200 a The increase in the base will provide addi\u00ad tional benefits for those railroad employees whose earnings exceed $450 a month and who will have to pay additional tax amounts. Those employees, who do not earn over $450 a month, will pay no additional taxes and will gain no credits toward higher benefits. The increase in the compensation base will reduce the deficit from the projected $62 million a year to approximately $24 mil\u00ad lion a year. The railroad retirement System would then 'be in a satisfactory financial condition. It is estimated that the change in base would produce an additional $87 million a year in the tax income. Over one- half of this amount, $48 million, would be required to pay the additional benefit amounts and the remainder, $39 million, would apply to the reduction of the deficit. As I have Indicated, the problem cannot be solved without legislative action. Tax revenue to the system can be increased only by increasing the taxable wage base, or by raising tax rates. A rate increase would have a harsh impact, particularly on employees with low earnings. Their tax amounts would be increased and they would get no addi\u00ad tional benefits; Congress, to my knowledge, has never increased social Insurance taxes without an accompanying increase in benefit amounts. In the financing of the recent Improve\u00ad ment of social security benefits, the Congress has relied principally on an increase in the wage base for the Increase In tax rates, was relatively slight. Tax -rates for the railroad retirement sys\u00ad temn are, under existing law, automatically geared to the tax rates for the social security system, although the railroad rates are ap- Proximately twice as large. Therefore, the increases in the social security tax rates will be reflected in the railroad retirement rates. There is not now a Coordination as to the earnings base. Historically, the ralroad retirement base has always, except for a few months In the late 1950's, equaled or ex\u00ad ceeded the social security base. It is also significant that even with the change, a sub\u00ad stantially lower percentage Of gross railroad earnings would be taxable than was the case when the system was first established, and the monthly base was only $300. The increase in the railroad retfrenient ta base Will, of course, add to the taxes Of railroad companies, but the larger in\u00ad orease In the soal security tax base will also add to the taxes for companies In industry Covered by the social security system. Finally, It is to be noted that If there is a difference In the taxable wage law, those under railroad retirement Or compared with thoee under social security, then the hoepi\u00ad tal insurance Program would be admninis\u00ad tered by the Social security Administration rather than by the Railroad Retirement Board as would be the case If this amend\u00ad mnent Were adopted. In reporting this bill, it is recognized that benefits will accr'ue to those workers who pay the additional tax. Under the heading Of \"1~Conlusio,\" on page 5 of the report, It is stated: \"It Is further recognised, because Of the matching contribution of industry and lbr that thoee workers earning more than $480 per month and living more than 5 years afise retirement Will receive more than they have 23046 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE September 15, 1965 paid Into the railroad retirement fund. This will naturally be a factor bearing on any future decisions In labor-management negotiations.\" Mr. DoMINic3K. mr. President, will the Ben- ator from Rhode Island yield? Mr. PELL.

Mr. President, this emend\u00ad ment is one which came to my attention as a need in order to maintain the parallels be\u00ad tween social security and railroad retirement. It came to my attention too late for con\u00ad sideration by the comomittee in connection 'with H.R. 3157, but I belleve it Is a worthy change and one which is needed In the light I intend to vote for it, because this was my original bill. I voted against the Pell amendment in subcommittee. I voted against it again on the floor. I am still go- ing to vote for the bill, in the hope that we can get something out of conference. Per- haps, if the House remains adamant, we can show the Senate that if it Is going to do any- thing for the spouses, it had better take the bill In the original draft as. It was first introduced. Mr. President, we are dealing With eCO- nomic benefits which will accrue to 41,000 persons. Many of them will disappear as time goes on, which is inevitable to all of life, so that the drain on the retirement fund, which has been mentioned over and over again, will progressively decrease as time goes on. It has already been stated that it would be 4 years before we really had to worry about retirement funds in any way whatsoever, Therefore, it seems to-me.. for us. to take the position that we must move now, so far as railroad retirement funds are concerned is quite premature. This assumes that Congress would not do anything after full hearings before~ the prop- er committee, in order to take care of the problem, if we presented It to them. . Thus, we are taking an action with the wrong committee, Insofar as revenues are concerned, even within the Senate. not speaking of the fact that it comes from the wrong House. I appreciate the Senator from Rhode Island yielding to me so that I may make these points, which I believe are important. They should be included in the RECORtD. All Sen- ators should know that the action taken in the Senate today may easily result in the inevitable defeat of the bill, if the Senate Is5refusing to move, and if the House will re- fuse to move--as, I am sure it will.

It does just one thing; namely, secures for tip employees of the railroads the same treatment of their tipe for retirement purpose as that Which Is now accorded tip employees In the social security law. That is, it allows dining car employees, porters, and those relatively few employees of the railroads who receive tipe to furnish the em- ployer with a statement of those sums thus received in a calendar month, The employer then deducts the tax required, and the em- Ployee receives credit in his payments for the additional earnings represented by the tips. As In the case of the social security law,there Is no payment made by the employer, The numbers of persons thus affected is small in relation to total railroad employ- ment, but for each of them the opportunity to count tips as wages for retirement pur-~ poses should be extended just as we have done to hotel and restaurant workers and others under social security.I have talked with the Associate General Oounsel of the Railroad Retirement Board, and he Informs me that the Board has no oibjeotiona. Neither do the railroad unions as represented by the Railway Labor Execu- tives Association, and since the employers do not under this bill acquire additional financial. obligations, I do not believe theyhave objections. Consequently, Mr. President, I would like to ask that the committee accept this amend- menit, so that equity may be maintained in this small area of employment where tips are received. Mr. PELsL.

Mr. President, I voted for the bill which, was lust passed because, In common with all Senators, I believe it should have been passed, and I am in sympathy with the humanitarian objectives of the bill; but I want to make It very clear that if the amendment which was attached to this bill that would tend to make the Railroad Re- tirement Fund solvent is eliminated from the bill by the House and it comes back in that form without the revenue provisions which would allow the Railroad Retirement Fund to remain solvent, I shall vote against I.cation Mr. PELL. I quite understand. I sym- pathize with the view of the Senator, Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, we have just completed action on H.R. 8489, a bill to amend the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937. The main and moatispiritedhIssuenInvolvedmIsland. was the constitutional question raised byIsad the junior Senator from Louisiana [Mr. LONO] by his point of order.

The junior Senator from RhodeIsland [Mr. FELL] demonstrated not only his persuasivenes, but also his mastery of the constitutional questions involved and the parliamentary precedents as was ~evi- denced by the vote sustaining his poitlo'n. Mr. PELL. I thank the majority lead\u00ad &r very much indeed for those kind re- Marks. I gladly underscore the remarks of the senior Senator from Oregon, because the action I am suggesting in voting on this bl o nn a niae gemnbl o nn a niae gemnwith the view that the basic bill the Sen\u00adate Passed was unconstitutional. What we are voting,-on now Is a bill which seeks a6cohipromise between the I 23048 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE September 15, 1965 various views that have been advanced, and we are voting on It on its merits.

The Senator from Oregon knows how grateful I am to him for his help and support the other day, and for the good advice and counsel he gave me at that time. The PRESIDING OFFCER.

LEGISLATIVE HISTORYs HOUSE REPORT No. 976 (Com~.on Interstate & roreign Commeroe). CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, Vol. 111 (1965): Sept. 14: Considered Wnd passed House. Sept. 15: Considered and passed Senate. SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION Number 35 October 4, 1965 AMENDMENTS TO THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACT To Administrative, Supervisory, and Technical Employees On September 29 the President signed H. R. 10874, a bill amending the railroad retirement law. Several of the changes made by the new legisla\u00ad tion (P. L. 89-212) are related to the Social Security Amendments of 1965. Of particular importance in this respect is the change in the railroad retirement monthly earnings and tax base from $450 to $550. Earnings and tax base increase P. L. 89-212 specifies that the maximum creditable and taxable monthly compensation under the Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad Retire\u00ad ment Tax Act for montha after the month of enactment shall be one -twelfth of the social security annual wage base or $450 a month, whichever is greater. The effect of this amendment, under present social security law, is to increase the monthly railroad retirement earnings and tax base from $450 to $550 beginning with January 1966. Should there be future increases in the social security earnings base the railroad retirement earnings and tax base will automatically be increased. This change brings into play hospital insurance provisions of the Social Security Amendments of 1965 which are applicable for years in which the earnings and tax bases of the railroad retirement and social security programs are equal. For such years, hospital insurance taxes on railroad retirement employment will be levied under the railroad retirement taxing provisions of the law, and transferred to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under provisions similar t'o the financial interchange provisions which apply to cash benefits under the two programs. Also, in such years the Railroad Retirement Board will make determinations as to the rights of railroad retirement beneficiaries to hospital insurance benefits, but payment (except to Canadian hospitals) will be made from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Hospital insurance benefits, financed from the Railroad Retirement Account, will be provided for railroad retirement beneficiaries in Canadian hospitals. (If the provision increasing 2 the railroad retirement earnings and tax base had not been enacted, hospital insurance taxes on railroad employment would have been levied under the social security taxing provisions of the-law, and hospital insurance benefits for railroad retirement beneficiaries would have been provided under social security on the same basis as for social security beneficiaries.) Tax rate decrease P. L. 89-212 reduces employee -employer contributions under the railroad retirement system by 1 percent of payroll (from 8. 125 percent to 7. 125 percent), effective October 1, 1965. The decrease would be a temporary one. Ono-fourth of the decrease, in terms of the contributions scheduled in prior law, will be wiped out each January 1 for the next 4 years, so that the decrease will be eliminated by January 1, 1969. (On that date railroad retirement employee and employer taxes --including hospital insurance taxes --will become 9. 40 percent; they will rise to a maximum of 10. 15 percent each on January 1, 1987.) On introducing H. R. 10874 in the House, Congressman Oren Harris (D., Ark.) Chairman of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, explained that the reduction in the railroad retire \u00ad ment contribution rates was designed to \"equalize the tax impact on both the employees and the employers\" of the, change in the railroad retirement earnings and tax base. Elimination of spouses' reduction provision P. L. 8.9-212 deletes the provision of the Railroad Retirement Act which required that a spouse's annuity under the railroad program be reduced by the amount of any retirement or parent's insurance annuity which the spouse is eligible to receive under the railroad retirement program, or by the amount of any social security benefit, other than a wife's or husband's insurance benefit. This change is effective with annuities payable for October 1965. The provision now deleted was included in the Rdilroad Retirement Act in 1951 along with various other provisions (added to the railroad retirement law either in 1951, or in 1946) for the reduction of railroad retirement annuities; all of the other provisions reducing rail \u00ad road retirement annuities because of the payment of a social security benefit, or of another railroad retirement annuity, had been deleted prior to the enactment of P. L. 89-212 except the provision specifying that where a person is eligible for more than one survivor annuity under the railroad retirement program, only the largest is to be paid. 3 Tips The same treatment is given under the railroad retirement system to railroad employees who get tips as that provided under social security by the 1965 amendments for employees who get tips. As in the case of tips covered by social security, tips covered under the railroad retire \u00ad ment system would not be subject to the employer tax. Coverage for tips is effective for tips received after 1965. Robert M. Bal Commissioner LISTING OF REFERENCE MATERIALS U.S. Congress. House. Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.
