Aromatherapy is the use of fragrant plant extracts and essential oils to improve your mood, ease respiratory distress, and even reduce congestion from sinus colds and the flu. Here we've pulled together some of our favorite DIY ideas for turning your daily shower into an aroma-therapeutic experience. Enjoy! 1. Bring Fresh Herbs Into Your Shower One of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to enjoy shower aromatherapy is by hanging fresh herbs in your bathroom; the heat and steam will distill the scent and natural herbal benefits. We recommend trying eucalyptus in the shower because this herb is readily available at flower shops and natural grocery stores, is a treatment against many ailments, and gives off a wonderfully cooling fragrance. Hang a bundle of the eucalyptus on your shower rod with natural garden twine, away from the spray of water. Enjoy the scent and healing properties for weeks to come! 2. Make Your Own Shower Steamers Shower steamers are another great DIY project because they're inexpensive, easy to make and store, and most of all, fun to use! A shower steamer placed on the shower floor will slowly melt under the hot water from your showerhead and turn into an aromatic steam. You only need a few ingredients to whip these up, and they can be made en masse in about an hour. You'll need baking soda, water, essential oils, and a silicone mold (like you use for cupcakes) to form the shower steamers. You can mix and match essential oils to your heart's content, but some popular choices include lemon, bergamot, eucalyptus, peppermint, lavender, rosemary, and chamomile. This is a great project to involve your kids in, too, because it's safe and mess-free. You can find instructions for making your own [DIY shower steamers here](http://helloglow.co/diy-aromatherapy-shower-tablets/). If you're looking for an aromatherapy option that is a little less DIY, the [ESSIO aromatherapy shower diffuser](http://www.essioshower.com/) may be the answer for you. ESSIO easily clips onto any existing showerhead and allows you to easily diffuse rejuvenating essential oils into your shower whenever you wish. As an added benefit, the diffuser includes no artificial ingredients, is not tested on animals, and is recyclable and organic. 3. Fight A Cold With DIY Shower Soothers If you or your loved ones are prone to colds during the chilly fall and winter months, you'll love shower soothers. Much like shower steamers, these little wonders made of eucalyptus, peppermint, and baking soda can also be placed on the shower floor to ease your cold and sinus symptoms with their scented steam. Going the DIY route saves you money and allows you to control the ingredients. These shower soothers are easy to make and are some of the best DIY at-home spa treatments for you and your family. You can find instructions for making your own [DIY shower soothers here](http://www.mainlyhomemade.com/healthy-living/natural-homemade-vapor-shower-soothers/#_a5y_p=4950157). Aromatherapy is relaxing for the tired body, mind, and soul. It can even help lessen the effects of congestion, and uplift your spirits as you're recovering from a nasty cold.
