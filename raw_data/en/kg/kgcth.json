Danielle Zinaich, 45, has been modeling since she was 15 years old and is represented by The Lions agency in New York, but she is also a licensed homeopath who helps her clients combat common ailments such as fatigue and inflammation using natural treatments. With many people working from home amid the global crisis and struggling to turn away from the 24-hour news cycle, Zinaich told [Vogue](https://www.vogue.com/article/danielle-zinaich-model-homeopath-interview) that it's important to be mindful of getting enough sunlight, moving your body, and using food as medicine. Keeping calm: Danielle Zinaich, 45, has shared her tips for staying healthy and relieving stress as people continue to quarantine amid the global crisis Claim to fame: Zinaich, pictured on the runway at the Daryl K Spring 2004 show, started modeling in the '90s She explained that many of her clients are currently focused on easing stress and retaining energy during these tumultuous times. 'Lots of people are stuck in their apartments and in front of a computer, but you've got to find a way to get Vitamin D,' she said. 'If you don't get enough, you can be affected by seasonal affective disorder\u2014even mid-summer. At least 15 minutes of direct sunlight every day and a 5,000 IU supplement is the way to go.' Zinaich advises making a list of goals for each day that you can complete and make time for calming practices such as yoga or meditation, saying 'it's so much easier to stick to those things and stay positive.' 'Using food as medicine is a big part of my practice,' she added. 'If you can't grow your vegetables, buy them from the grocery and push yourself to incorporate them into every meal and start using herbs in your cooking. 'Oregano oil is potent, rosemary, basil, garlic, onion, all these things we use daily. Ginger tea and honey for your sore throat, turmeric to help with inflammation, it all adds up.' Still got it: Zinaich walked the catwalk at the Veronica Beard show in February during New York Fashion Week Sunshine: Zinaich insists that people who are working from home need to step away from their computers and get at least 15 minutes of direct sunlight for Vitamin D Zinaich also likes to use arnica for inflammation and bioplasma for fatigue, recommending supplements from Boiron, a manufacturer of homeopathic products headquartered in France. The model became interested in alternative medicine in 1994 when her dog, Gypsy, developed a growth on her eye after getting a vaccination. Her veterinarian recommended extensive surgery that would possibly require removing her dog's eye. Looking for a less invasive treatment, she took Gypsy to homeopathic veterinarian Dr. Roberto Gil, who prescribed Thuja, a remedy derived from pine trees. After two weeks, the growth was gone. The experience inspired Zinaich to start studying alternative medicine alongside New York-based homeopath Sue Anello. More than two decades later, she has her own practice in upstate New York, where she lives with her two teenage sons, Van and Nico, and her husband Adam Strahl. Healthy as can be: She also advises incorporating vegetables and herbs into your diet, including rosemary, basil, garlic, onion, turmeric, ginger tea, and honey Make it work: Zinaich said if you can't grow your own vegetables at home, buy them at the grocery store Sweat it out: The incredibly youthful-looking mother of two likes to sit in an infrared sauna for 30 minutes or take a bath with Epsom salts and essential oils to unwind While Zinaich's focus is wellness, it's hard not to wonder if her healthy lifestyle has helped contribute to her incredibly youthful appearance. Last year, she opened up about her beauty regimen and morning routine with [Beauty and Well-Being](https://beautyandwellbeing.com/well-being/interview-well-being/homeopathy-danielle-zinaich/), noting that she takes vitamins and bioplasma, which is 'great for hair, skin, and nails.' 'I like to have green tea first thing in the morning,' she said. 'Then I have celery juice, take the dog out for a walk, wash my face, apply toner, put on layers of cream and oil, get dressed, meditate for 15 minutes, eat breakfast (sometimes homemade cashew/coconut yogurt with fruit and a little granola, a protein shake, or eggs and avocado). 'I then energetically clear my office and put the kettle on before I start seeing my lovely homeopathy clients. I like to wake up slowly and not jump into things.' Au naturel: Zinaich shared a photo of herself getting a 'detox energy corrector facial with crystals' last summer Stretch it out: Although she is an advocate for alternative medicine, Zinaich believes some problems can be treated simply by moving the body Josh Rosebrook's Nutrient Day Cream, Mad Hippie Vitamin A Serum, True Botanicals Vitamin C Powder and Cellular Repair Serum, and Tata Harper Cr\u00e8me Riche are just some of her go-to products. In recent weeks, she has been using Kat Burki Skincare line and was featured in the brand's newsletter, Nourish, last month. To unwind, Zinaich likes to cook a new recipe with her husband, have family dinners, hang out with her dog, or curl up on the couch and either watch TV or read a book. 'Sometimes, I'll take a 30-minute infrared sauna or have a nice bath with Epsom salts and essential oils,' she said. Although she is an advocate for alternative medicine, Zinaich believes some problems can be treated simply by moving the body. 'If you're feeling stressed, go out for a walk and get your endorphins going,' she told Vogue in her latest interview. 'When you're getting fresh air and sunshine, you're going to feel a bit better; it's common sense.'
