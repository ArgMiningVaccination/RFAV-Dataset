If so, this is for you... Sucralose, the main ingredient in Splenda and NutraSweet, is an unnatural substance derived from sugar, but it is actually made by a property from a chemist, using three chlorine atoms. This unnatural process makes the new molecule a sweet tasting, but toxic substance that has never been proven to be safe at any dose or with chronic use, and yet the FDA approved it! There is nothing natural about Splenda or NutraSweet and there are many neurological and hormone inhibiting factors from these chemicals. Chlorocarbon molecules, including sucralose, don't have calories; which is why they claim it to have \"0calories\". It affects human cellular metabolism because it is toxic to many enzyme systems and the body's cells structure. This process converts the sugar molecule to a fructo-galactose molecule. This type of sugar molecule does not occur in nature, and therefore your body does not possess the ability to properly metabolize it. As a result of this \"unique\" biochemical make-up, McNeil Nutritionals makes its claim that Splenda is not digested or metabolized by the body, hence it has zero calories. In addition if you or anyone you know has digestive problems, including IBS, Crohn's Disease or Colitis, Splenda is especially dangerous. Those stomach disorders are commonly due to an inflammatory response for many reasons, but ingesting artificial sweeteners cause an even harsher reaction to the gut when its not already functioning well. The body takes in all chemical colorings, preservatives and sweeteners as a \"toxin\". It is not a natural food source, so the body looks at them as \"foreign objects\". In its efforts to assimilate them into the body, it can't find a place for them since they don't really \"feed\" anything. The most common way to protect itself in the body from attacking the organs, is to give you a toxic liver and then make fat cells (especially in the abdomen) in order to hold them from getting elsewhere in the body. This result is the inability to lose weight even when trying to, since the liver processing system cannot take the chance to release the toxins from the fat cells where it's being held. Splenda Actually Destroys Your Gut Flora Different artificial sweeteners have been found to wreak havoc in a number of different ways. Aspartame, for example, has a long list of studies indicating its harmful effects, ranging from brain damage to pre-term delivery. Splenda (sucralose) has been found to be particularly damaging to your intestines. A study published in 2008 found that Splenda: \u00b7 Reduces the amount of good bacteria in your intestines by 50 percent \u00b7 Increases the pH level in your intestines, and: \u00b7 Affects a glycoprotein in your body that can have crucial health effects, particularly if you're on certain medications like chemotherapy, or treatments for AIDS and certain heart conditions They also found unmistakable evidence that Splenda is absorbed by fat, contrary to previous claims. In response to this study, James Turner, chairman of the national consumer education group Citizens for Health issued the following statement: \"The report makes it clear that the artificial sweetener Splenda and its key component sucralose pose a threat to the people who consume the product. Hundreds of consumers have complained to us about side effects from using Splenda and this study ... confirms that the chemicals in the little yellow package should carry a big red warning label.\" It's extremely upsetting that Splenda can destroy up to 50 % of your healthy intestinal bacteria, as these bacteria are absolutely essential for supporting your general health! Many people are already deficient in healthy bacteria due to consuming too many highly processed foods and taking various medications or antibiotics. This is why a high quality probiotic is one of the very few supplements I highly recommend for most, if not all, people. Believe me, if you continually destroy up to half of your gut flora by regularly consuming Splenda, then poor health is guaranteed! Splenda has Never Been Proven To Be Safe for Human Consumption Splenda was approved by the FDA as a general-purpose sweetener in processed foods in 1998. The FDA claims the approval was based on more than 110 animal and human safety studies. However, what they don't specify was that out of these 110 studies, only two were human studies, consisting of a combined total of 36 people, of which only 23 people actually ingested sucralose. Additionally, the longest of these two human trials lasted only four days and looked at sucralose in relation to tooth decay, not human tolerance! The remainder of those 110-plus \"safety studies\" were done on animals, and they actually revealed plenty of problems, such as: \u00b7 Decreased red blood cells \u2014 sign of anemia \u2014 at levels above 1,500 mg/kg/day \u00b7 Increased male infertility by interfering with sperm production and vitality, as well as brain lesions at higher doses \u00b7 Enlarged and calcified kidneys (McNeil stated this is often seen with poorly absorbed substances and was of no toxicological significance. The FDA Final Rule agreed that these are findings that are common in aged female rats and are not significant.) \u00b7 Spontaneous abortions in nearly half the rabbit population given sucralose, compared to zero aborted pregnancies in the control group \u00b7 A 23 percent death rate in rabbits, compared to a 6 percent death rate in the control group Just as with aspartame, many Splenda users complain of general malaise or \"feeling under the weather,\" along with a variety of neurological changes, such as foggy-headedness, lack of concentration, and \"bad mood.\" If you have ever suffered any side effects from taking Splenda or any artificially sweetened product, I strongly recommend reporting it to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in your area. Splenda\u2014\"Made from Sugar\" But More Similar to DDT... The catchy slogan \"Made from sugar so it tastes like sugar\" has fooled many, but chemically, Splenda is actually more similar to DDT than sugar. Sucralose starts off with a sugar molecule, yes, but that's where the similarity ends. (A sucrose molecule is a disaccharide that contains two single sugars bound together, i.e. glucose and fructose.) Then, in a five-step patented process, three chlorine molecules are added to that sucrose (sugar) molecule. But, if you look at the research, you will find that an average of 15 percent of sucralose IS in fact absorbed into your digestive system, and ultimately is stored in your body. To reach the average number of 15 percent means that some people absorb more and some people absorb less, depending on your biochemical makeup. If you are healthy and your digestive system works well, you may be at HIGHER risk for breaking down this product in your stomach and intestines, so for you the adverse reactions may be more acutely felt. Have you ever exhibited symptoms of muscular twitching whether during your sleep or even during daylight hours? If you happen to use a packet of Splenda in your coffee on a daily or regular basis, you may want to stop using it for a week or two and notice if those symptoms have disappeared! I have personal experience with this situation, as my adult daughter was muscle twitching very frequently in her sleep, from the waist down on a nightly basis. Some of the twitching continued during the day through time, until the doctors were suspecting a possible brain malfunction. Interestingly, after terminating her Splenda use, every symptom completely disappeared. Through the extensive testing processes of the FDA, the sugary poison was considered safe for human consumption in 1998 after the effects were studied on over 100 animals and humans (only 2 of which were actually humans). And thus yet another artificial sweetener was born, putting people's health at risk through marketing and profit-driven goals. What comes as the greatest surprise, however, is the fact that all of the testing done with Sucralose was only completed on around 40 people total - much of the studies' goals were only to test its effects on the teeth of the subjects, and virtually nothing about the toxicity of the sweetener whatsoever. So, is Splenda safe? Fortunately, other non-governmental studies have been completed and the results have shown that Sucralose is responsible for a variety of ailments: headaches, blurred vision, short-term dizziness, and more serious long term effects such as depression and weight gain. There are other effects associated with splenda consumption as well, such as: \u00b7 Skin breaking out in hives or rashes \u00b7 Shortness of breath \u00b7 Swelling of facial muscles \u00b7 Eye irritation \u00b7 Joint pains \u00b7 General sensation of anxiety in a number of consumers The worst effect of them all? The stomach is essentially cleansed of any healthful bacterium existing within the stomach lining, in addition to increasing pH levels within the intestines. This effect directly stimulates/upsets ghrelin levels (hormones responsible for stimulating appetite, resulting in increased cravings for carbohydrates and other non essential food sources). What is so wrongful and vile about the substance is that it is not only sold to consumer food product manufacturers, but also to a fair share of big pharma. This means that the medications that you buy may still contain the sugar sweetener without you ever knowing, as many companies are deliberately not listing Sucralose as an ingredient at all. This adds just one more reason to break any reliance for pharmaceutical medications. But instead of Splenda rightfully discontinuing their toxic creation, they have decided to make it sound even better for consumers under the name Splenda Essentials, Unfortunately, this is marketing deception, as you are still consuming the highly toxic Sucralose. What's a Person To Do? The best way to \"clean\" the body and especially the liver to allow the body to function the way it should, is to do a simple liver cleanse. The option to clear the liver is as simple as using a liquid drop or pill formula daily for a certain period of time which would help release the toxins from the liver, allowing the fat cells to then release. How to Kick the Artificial Sweetener Habit Sweet cravings are very common for the simple reason that sugar is as addictive as cocaine. Here are some simple solutions to your sweet tooth: \u00b7 Use Stevia (a natural plant leaf) which has no calories and no chemicals) \u00b7 Use Honey (using locally grown varieties to your area are very helpful to your immune system) \u00b7 Use raw unprocessed sugar (purchased in a health food store) \u00b7 Substitute organic jelly or fruit jam in your plain yogurt or to sweeten your oatmeal rather than using sugar Remember, you are your own health care advocate. Read labels, stay informed. If you see ingredients that are not naturally derived, don't use them. "}
