There are no cures for AIDS. DNCB (which is short for dinitrochlorobenzene) is an alternaive treatment for IVrinfecution. It is a chemical. dissolved in a liquid, that you swab onto your skin. Does DNCB kill HIV? Not directly But DNCB boosts your own immune system so that it can still kill some of the HI-V in your b()dy. It also helps prevent the f-IV from spreading inside you. Does DNCB prevent other infections? Again. not direcdr: But DNCB also stimulates your immune system to kill or control virtually all of the opportnisutic infecutions in AIDS. However, DNCB is ineffective Pneumonia (PCP). and PCP prophvylaxis (preventative medicaution) is mandatory when CD4 cells drop below 200. Is everyone who does DNCB helped by it? In most cases. DNCB users who are not sick and who follow the directions exactlyv each week will stabilize and increase the ability of their immune systems to control opportunistic infections. In a number of cases, people who already have infections can be helped. This depends a great deal upon the infection or condition, and many other factors, including diet, use of vitamins, use of antibiotics, and other alternative treatments undertaken by the patient that may be suppressing the iminune system. Incidentally. DNCB may lessen or eliminate Kaposi's Sarcoma le-,ions when applied directly to them. (In tact. this is how DNCB's value against -I\" was tirst discovered. Lv a dermatologist treating his KS patients in 10S5.) For how long have people been using DNCB? DNCB has had many uses in medicine for almost 50 years, long before AIDS. DNCB has been used by some HIV+ people for almost ten years. Many original users are still alive and healthy. How many people are using DNCB in this country? ACTUP San Francisco estimates between 7,000 and 10.000 people. Many, many others are using it in Europe, South America, and elsewhere. Are there any studies proving DNCB helps control HIV? Yes, several, and <f _ others are underway at this time. DNCB's Cost and Availability How much will DNCB cost me? About 25c a week, or about a dollar a month. Usually people order a supply for 6-8 months, which can cost as little as $7 total, or about Sl4 a year. Why is it so cheap? Because it's a very simple, common, and inexpensive compound to make. Also, no company can legally patent DNCB, so there is little incentive for drug companies to market DNCB. Currently, AIDS treatment actwists affiliated with ACTUP San Francisco are making DNCB avail able to anyone who wants it, even for free. Where do the activists get it? They obtain medical-grade DNCB from companies that supply chemicals and are very concerned about its purity and effectiveness. What does the Federal Government think of DNCB? The science supporting its use is becoming well-known. AIDS researchers at the National Institutes of Health are aware of DNCB AT therapy. Activists preL UT sented a DNCB Forum to AIDS researchers at the NIH S in June. 1994. It was one of dozens of fo-rums they have held nationwide. A video of the NIH Forum is available. Using DNCB How often do I use it? Once a week. No more, no less. For how long do I have to use DNCB? DN CB must be used for life, like a pacemaker or insulin. How do I use DNCB? You put DNCB directly on your skin with a Q-Tip or cotton swab. You put it on a different area each week. somewhere between your neck and your knees. The trunk is a good location. The exact strength of the solution does not matter: what matters is getting an appropriate reaction each week. What happens when I put DNCB on my skin? At first, nothing. Your body's response to DNCB is delayed. Over the next 24-72 hours, however, the skin at your application site will become bright pink or reddish, slightly raised, and maybe itchy, like poison oak. But the rash will not spread anywvhere else. SDoes it hurt? No, not reallyv. Sometimes there is stinging at the spot for the first hour or so, but this goes away soon. The reaction may develop an itch and-if it is strong-eventually peel, like sunburn. When does the rash go away? The first few times you apply DNCB, the rashes may take threesix weeks to completely disappear. Soon, however, it starts to disappear within the same week that you applied it. Are there other reactions besides the rash? No, none. There are no side effects. Is DNCB dangerous? Government studies have proven that topical use of DNCB is safe and nontoxdc. It is noncarcinogenic. Uing DNCB with Other Treatments Are there are other drugs I should be using in addition to DNCB treatments? Yes. If your CD4 T-cells go below 200, you must use a drug to prevent PCP. According to government guidelines, your doctor should consider prescribing something at that time, such as Bactrimu/ [Page 2](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0326.013/2) Septra. There is no conflict with DNCB. But unless you have other active infections that demand treatment, there is no need to take additional antibiotics when you are doing DNCB weekly. In Fact, they will weaken DNCB's ability to boost your iunnuine system. ho wever, there are some SUPPLEMENTS The followming.rsupplemenrs, all of which are available from Great Blrth Vitamin Stores, are highly recommended.

Super Multi-Minerals Super Hy-Vites B-Complex 100 Super Oxy-E-400 Beta Carotene 25,000 Oderless Garlic Super C Complex 1000 Zinc 30mg traviolet light will increase the replication of HIV in your system, and suppress your cellular immune system. What about continuing to use AZT? DNCB will help you even if you conunue to use AZT or other similar infections, such as CMIV retinitis, chat do require anti-infective therapy for life. Surprisingly, a lot of so-called HIV treatments. both mainstream and alternative, actually weaken immunity. Basically, avoid HIV treatinents that instead of preventing insections actually suppress your cellular immunity. Before usingz any alternative or mainstream treatment, it is very important that you assure yourself that it boosts your cellular immunity What about Chinese herbs? A growing body of research is now showing that many if not all herbal treatments for HI/AIDS are harmful to the cellular immune s vstemn in the long run. What about acupuncture? Research also shows that only mild stimulation with very few needles may be effective against HIV Such a gentle approach may be effective in boosting immunity exactly the same way that DNCB does. Be sure your acupuncturist is thoroughly familiar with how the immune system operates. What about nutrition? Surviving with HIV requires you to evaluate your lifestyle, especially your diet. Ideally, you should also discontinue using alcohol and recreational drugs. Are vitamins important? \\Yes. definitel,. See the list of dietary supplements at the top of this page. Any other precautions? Yes. It is critical that you avoid sunbathing and tanning salons. Ul kinds of HIV cvtotoxic chemotherapy. However, discontinuing these drugs is strongly recommended by DNCB experts, who consider them dangerous and immunosuppressive, without any proven clinical benefit or increase in survival. Science and DNCB What do scientists think DNCB does? Your immune system has two branches. One branch produces antibodies to fight infections in your blood, usually bacterial, outside of your body's cells. The other branch produces \"cell-mediated immunity.\" This branch fights, or at least controls, infections like viruses, bacteria, ifunid, and protozoa, which burrow into your body's cells, primarily the cells known as macrophages, and from within them reproduce and cause disease. HIV is one such virus. Although AIDS is still not fully understood, scienutists today have no doubt that HIV' disrupts your immune system's ability to fuilly utilize the \"cell-mediated\" branch of your immune system. Over time, the cell-mediated branch is so weakened that infections that normal immune systems can control instead have an \"opportunity\" to break out, and usually do. You can keep producing antibodies with the other branch for a long time-but they do little or no good against these oportunistic infections (\"OI's\"), which hide inside cells. By causing your body to re spond to the rash it produces-a process technically known as Delaved Type Hypersensitivity (or Contact Sensitivity)-DNCB \"boosts\" your cell-mediated immunity every week. Over time it can get even stronger. In this way your HIV disease does not progress. Will DNCB help myTcell count? DNCB may or may not help your CD4 T-cell count. What it will do is increase your \"cvtotoxic CD8 T-cells\" as well as your \"Natural Killer cells.\" Generally, the number of absolute CD8s will also increase. Won't this disturb the ratio of CD4s to CD8s? Yes, but maintaining a \"normal\" ratio is now thought to be an outmoded approach to HIV disease. High numbers of CD8 cells are now thought to be the most important indicator of long term survival. Why are CD8T-cells now considered so important? Because a certain number of them, the ones known as \"cvtotoxic\" that DNCB increases, are now known to kill infected cells, regardless of the presence or number of CD4 T-cells. Does DNCB help my immune system in other ways? Yes. Immune cells known as \"Natural Killer\" cells, as well as \"Langerhans/dendritic cells,\" are generated each week. These are fresh. uninfected, and important cells. and they increase each week you use DNCB as prescribed. How come my doctor hasn't mentioned DNCB? He or she may be relying on outdated information. When doctors inquire about DNCB, they discover that it is the most widely used alternative treatment for HIV in America, and that emerging scientific discoveries in immunology support its use. Remember, most doctors are clinicians and do not have the time to keep abreast of the latest developments in basic research concerning immunology, infectious diseases, and virolo~.
