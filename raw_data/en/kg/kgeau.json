Scope and Background The Carnegie Mellon University Toxic and Highly Toxic Gas Handling Program specifies minimum requirements for safe storage, use, and handling of toxic and highly toxic gas at Carnegie Mellon University. This program has been approved by the Laboratory Safety Committee. This document: summarizes the health and safety risks associated with toxic and highly toxic gas use and handling; identifies exposure control methods to protect employee's safety and health and the environment; outlines regulatory and university requirements related to this work; specifies emergency response procedures for addressing toxic gas issues; and provides resources for further information. Toxic and highly toxic gases are gases that may cause significant acute health effects at low concentrations. Health effects may include severe skin or eye irritation, pulmonary edema, neurotoxicity or other potentially fatal conditions. The criteria used to establish the materials addressed by this policy are: A National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) health rating of 3 or 4 An NFPA health rating of 2 with poor physiological warning properties Pyrophoric ( self-igniting ) characteristics, OR An extremely low occupational exposure limits in the absence of an NFPA health rating. Table 1 identifies common gases that meet the criteria of toxic or highly toxic, though it is not exhaustive. Certain dilute toxic gases are exempt from this program if worst case release modeling of an accidental acute release indicates that the gas concentrations will not result in exposures to laboratory personnel exceeding any of the following: The OSHA Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL) The Threshold Limit Value -ceiling (TLV -C) Any recognized full shift exposure standard if there is no STEL or TLV -C for the material One half of the concentration established as Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) ALL exemptions on the basis of dilution will be made on a case -by-case basis by Carnegie Mellon's Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) department.

Gas cabinets shall: Operate at negative pressure in relation to surrounding areas; Have self -closing limited access ports or non -combustible windows to give access to equipment controls; Provide and average velocity at the face of acces s ports or windows not less than 200 feet per minimum with a minimum of 150 feet per minute at any point (call EH S at 412 -268-8411 to have air flows measured); Be connected to an exhaust; Have self -closing doors; Be constructed of not less than 12 gauge steel Have airflow measuring devices and visual and audible alarms that signify low airflow conditions Be located in rooms that are exhausted and negative in pressure to surrounding areas Be installed through the department of Campus Design and Facility Development (CDFD). 3. Exhausted enclosures shall: Operate at negative pressure in relation to surrounding areas; Provide and average velocity at the face of access ports or windows not less than 200 feet per minimum with a minimum of 150 feet per minute at any point (call EH S at 412 -268-8411 to have air flows measured); Have airflow measuring devic es and visual and audible alarms that signify low airflow conditions Be located in rooms that are exhausted and negative in pressure to surrounding areas ii. All exhaust lines or ducts carrying purged or exhausted emissions of toxic gases must be connected to a mechanical exhaust system that discharges to a safe location (i.e. presents no potential for reentrainment into any building supply air intake or occupied area). Exhaust wall ducts shall be chemically resistant to degradation by the toxic gas in use. b. Work Practice Controls For personnel and environmental protection against the potential exposure to toxic and highly toxic gases, the following work practice controls should be used by personnel: i. Handling: The following work practice controls must be used when handling toxic and highly toxic gases: Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be reviewed prior to working with any toxic or highly toxic gas. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) must be developed fo r the gas(es) in use; the University's PHS procedure format may be used. All work with toxic or highly toxic gases must be conducted in a working chemical fume hood to prevent exposure by inhalation. Proper personal protection equipment (PPE) must be worn at all times to prevent eye and skin contact. No work with toxic or highly toxic gases shall be performed alone. Environmental Health and Safety Page 4 of 6 Do not drag, roll, slide or drop cylinders. A suitable hand truck, to which the cylinder is secured, must be used for cylinder movement. When transporting gases outside the lab, the protective cap shall be in place and shall cover the valve. Never attempt to lift a cylinder by its cap. Secure cylinders at all times while in use and during transport. Only use a pproved regulators and valves. Consu lt your gas supplier for approved regulators and valves. Once cylinder has been connected to process, o pen valve slowly and carefully. If experiencing difficulty opening cylinder valve, discontinue use and contact supplier. Forced freeing of \"frozen\" or co rroded valves should NOT be attempted. Regulators and valves should be kept free of moisture. Systems should be purged with dry inert gas (e.g. helium, nitrogen, argon, etc.) before the product is introduced and when system is out of service. The main valv e on all toxic and highly toxic gas cylinders must be closed at all times when the cylinder is not in use. ii. Piping, tubing, valves and fittings: The following must be considered when selecting and using piping, tubing, valves, and fittings for use of toxic or highly toxic gases. Piping, tubing, valves and fittings: shall be designed and fabricated from materials compatible with the material to be contained and shall be of adequate length and durability to withstand the pressure and structural stress an d exposure to which they are subject shall be identified to indicate the material conveyed and arrows shall indicate the direction of flow shall have readily accessible manual or automatic remotely activated fail- safe emergency shutoff valves installed on supply tubing at the point of use and the source shall have emergency shutoff valves identified and the loc ation shall be clearly visible and indicated by means of a sign shall have backflow -prevention or check valves when backflow of hazardous materials could create a hazardous condition of caused the unauthorized discharge of hazardous materials shall have excess flow control when gas is carried in pr essurized piping abov e 15 psi.
