While we're working, we share a summary from our predecessor website, Beyond Conventional Cancer Therapies. The information we share here was last updated in November 2020. Please consider supporting our update and revision to this information. Zyflamend Key Points - Before using this therapy, consult your oncology team about interactions with other treatments and therapies. Also make sure this therapy is safe for use with any other medical conditions you may have. - Zyflamend is a multicomponent supplement blend taken for inflammation support, for pain and soreness, and for joint function and flexibility. - BCCT is interested in Zyflamend's uses in reducing the risk of or to treat prostate cancer, its symptoms or side effects of disease treatment. - Evidence from lab and animal studies indicate it reduces inflammation and levels of enzymes that produce estrogen. It can also cause cell death. - It may enhance the cell-killing effects of certain chemotherapy drugs. - It generally has mild side effects, including heartburn, but some individuals may be hypersensitive to one or more of the components. - Zyflamend should not be used by pregnant or lactating women or in newborn infants. - There are no randomized controlled human clinical trials on the efficacy of Zyflamend to treat cancer. Zyflamend is a supplement blend of 10 herbs taken orally for several purposes: - Inflammation support - Soothing aches, pain and soreness - Supporting joint function and flexibility Zyflamend is of interest to CancerChoices because it contains a number of herbs that are included in several integrative cancer care protocols for prostate and other cancers. It is also listed and described in the NCI's PDQ [Prostate Cancer, Nutrition, and Dietary Supplements](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/prostate-supplements-pdq#section/_485) as one of the multicomponent complementary therapies used in preventing and treating prostate cancers. Treating the Cancer Working against cancer growth or spread, improving survival, or working with other treatments or therapies to improve their anticancer action Cinical Evidence No definitive clinical trials of Zyflamend have been published, but a few small trials show benefits: - In a small phase I clinical trial in 2009 of men with HGPIN (a pre-cancerous abnormality of the prostate gland), 780 mg of Zyflamend plus combinations of other dietary supplements were administered three times a day. After 18 months, the majority of patients (60 percent) had only benign tissue at biopsy, and 48 percent of subjects demonstrated a 25 to 50 percent decrease in PSA. The treatment was well tolerated with no serious side effects.2 - A 2017 review of the impact of several dietary choices and Zyflamend found that Zyflamend showed promise in reducing prostate cancer progression.3 - A phase 1 clinical tried showed reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a marker of prostate cancer, in about half of patients.4 - While a 2013 review found that conclusive evidence for the use of complementary medicine in prostate and bladder cancer is lacking\u2014and use also carries risk\u2014the authors considered the 2009 phase I trial described above to be \"robust evidence\" of \"the potential role of Zyflamend as a therapeutic agent.\"5 Lab and Animal Evidence [](javascript:void(0)) Click or tap to open. Results from both lab and animal studies of Zyflamend have shown these effects: - Reduced angiogenesis (the creation of new blood vessels to supply tumor cells)6 - Inhibited melanoma growth by regulating the autophagy-apoptosis switch7 - Inhibited expression and function of androgen receptor and acted synergistically with bicalutimide to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth8 - Inhibited growth of human pancreatic tumors and sensitizing pancreatic cancers to gemcitabine9 - Counteracted bladder cancer resistance to cisplatin10 Components of Zyflamend Zyflamend is a supercritical extraction of herbs using carbon dioxide and cosolvents, which is suspended in olive oil:1 - Rosemary - Turmeric - Ginger - Holy basil - Green tea - Hu zhang - Chinese goldthread - Barberry - Oregano - Baikal skullcap Reducing Risk Clinical Evidence A 2017 review of the impact of several dietary choices and Zyflamend found that Zyflamend showed promise in reducing prostate cancer risk.11 Optimizing Your Terrain - Zyflamend shows anti-inflammatory properties in prostate cancer.12 - Reduced levels of enzymes that produce estrogen13 Access Zyflamend is readily available online and in some stores and pharmacies that sell nutritional supplements. No prescription is required. New Chapter, the manufacturer of Zyflamend, makes three formulations: The clinical trial related to prostate cancer used the Zyflamend Whole Body formulation. Cautions A few potential minor side effects have been noted, but Zyflamend is generally well-tolerated. The manufacturers recommend taking Zyflamend with food to reduce the risk of heartburn. People can be hypersensitive to any of the herbs in Zyflamend. One or more of its herbal constituents may interact with other prescription drugs or other herbs. Check with your pharmacist for herb-drug interactions. Also, before using Zyflamend, consult with your physician. If you are already taking Zyflamend, notify your physician. European barberry, a component of Zyflamend, should not be used by pregnant or lactating women or in newborn infants, as it can cause kernicterus; several fatalities have been associated with use in these populations.14 Dosing CancerChoices does not recommend therapies or doses, but only provides information for patients and providers to consider as part of a complete treatment plan. Patients should discuss therapies with their physicians, as contraindications, interactions and side effects must be evaluated.
