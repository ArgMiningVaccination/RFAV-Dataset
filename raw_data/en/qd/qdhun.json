It's a bit shameful to admit, but I've always kind of scoffed at \"self-care\" culture. It felt overly indulgent, hashtag trendy and something only high school girls had time for. For nearly my entire life, I had been time management obsessed, led exclusively by the most practical solutions and only showing myself respect when I felt like I was living up to my over-achieving goals and aggressively handling my daily task list. Then the 2020 shut-down happened and suddenly it felt like my life was hit with a giant pause button. Our family routine was thrown on it's head and I was strong armed into dramatically altering the structure of my days and evenings. This also meant having a home full of people 24/7 and having to actually carve out time to be alone. At around this time, I was already on a path of inner self-discovery, but was really struggling with tapping into the feminine and my intuitive nature. That journey deserves it's own long-ass blog post, but essentially I was only showing appreciation and kindness to my masculine traits and seemingly spent a lifetime pushing down and hiding from the inner feminine aspects of myself. By April, I had been homeschooling 3 kids full-time for over a month, dealing with having my husband work from home (listen, I love this man, but seeing him 24/7 everyday of the week was a huge change!) attempting to keep creating recipes/blog posts and adjust to a possible \"new normal,\" socially speaking. It was a lot. I know you feel me. Carving out time to be alone no longer felt like an indulgence, it was unquestionably necessary. For about an hour every evening, while the kids had their screen time, I would head into my bedroom, lock the door and escape. It wasn't long before my giant soaker tub (which I had NEVER used) started to call me in. I was learning about ritual baths at that time and how they can seriously help you tap into your divine feminine energy. I was hesitant, but worked past my inner skeptic and planned on a once a week bath. With my passion for herbology, a budding interest in the divine feminine and an hour to kill every night, I started to jot down some ideas for ritual bath recipes like this goddess bath recipe. I would start with what my intentions were. I would ask myself questions like: - What do I want to release today? - What mental or spiritual blockages are presenting themselves? - What is the current cycle of the moon? - What type of mood do I want to move into? - What do I need and how do I really feel today? From there, I researched and began to collect ingredients and test out various blends of salts, oils, herbs and flowers to create this rose bath salts recipe. I would also use Spotify to create musical playlists that would help to deepen the experience of the intention, as well as various healing crystals and alter pieces. It's been about 8 months since I first dove into this adventure and it has been truly and wildly transformative. I fully intend on continuing with my weekly ritual baths and would love to share the recipes and ideas with this community. The first ritual bath that really hit, was one focused with the intention of unleashing and healing the inner goddess. I had no specific goddess in mind to channel, but rather just embracing the beauty and immense power of the feminine, without judgement or too much overthinking. After getting all the ingredients together, setting my intentions, creating an inviting and loving space and killing it with that Spotify playlist... wow, just bloody wow! I was able to get into the most incredible meditative state. I was almost overwhelmed by feelings and deep sensations of forgiveness, connectedness, warmth and sensuality. It was damn near impossible to leave that first successful ritual bath session. Had the water not become uncomfortably cold, I could have stayed in that tub until I was an actual human raisin. Let's take a peek at some of the ingredients and methods used to create this immersive, magical new moon goddess bath recipe experience! Healing the Inner Goddess Blend - Rose & Hibiscus Bath Salts Recipe Ingredients [Pink Himalayan salt](https://www.amazon.ca/Yupik-Himalayan-Pink-Salt-1Kg/dp/B00N75R7X8/ref=sr_1_4_sspa?crid=XB98FXF7G3HC&dchild=1&keywords=himalayan+pink+salt&qid=1606145179&sprefix=hima%2Caps%2C229&sr=8-4-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzRVg4WVRJM05YV0xaJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNTI3NTIwWENaRjJGNFhYVEsyJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3NTAxMTQzN1FUWUc2MlkzUlFMJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) - Composed mostly of sodium, this pretty pink salt also consists of trace minerals such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Himalayan salt assists with drawing out dirt, bacteria, and pollution from deep within your pores. It also exfoliates, removes dead skin cells, detoxifies and balances the body's PH levels. [Epsom salt](https://www.amazon.ca/Yogti-Natural-Epsom-Salt-Canadian/dp/B07RPPB6YT/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=epsom+salt&qid=1606145704&sr=8-5) - Epsom salt is made of magnesium and sulfate. Magnesium is known for its ability to reduce inflammation, aid in muscle function and increase physical relaxation. It can also help your body produce melatonin. Sulfate aids in recovery and detoxification. [Lavender essential oil](https://www.amazon.ca/Now-Lavender-Oil-Liquid-30ml/dp/B00IZ7WSXM/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2VCK0S1HYBCAH&dchild=1&keywords=lavender+essential+oils&qid=1606147118&sprefix=lav%2Caps%2C227&sr=8-7) (organic whenever possible) - Legendary lavender not only fights headaches, keeps bugs at bay, reduces stress and acts as a powerful antiseptic, it also smells absolutely divine. It's crisp, sweet, strong floral scent embodies the feminine and enchants the senses! [Argan oil](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B004Z209HS?slotNum=1&ots=1&ascsubtag=[artid%7C2141.a.26099233[src%7C[ch%7C[lt%7C&linkCode=gs2&imprToken=58bafaea-adc2-f29d-9ab&tag=hearstmagazin-20) - Argan oil is hands down my go-to skin oil! It is rich in nutrients such as vitamin E, squalene, fatty acids and antioxidants. It so easily penetrates the skin to boost moisture and activate the creation of natural lipids. Unlike many other oils, argan oil is relatively light and can be used on most skin types. [Dried hibiscus flowers](https://www.amazon.ca/Organic-Hibiscus-Flowers-453-Botanicals/dp/B002DXU07A/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2NB0VASCBGOCC&dchild=1&keywords=dried+hibiscus+flowers&qid=1606147553&sprefix=dried+hi%2Caps%2C180&sr=8-7) - Hibiscus is associated with the planet Venus and and the element of water, making it the perfect flower for this Inner Goddess blend. Hibiscus flowers have long been connected to lust, love and divination. [Dried rose bud](https://www.amazon.ca/Red-Rose-Petals-Sprinkles-Decoration/dp/B07SNTF854/ref=sr_1_19?dchild=1&keywords=dried+rose+flowers&qid=1606147588&sr=8-19) - Roses are also associated with the planet Venus and the element of water. For centuries, roses have been used in love mixtures and connected to romance, protection, love, healing and even psychic powers. (Dried rose petals work fine here too!) How to Make Rose Hibiscus Bath Salts (This new moon bath recipe makes enough for one goddess bath ritual) Step 1 - In a mixing bowl combine 1/4 cup Himalayan salt with 1/4 cup Epsom salt. Step 2 - Using a dropper, add 3-5 drops of lavender oil to the salts and stir well. Step 3 - Add 1 tsp of argan oil, and combine well. Step 4 - Toss in 2 tbsp of both dried hibiscus and dried rose buds/petals. Step 5 - If not using immediately, transfer to an air-tight container and store in a cool, dry location. * Feel free to pour this rose bath salts recipe blend directly into the new moon bath. This is my preferred method and I just use a fine mesh sieve/strainer to remove the debris before emptying the bath water. If you don't want to both with any post-bath mess, toss your blend into a reusable mesh bag. Healing Inner Goddess New Moon Bath Ritual Intention Affirmation - \"I intend to release and empower the goddess within me.\" Lighting & Mood - Candlelight only, preferably 2-3 unscented pink candles (white candles are also a decent suitable). Be sure the space is tidy and free of clutter. Remove any synthetic or possible toxic fragrances (plug-in's, scented candles, etc). Light a natural lavender scented incense or place a few drops of lavender essential oil into a diffuser. Surround the outside of the tub, or space with healing crystals that help connect with the feminine. Selenite, moonstone and rose quarts are beautiful options. Bath Water - For this new moon bath, be sure the water is as warm as your body can comfortably handle for up to 30 minutes. Add Healing Inner Goddess - Rose & Hibiscus Bath Salts and use your hands to stir in before entering the water. Use this time to connect to the water and soften your inner voice. Breath Work - Once you enter the bath, allow yourself a few minutes to adapt to the space and really release yourself from the surface realm. Once you feel relaxed, close your eyes and begin to inhale slowly and deeply through the nose. Hold for 2-3 seconds and exhale deeply, but at a natural pace through the mouth. You might find that making an \"awe\" sound as you exhale, really helps you to connect to your inner feminine. Sound - Crystal singing bowls are so beautiful and can aid in deepening your focus and relaxation. I really like [this Youtube video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGi9aMDeAJY)and find it works so magically with this ritual. I also find music to be an incredibly powerful tool for manifestation. I find haunting, melodic female voices to be the most effective. Here are a few songs I put together on my Spotify list for this Healing Inner Goddess - Rose & Hibiscus New Moon Bath ritual: It's Happening Again - Agnes Obel The Blessing - Essie Jain Dreams - Kelsey Lu Spinning Centers - Chelsea Wolfe Exiting the Water - If not using a mesh bag to contain dried florals, used mesh sieve to remove any floating debris. Open the drain and allow water to wash away as you exit the bath. Wrap yourself in a thick, fresh and clean towel or bathrobe. Remain clear of your intentions as you dry yourself and apply your favourite body oil or moisturiser (preferably naturally scented and non-toxic). Leave the space only when you feel ready. Blow out the candles, leave your crystals near a natural light source to recharge and remind yourself that you truly are the vessel of a beautiful, powerful and compassionate inner goddess. Move on with lightness and gratitude. So there you have it! My first and to date, most effective healing ritual bath. These weekly sessions have had an immense positive effect on my life, and I hope beyond hope that you will also find comfort, peace, joy and inspiration in this process <3 Rose & Hibiscus Bath Salts - Healing the Inner Goddess Ingredients - 1/4 cup Himalayan salt - 1/4 cup Epsom salt - 1 tsp argan oil - 3-5 drops lavender essential oil - 2 tbsp dried rose petals/buds - 2 tbsp dried hibiscus petals Instructions - In a mixing bowl combine 1/4 cup Himalayan salt with 1/4 cup Epsom salt. - Using a dropper, add 3-5 drops of lavender oil to the salts and stir well. - Add 1 tsp of argan oil, and combine well. - Toss in 2 tbsp of both dried hibiscus and dried rose buds/petals. - If not using immediately, transfer to an air-tight container and store in a cool, dry location.
