NTS facilities are des igned and constructed to improve water quality by taking advantage of processes that occur in nature . The NTS is an additional layer of treatment on top of the first flush best management practice (BMP) required by the City and County per the MS4 Permit of the California Regional Water Q uality Control Board (CRWQCB). Design review of first flush BMP's are the responsibility of the City o r County. Each development or NTS site is a portion of a larger regional approach to dealing with non-point source polluti on. Specific goals in the design of natural treatment systems include: (1) improvement of water quality in the San Diego Creek watershed and other watersheds partially or completely within District boundaries and (2) the reduction of Total Maximum Daily Lo ads (TMDLs) of various constituents d ischarged to Upper Newport Bay. The reduction of TMDLs is required to meet targets established under the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permit issued to Orange County and a number of Cities or co -permittees . Design criteria for natural treatment systems have been developed to achieve these goals and are outlined in the following sections. 2 2.0 REGIONAL WATER QUALI TY CONTROL BOARD (RW QCB) REGULATIONS 2.1 GENERAL STORMWA TER REGULATIONS 1. As authorized by the Clean Water Act (CWA), the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program controls water pollution by regulating point sources that discharge pollutants into waters of the United State s. Under the NPDES storm w ater program, operators of large, medium and regulated small municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) require authorization to discharge pollutants under an NPDES permit. 2. Treatment of urban runoff by natural treatment systems will assist the Cou nty of Orange and permitted cities in meeting their discharge req uirements under the MS4 permit. IRWD is not a co-permittee under the MS4 permit; however, the District has assumed maintenance and monitoring responsibilities for the natural treatment system , in cooperation with the responsible parties. 2.2 TOTAL MAXIMUM D AILY LOAD (TMDL) LIM ITS 1. The MS4 permit, issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Santa Ana Region, specifies TMDLs for sediment and nutrients in San Diego Creek and Newport Bay. TMDLs for Newport Bay for several toxic pollutants which are exceeding applicable State water quality standards are: selenium; several heavy metals; several organic chemicals including modern pesticides (i.e., diazinon and chlorpyrifos) a nd legacy pesticides (DDT, Chlordane, etc.) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). 2. Each NTS facility will need to be designed to red uce TMDLs of these pollutants. The Natural Treatment System Master Plan identifies the estimated po llutant removal for ea ch site. The developer shall verify any changes to the Master Plan for the local natural treatment system facilities. 3. Monitoring of water quality will allow IRWD to determine if the natural treatment system is removing pollutants as designed. 3 3.0 DESIGN SUMMARY 1. Natural treatment systems reduce pollutants in stormwater through the processes of sedimentation, filtration, solar ultraviolet disinfection, nitrification, plant uptake and volatilization. Figure 1 indicates the main components of a typ ical natural treatment system and the processes that occur as stormwater runof f flows through each component. Figure 2 illustrates the various vegetation and irrigation zones of a typical system cross -section. Properly designed and operated natural treatm ent system facilities can reduce the TMDLs of various pollutants that would otherwise be discharg ed to the receiving water body. Natural treatment systems will be provided by developers to treat the urban runoff within their development and reduce TMDLs fo r various pollutants, such as, but not limited to: sediment, nitrogen, phosphorous, pathogens, pesticides, selenium and heavy metals. 2. Natural treatment systems can be categorized into four main types : Type I - Off-line facilities: Designed to treat low flows that are diverted into an off-line wetland facility. Type II - In-line facilities: Designed to create water quality treatment wetlands within existing stream channels. Type III - Combination facilities: Designed to incorporate natural treatment systems into existing flood control basins. Type IV - Bioretention facilities: Designed to capture and treat urban runoff and first flush stormwater using one or more subsurface cells containing an engineered matrix. 3. Most of the Development/Local fac ilities will be Type I or III, under the management of various jurisdictions (County or City Flood Control, County Vector Control, IRWD NTS maintenance and operation). The primary purpose of the Development/Local facilities will be treatment of base flows from urban development. 4. Bioretention facilities (Type IV) are distinctly different from facilities of Types I, II and III and therefore, covered in more detail in Appendix B. 4 Figure 1 Typical Natural Treatment System Components and Design Functions A A (See 3.1.1.D) 5 Figure 2 Typical Cross -Section of a Natural Treatment System Showing Vegetation and Irrigation Zones 6 3.1 SYSTEM LAYOUT Natural treatment systems incorporate various elements to achieve specific design objectives. While each wetland design will be tailored to local conditions and constraints, most of the natural treatment system facilities share common design features, as shown in Fig ure 1 and the NTS Master Plan. These design elements are intended to provide various functions within the natural treatment system, as follows: 1. Inlet Structures Inlet structures will be designed to dissipate energy at the inflow, which will reduce the potential for erosion and damage to w etland plants. If riprap is used, it shall be grouted to discourage vector breeding areas. Inlet structures also spread the water laterally and help prevent short -circuiting of flows t hrough the treatment facility. The number of inlets to the inlet pool shall be limited to a single feed to facilitate water quality monitori ng requirements. The inlet shall be placed a minimum of one foot above the basin's general invert elevation in an effort to prevent blockage of the storm drain conduit by silt build up. An isolation sluice gate structure, or other means to contain and drain the system, shall be required in the event of a hazardous material spill. 2. Inlet Pool The inlet pool is designed to trap the majority of c oarse sediments in the inflow. They shall also promote eas y desilting and trash removal. Vector control may be achieved through the use of mosquito fish. Any riprap should be grouted to discourage mosquito reproduction. 3. Shallow Water with Emergent Cattails Shallow water, 1 -2 feet in depth, supports e mergent plants such as cattails which provide frictional resistance to slow the velocity of the inlet waters, promoting sedimentation and increasing t he time for pollutant removal. Cattails are aggressive emergent plants that are effective in facilitating microbially -mediated removal of nitrate and immobilization of heavy metals an d metalloids such as selenium. Cattails also provide a good physical substrate for filtering bacteria and some removal of soluble phosphate. Cattails are selected for planting in upstream areas near the inlets because they are not an attractive food source for native fish and waterfowl. 4. Open Water Areas Deeper, open water areas, approximately four to six feet deep, provide favorable environments for mosquito fish and also provide sites for ultraviolet degradation of complex organics and path ogens. Open water areas also provide access areas for mosquito control measures. Open water pools may be required for basins with tributary drainage areas of greater than 100 acres. 7 5. Shallow Wa ter with Emergent Bulrush Bulrushes also help to slow the velocity of inlet flows, promoting sedimentation and increasing retenti on time for pollutant removal. Bulrushes provide a good long -lasting peat source for anoxic degradation of organic pollutants s uch as pesticides and petroleum products. 6. Outlet Structures Outlet structures control the hyd raulic regime of the wetlands. A level control structure shall be incorporated into the outlet structure to provide precise level controls. Aluminum stop logs shall be l imited to a maximum width of 48 inches. The number of outlets from the wetlands shall be limited to a single facility to facilitate water quality monitoring requirements. Extended detention riser outlet structures will be employed in the propos ed wetlands because they drain water more slowly than culve rts. Erosion control will be provided at the inlet and outlet ends and a device to prevent floating debris from clogging the outlet may be inst alled on the perforated riser. Outflow structures will be equipped with valves or gates to permit drainage of the wetland pool for opera tion and maintenance purposes. A trash rack on the outlet will prevent plugging with debris and provide safety to the public. An isolation sluice gate structure or other mea ns to contain and drain the system shall be required in the event of a hazardous material spill. 7. Riparian and Upland Vegetation Vegetation in the riparian area adjacent to the wetlands can serve important habitat functions including: a. Produce detritus, a critical foundation of the wetland food chain b. Provide shading, which helps control water temperature c. Provide a transition between the wet lands and surrounding habitat. Upland vegetation will serve as a buffer between the natural treatment system wetlands and the surrounding urban uses. Figure 2 is a cross -section of a typical natural treatment system showing the transitions between the riparian and upland areas. 8. Plug-Flow Configuration The natural treatment systems are designed to be a linear channel -like configuration in order to promote \"plug -flow\". Plug-flow refers to the concept that water entering the wetlands moves as a unit from the inlet to outlet promoting uniform flow, which improves treatment effectiveness. Alignment of the basin shall be in th e direction of the prevailing wind to discourage mosquito reproduction. 9. Monitoring Equipment Monitoring devices for automatic flow measurement and water quality sampling will be installed near the inlets and outlets to measure influent and effl uent pollutant 8 concentrations. Electrical outlets shall be provided at each inlet and outlet above the high water level, but not more than 15 feet above the sample point and 35 feet horizontally. 3.2 GENERAL DESIGN PARAMETERS Design considerations will vary depending on the location and shall conform to Table 7.2 of the Natural Treatment System Master Plan and the particular objectives of the stormwater treatment plan. Common design parameters that need to be considered in the natural treatment system de sign are as follows: 1. Depth of Water Water depths along the channels and in wetl and and ponded areas are varied as shown in Figure 1 and 2, to provide a variety of tr eatment functions and habitats. Specifically, vegetation communities consist of eme rgent, aquatic and woody plants which have different preferred water depths depending on both the type of plant and specific plant species. 2. Detention Time Many natural treatment facilities are designed with a dual function of treating low flows and stormwater r unoff from small storms as well as the first flush of lar ge storms. The developer/local natural treatment system facilities are designed primarily for the treatment of low flows. Stormwater detention in Type I off -line facilities occur through use of levees constructed around the perimeter of the wetland a rea. However, at many sites, the area available for stormwater detention is greater than the area of the wetlands. The levees are designe d to provide a stormwater quality pool depth of about 3 -4 feet above th e water level in the wetlands. Optimum treatment of low flows requires a detention period of 10 to 14 days, with 10 da ys considered to be a minimum. During periods of stormwater detenti on, the wetlands will be mostly inundated for a period of about 36 -48 hours as require d by other agencies per the R egional Boards MS4 permit. Type II in -line facilities are intended for treatment of low flows so there is no stormwater detention component . At Type III facilities, stormwater detention is integrated with the flood retarding function of the facility so no additional levees are anticipated to be needed at those sites. 3. High Runoff Flows Runoff from large storm events can potentially stir up a nd move sediments that were previously settled and can potentially damage wetland vegetation. Diversion structures at the Type I offline facilities are designed to bypass flows in excess of the storage capacity of the stormwater quality pool. 9 4. Trash and Coarse Sediments Design of sediment traps in the inlet pool will consider lik ely upstream sediment sources. Trash racks will be installed upstream of the wetlands to capture large trash and vegetative debris. 5. Channel Banks To address water safety concerns, the wetlands are designed with shallow side slopes along the perimeter, generally between 3:1 and 5:1. Type II in -line facilities are intended to create shallow water pools within existing stream channels so sloughing and failure of side slopes c aused by increased wetting should not generally be a concern. However , riprap may be placed along the base of the channel wall for increased protection. 6. Channel Profile The profile of the wetland will be designed with a gradual slope to keep the water velocity low, which promotes more effective treatment in the wetlands and limits stress on the vegetation that could be caused by high water velocities. However, design slopes will not be so low that stagnant water conditions exist, which could promote mo squito breeding or other nuisances. 7. NTS Dry Weather Flows The treatment flow or dry weather flow will be approximated by the tributary irrigated area in acres multiplied by the runoff factor of 0.169 GPM/Irr Ac (for turf type landscaping without any conse rvation methods) or the runoff factor of 0.085 GPM/Irr (for turf type landscaping with remote, weather based, evapotranspiration or ET, automated irrigation controller tec hnology and public education). Drought resistant landscaping has the potential of pro ducing even small flow quantities. 10 4.0 CIVIL AND LANDS CAPING DESIGN DETAIL S 4.1 STANDARD NOTES 1.

The Engineer shall direct the Contractor to provide submittals and obt ain approvals by the Developer/ Engineer and IRWD prior to the contractor ordering access road materials. 4.2.2 ISOLATION STR UCTURES AND GATES An isolation sluice gate structure or other means to contain and drain the system is required in the event a hazardous material spill occ urs upstream of the NTS Basin. The Engineer shall provide detailed plans, notes and specifications to clearly show how to construct the isolation structures and gates. Isolation sluice gates sh all be manufactured by H. Fontai ne, Ltd. or Waterman . The isolation sluice gate shall have 316 stainless steel guide frames and stem s and configured to keep the thrust ring out of the flow path as much as possible. The sluice gate shall be mounted within a structure that shall provide for safe and easy operatio n, maintenance and replacement. The sluice gate shall have a 2 -inch square operating nut for valve key operation, or similar met hod that limits access of the slui ce gate by non -IRWD personnel. The sluice gate shall be mounted to the structure with a wall thimble and stainless steel nuts, bolts and EPDM gaskets. No direct wall mounting is allowed due to the difficulty of getting this method to properly work. The Engineer shall require the Contractor to submit shop drawings and cut sheets for approval by the Developer/Engineer and IRWD prior to the contractor ordering equipment. 4.3 MONITORING FACI LITIES AND ELECTRICA L SERVICE 1. Monitoring facilities for water quality of the natural treatment systems will be specified for each site, based on the Master Plan and review ed by District staff. Based on the treatment effectiveness for pollutant removal, the monitoring ob jectives may chang e over time. Thus, the facility must be designed to accommodate both automatic and manual monitoring devices. 14 Samplers require a minimum of a 4 -inch pool to draw from and shall not be placed higher than 15 feet above the lowest sampling point or more than 35 feet horizontally from the sampling point. If a modified junction structure or MH is used for a sampling point , the opening shall be at least a 30 -inch diameter opening with a light weight fiberglass MH cover with stainless steel bolt-downs as manufac tured by Comcore Utility Products, Inc. MH steps shall be poly coated and conform to APWA Standard Plan 636-1 or approved equivalent. The junction structure's shaft inside diameter dimension s shall be modified to conform to IRWD's Procedural Guidelines , Section 4, Extra D epth Requirements . Generally, electrical service must be available at both the inlet and outlet t o the natural treatment system to accommodate future requirements and f or the irrigation controllers. For monitoring devices such sampling units, a G.F.I. duplex receptacle with weatherproof jumbo cover a long with a 5 -foot x 5 -foot x 6 -inch concrete pad would be required. For each inlet and outlet , the sample unit shall be a refrigerated liquid sampler . If the flow through the NTS is relative ly large, like El Modena NTS or the San Joaquin Marsh , the sampler unit would be a HACH Sigma 900Max all weather refrigerated sampler , FRP security enclosure, with flow measurement capabilities, Sigma 950 with RS -232 connections and SCADA modbus communicat ion protocol with optional modem or equal product s by ISCO . The primary flow measuring device, such as flume, pipe, channel or weir shall be design ed and installed to fit the hydraulic situation for each NTS basin. Smaller Basin Flows would require a refr igerated all weather water quality sampler, such as a HACH Sigma all weather SD900 with a FRP security enclosure or equal products by ISCO . Flow measurement would be obtained by direct observation (gallon bucket and timer or other acceptable methods ). 2. The developer shall apply for, coordinate with and provide approved service plans from Southern California Edison and if required, from the phone company. The developer shall also provide an electrical and telephone site plan from the utility Point -of-Conn ection (POC) to each sample point, irrigation controller and other miscel laneous designated outlet. The Developer/E ngineer shall coordinate and meet with IRWD and the service planner prior to preparing the final design. At this time , the D eveloper/ Engineer shall work with IRWD in the investigation of the possibility of using radio communications at the NTS sit e in lieu of telephone service. However, radio communications are based on line -of-sight and the developer 15 must provide information to IRWD that verif ies that future planned developments will not block the radio signal from the NTS site to the existing IRWD radio antennas. 16 5.0 PLAN CHECK SUBM ITTALS, GRADING AND LANDSCAPE PLANS Refer to Chapter 6 of the Procedural Guidelines for submittal procedures requirements. 17 6.0 LANDSCAPING AND PLANTING Natural treatment system wetlands will be landscaped according to facility type, adjacent land use and type of natural habitat present. All vegetation will be native to the region to complement the natural diversit y and attract native wildlife. A planting scheme of the proposed vegetative community shall be depicted on the natura l treatment system site plans. Include the species, quantity, spa cing of all plantings, stock type (bare root, plug, container, seed) and the source of the plant material. The plan must identify the proper time to plant and include, if appropriate, acceptable substitutions. If bare root stock is being used, they should be planted in the spring. 6.1 GENERAL LANDSCA PING DESIGN Plant material is an integral component to the design and function of natu ral treatment system wetlands. The preferred planting arrangement is flexible but should remain in a ran dom or \"natural plant la yout.\" Massings and groupings of single species are generally preferred over linear arrangem ents and alternating patterns. While the design is flexible, it is important to establish distinct and diverse layers of overstory trees, understory trees, shrubs and herbaceous materials. The intent is to establish a diverse, dense vegetative cover to treat stormwater runoff, provide wildlife habitat and withstand stresses from insect and disease infestations, drought, temperature, wind and exposure. 6.2 GENERAL PLANT MATERI AL GUIDELINES The use of native plant material, combined with minimum planting area size, provides cover for wildlife and creates a microenv ironment within the landscape. The conditions of a natural treatment system mimic natural wetland and floodplain areas. Typical plant species found in these natural settings should be obtained from local nurseries specializing in native plant propagation (generally, these materials are not available from commercial nurseries) and installed per IRWD standard specifications. Locally grown material, if available, is preferred over material purchased from another region, as it is more likely to be adapted to local conditions (i.e., soils, weather, hydrology, etc.) Material should be selected at the nurs ery by a qualified individual who will visually inspect trees and shrubs either at place of growth or onsite before planting for compliance with requirements for genus, speci es, variety, size and quality. In addition, seed should be purchased 18 from a reputable supplier experienced in obtaining, processing and distrib uting viable native seed mixes. Avoid the use of weedy, invasive or non -native species. 6.3 SITE PREPARATIO N The site must be prepared for the installation of plant materials and the appl ication of see d. The Contractor shall complete the following tasks. 6.3.1 TRASH AND DEBRIS REM OVAL The facility shall be kept free of all trash and debris at all times. All trash and debris shall be removed from the site by the Contractor and legally disposed of off -site. 6.3.2 SOIL CONDITION AND P REPARATION 1. Soil Testing: Upon acceptance of the si te, conduct soil testing to verify the specified soil conditioning program. a. The project area sh all be divided into four areas and composite s oil samples collected and analyzed for each area. b. Soil testing shall consist of a complete horticultural suitability analysis testing, including: Fertilize (pH, salinity, nitra te nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen phosphate phosphorus, potassium, calcium magnesium and sodium). Agricultural suitability (saturation extract salinity, Sodium Alkalinity Ratio (SAR). Particle size appraisal (USDAA particle size). c. Soil testing shall be accompanied by a written r eport by the testing laboratory with recommendations for a modified soil conditioning program, if required. d. Approved soil testing laboratories: Soil and Plant Lab, Inc., PO Box 6566, Orange, CA 92863 -6566 Telephone: (714) 282 -8777 Wallace Laboratories, 365 Cor al Circle, El Segundo, CA 90245 Telephone: (310) 615 -0116 19 2. The soil shall be prepared in accordance with the recommendations provided in the soils report. 6.3.3 WEED ERADICATION All weeds that are present shall be aggressively eradicated prior to and throughout the installa tion period, mechanically, if feasible. In circumstances where mechanical removal is not effective, it is appropriate to utilize systemic herbicides that have been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use in aquatic situations. All weeds shall be removed and all resulting debris shall be legally disposed of off -site. The IRWD Biologist/Restoration Specialist shall inspect the site prior to seeding and plant installation to ensure that it is weed free. The target species and those determined by the IRWD Biologist/Restoration Specialist to be inconsistent with the success of the site shall be removed. Targeted weed species include, but are not limited to, the following : Mustard (Hirschfeldia spp.and HERBICIDE TRE ATMENT 1. In order to apply an unrestricted herbicide (Roundup, Rodeo, etc.), the contractor must have a Pest Control Business License, which requires that at least one individual employed by the contractor be in possession of a Qualif ied Applicators License (QAL). If a qualified applicator is not present during treatment, all applicators must have undergone documented h erbicide application training. All licenses must be issued by t he State of California, registered in Orange County and be of current status. 2. Spraying and or wick application of herbicide may be employed t o control undesirable species. Only EPA approved glyphosate -based, systemic herbicides (e.g., Roundup or Rodeo) may be used and Rodeo must be used when applying herbicide within 100 feet of a natural watercourse or body of water. 3. For foliar spray application, Roundup and Rodeo shall be applied at a minimum of a 1.5 percent solution during foliar wick application . The herbicide shall be applied at a 33 percent solution; a 100 percent solution shall be used for all stump treatments. No pre-emergent herbicides may be used. A brightly colored dye shal l be used in all applications. The material shall be a non -toxic, w ater-soluble liquid material such as \"Blazon\" by Millike n Chemical or equivalent. The dye shall be mixed with the herbicide at no more than half the rate specified on the label (one quarter the rate will usually suffice). 4. Spraying may be conducted only wh en weather conditions are conducive to effective uptake of the herbicide by the targeted species (e.g., sunny, dry and when plants are actively growing) and when wind conditions are such that herbicide drift is non-existent (5 mph or less). During herbicid e application, protection for non -target species (e.g., native vegetation) is required. 6.3.5 EROSION CONTR OL 1. In order to prevent unnecessary competition w hile the native plant community is getting established, no grasses shall be seeded or planted as erosion control measures prior to the installation of the natural treatment facility. In case of heavy rainfall conditions, non - vegetative erosion control measures (i.e., silt fence, sandbags, straw wattles, etc.) are to be used. 2. The Contractor shall be responsible for all erosion control required during the entire term of the contract. The Contractor is responsible for installing preventative erosion control measures as necessary to prevent erosion damage. This will include slowi ng the velocity and dispersing concentrated water that is entering and exiting the restoration site. Erosion control measures shall be included in various items of work and no additional compensation shall be allowed. 22 6.3.6 MATERIALS The Contractor shall supply all materials necessary to complete the work in accordance with the specifications. All materials are subject to approval by the IRWD Biologist/Restoration Specialist. Seed The Contractor sh all provide all seed material. The species to be i ncluded were selected based on native plants found in a local fresh water mar sh plant community.

Upon receipt of the seed, the Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the viabilit y of the seed unit it is sown. All seed must be sown within 96 hours of being delivered to the Contractor. Container Plants The genetic source of all container plants will be within ten miles o f the project site, if possible and of similar microclimate regime (coa stal Orange County). All plant substitution decisions or alternative genetic sources shall be approved by the IRWD Biologist/Restoration Specialist. Because the Contractor must guarantee 1 00 percent survival for the 120 day establishment period, all contai ner plants must be observed and approved by the IRWD Biologist/ Restoration Specialist and the Contractor at the time of delivery. All plants shall be healthy and in good condition. The roots shall be young roots that fill the container and must not be wrapped around the sides of the container. Any plants that, in the opinion of the Contractor or the IRWD Biologist/Restoration Specialist, are incapable of surviving for 120 days following good installation techniques will be returned to the nursery for replace ment . Upon receipt of the container plants, the Contractor will be responsible for ensuring the health and good condition of the pl ants until they are installed. All container plants must be kept in an area that is safe from vandalism, herbivore browsing and drying from winds. Cuttings The following guidelines apply to collecting cuttings for immediate use on the site: a. All cuttings shall be collected from within ten miles of the project site. b. Collect the cuttings within 24 hours of anticipa ted planting. Cuttings not planted within 24 hours of collection shall be disposed of in an appropriate manner. c. Take cuttings only from healthy, vigorous plants that are in a dormant state. d. Do not collect from more than 50 percen t of the plants in a give n area and do not remove more than 50 percent of any plant. 23 e. Cuttings shall be approximately 36 inches in le ngth and shall range between \u00bd and 1 inch in diameter. f. Cut the top of each cutting square above a leaf bud; cut the base below a leaf bud at an angle of approximately 45 degrees. Us e only sharp, clean tools. g. Trim all leaves and branches from the cuttings flush with the stem. h. Submerge cuttings in water until planting time (within 24 hours of collection). Cuttings that are allowed to dry out sha ll not be used. Mulch The Contractor shall supply enough clean organic mulch to cover the watering basin of each plant installed. All mulch must be certified by the distributor that it is free of pesticide residue, eucalyptus and palm. Mulch shall be a s hredded \"medium grind\" mix. A minimum of 95 percent by weight of the materials shall pass a 3 -inch screen with less than 20 percent of particles by weight passing a 0.125 -inch screen. Organic content shall be minimum 90 percent based on dry weigh t and det ermined by ash method. Moisture content shall be 25 - 50 percent at time of delivery. All material must be woody in nature , derived from yard trimming, wood residuals (no eucalyptus) or a combination thereof. The mulc h shall have an acceptable odor like so il, musty, moldy or negligible. Unacceptable odor shall be sour, putrid or ammonia. Mulch material shall have been fully composted to a temperature of at least 130 F thro ughout the pile for a minimum 7 day period. If requested , the supplier must provide the documentation for recorded temperatures and pile turning. The mulch shall be free of visible contaminates such as glass, metal, plastics and paper. Contractor shall submit mulch samples to IRWD for review and approval prior to delivery. Other Materials All other materials not specifically described herein, but required to complete this project, shall be furnished by the Contractor and are subject to the approval of the IRWD Biologist/Restoration Specialist. 6.4 PLANTING METHODS 6.4.1 CONTAINER PLA NTS/WILLOW AND MULEF AT CUTTINGS 1. Following delivery by the nursery, the Landscape Contractor shall regularly water all nursery stock in containers and place them in a cool area that is protected from the sun and drying wind s. The Landscape Contractor shall not allow plants to dry out before or while being planted. Wilted plants, whether planted or not, will not be accepted and shall be replaced at the Landscape Contractor's expense. 24 2. Container plantings shall be spaced i n natural -looking patterns to replicate th e character of natural stands. The plantings shall be set out on the site under the supervision of the IRWD Restoration Ecologist and monitored with consideration given to the microclimate for each plant. 3. Shrub s/trees shall be planted according to the following directions: All planting holes shall be excavated, have vertica l sides with roughened surfaces and be one and one -half (1 \u00bd) times the diameter and twice the depth of the plant's container for plugs, one gallon, five gallon and f ifteen gallon plant containers. For 24 and 48 -inch boxes, the planting holes shall be excavated to six inches deeper than the box size and twice the width. Any roots wrapped around the sides of the container shall be p ulled loose from the rootball. The sides of the rootball shall be scarified to promote new root development. Plants shall be planted with the roots untangled and laid out in the planting hole to promote good root growth and prevent the plant from becoming rootbo und. Roots shall be adequately protected at all times from sun and/or drying winds. After excavation and before planting, the planting hole shall be filled approximately half full with water, backfilled with thor oughly broken up native topsoil and then completely filled with water to minimize soi l settling after installation. Plants shall be set in the planting hole so that the crown of the root ball is 2 inches above finish grade. The crown of the plant shall not be depressed. A watering basin shal l be provided around each plant. Each plant is to be individually watered with sufficient water to reach to the lower roots at the time of planting. In the event that the season's rainfall is low, additional watering may be required if the plants have insu fficient moisture to sustain them between rainfall events. Typical plant spacing: Small shrubs - 5 feet o.c.; medium/large shrubs -10 feet o.c. and trees 20-30 feet o.c. 6.4.1.1 Willow and Mulefat Cuttings Mulefat and willow cuttings shall be planted according to the following specifications and details: Use one -inch rebar to create planting holes that are approximately 24 inches deep. Fill each planting hole with water and allow the water to absor b into the surrounding ground. Once the water has completely drained, be certain not to 25 disturb the settled soil in th e bottom of the planting hole. Repeat this watering process once more. Apply a root stimulant to each cutting prior to planting, in accordance wit h manufacturer's instructions. When most of the second filling of water has soaked into the ground, insert a cutting in the hole. The base of the cuttings shall be a minimum of 18 inches deep and shall have three to five bud scars exposed above the fini shed grade. Backfill with excavated material. The material shall be distributed evenly throughou t, without clods or air pockets and filled in without damaging the bark of the cutting. Tamp down the backfill sufficiently to prevent easy removal of t he cuttings. Immediately following installation, deep soak each plant twice with sufficient water to reach the lowest part of the cutting. This will ensure that the cutting settles completely within the planting hole. 6.4.2 HAND SEEDING Before broadcasting, the pure live seed (PLS) shall be mixed with a dispersal agent (rice hulls, bran, etc.) at a 2:1 ratio (dispersal agent to seed), which will aid in goo d seed dispersal and coverage. After broadcasting, the seed is to be lightly raked into the soil (but not covered) with a bamboo landscape rake or equivalent. 6.4.3 HYDROSEEDING 1. At the time of hydroseeding, all hydroseed mixing shall be performed in a clean tank (thoroughly rinsed a minimum of three times in the presence of the IRWD Biologi st/Restoration Specialist) with a built -in, continuous agitation and re -circulation system of sufficient operating capacity to produce a homogeneous slurry and a discharge system that will apply the slurry to designed areas at a continuous and uniform rate . The Contractor shall be responsible for providing all water required to hydroseed, as well as for providing a location to legally clean out the hydroseed tank. 2. The slurry preparation shall take place at the project site and shall begin by adding w ater to the tank when the engine is at half throttle. Good recirculation shall be established when the water level has reached the height of the agitator; at this time seed shall be added; the long strand wood fiber mulch shall be added when the tank is a least 30 percent filled with water. The mulch used shall be 100 percent long strand wood fiber mulch (e.g., Conwed Hydro Mulch or Canfor EcoFiber); no paper mulch shall be used. The Contractor shall commence spraying once the tank is full. 26 3. The Contrac tor shall spray designat ed areas with the slurry in a sweeping motion and in an arched stream, until a uniform coat is achieved with no slumping or shadowing and the material is spread at the required rate per acre. The hydroseed slurry should float down f rom above as opposed to a direct stream. During hydroseed application, all container plants must be protected from damage (including but not limited to mulch coating, direct spray, dragging hose , etc. ) The tanks must be emptied completely duri ng each stag e of hydroseeding. Excessive mulch coating on con tainer plants must be removed. Intentional or unintentional damage caused by Contractor hydroseeding activity will be required to replace each lost plant. 4. The standard hydroseeding technique shall be e mployed as follows: 1,500 lbs/acre of 100 percent wood fiber mulch (paper mulch shall not be used) Specified pure live seed 150 lbs of Ecology Control binder (or approved equal) 5. See the establishment period guidelines for various planting methods in the Monitoring and Maintenance section. 6.5 WETLAND VEGETAT ION 1. The main purpose of the natural treatment system is the treatment of various pollutants. Thus, plant selection is based primarily on need to achieve pollutant treatment and secondaril y to provide wildlife habitat. Recommended materials should be native species selected for their ability to withstand periodic flooding and drier/drought conditions. In general, a diverse plant palette that can be maintained over long periods in winter and s ummer is the best method of pollution removal. 2. The shallow water channel sections (approximately one to two feet in depth) of Type I, Type II and Type III wetlands will be planted with species from the cattail and bulrush series. Species in the ). 3. Planting in the wetland area will involve a uniform density of a single species of emergent plants across the entire channel in an effort to promote uniform flow through the channel cross section. For example, bands of cattail and bulrush series may b e planted on alternate shallow water sections, with cattails planted along upstream sections and bulrushes planted along the 27 downstream sections. If plant density and type are not uniform across the width of the channel, then preferential flow paths and sh ort-circuiting could develop, which reduces the uniformity of flows and overall treatment effectiveness. 4. Optimal planting densities v ary between particular species. If vegetation is too dense, it may inhibit water circulation, and if too sparse, the vegetation is not productive and may not be able to provide enough of a food base for some species of wetland organisms. When hand planting plugs in wetland areas, specie s in the cattail series should be planted at a rate of 2,400 plugs/acre. Species in the bulrush series should be planted at a rate of 2,800 plugs/acre. When seeding wetland areas, species in the cattail series should be seeded at a rate of 0.5 pounds/acre. Species in the bulrush series should be seeded at a rate of 7.0 pounds/acre. 6.6 RIPARIAN VEGETATION (LWL TO HWL) 1. Vegetation in the riparian area adjacent to the wetlands serves important habitat functions and provides a transition between the wetlan ds and the surrounding habitat from the low water level (LWL) to the high water level (HWL). This riparian vegetation may also provide suitable habitat for wildlife 2. Understory vegetation (groundcover and shrubs) should transition from the cattail/bulrush habitat, through shallower water wetlands (less than one foot in depth) and into the wooded overstory habitat that will be less frequently inundated. Overstory ri parian species may include those in the mixed willow series such as black willow ( Salix gooddengii ), red dcover vegetation may be composed of a seed mix containing the following species and applied according to techniques described in Section EDGE OF ACCESS ROAD) Upland/t ransition vegetation will serve as a buffer between the natural treatment sys tem wetlands and the surrounding urban areas. Plant selection s for these areas are intended to provide habitat for avian species as well as providing a transition ele ment in a developed landscape. If required, an irrigation system designed to eliminate ru noff into the NTS will regulate hydrology in upland areas. Overstory species may include western sycamore, coast live oak, western cottonwood . Shrub vegetation may include California sagebrush, California buckwheat, giant wild -rye, monkey flower, California rose. Groundcover vegetation may be composed of a seed mix containing the following species and applied according to techniques described in Section 6.8.3: PLANTING DENSIT IES Planting densities of vegetation in the riparian and upland areas may be achieved by util izing the following guidelines. For understory vegetation, apply seed mixes us ing hydroseeding techniques 29 discussed in Section 6.4.3 . Understory shrub plantings should be planted at a density of 5 -10 feet on center and overstory trees planted at approximately 20 -30 feet on center using containerized planting methods described in Section 6.4.1 . 6.9 SOILS AND SUBST RATE 1. Soils are an important part of constructed wetlands and their associated riparian areas. Wetland soils provide a substrate for plant growth and production, habitat for microorganisms and act as a semi -permeable barrier that helps to slow the loss of water due to infiltration. 2. The soil within a wetland must provide substrate to support growth of emergent plants and provide suitab le habitat for microorganisms. In wetlands, a fine organic layer provides an envir onment for plant growth by maintaining moisture and allowing for the de composition of organic matter. The surface layer acts as a filter for finer particles still in suspension and maintains an environment for the microbial community to help brea kdown urba n runoff pollutants. Soil pH levels between 5.0 and 7.0 provide the ideal habitat for microb ial production. The substrate should be thick enough (approximately 24 inches) to allow for the establishment of plants. 3. Another important function of soils i n wetland areas is its ability to act as a barrier to water infiltration. The quantity of water infiltrating into the subsurface depends on the properties of the soil underl ying the bottom of the wetlands and on groundwater elevations. Soils with small grain size, such as clays and silts, provide a better barrier to water infiltration than soils with larger grain size such as sand, la rge areas of cobble or gravel. Areas of bedrock shall be made suitable for plant growth and infiltration through fractures s hall be prevented. 4. According to the Soil Conservation Service, major portions of the District contain soils characterized by low infiltration capacities (silty -loam soils inter -bedded with fine textured soils and clayey soils wi th a high swelling poten tial). However, there are areas where soils with higher infiltration capacities (fine to coarse textured sandy loam) predominate. Soil conditions and infiltration at individual sites will be evaluated d uring detailed design studies. The import of more suit able substrate may be required at sites that contain soils with high infiltration rates. Liners at the bottom of the wetland facilities will be considered for all sites where unsuitable 30 soils are present, or where other en vironmental conditions dictate. The liners can be either synthetic geotextile materials or 18 -24 inche s of silt loam, clay loam or dried organic muck. 31 7.0 IRRIGATION 7.1 GENERAL Natural treatment systems require a minimum inlet flow rate in order to establis h and maintain the vegetation. Generally, the minimum flow wil l be provided by urban runoff. In areas not subject to urban runoff irrigation, supplemental irrigation with recycled water may be required. Procedural Guidelines for the use of recycled water for irrigation are contained in the IRWD Procedural Guidelines, Section 5 and apply to recycled water facilities for natural treatment system irrigation; in addition, IRWD requires separate irrigation systems for trees and shrubs. 7.2 SYS TEM CRITERIA The natural treatment systems consist of several landscape systems/hydro zones (see Figure 2) that will require varied irrigation systems to establish and provide for long -term survival of the various plant communities. The irrigation system m ust minimize runoff into areas below the high water line. 1. Upland Area : Defined as the community/public edge planted with ornamental, drought - tolerant landscape to blend with the various regions and neighborhood communities outside of where the natural treatm ent system is located. Upland A rea drainage shall be directed to th e development's storm dr ain system. Drainage from upland slopes adjacent to the NTS area shall be directed to the development's storm drain system and not allowed to enter the NTS from the side or in a short circuiting manner. Irrigation Equipment : Conven tional overhead rotor, spray or bubbler irrigation equipment. Irrigation spray shall be directed uphill and away from the NTS . 2. Upland /Transition Zone : Defined as the slope area between the Upland Area and the riparian area of the natural treatment syste m or HWL. This area may be planted with natural vegetation to limit irrigation runoff into the natural treatment system facility. Irrigation Equipment : Bubbler and drip irrigation systems may be used to provide for establishment of container plants or u se hydroseed mix without an irrigation system, propagated by natural rainfall. The container plants and trees shall have watering basins and other measures shall be taken to eliminate irrigation runoff into NTS. Shrubs shall be on separate irrigation systems from tree s. 32 3. Riparian Area : Defined as the area between the HWL and the LWL. Irrigation Equipment : None p referred. Use a hydroseed mix propagated by natural rainfall to prevent irrigation runoff into NTS, in accordance with Section 6.6 of this document. 4. Wetland Area : Defined as the area below the LWL within the basin. No irrigation system in the wetland area will be permitted. 7.3 EQUIPMENT LIST The District has established this standard list of irrigation equipment for all treatment facilities to be maintained by the District. Contro ller: CalSense enclosure assembly. These irrigation controllers are availa ble in 8, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32 or 40 station models (C ontractor required to have CalSense sign off on the installation). Flow Sensor: CalSense FM series. Recycled Basket Strainer: Hayward #72 SS. 30 mesh or finer. Hunter PRS Bubbler Rainbird 1400 series. Wiring for irrigation power and contr ol shall be placed in conduit. No direct burial of wire will be allowed. 7.4 CALIFORNIA REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTRO L BOARD, SANTA ANA NOTIFICATION Use of recycled water requires coordination with the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, S anta Ana River Basin (CRWQCB). The CRWQCB must be notified in advance that the use 33 of recycled water may be ne cessary within the subsequent 7 day period. Notification will also be required on the day prior to application of recycled water. 34 8.0 MONITORING AND MAINT ENANCE OF LANDSCAPIN G 8.1 LANDSCAPE MONITORING AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA 1. During the establishment period, the developer shall be responsible for monitoring the landscape and provide routine maintenance. 2. Performance Standards Required: Landscape with irrigation system - Establishment period, 120 days with 100 percent plant survival, with a n extended maintenance period to coincide with the hydroseed establishment period with an 80 percent survival rate. Landsc ape with no irrigation system (h ydroseed) - Establishment p eriod, minimum one year or greater to achieve 75 percent native coverage and less than 5 percent nonnative coverage . 8.2 PERFORMANCE MON ITORING 1. The District shall conduct inspection and water quality monitoring for each site based on a schedule established by the District and a lso durin g and after major storm events. Routine inspections will be performed to monitor sediment accumulation, plant condition, vector monitoring and mosquito fish monitoring. 2. Water quality monitoring will consist of continuous flow and water level measurement, sampling to determine influent and effluent concentration of pollutant concentrations and field measurement of gen eral water quality parameters. IRWD, at its discretion, may undertake to perform any or all of the above monitoring during the e stablishment period. Based on the monitoring results, IRWD will determine if modifications to the system design are required or if final acceptance of the facility may be granted. 8.3 LANDSCAPE MAINT ENANCE The developer is required to provide maintenanc e of the landscape vegetation during the establishment period, including replacement of vegetation, removal of invasive vegetation, herbivore control, irrigation system, trash removal and general care of herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and trees. 35 8.3.1 M AINTENANCE OF LANDSC APE Normal maintenance will inc lude weeding, herbivore control and irrigation. During the establishment period after the installation is complete, the plant community must be maintained regularly to ensure its successful establishment. At the end of the establishment period , a thorough observation of the restoration areas shall be conducted by the Contr actor and Restoration Ecologist and a list of those plants that are alive and healthy shall be submitted to t he Contractor at that time. The Contractor shall replace all dead or missing container plants required to achieve the 100 percent survival rate required through the establishment period. The Contractor may choose to plant more than the total required to achieve this standard. 8.3.2 REPLACEMENT OF VEGET ATION All vegetation will be guaranteed during the establishment period by the Contracto r (see performance standards). If any vegetation needs to be replaced during this period, the Contractor will be res ponsible for replacement. Partial acceptance of a portion of the NTS facility landscape is not acceptable. 8.3.3 REMOVAL OF IN VASIVE VEGETATION In order to help establish the developing plant community, the Contractor shall remove all nonnative weeds to reduce the amount of competiti on for natural resour ces, including water, nutrients and sunlight. The amount of weeding required will be determined by the amount of weed seed in the soil, weather conditions and the Contractor's diligence in removing the weeds, there by reducing the weed seed bank. The Contractor shall be required to satisfy the following weeding criteria continuously throughout the maintenance period. The percent cover by weeds must be kept below 5 percent at all times. If at any time the site contains more than 5 p ercent cover by weeds, the Contractor will forfeit 10 percent of the total maintenance period payment for each month of noncompliance and shall incur liquidated damages of 10 percent of maintenance period payment per day of noncompliance. No more than 10 percent of the site may be covered by weeds that have reached the seed dispersal stage. If the site contains more than 10 percent cover of weeds that are in the seed dispersal stage, the Contractor will forfeit 75 percent of the maintenance period payment. 8.3.3.1 Methods of Removal All non -native invasive weeds shall be rem oved mechanically, if feasible. In circumstances where mechanical control is not effective, it is appropriate to utilize systemic herbicides that have been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use in aquatic situations. In no case shall weedy speci es exceed 12 inches in height. All nonnative vegetation debris accumulated as a result of weed - removal activities shall be legall y disposed of off -site. Target species and those 36 determined by the IRWD Biologist/Restoration Specialist to be inconsistent with the success of the establis hment effort shall be removed. Targeted weed species include, but are not limited to, the following: Mustard (Hirschfeldia spp. Morning Herbicide Treatment Guidelines 1. In order to apply an unrestricted herbicide (Roundup, Rodeo, etc.), the contractor must have a Pest Control Business License, which requires that at leas t one individual employed by the contractor be in possession of a Quali fied Applicators License (QAL). If a qualified applicator is not present during treatment, all applicators must have undergone documented h erbicide application training. All licenses mu st be issued by the State of Californ ia, registered in Orange County and be of current status. 38 2. Spraying and or wick application of herbicide may be employed to control undesirable species. Only EPA approved glyphosate -based, systemic herbicides (e.g., Roundup or Rodeo) may be used and Rodeo must be used when applying herbicide within 100 feet of a natural watercourse or body of water. 3. For foliar spray application, Roundup and Rodeo shall be applied at a minimum of a 1\u00bd percent solution and during foliar wick application the herbicide shall be applied at a 33 percent solution; a 100 percent solution shall be used for all stump treatments. No pre -emergent herbicides may be used. A brightly colored dye shall be used in all applications. The materia l shall be a non -toxic, water -soluble liquid material such a s \"Blazon\" by Milliken Chemical or equivalent. The dye shall be mixed with the herbicide at no more than half the rate specified on the label (one quarter the rate will usually suffice). 4. Spray ing may be conducted only whe n weather conditions are conduc ive to effective uptake of the herbicide by the targeted species (e.g., sunny, dry, and whe n plants are actively growing) and when wind conditions are such that herbicide drift is non- existent (5 mph or less). During herbicide application, protection for non -target species (e.g., native vegetation) is required. 8.3.4 GENERAL SHRUB CARE Typical maintenance considerations include watering thoroughly during the establishment period if necessary and inspecting shrubs closely to discover and control pests or d iseases in their early stages. The only other maintenance requirement is occasional pruning. 8.3.5 GENERAL TREE CARE Trees require virtually the same maintenance as shrubs (i.e., watering, pruning and inspecting for d iseases). One additional ma intenance procedure is staking. During installation, the developer will stake all trees. The stakes shall be removed as soon as the trees are able to stand on their own. Stakes are usually only needed through the first season. 8.3.6 DISTURBANCE C ONCERNS 1. The developer shall be aware of the following maintenance restrictions: a. Breeding /nesting s eason b. Migration c. Surrounding jurisdictional wetlands d. Endangered species e. Local bird s / mammal s / reptile s / amphibian s 2. Vegetation spraying / removal will be limited between March 1 and Sept ember 15 if concerns \"a\" through \"e\" above apply. A qualified biologist, to ensure compliance with 39 the Endangered Species Act, the California Endangered Act and Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, shall monitor any vegetation removal or earthwork between March 1 and September 15 in or in the vicinity of existing habitat. This monitor shall have the authority to stop or otherw ise divert work to avoid impact as necessary. 3. Waterfowl migration normally starts in late October and ends late January. Vegetation removal can proceed during this p eriod, but waterfowl disturbance su ch as noise levels, time of day and frequency need to be addressed. 4. After final acceptance of the natural treatment system facility, IRWD will assume responsibility for monitoring and maintenance. 8.4 PEST CONTROL Insect and herbivore damage control shall be the responsibility of the Contractor, using only those methods approved by the IRWD Biologist/Restorat ion Specialist. The Contractor shall implement control measures, which may require fencing or caging all con tainer plants at the earliest sign of damage. In addition, the Contractor shall treat any insect infestation as necessary to protect the health and establishment of the plant community per the recommendation of the IRWD Biologist/Restoration Specialist. 8.5 IRRIGATION Irrigation shall be applied in a manner that encourages deep rooting of the installed plant community. In addition, excessive runoff by irrigatio n should be kept to a minimum. The use and method of irrigation are the responsibility of the Co ntractor, and no further compensation will be allowed. The source and cost of the water shall be the responsibility of the Contractor and shall be included in the maintenance price. Two sets of laminated colored as -builts controller charts shall be submitt ed approved by IRWD for on -site cabinet storage and back up filing. 40 9.0 SECURITY AND SIGNAGE Natural treatment system facilities may utilize shallow and ponded water areas for wat er quality treatment purposes. At the time of final design, consideration will be given to mitigating any significant hazard to public safety by the facility through th e inclusion of fencing, signage or special design features, based on the specific physi cal circumstances at the site. In addition, signage in Englis h and Spanish will be considered at the site where it can be effectively used to describe the functions of the facility to the public. Recycled water facilities will be clearly identified according to the requirements of Section 5. 41 10.0 PERMITS Prior to construction, the developer will be required to obtain all required environmental clearances for the proposed natural tr eatment system facility. The following table summa rizes the majority, but not all of the possible federal, state and local permits from various agencies that may be required prior to construction.

Bioretention Areas, also known as bioretention cells or bioretention facilities, function as soil and plant -based treatment systems that remove pollutants through a variety of physical, biological a nd chemical processes. Because ponding is typically of short duration in the bioretention areas, issues related to vector control or permanent pool maintenance are generally eliminated. Also, the biorentention areas, if constructed in areas where relativel y permeable soils underlie the features, can be designed to infiltrate urban stormwater runoff and aid in attaining watershed hydromodification objectives. By infiltrating and temporarily storing runoff water, bioretention areas reduce a site's overall run off volume and help to maintain the predevelopment peak discharge rate and timing of the subwatershed in which they are constructed. Specific goals of the bioretention areas are as follows: 1. Improvement of water quality within San Diego Creek watersheds re gulated by the Santa Ana RWQCB. 2. Reduction in Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) of various constituents ultimately discharging into Newport Bay. 3. Reduction of runoff volume to the affected watershed receiving waters . While results vary, i n a recent study conducted on a bioretention project, reductions o f 90 percent for heavy metals such as cadmium, c opper , zinc and l ead and 80 to 90 percent reductions for PAH's ( Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) and PCB's 1 David N., Lent, M., Leatherbarrow, J., Yee, D., and McKee, L. (2011). Bioretention Monitoring at the Daly City Library. Final Report. Contribution No. 631. San Francisco Estuary Institute, Oakland, California. 52 2.0 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK 2.1 GENERAL STORMWATER REGULATIONS Stormwater runoff water quality is regulated under the federal National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES\") program established by the Clean Water Act of 1972 (CWA). The NPDES program's ob jective is to control and reduce the discharge of pollutants to water bodies from non -point discharges. The program is administered by the Regional Water Quality Control Boards throughout the State. The Santa Ana RWQCB issues NPDES point source permits for discharges from major industries and non -point source permits to municipalities and other non - agricultural dischargers for discharges to water bodies in the Santa Ana Region. The NPDES provides a variety of measures designed to minimize and reduce pollu tant discharges. All counties with storm drain systems that serve a population of 50,000 or more, as well as constructi on site s one acre or more in size, must file for and obtain an NPDES permit. Another regulation for minimizing and reducing pollutant dis charges to a publicly owned conveyance or system of conveyances (including roadways, catch basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man -made channels and storm drains, designed or used for collecting and conveying stormwater) is the EPA's Storm Water Phase II Fina l Rule. The Phase II Final Rule requires an operator (such as a city) of a regulated small municipal separate storm sewer syste m (\"MS4\") to develop, implement and enforce a program (e.g., Best Management Practices ['BMPs\"], ordinances or other regulatory m echanisms) to reduce pollutants in post -construction runoff to the city's storm drain system from new development and redevelopment projects that result in land disturbances greater than or equal to one acre in size. For the City of Irvine, the City of Irv ine Community Development Department is the local enforcing agency of the Orange County MS4 NPDES Permit. 2 2 State of California, California Regional Water Control Board, Santa Ana Region, Order No. R8 -2009 -0030, NPDES No. CAS618030, as Amended by Order No. R8 -2010 -0062, Waste Discharge Requirements for the County of Orange, Orange County Flood Control District and The Incorporated Cities of Orange County within the Santa Ana Region Areawide Urban Storm Water Runoff Orange County. 53 The Orange County MS4 Permit requires the installation of post -construction BMPs for new development and sets standards for the implementation of these requirements. These standards have been updated most recently in Order No. R8 -2009 -0030 NPDES No. CAS618 030 as amended by No. R8 -2010 -0062 from the Santa Ana RWQCB. The provisions of this order are applicable only for projects whose tentative map applications are deemed substantially complete after March 2011. The intent of these regulations is to ri gorously regulate t he quality and quantity of post -construction stormwater runoff from any new impervious surfaces over 10,000 square feet in size so that downstream receiving waters are not adversely impacted. To comply with these requirements, new develo pments are required to install stormwater runoff water quality BMPs that f ilter or treat approximately 80 percent of the stormwater runoff generated from rainfall events, before discharging into a receiving water such as San Diego Creek. Additional hydrogr aph modification BMPs are also required so that post -project runoff does not exceed pre -project rates or durations if such an increase could contribute to erosion in downstream receiving waters. IRWD is not a co -permi ttee under the new MS4 permit; however, the District has voluntarily assumed maintenance and mon itoring responsibility for water quality treatment facilities consistent with IRWD's Natural Treatment System (NTS) Master Plan. 2.2 TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD (TMDL) L IMITS 1. The Orange County MS4 permit, issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Santa Ana Region, specifies TMDLs for sediment and nutrients in San Diego Creek and Newport Bay. TMDLs for Newport Bay for several toxic pollutants which are exceeding applicable State water quality standards include selenium; several heavy metals; and several organic chemicals , including modern pesticides (i.e., diazinon and chlorpyrifos), legacy pesticides (DDT, Chlordane, etc.) and polychlorinated biphe nyls (PCBs). 2. Each bioretention a rea is to be designed to reduce concentrations of these pollutants based on tributary area. 54 3.0 DESIGN SUMMARY 3.1 GENERAL SYSTEM LAYOUT Urban stormwater should be collected using a storm drain system for larger watersheds. The conveyance system should be designed to minimize sediment uptake and transport and water velocity entering the facility . The intent of the bioretention area is to treat up to approx imately 80 percent of the average annual runoff in an area where a small amount of ponding occurs and slowly filters the inflow through a planted mulch and filtering sand medium. The stormwater can then either be directly infiltrated into the ground or c ollected in a subdrain system installed at the base of the bioretention area and discharged via gravity into a storm drain system as treated stormwater. Generally, if onsite soil infiltration exceeds 5 inches per hour, infiltration is preferred. Sites with infiltratio n less than 5 inches per hour but greater than a \u00bd inch per hour may utilize both a subdrain system and an infiltration gallery. Figure 1 on the following page presents a schematic bioretention system plan and profile considering a drained and undrained system. 55 Figure 1. Schematic bioretention system detail with high and low permeability subsoils. 56 3.2 GENERAL DESIGN PARAMETERS 3.2.1 SHAPE The shape of the bioretention facility can be designed to conform to the available land or open space. Rectangular shaped b ioretention facility Oval shaped b ioretention facility Linear b ioretention facility Irregular shaped b ioretention facility 57 3.2.2 SIZING Sizing of the bioretention area should account for the amount of stormwater filtered through the mulch and sand media and the depth of ponding that could occur before the stormwater feature releases water through the overflow outlet. The sizing can be calculated by either methodology set forth in the Orange County Model Water Management Plan (May 2011), as follows: 1. Capture and infiltrate, filter or treat 80 percent of ave rage annual runoff. OR 2. Capture and infiltrate, filter or treat the runoff from the 24 -hour, 85th percentile storm event, as determined from the County of Orange's 85th Percentile Precipitation Isopluvial Map and draw down the stored volume in no more than 48 hours following the end of precipitation. One foot of short -term ponding above the low point of the bioretention area is common in calculating treatment volumes; however, considerations regarding the depth of ponding should be made in conjunction with the project landscape architect regarding the ability of proposed plant materials to wi thstand greater ponding depths. At a minimum however, the inlet to the overflow catch basin should be at least 6 inc hes above the low point of the bioretention planting area. The actual sizing steps are outlined as follows: Estimate an initial treatment area based on BMP pervious surface. Dete rmine the duration of treatment rainfall event based on Orange County rainfall data. Determine total runoff volume associated with the treatment rainfall event. Calculate the treatment volume required. Calculate the amount of runoff that filters through the soils during the treatment rainfall event. Calculate the remaining v olume after filtering; confirming that the sum of the water filtered through the soil and the remaining ponded volume capacity is equal to or greater than the required treatment volume. The intent of the sizing requirements is to capture a water quality d esign storm sufficiently such that first flush constituents will either infiltrate into the component filter media or be stored with approximately one foot of head over the filter media for the duration of the storm. 58 3.2.3 SPECIFIC BIORETENTION AREA MATERIALS 3.2.3.1 ENERGY DISSIPATION ROCK Rock riprap for energy dissipation and sediment collection should be provided at inlets to each planned bioretention area based on calculated exit velocities and flow depths. Rock riprap should meet Caltrans riprap speci fications for absorption and durability and should be underlain by a durable woven geosynthetic separation fabric mat. 3.2.3.2 MULCH LAYER A minimum of 4 inches of mulch should be placed on top of the sand filter media in the bioretention area where stormwater ponding will occur. The material can be composed of organic material with sand or pea gravel, depending on the planting concept. However, the material should be denser than water so that it will not float during brief anticipated ponding periods and should have an infiltration potential greater than that of the filter media. 3.2.3.3 SAND FILTER MEDIA The sand filter media for stormwater treatment shall consist of high organics soil (no gravel) with an infil tration rate of approximately 5 inches per hour, supplie d from previously tested and approved sand quarry or landscape supplier sources . The thickness of the sand medium should be designed to remove pollutants to the maximum extent practicable, but should generally be no less than 18 inches. The sand medium should conform to the following minimum specifications and requirements: Screen Information Percentage a. Maximum particle size : 2 millimeters (0.078 inch) b. Percent passing No. 10 screen (2mm) : 100 percent (coarse sand or finer) c. Percent passing No. 200 screen (0.074mm) : 10 to 15 percent d. The overall dry we ight percentages shall be 85 -90 percent sand, les s than 5 percent clay and less than 5 percent silt. The sum of clay, silt and organics should be less than 10-15 percent of the total volume. The sand filter media should have 4 to 6 percent (by dry weight) organic compost mixed in. The organic compost percentage may be lowered by IRWD or by the design landscape architect for varying plant species in the treatment measure, if shown to inhibit growth of target species. 59 In addition, the mulch and sand filter media should have a salt concentration less than 500 mg/L and the pH should be between 5.5 and 7, un less directed otherwise by IRWD or project landscape architect. 3.2.3.4 SUBDRAIN SYSTEM (optional) In low infiltration soils, a subdrain system should be provided at the base of the bioretention area to collect treated stormwater prior to returning to the municipal storm drain system (or a creek outfall as applicable). The subdrain system sh ould consist of a minimum of 12 inches of Caltrans Class 2 permeable material or an angular 0.375 -inch drain rock. The subdrain pipe should consist of perforated SDR 35 PVC pipe or equivalent, which collects treated stormwater in the system. These subdrains should be spaced 10 to 20 feet on center. Filter fabric is not recommended to be placed between the subdrain system and the sand filter media as experience has demonstrated that it may be prone to clogging. 3.2.3.5 VEGETATION The project applicant will be responsible for maintenance and repair/replacement of plants or irrigation during the first year of operation. In addition, a separate entity will be identified by the project applicant for maintenance of landscaping. If provided, plants should be native species suitab le to well drained soil and occasional inundation. Shrubs and small trees can also be used if planted so as not to interfere with the subdrain system. Trees and vegetation should not block the bioretention area inflow or outflow, obstruct utilities or create safety issues. Irrigation systems are acceptable to maintain plant life through dryer months of the year, if a wetter plant palette is selected for the area. A wetland -type plant palette of forbs, sedges and wetland grasses with limited irrigat ion can provide uptake of nutrients and other stormwater constituents during dry weather conditions, if dry weather flows are anticipated. 3.2.4 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS IN SUMPS For situations where the bioretention area will be located in a sump that depends on outflow through a catch basin, the bioretention area should be designed to have freeboard of at least 1 foot to the lowest building finished floor elevation (including garage and excluding crawl space) for te mporary c onditions when the outlet is 50 percent clogged. Where the freeboard cannot be provided, an emergency sump pump may be allowed on a case-by-case basis. A minimum of 2 inches between the crest of the emergency outfall riser and higher elevation ( top of planting mounds) of the treatment surface area is required. 60 4.0 CIVIL AND LANDSCAPIN G DESIGN DETAILS 4.1 CONSTRUCTION DETAILS Design documents should include grading and landscape construction drawings and technical specifications that address, but are not limited to, the following: a. Existing site conditions b. Excavation limits c. Location of benchmark d. Proposed structures e. Channel plan and profile, if the pond is greater than 100 feet in length f.

Grading requirements per applicable codes (IRWD, Greenbook, Cit y, County, etc.) q. Subgrade for structures per IRWD Construction Manual r. Concrete work requirements 4.2 ACCESS ROADS Where bioretention areas are lower than 6 feet below general adjacent grades, access roads must be provided. Such roads shall have a minimum width of 12 feet and shall provide all -weather access with a structural section as recommend ed by a civil engineer. Access roads with a longitudinal slope between 0 and 8 percent should have a structural section of at least 4 inches of asphaltic concrete (AC) over 8 inches of Class 2 aggregate base (AB) over prepared subgrade. Access roads with a longitudinal slope betw een 8 and 10 perc ent shall have a structural section of at least 6 inches of jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) over 4 inches of AB over prepared subgrade with a raked finish and reinforcement as recommended by the Engineer. Access roads shall h ave a cross slope of at least 2 percent . 61 Access to the outlet and inlet structures must be provided with a road consisting of at least 4 inches of asphaltic concrete (AC) over 8 inches of Class 2 aggregate base (AB) over prepared subgrade. 62 5.0 LANDSCAPE AND PLANTI NG 5.1 GENERAL LANDSCAPE DESIGN Bioretention areas should be landscaped according to facility type, adjacent land use and t ype of natural habitat present. Where bioretention areas are in open space areas away from development, vegetation should be native to the region to complement the natural diversity and attract native wildlife. A planting scheme of the proposed vegetative community should be depicted on the bioretention area site plans. Det ails shoul d include the species, quantity and spacing of all plantings, stock type (bare root, plug, container, seed) and the source of the plant material. The plan must identify the p roper time to plant and include if appropriate, acceptable substitutions. If bare root stock is being used, it should be planted in the spring. 5.2 GENERAL PLANT MATERIAL GUIDELINES While the hydraulic function of the bioretention area is not reliant on vegetation, plant material can be a n integral component to create a natural bioretention area. The preferred planting arrangement is flexible but should remain in a random or \"natural plant layout .\" Massings and groupings of single species are generally preferred over linear arrangements an d alternating patterns. The intent is to establish a diverse, dense vegetative cover to treat stormwater runoff, provide wildlife habitat for beneficial insects and withstand stresses from insect and disease infestations, drought, temperature, wind and exp osure. The use of native plant material, combined with minimum planting area, provides cover for wildlife and creates a microenvironment within the landscape. Locally grown material, if available, is preferred over material purchased from another region, as it is more likely to be adapted to local conditions (i.e., soils, weather, hydrology, etc.). Material should be selected at the nursery by a qualified individual who will visually inspect trees and shrubs either at place of growth or onsite before plant ing for compliance with requirements for genus, species, variety, size and quality. In addition, seed should be purchased from a reputable supplier experienced in obtaining, processing and distributing viable native seed mixes. A void the use of weedy, inva sive or non -native species. 63 6.0 IRRIGATION Depending on aesthetic objectives, bioretention areas may require a minimum inlet flow rate in order to establish and maintain vegetation. Generally, the minimum flow will be provided by urban runoff. In areas not s ubject to urban irrigation runoff, supplemental irrigation with recycled water may be provided. Procedural guidelines for the use of recycled water for irrigation are contained in the IRWD Procedural Guidelines, Section 5 and apply to recycled water facili ties for natural treatment system irrigation, which would be similar to the bioretention areas. In addition, IRWD requires separate irrigation systems for trees and shrubs. 64 An irrigated bioretention area with select ornamental landscaping that serves as a community amenity. A neighborhood bioretention area that does not use supplemental irrigation or ornamental landscaping. 65 7.0 MONITORING AND MAINT ENANCE Bioretention facilities require periodic monitoring and maintenance to keep the outlet and inlet structures free of blockage, to remove litter and debris, to promot e proper filtering and drainage and to preserve aesthetics. Facility maintenance should include cleaning the inlet and outlet areas, observing the function of the engineering components with respect to drainage capacity and o verall performance and pruning vegetation. However, IRWD will not maintain ornamental vegetation. The facilities are to be designed t o be free draining, with up to approximately 1\u00bd feet of ponding capacity during larger storm events, such that pumping of the areas is not required under typical storm conditions. If water ponds for over 48 hours after cessation of rainfall, the facility a nd/or piping leaving the facility may not be functioning properly. Ponding in excess of 72 hours may be cause for mosquito vector control concern and should be addressed immediately. 7.1 BIORETENTION FACILITY MAINTENANCE Vegetation is planned in the facilities to aid in biological and chemical reactions associated with the removal of typical urban stormwater pollutants. Plants are important for proper functioning, but should not be allowed to become so extensive that their root s ystems could clog the subdrains or otherwise prevent stormwater from freely draining with in the system. Pruning, removal and replacement with smaller specimen s, as well as normal plant care are anticipated only to the extent that they do not hinder infiltration of water. Pesticides and herbicides should generally not be used within the facilities as the chemicals would add significantly to the pollutant load and might cause adverse changes in the biotic mix necessary for proper facility function. Pesticide use should be limited and only applied if necessary for mosquito control and in conformance with all applicable rules and regulations; it should be conducted by a licensed IPM (integrated pest management) contractor. 66 The following general mainte nance activities will be implemented at a bioretention area. Grade modifications that prevent runoff from flowing toward the bioretention areas should be avoided. 1. Landscape Maintenance - IRWD assumes no responsibility for landscape maintenance or monitorin g during the initial landscape establishment phase. Long term, IRWD's maintenance responsibilities will be limited to providing for adequate surface flow capacity. Bioretention areas within neighborhoods may contain ornamental landscaping. Maintenance of s uch landscaping to improve appearance shall be carried out by an entity other than IRWD. 2. Plant Replacement - All plant replacement materials should be able to tolerate both periodic saturated soil conditions and anticipated runoff constituents. The bioret ention facilities should be planted with vegetati on having low water, fertilizer and pesticide requirements. Plant replacement after the establishment phase should be in like kind unless allowed otherwise by a qualified plant expert. 3. Debris Control - Litter and debris blocking the bioretention area filter media could reduce performance and should be removed. Regular debris removal should be undertaken. This includes removal of woody vegetation blocking the flow path, removal of debris blocking facil ity ou tlets and inlets and removal of general litter from all facilities. 4. Drainage Monitoring - Because the bioretention areas have a filtration component, it is important that the facilities drain at appropriate rates and do not experience excessive ponding. D rainage monitoring should be performed to observe long -term changes in the system and to highlight needed maintenance to either the surface or structures, including to the riser pipes. 7.1 DRAINAGE AND FILTER MEDIUM MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE Replacement of the sand media or other media within the bioretention area should not be necessary as part of maintenance activities unless evidence of excessive saturation or ponding is noted during repeated monitoring and the integrity of the discharge pi ping has been established as functional. If the monitoring of subdrains, inlets, outlets and other drainage appurtena nces does not indicate blockage and the filter medium still does not drain at approximately 5 inches per hour, replacement of the filter me dium should be considered. The original filter medium composition should be repeated in any new medium placed in the facilities unless an alternative is specifically approved by IRWD. 67 Urban runoff will be routed to each bioretention area via surface flow from impervious and landscaped areas. If standing water or soggy, saturated soil medium is noted during monitoring, it may indicat e subdrain or outfall clogging and both the subdrain and outfall should be checked for integrity and proper function. The bior etention area inlets and outfalls must be maintained in working condition, free of obstruction and freely draining. Each bioretention area should be monitored for proper function and public safety. Of particular importance is maintaining the facilities' a bility to filter stormwater and dry -weather nuisance runoff without clogging or becoming saturated (although during large storms some amount of water ponding is expected). To this end, the facility must not be capped with clayey soils, covered with impervi ous surfaces or altered in any way that is inconsistent with the project plans. The rock rip rap (or concrete) apron for energy dissipation, located where water enters the bioretention area, may need periodic maintenance if there is sediment buildup. The purpose of the apron is to slow the water entering the bioretention area to minimize scour erosion and also to trap suspended sediments prior to the water flowing onto the surface of the bioretention area. Therefore, sediment buildup is expected in the apr on area. If sediment buildup has accumulated in the apron area such that it appears th at the rip rap or concrete is not trapping sediment/debris or that the void spaces between the riprap are filled with sediment/debris, this is a trigger for replacement of the riprap in this area. The facilities' surface at the inflow locations must be regularly cleared of any excess sediment and leafy/organic material to enable proper flow characteristics . If sediment, organic material or other debris is accumulating suc h that it has created a continuous cover over any portion of the bioretention area, the buildup should be removed. 68 A typical monitoring schedule for a bioretention area is presented below: Bioretention Area Maintenance Pruning and light feeding of ornamental landscaping. Verifying proper irrigation system function . Quarterly Monthly Check plant height and health, prune plants and repair irrigation as needed. If needed, plant replacement should be able to tolerate saturated soils and should have low water, fertilizer and pesticide requirements. Assess m ulch Annually Apply mulch as needed. Can be applied over previous layers. Routine removal of litter and debris . Quarterly Remove debris/litter as necessary. Observing for standing water or soggy, saturated soil medium. Three times yearly and additionally within two working days after storm events with rainfall exceeding 1 inch in 24 hours. Replace filter medium as necessary. Clearing of surface of facility at inflow locations of excess clayey sediment, leaves or other debris. Three times yearly and additionally within two working days after storm e vents with rainfall exceeding 1 inch in 24 hours. Remove debris as necessary. Observing for sediment buildup at rock apron inlet protection. Annually Remove filter fabric and rock. Clean rock, replace filter fabric as needed. Verifying that access road is suitable for vehicle access . Annually Reapply gravel or other surfacing as necessary. Table 1 - Typical Biorete ntion Area Maintenance Schedule 69 8.0 SECURITY AND SIGNAGE The bioretention area is to be designed primarily for water quality purposes. Subject to approval by IRWD , it may be possible to integrate other recreation uses around or through the features, depending on the overall layout of a particular project. In general, a bioretention area should not be subjected to vehicular traffic, except as required for maintenanc e. The area can be designed with a pea gravel mulch that generally inhibits pedestrian a nd vehicular traffic and pedestrian walkways can be designed to circumvent the features. IRWD staff may consider installing signs around the facility if high levels of pedestrian traffic persist. A typical sign may read \"This area has been constructed for water quality purposes. For your safety and for the protection of water quality in this neighborhood, please respect and preserve the landscape features in this area \". The following is sample signage.
