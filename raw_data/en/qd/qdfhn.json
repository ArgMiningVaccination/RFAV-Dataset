Within the historical debates concerning abolition, many scholars have argued the importance of shipboard conditions . There is no doubt that death occurred constantly from disease, accident, rebellion, suicide and natural disaster however, none of these studies have adequately addressed the issue of slave ships within the context of eighteenth-century notions of improvement an d reform. This paper will address health and disease on board British slave ships during a time when environmental causes of disease had come to the fore. The eighteent h century observes attempts to cleanse the environment and the putrid air with fumigation, refuse burial, waste sites and hydraulic improvements. Therefore, more specific ally, this paper will identify the work and responses to the eighteenth-century natur al philosopher, Stephen Hales (1677-1761) who designed a system of ventilation that was introduced onboard ships, prisons, hospitals and gaols throughout Britain. This paper will question the significance of Hales's work for British slave ships during a time when there was an increasing awareness that man had an economic value for slave-traders and plantation owners. By closely examining the connections between inventions such as Hales's ventilator, eighteenth-century thoughts of environment and disease, and British-colonial expansion, new light can be shed on the mortality and conditions on board British slave ships.2 Phil McCoy, Green Templeton College phil.mccoy@gtc.ox.ac.uk Agency, Freedom and Healthcare: Healthcare for Freedmen under the Freedmen's Bureau During reconstruction the influx of freed into southern communities posed many issues for local, state and federal government. The Freedmen's Bureau was established in 1865 as a federal agency that helped freed sl aves in The South during reconstruction. One major aspect of the Bureau was organizing healthcare for freedmen under the direction of its medical department. This presentation will look at how the Freedmen's Bureau attempted to establish healthcare systems for freedmen, how they worked and their efficacy in providing healthcare for millions of freedmen. The Freedmen's Bureau, while a federal agency, operated largely on a state and local level necessitating interaction with local governments. The nature of these interactions shaped healthcare in each state and determined what type of care the Bureau promoted and provided. Healthcare approaches, efficacy and goals differed state to state but were temporary and largely ineffective throughout The South. This resulted in healthcare becoming a contested issue between political bodies that often resulted in unsatisfactory healthcare for freedmen and freedwomen. Themes of raci al prejudice and paternalism that dated to before the American Civil War also reappeared during reconstruction and hampered the development of an effective healthcare system for freedmen. By looking at the experiences of the Freedmen's Bureau and healthcare in different states it becomes possible to look at what policies and factors attributed to the largely unsuccessful attempts to provide effective long-term care for freedmen. 3 Linda C Maga\u00f1a, Green Templeton College linda.magana@gtc.ox.ac.uk Health on Distant Shores: The Impact of American Imperial Politics on Puerto Rican Public Health and Medicine, 1890-1920 This dissertation will examine the creation of disparate health environments in the metropole and colony, specifically in regards to the intersection of Spanish and American imperial influence on the development of Puerto Rican public health institutions from the late 1890s to 1920s. Because Puerto Rico became a contested space of the expanding American empire at the turn of the twentieth century, it is important to understand how political, social, cultural, and economic interests in Washington, D.C. shaped the fate of Puerto Rican bodies more than 1,500 miles away from the capital. Bureaucrats, nationalist polit icians, US Public Health Service (USPHS) officials, lobbyists, and medical elites all vi ed for legitimacy in determining the course of public health and medicine in Puerto Ri co. Major international philanthropic organizations such as the Rockefeller Foun dation used the island as a staging ground for its own public health investigations. Still, few researchers have traced the transition from Spanish colony to American imperial outpost, as it pertains to such critical themes in twentieth-century history as global health, human welfare, and social well-being. The proposed research will explore how various agendas - of the US Congress and the Rockefeller Foundation among others - impacted the social, political, and economic development of the Puerto Rican population. Recent historical studies are useful but there is a need for a study which takes views of the social and political relations affecting health care and the changing disease environment on Puerto Rico, as well as a more penetrating study of the relationship between the mainland and the island, pressure groups and Puerto Ricans, health care and exploitation. 4 Zujaja Tauqeer, Jesus College zujaja.tauqeer@jesus.ox.ac.uk Saints, Soldiers, and Civilians: Assessing the Impact of Military Government on the Political Economy of Health in Pakistan Carved out of the Indian subcontinent through a bloody partition in 1947, Pakistan has managed to survive in the span of sixty-three years a brutal civil war that tore the country in half, the threat of nuclear war from its eastern neighbor India, and the anarchic forces of domestic terrorism. Yet scores of initiatives aimed at improving the health of the economy, have been powerless to improve even the health of the average Pakistani. One interesting lens then through which the state's failed development efforts and the sociopolitical consequences of that can be dissected is the history of medicine in the country. I will seek to demonstrat e how government and political ideology have historically impacted the delivery of healthcare in Pakistan. Studying issues of governance and civilian well-being in Pakistan while disregarding the role of Pakistan's only effective modern institution - the Pakistan Army - would be historiographically myopic. The political economy of health in Pakistan must take into account a national policy that increasingly came to favor a growth philosophy that aimed to consolidate investment in defense and in development proj ects with short-term financial gains that sacrificed long-term productivity and human development. I will endeavor to show how the increasing encroachment of the milita ry in the governance of Pakistan during the formative first two decades, which witnessed the first outbreak of military rule, affected the distribution of resources between defence and welfare. 5 Julianne Weis, University College julianne.weis@univ.ox.ac.uk Globalized Maternity Care in Modern Ethiopia The principle aim of my research is to help address a dearth in understanding of the history of medicine in Ethiopia, as related chiefly to the interaction between mid twentieth-century hospital construction with indigenous forms of healthcare, particularly the highly ritualised support systems surrounding childbirth. With the bulk of literature on African medical history focussing on societies under colonial powers, Ethiopia presents a unique case in which ruling Emperor Haile Selassie confronted his own cultural landscape by institutionalising the nation's healthcare in the first part of the twentieth century. Studies on the ways in whic h governments systematised maternal and reproductive health towards economically productive ends have contributed greatly to the understanding of the position women and thei r reproductive capacities can play in the intentions of nations and empires, (R ose Hunt 1999, Thomas 2003) a theoretical framework I intend to expand towards the politically unique case of Ethiopia. The Seventh-Day Adventist missionary doctors who staffed and administered the Empress Zauditu Hospital in Addis Ababa from the 1930s-70s consistently mention their deference to His Majesty, Emperor Selassie, whose blue Mercedes was not only seen 'often parked' on the Hospital grounds, but who personally oversaw events from the hospital's inauguration to the handing of diplomas to graduating nursing students. In a similar manner, Emperor Selassie personally asked famed British suffragette Sylvia Pankhurst to oversee the fundr aising for a new maternity-based institution in Addis, the Princess Tsahai Hospital, touring the fa cility by her side at the groundbreaking, inauguration, and repeatedly for British state visits throughout the 1950s-60s. With such a public relations environment in which the Emperor appeared deferent to the health concerns of his subjects, and yet relied almost entirely on foreign medical staff and funders for health projects, I investigate the extent to which existent cultural systems of maternal care were either encouraged or s hunned, and the ways in which Selassie's schemes altered the indigenous health landscape in relation to women and childbirth.6 Richard Howard, Linacre College richard.howard@linacre.ox.ac.uk History of Algal Derived Biofuels Fuel and energy sources which are bountiful and require minimal work have been the prize of successive generations of humans throughout history. Many fuels have been utilised over time, with supply and production problems being their Achilles heel; however, currently researchers are looking to new types of biofuels to solve our energy dependency and one of the most promising feedsto cks for this new technology is algae. The history of algae biofuels has not been as straight forward as would have been expected and how we arrived at this current stat e of affairs is what the presentation will address. There are several periods of research that will be investigated. Initially, how algae became seen to be a potential solution to famine and hunger in post WWII Europe and studying the increases in algae cultivation knowledge that took place. The next step is when in the late 1970s the possibility of extracting 'fuel' from algae (of all types) became widely realised as feasible and was pursued by researchers. However, the main line of enquiry will revolve around US research conducted in the 1980s. In the mid-1970s the fuel crisis gave impetus to the US government to fund a program looking at alternative and secure fuel sources known as the Aquatic Species Program (ASP). This program with the wider Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) program was focused on giving the US fuel independence and soon established that the algal derived biofuels was the best possible solution. The ASP peaked in the mid-1980s; however, it suffered heavily under the Reagan cuts and ramped up US oil production, and subsequently was shut down in 1996. As a result algae biofuels were neglected until the turn of the millennium. 7 Katherine Allen, Wolfson College katherine.allen@wolfson.ox.ac.uk Distilling Medicinal Recipes: The \"Science\" Behind Eighteenth-century Domestic Medicine Health was a fashionable obsession in eighteenth-century England. While purchased medical treatment was increasingly available and affordable many still relied on medical knowledge recorded in recipe collections, be it their personal manuscripts or popular printed guides. Choosing the most effective treatment was a legitimate and constant concern for the infirm and their caregivers, and recipe collections were often the first port of call for trusted and tested remedies. However, the desire for fast cures appears to conflict with the continued recording of time consuming and technically complex remedies produced through distillation. Wh y did recipe collectors choose to include distillation recipes in their books when there were simpler alternatives available? Moreover, to what extent did household distillation shift away from being a woman's charitable obligation, as it was in the seventeenth century, whilst remaining utilitarian in a medical context? Addressing these questions, this paper explores the underlying relationship between medicine and natural philo sophy by considering the practice of distilling medical waters in domestic spaces as a leisure activity of the experimentally-minded. Providing a brief overview of the role of distillation in recipe collections, the household, and in society, this paper uses examples from several manuscripts to examine the technical and material aspects of distillation and the ways in which distillates were used as medical treatment for eighteenth-century ailments. This paper aims to shed light on the broader cultural implications of distillation as an elective process for medical treatment and as a scientific hobby. 8 Ruby Paloma, Linacre College ruby.paloma@linacre.ox.ac.uk Collecting as an Aesthetic Br anch of Natural Philosophy: Collecting at the Court of Brandenburg-Prussia and Aesthetic Appreciation of New Science The Brandenburg Kunstkammer was the collection of the Brandenburg Electorate, roughly made up of fine arts, objects of art, antiquities, numismatics, curiosities and rarities gathered from travel, and mechanical and mathematical instruments. It was gathered in the late sixteenth century, destroyed under the Thirty Years War, and reassembled under the reign of the Great Elector Friedrich Wilhelm in the 1640s. Until the beginning of the 1690s, the collection fits comfortably in the categorisation of princely Kunstkammern presented in literature on early modern collecting and on scientific pursuits at European courts. Whic h roles the collection served between the 1690s and the 1790s, has, however, yet to be pinned down; it is a point when the collection was in a state of reorganisati on and not expansion. The presence of heritage objects in the collection was strong, and it included objects related to early science and mathematical arts whose application had ch anged from the time these objects had been created to their presence in the collection in the late seventeenth century. The collection thus existed somewhere between its role as Kunstkammer , and the research-exhibition it came to be when the management of the collection was delegated to the Berlin Academy of Sciences later in the eighteenth c entury. This paper targets the early years of this historiographical time-gap from the perspective of aesthetics, and suggests that the collection might have functioned as an aes thetic appreciation of natural knowledge, and that such an appreciation was an integral part of the reception of the Scientific Revolution in Brandenburg-Prussia. 9 Kristen Frederick-Frost, St Catherine's College kristen.frederick-frost@stcatz.ox.ac.uk An Artifact-based Study of Henry Moseley's X-ray Spectroscopy Henry Moseley, a British physicist, made a major contribution to physics and chemistry in 1913 by relating X-ray emission frequencies of elements with their atomic number. This dissertation will provide an in-depth examination of artifacts, housed at the Museum of the History of Science, attributed to Moseley's spectroscopy experiments. Specific focus will be placed on the interrelationship of the various artifacts, the possible experimental setups, procedures, and the su pporting laboratory infrastructure that enabled Moseley to formulate the law that bears his name. Moseley's famous spectroscopic research culminated during his brief tenure as an independent researcher at the Electrical Laboratory in Oxford but his methods, intellectual community, and equipment hailed from other academic institutions. His post-graduate research in Ernest Rutherford's group at the University of Manchester and his introduction to X-ray methods by William H. Bragg at the University of Leeds were critical to his experimental success. Examination of Moseley's apparatus links his research to both the standard practices and novel experimentation of a wi der community straddling the fields of physics and chemistry. These links and co llaborative connections enabled Moseley to quickly reestablish his experimental work once he moved to Oxford, overcoming the isolation and material difficulties associated with independent research. 10 Anna Jenkin, Balliol College anna.jenkin@balliol.ox.ac.uk Living with London's Mad: Metropol itan Communities and the Insane 1740-1800 Traditionally the eighteenth century has been viewed as a dark age in the history of insanity, a world in which lunatics were kept as wild beasts in horrific conditions. A series of works, most famously, Roy Porter's Mind Forg'd Manacles have demonstrated that this understanding is over-simplified and anachronistic, blurred by too much focus upon medical institutions. This presentati on will show how Porter's work can be expanded by exploring the experiences of communities in interacting with their insane members in their daily lives. Through the study of legal records a very different image of eighteenth-century insane provision will be cr eated. London will be shown as a city in which, far from being restrained, locked up or abused, lunatics lived active lives, held down jobs and had families. Lunacy was not a spectre to be gawped at through Bethlem's bars, it was everywhere - in the workplace, in the street, in the household and even in the marriage-bed. This presentation will focus upon the cases of the Old Bailey, providing examples of when lunatic behaviour became too extreme to tolerate and the lifestyles that such lunatics lived prior to the crises that led to their apprehension. It will show how institutional sour ces can be used to understand the treatment of the insane outside of institutions, where the majority of mentally ill people lived their lives. 11 Lynsey Shaw, Wolfson College lynsey.shaw@wolfson.ox.ac.uk Classifying Mental Disorder: Royal Air Fo rce Neuropsychiatrists and the End of Flying Stress The definition and classification of mental disorders was an issue of central importance to neuropsychiatrists working in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. These accomplished and highly respect ed specialists believed that definitions should be specific, informed by rigorous re search, and should reflect the image of an advancing scientific profession. This paper w ill examine a disorder, 'flying stress', which did not meet the neuropsychiatrists' exacti ng standards. It will critically assess the process by which this term was removed from RAF neuropsychiatric nomenclature during 1941 and 1942. The objections of neuropsychiatrists to the use of the term flying stress will be examined, including the problems created by multiple medical definitions, similarities to problematic disorders, matters of professional standing, and non-adherence to official policy recommendations. The process of redefinition and removal will also be assessed, which was defined by the concerns of RAF senior officers and intense inter-disciplinary research. Finally, it will consider the impact that the removal of this term had on the practice of neuropsychiatry by examining post-removal terminology and the education of medical officers. The removal of this term also had a broader significance as it highlighted issues concerning the status and autonomy of RAF specialists. Neuropsychiatrists had effectively transformed categories of mental disorders, demonstrating that they had administrative control of their own branch of the medical service. 12 Sarah Levitt, Green Templeton College sarah.levitt@gtc.ox.ac.uk A Scientific Method?: Perceptions of Psychiatry from 1940-2000 Since the professionalization of psychiatry in the early-twentieth century, its medical brethren and detractors have criticized the discipline for being 'unscientific', and, consequently, unhelpful for patients. With the imminent release of the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), expected in May 2013, there is once again focus on psychiatric practices and their logic. It has thus become important to historically evaluate how psychiatry has conformed to, and deviated from, the biomedical scientific paradigm since the in troduction of somatically-based therapeutic practices - which rely on science for their legitimacy - to this field (c. 1940). I will provide a definition of the biomedical scientific model, including identifying some of its assumptions. I will then evaluate how this model has been applied in psychiatry with regards to diagnostic methods and treatment pr actices. In particular, I will take three case studies in the history of psychiatry to examine how the specialty has adapted the use of the biomedical scientific paradigm to its own purposes: the creation and dissemination of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), the development and spread of psychotropic pharmaceuticals, and the writing of the DSM-III, which is widely considered by psychiatrists to be the point where their fi eld reached a scientific method of diagnosis. This research draws on physician, patient, and legal perspectives towards the 'scientificness' of psychiatry. Sources for this work range from debates in medical journals and patient memoires to popular media and FDA court cases. This presentation is representative of a work in progress, but when this work is complete I plan to have employed psychiatrists' use of science as a framework for tracing the development of twentieth-century psychiatry. In doing so, I hope to be able to address some of the wide criticisms of psychiatry from a historical perspective. 13 Elana Rakoff, St Anne's College elana.rakoff@st-annes.ox.ac.uk \"Now Mr Darwin, how could you insult him so?\": Wit and Satire on Evolution during the Nineteenth Century It is an unfortunate truth that most nineteenth-century jokes about evolution could be covered with one image of talking gorillas. Add in some uneasy cracks attacking the idea of a \"nature red in tooth and claw,\" add scholars deriding a half-dozen 'egregious speculations,' and the rest is corroborative detail. But what was the reason for the persistence of these endless repetitions on a few themes, and how can their tenacious existence be reconciled with the nineteent h-century public's gradually emerging conviction that Darwin's reasoning was not entir ely ridiculous? This paper suggests that the apparent paradox dissipates upon examining the various purposes of evolutionary humor for three broad groups: the middle-class periodical reader, the elite humanist, and the scientist emerging from the genus amateuris . For the first two, the humor of evolution was mostly unappreciated before Darwin's theories gained prominence; once convinced evolution was taken seriously by scientists, these audiences reinterpreted basic tenets for their own concerns. For the reader, evolutionary humor provided a simultaneous critique and affirmation of relatively stable Victorian mores, whereas for the humanist, such jokes became an increasingly self-defensive affair as they perceived their prestige dwindling. By contrast, a genuine 'paradigm shift' could be detected in scientists' sarcasm. What struck a scientis t as illogical would be expressed in similar manner across the century, but the change in guiding assumptions meant that supposed 'speculations' likewise were perceived in new places. Thus, what may appear as the 'same old jokes' actually masks an impressive diversity of responses to evolutionary theory. 14 Yvonne Liu, Christ Church College qian.liu@chch.ox.ac.uk \"O, Brave New World\": The Huxley Brothers and Social Concerns of the Early Twentieth-century Britain The Huxley brothers, Julian Sorell Huxley (1887-1975) and Aldous Leonard Huxley (1894-1963), were both highly prominent figures in Britain. While choosing vastly different mediums of expression, science and literature respectively, both Julian and Aldous were deeply influenced by developments in evolutionary theories and its social implications. This was a period in which secular humanism flourished and the idea that the power of science to not only understand but also manipulate nature opened up hitherto unimaginable possibilities in the advancement of the human condition. At the same time, the political turmoil of the time such as both World Wars and the Great Depression inspired a wide spectrum of social concerns and fears. While scientists saw science as the beacon to human advancement , many writers concerned with the same issues held less optimistic views. The co mplex interplay between science as both cause and solution to these issues form major themes in literary works of the period, such as in H.G. Wells' The Time Machine , Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and George Orwells' 1984 . By looking at the intersection between science and arts, specifically Julian Huxley's scientific works on human evolution and its social implication, as well as Aldous Huxley's literary work The Brave New World and The Brave New World Revisited , this paper aims to illuminate the social issues at the heart of early twentieth-century Britain and their respective attitudes towards them. 15 Sarah Swenson, Balliol College sarah.swenson@balliol.ox.ac.uk Reconsidering the Role of Selfishness in the Evolution of Social Behaviour: W D Hamilton and Inclusive Fitness Evolutionary biologists tend to write histories of evolutionary theory in which science is made to appear politically neutral. This is problematic because it places evolutionary debates within the confines of a linear histor y of scientific progress that bears little resemblance to how scientists actually work and which discounts the relationship between scientists' ideas and their politics. Indeed only the political beliefs of those scientists subsequently deemed incorrect are acknowledged. This has been so in the case of Jean Baptiste Lamarck, Trofim Lysenko, and more recently, advocates of theories of group selection. The relationship between politics and the development of evolutionary theory is particularly important on the cusp of biology and sociology. The presence of what appears to be altruistic behaviour in nature has been a major dilemma for modern biologists. I will examine the polit ical assumptions at work in the biological theories used to explain altruism and how these theories contribute to a larger understanding of our innate sociality or selfishness. My point of departure will be W. D. Hamilton and his theory of inclusive fitness (1963, 1964), which provided a mathematical explanation for 'altruism' at the genetic level. According to this theory, even the appearance of the most altruistic actions could be explained in terms of 'selfish' genes. Hamilton was not blind to the political implications of his theory, writing that his theory was publicly perceived as dissolving a vital social glue. "}
