Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism, is a broad term used to describe a group of neurodevelopmental conditions. These conditions are characterised by problems with communication and social interaction. People with ASD often show restricted and repetitive interests or patterns of behaviour. ASD is found in people around the world, regardless of race and ethnicity, culture, or economic background. There are indications that instances of autism are on the rise. Some attribute this increase to environmental factors. 2. What are the symptoms of autism? Symptoms of ASD typically start during early childhood, between ages 12 and 24 months. However, symptoms may also appear earlier or later. Early symptoms may include a marked delay in language or social development. The DSM-5 (doctors standard classification of mental disorders) divides symptoms of ASD into two categories: To be diagnosed with autism, a person must experience symptoms in both of these categories. 3. Problems with communication and social interaction ASD can involve a range of issues with communication, many of which appear before age 5. Here's a timeline of what this might look like: Additionally, autistic children might have trouble expressing their feelings or understanding those of others starting at 36 months. As they age, they might have difficulty talking or very limited speaking skills. Other autistic children might develop language skills at an uneven pace. If there's a particular topic that's very interesting to them, for example, they might develop a very strong vocabulary for talking about that one topic. But they might have difficulty communicating about other things. As autistic children begin talking, they might also talk in an unusual tone that can range from high-pitched and 'sing-songy' to robotic or flat. They might also show signs of hyperlexia, which involves reading beyond what's expected of their age. Children on the autism spectrum might learn to read earlier than their neurotypical peers, sometimes as early as age 2. But they tend to not comprehend what they're reading. As they interact with others, autistic children might have difficulty sharing their emotions and interests with others or find it hard to maintain back-and-forth conversation. Nonverbal communication, like maintaining eye contact or body language, might also remain difficult. These challenges with communication can persist throughout adulthood. 4. Restricted or repetitive patterns of behaviour or activities In addition to the communication and social issues mentioned above, autism also includes symptoms related to body movements and behaviours. These can include: 5. Other characteristics Some autistic people might experience additional symptoms, including: 6. What is stimming? 'Stimming' is a term used to describe self-stimulating behaviours, e.g. involving repetitive motions or speech. For example, someone might clap their hands, rub an object, or repeat a phrase. It is typically associated with autistic people. But nearly everyone does some form of stimming, whether that's rubbing their hands together or biting their nails. For autistic people, stimming can sometimes get in the way of daily life or cause physical harm. But it can also serve as a helpful coping mechanism for dealing with sensory overload or navigating uncomfortable situations, among other things. 7. What causes autism? The exact cause of ASD is unknown. The most current research demonstrates there's no single cause. Suspected risk factors for ASD include: However, multiple sources, old and new have concluded that vaccines do not cause ASD. A controversial 1998 study proposed a link between autism and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, that study has been debunked by other research and was eventually retracted in 2010. Read more about autism and its risk factors. 8. What tests are used to diagnose autism? Your child's doctor may recommend a combination of tests for autism, including 9. Determining the diagnosis A team of specialists typically makes the diagnosis. This team may include: 10. What support is available for autistic people? There is on 'cure' for ASD. Rather, for some autistic people, supportive therapies can help them feel better or alleviate certain symptoms. Many approaches involve therapies such as: Massages, weighted clothing and blankets, and meditation techniques may also help some autistic people manage symptoms. However, results will vary. Some people may respond well to certain approaches, while others may not. Medication for autism There is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, and there's currently no medication to treat it. But some medicines can help with related symptoms like depression, seizures, insomnia, and trouble focussing. Studies have shown that medication is most effective when it is combined with behavioural therapies. Risperidone is the only drug approved for children with autism spectrum disorder. It can be prescribed for children between 5 and 16 years old to help with irritability. Some doctors will prescribe other drugs in certain cases, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anti-anxiety medication, or stimulants. Summary We have described 10 autism facts.
