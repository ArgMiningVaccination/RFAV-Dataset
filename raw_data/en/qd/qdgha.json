Page 4 of 5 ACTIONS 1. Inform the patient that the animal bite will be reported to the Public Health Department and to Law Enforcement (for purposes of reporting to the appropriate Animal Control Authorities). 2. All animal bites and exposures to bats should be reported to the Washtenaw County Public Health Department (WCPHD) by staff. Complete the attached Animal Bite Report form and fax to WCPHD at (734) 544 -6706. Go to WCPHD website for more info: https://www.washtenaw.org/1795/Rabies 3. Contact WCPHD at (734)544 -6700 for advice regarding sending bats or other animals for rabies testing. 4. Hospital Security, Law Enforcement & Animal Control Notificat ion: a. Healthcare provider must report the bite to UMHS Hospital Security by providing Security with the following information: anim al bite victim's name; hospital registration number; date of birth; hospital location/room number. b. Upon notice from health care provider, Hospital Security will dispatch a security officer to obtain the details about the animal bite incident from the animal bite victim. The type of information obtained includes: i. Full Name and address of the victim; ii. Information about the animal (e.g., type of animal, whether wild or domestic pet, etc., as applicable); iii. If known and applicable, name and address of the animal's owner; iv. Location where the incident occurred; v. Cause, character and extent of the injury; vi. How the incident occurred; and vii. Other related and/or aggravating circumstances regarding the incident (e.g., was animal provoked) c. In cases where a patient or his/her personal representative is not able to provide the information directly to the Hospital S ecurity Officer (e.g., unconscious p atient, no personal representative available) the Hospital Security Officer may obtain information about the animal bite (e.g., location, severity, etc.) verbally from the treating health care providers. d. UMHS Hospital Security reports only the animal bite information set forth in Section 4B above to the University of Michigan Department of Public Safety (DPS) via phone and security dispatch report (DPS thereafter notifies the appropriate law enforce ment agency/animal control officer for the jurisdiction in which the bite occurred). 5. Wound management : a. Stabilization/Evaluation - Animal bites should be treated as contusions though they may also have significant lacerations or deep punctures. Initial treatment with ice and elevation will help reduce swelling. Di rect pressure will control actively bleeding wounds. Consideration should be given to potential injury to deep or surrounding structures. A careful neurovascular examination of t he injured area should be performed prior to the instillation of local anesthe tics. A musculoskeletal exam should be performed with attention to integrity of deep and adjacent structures. Consider imaging if concern for boney injury or foreign body exists ( e.g., plain radiograph or ultrasound). Lacerations over the metacarpophalange al joints should raise suspicion for possible human bite (i.e., fight bite) injuries. b. Clean wound - Appropriate local anesthesia facilitates adequate wound cleaning. Wounds should be washed with soap and water as soon as possible thorough wound cleaning ma y help reduce likelihood of rabies transmission. c. Lacerations - To reduce the counts of bacteria present in the wound, the surface should be cleaned with povidone iodine and the depths irrigated with copious amounts of saline using pressure irrigation from a syringe. Wounds should be explored for foreign body, or deep structure injury, devitalized tissue should be debrided. Wounds over or near joints should be explored carefull y through a range of motion to assess for damage to the underlying tendon sheath, fascia, joint capsule, etc. d. Puncture wounds - Inspect wound for evidence of deep puncture, especially if the wound is located in the scalp or near a joint. Remove any foreign bodies or gross wound contaminants. Superficially irrigate the wound, avoiding hi gh pressure irrigation into the wound. Avoid removal of deep tissue (e.g., \"coring\"). e. Wound closure - Closure of a bite wound may increase the risk of infection depending on species inflicting the bite, location, type and age of wound and host factors. In general, wound closure is discouraged except in locations where cosmetic or functional impairment may result. (e.g., facial bite wounds, etc.) Antimicrobial Added B virus treatment, adjusted reptile bite recommendations The recommendations in this guide are meant to serve as treatment guidelines for use at Michigan Medicine facilities. If you are an individual experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 immediately. These guidelines should not replace a provider's professional medical advice based on clinic al judgment, or be used in lieu of an Infectious Diseases consultation when necessary.
