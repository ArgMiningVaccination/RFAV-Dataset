Often, these systems have evolved apart from and earlier than the conventional medical approach used in the United States. Examples of alternative medical systems that have developed in Western cultures include homeopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine. Examples of systems that have developed in non-Western cultures include traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. - {{ [Mind-body interventions](/wiki/Template:Mind-body_interventions)}} -- Mind-body medicine uses a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms. Some techniques that were considered CAM in the past have become mainstream (for example, patient support groups and cognitive-behavioral therapy). Other mind-body techniques are still considered CAM, including meditation, prayer, mental healing, and therapies that use creative outlets such as art, music, or dance. - {{ [Biologically based therapy](/w/index.php?title=Template:Biologically_based_therapy&action=edit&redlink=1)}} -- Biologically based therapies in CAM use substances found in nature, such as herbs, foods, and vitamins. Some examples include dietary supplements,3 herbal products, and the use of other so-called natural but as yet scientifically unproven therapies (for example, using shark cartilage to treat cancer). - {{ [Manipulative methods](/wiki/Template:Manipulative_methods)}} -- Manipulative and body-based methods in CAM are based on manipulation and/or movement of one or more parts of the body. Some examples include chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation, and massage. - {{ [Energy therapy](/wiki/Template:Energy_therapy)}} -- Energy therapies involve the use of energy fields. -- [John Gohde](/wiki/User:John_Gohde) 19:44, 4 December 2007 (UTC) Dianetics Dianetics is an alternative medical system. What is the rationale for viewing it as anything else? [ausa ui](/wiki/User:Causa_sui) [\u00d7](/wiki/User_talk:Causa_sui) 06:53, 24 November 2006 (UTC) - Why is NCCIH regarded as the sole source that is acceptable for determining what is and isn't an alternative medicine? -- [74.132.180.62](/w/index.php?title=User:74.132.180.62&action=edit&redlink=1)22:14, 25 November 2006 (UTC) - It isn't. There is a vast difference between an alternative medical \"system\" and a form of [alternative medicine](/wiki/Alternative_medicine). The template must be kept small, and therefore it sticks to the NCCIH system of classification. If you can provide some kind of proof that Dianetics is an alternative medicine form, then it certainly qualifies to be in [[Category:Alternative medicine]]. It does contain some elements of [pseudoscience](/wiki/Pseudoscience), [quackery](/wiki/Quackery), [fraud](/wiki/Fraud), [pseudoreligion](/wiki/Pseudoreligion), and other characteristics of alternative medicine, so it could certainly be in that category. There is room for plenty of articles there, but not in the template. To illustrate, I'll use a corollary. There is a template for continents, and it would be inappropriate to start adding countries to it. Continents can be in a small template, but not all countries can fit there. You can see the vast difference here: - It isn't.

Relying solely on an American governmental body as a system of classification in the template, especially for systems that are not of U.S. origin, is a violation of this neutral and international stance. [VanTucky](/wiki/User:VanTucky) [Talk](/wiki/User_talk:VanTucky) 23:10, 26 September 2007 (UTC) - Four out of the eight systems mentioned are \"systems that are not of U.S. origin,\" so what's the problem? The NCCIH recognizes them as such. Keep in mind that all systems get brought to the US and are practiced there. They therefore get assessed by the NCCIH. -- [Fyslee](/wiki/User:Fyslee)/ [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Fyslee)04:38, 27 September 2007 (UTC) - It is a V & RS of a system of classification that is all-inclusive and has been a consensus part of the template for ages. No need to remove such a valuable resource. Restoring consensus version. -- [Fyslee](/wiki/User:Fyslee)/ [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Fyslee)05:19, 27 September 2007 (UTC) - First off, a discussion between two users where they disagree is not a consensus. Relying on a previous consensus by default when new issues have been brought up is not okay. Second, the NCCAM is a solely American body, and by including its method of classification (which not a single other regulatory or private body uses) the template fails to represent a world-wide POV. Third, many of the classifications that the NCCAM uses for arts such as [qigong](/wiki/Qigong), [t'ai chi ch'uan](/wiki/T%27ai_chi_ch%27uan), [feldenkrais](/wiki/Feldenkrais)and [yoga](/wiki/Yoga)are very controversial. They take a stance on the healing mechanism of these practices that is only one significant view, and thus including only NCCAM on the template, and presenting it as if it were widely accepted, is a violation of NPOV. [VanTucky](/wiki/User:VanTucky) [Talk](/wiki/User_talk:VanTucky)18:56, 27 September 2007 (UTC) - FWIW, I'm in favor of keeping the NCCAM classification. The existence of a longstanding version usually indicates that quite a few editors agree with that version. While a new consensus is always possible, chances are that it will not stick. I also think that an important change like this one should be discussed and a consensus reached before we change a template that is in such wide use. Having said that, I feel that some of your arguments may have merit. The NIH classification is, indeed, US-centric. How about making this explicit (e.g. by adding \"(U.S.)\" to the text)? I do not think your other complaint (only one view of several) should be solved by removing the NCCAM classification. It would be better to add other notable/well-sourced classifications (if they exist). [Avb](/wiki/User_talk:Avb)23:59, 27 September 2007 (UTC) - Also FWIW, keep the current template. There are a huge number of editors, myself included, that don't actually believe in \"alternative\" medicine, we ascribe to scientific analysis and therefore there is medicine as science and there's folklore or faith or something else. Keeping the NCCAM verbiage at least gives a little bit of cover to claiming that these alternative medicine classifications have some meaning.

I sympathize with your point about maintaining a mainstream, scientifically acceptable (at least to some degree, the NCCAM has its notable detractors in the scientific community) system of classification for alt medicine. However, I urge people to keep in mind that this system is not accepted or even well-known among many of the actual systems that fall under the NCCAM's purview. A bit of cultural sensitivity wouldn't hurt here.

The classification of, for example, [mind-body intervention](/wiki/Mind-body_intervention)was created expressly and exclusively for categorization of these systems and techniques, so the fact that it is disputed and/or unknown by practitioners is much more indicative.

The relationship between [acunpuncture](/wiki/Acunpuncture) and [traditional Chinese medicine](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) is akin to the relationship between [spinal manipulation](/wiki/Spinal_manipulation) and [chiropractic](/wiki/Chiropractic). For consistency, we should list [traditional Chinese medicine](/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine) and [chiropractic](/wiki/Chiropractic) in this template, and we [acupuncture](/wiki/Acupuncture) and [spinal manipulation](/wiki/Spinal_manipulation).

The [NCCIH](http://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/) page on CAM doesn't list faith healing as a medical system, and looking in other sources I don't see anyone claiming that it is a medical system.

I added it back in, on the justification that there are particular practices within a system of faith healing, such as laying of hands, praying, exorcism, etc. But the main reason I have for adding it back in is so readers of the alt med article can have faith healing as a link in the box on the right. When I was editing alt med, and wanted a quick link to go to the faith healing page, it was not there. If you feel strongly about the issue, please feel free to revert my edit, and lets talk more here.

I [redid](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Alternative_medical_systems&diff=344284178&oldid=344255575) it to version 3, which lets the browser do the layout, but this was [reverted](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Alternative_medical_systems&diff=344994922&oldid=344284178) with the edit summary 'That makes the template to narrow, and puts a \"\u00b7\" at the end of every line.' However, version 3 doesn't make the sidebar too narrow: the width looks just fine when the sidebar stands alone. Version 2 results in very bad layout when browsers are configured to use large fonts (a common practice among visually impaired readers), as the sidebar becomes way too wide and doesn't even fit within the screen. If width is an issue in some contexts (perhaps because of neighboring images or other sidebars), we can add a |style= parameter to let the template invoker choose their own width and other style parameters. Also, there's nothing wrong with version 3's putting the \"\u00b7\" at the end of the lines when this separates items; this clearly and consistently indicates the reader the boundary between two items, and is less confusing than the version 2 approach, which occasionally breaks an item across line boundaries and for which a line boundary therefore is visually ambiguous (sometimes it's a separator between items, sometimes not). Consistent use of \"\u00b7\" is common in navbox templates, and is used in {{ [Alternative medicine](/wiki/Template:Alternative_medicine)}} and many similar templates. While we're on the subject, what's the point of using {{ [Sidebar with heading backgrounds](/w/index.php?title=Template:Sidebar_with_heading_backgrounds&action=edit&redlink=1)}} at all? What's wrong with {{ [Infobox](/wiki/Template:Infobox)}}? If we can't come up with a good approach with {{ [Sidebar with heading backgrounds](/w/index.php?title=Template:Sidebar_with_heading_backgrounds&action=edit&redlink=1)}} perhaps we should just revert back to version 1. Anyway, I've made [this further edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Alternative_medical_systems&diff=345061303&oldid=344284178) to version 3, which adds a |style= parameter as discussed above.

That's a traditional medicine, is not it? [Biophys](/wiki/User:Hodja_Nasreddin) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hodja_Nasreddin)) 18:40, 17 January 2011 (UTC) - Not to my knowledge - the article says late 19th century, whereas [traditional medicine](/wiki/Traditional_medicine)usually means practiced since time immemorial or something along those lines. My guess is that non-US osteopathy is the intended target (the [holistic](/wiki/Holistic)kind rather than the roughly-equivalent-to-an-MD kind). [Osteopathy](/wiki/Osteopathy)talks about the differences a fair bit, and seems to be the main article for the alternative medicine; [Osteopathic manipulative medicine](/wiki/Osteopathic_manipulative_medicine)is hat-linked from there, and I am not sure how we could really make the distinction in this template. - [2/0](/wiki/User_talk:2over0)( [cont.](/wiki/Special:Contributions/2over0)) 19:18, 17 January 2011 (UTC) - I mean \"modern\" or \"mainstream\" medicine (it seems that [Traditional medicine](/wiki/Traditional_medicine)actually refer to \"alternative medicine\", sorry, I did not realized that). The point is very simple. The vast majority of people with DO degrees come from the US and work in the field of \"mainstream medicine\", legally and based on their education and qualification. Hence placing this area to \"alternative medicine\" (as something opposed to \"mainstream medicine\") is hardly justifiable. [Biophys](/wiki/User:Hodja_Nasreddin)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hodja_Nasreddin)) 20:44, 17 January 2011 (UTC) - I mean \"modern\" or \"mainstream\" medicine (it seems that - Meaning that free of the context at that article, it is misleading simply to say osteopathy?

The template still renders fine on my display without it, so I do not think we need to worry overmuch about replacing it. - - As 2/0 says, there is a difference. The original form of osteopathy as started by [Andrew Taylor Still](/wiki/Andrew_Taylor_Still)(a spiritualist like [D. D. Palmer](/wiki/D._D._Palmer), the founder of chiropractic), was a form of alternative medicine with metaphysical and unscientific roots, but unlike Palmer, Still was an MD to begin with and had quite a bit more knowledge, although at the time that was quite limited. In contrast to chiropractic, osteopaths officially and in writing distanced themselves from their unscientific roots and gradually updated their educational standards to something nearing, but still not quite, that of MDs. (Chiropractic has yet to make such an official declaration, but hopes to modernize [under the radar](/wiki/Under_the_radar)so they don't have to admit they've been treating a fictive lesion all along, IOW operating a scam all along.) These DOs are legally considered on a par with MDs. It is these DOs who are referred to as [Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine](/wiki/Doctor_of_Osteopathic_Medicine), yet in common parlance they are still often called Osteopaths, which makes the matter confusing. To distinguish the scientific ones from those who practice according to the old unscientific manner, especially in countries outside the USA where they do not receive the same degree of education and are educated in the old manner, we have two articles. One is generic and the other specifically for the near-equals of MDs. Are you still confused? You should be! As long as there exists a separate education, there will be confusion. It also increases the likelihood that a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine will include old-fashioned quackery in his practice, like [Joseph Mercola](/wiki/Joseph_Mercola)does. To be fair, there are also MDs who include unscientific ideas and methods in their practices (think [Andrew Weil](/wiki/Andrew_Weil)and [Dr. Oz](/wiki/Dr._Oz)). Quackery knows no boundaries. -- [Brangifer](/wiki/User:BullRangifer)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:BullRangifer)) 03:54, 18 January 2011 (UTC) - As 2/0 says, there is a difference.
