For yoga classes: We would love for you to bring a yoga mat, but if you don't have one, we offer mats at the studio you can borrow for $1. We have non-toxic cleaning products that you can use for your mat and any borrowed mat. For meditation classes: You don't need to bring anything but yourself. We have cushions, blankets, and a comfy room that we meditate in. I'm new to yoga, what classes are best for me? We suggest you try our Seed Yin Yoga class for a relaxing stretching class and our Bloom Vinyasa Fundamentals class for a flow yoga class. Our Bloom classes cover the basics of a flow class which are great for beginners to slowly learn poses and their practice, while also being great for seasoned practitioners to get into a good flow state and be able to add on and up level, as needed. All meditation classes are suitable for everyone and anyone. Do I need to pre-book my class? Yes, we encourage you to book your class from our [Schedule](/schedule) page. Pre-booking your class helps us keep the integrity of class sizes for everyone. You can see if a class is full by when the button next to class, on the schedule page, is a light yellow color, and it doesn't allow you to book. Virtual/livestream classes will still be able to be booked if in person is full. Livestream booking closes 15 minutes before a class starts. Please do not sign up for a livestream/virtual class and show up in person. When should I arrive for my class? We suggest you arrive 5-15 minutes before your class is due to start. This is to ensure that you have ample time to arrive, get settled in, relax, and maybe even connect with your fellow members. We lock our doors when we start class, so please always remember that we have a no late entry and a no leave early policy. I'm not sure if I will like yoga/meditation, do you have a class I can try? We sure do! We do a great month trial for $45. This is a great way to do a few class (or as many as you can), to get a better idea if yoga/meditation is for you. Your first class is always a lot. A few classes is where you can really see if it is for you or not. I have an injury or pre-existing medical/injury condition, can I still join? Yes, we would love for you to join us! Please let your teacher know before class if there is something that you need specific help with so we can give you pose options. We offer modifications and support options in our classes. Please take them when you need them and always look after yourself, never pushing into any pain. We are yoga teachers and not doctors so please always consult your medical provider before you start a physical practice. What temperature are your rooms? We keep our studio and rooms at a neutral 73-74. We do not offer hot yoga. Do you offer prenatal yoga? At this time, we don't offer specific prenatal classes. Our Seed and Bloom classes would still be appropriate though. Please let your teacher know before class if you are pregnant so they can give you support throughout the class, and any tips to keep you safe and comfortable. Can kids join for classes? We are a studio focused on teaching adults, and prefer that children don't join for classes. How many people are in your classes? We cap our yoga classes at 20 members and our meditation classes at 12. This gives everyone space to move and have personal space around them. Are we listed in the Yin Yoga community? Yes, if you came to us via the [Yin Yoga Forum](https://yinyoga.com), we hope you feel welcome and are able to find the resources, classes and workshops you came looking for.
