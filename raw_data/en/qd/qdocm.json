The Team\u00a9Shutterstock/Shaun Jeffers \u00a9Shutterstock/Dmytro Zinkevych Discovery IMMUNOLOGY Immunology News NEWS 4 VIEW FROM ... THE BSI PRESIDENT It has been a tremendous honour to be the President of the British Society for Immunology for the past four years. When I began my term at the end of 2018, I couldn't have foreseen what this next chapter would entail. I had an important goal: to ensure that the Trustees, committee members and staff team worked together for the maximum benefit of the BSI and its members. When the pandemic struck, BSI members across all areas played a critical role to drive global research efforts and increase our understanding of COVID-19, protecting the health of millions across the world. The BSI did a fantastic job of harnessing the expertise of immunologists to feed into policy and public discussion whilst bolstering our external facing work. The way the Society and our immunology community came together during this unprecedented time makes me incredibly proud. However, we have made great strides in a wide range of areas beyond COVID-19. The advances in our understanding of how the immune system works and the potential to significantly better human and animal health are outstanding. Looking back at my term, it is fantastic to see the brilliant progress the BSI has made to champion immunology and support those working in the field. The Society's strategic plan developed during my time as BSI President set the course of our work over the next few years, with numerous achievements already. Our membership has expanded, both in numbers and breadth of sectors and career stages; we have ramped up our work engaging with policymakers, the public and patients to materialise the benefits of immunology research and we have diversified our publishing portfolio, including the recent launch of Discovery Immunology. We have also expanded the support we provide to different sections of the membership, with the launch of our Career Enhancing Grants aimed at those starting out their careers, and with a programme of work now in place to drive how we support our senior and retired members. This is just a snapshot of some of the many highlights, none of which would have been possible without the enthusiastic support of our members who volunteer their time to forward the BSI's mission. I feel incredibly grateful for this time working closely with the Board of Trustees to determine the strategic direction of the Society and with the wonderful BSI staff team who translate ambition into outcome. I would like to give my sincere thanks to all of them and the wider membership for their support over the past four fantastic years. I will always carry with me the fond memories of my time as BSI President, playing a part in supporting our community in driving scientific discovery and making a positive impact on health, but also the collaborative atmosphere and drive with which we worked all together for the benefit of immunology (and of course the always memorable BSI Congress parties!). The BSI still has a lot to achieve, but I am pleased to finish my term with the Society standing strong and ready for what's to come. I'm delighted to pass the baton to Professor Tracy Hussell, the new BSI President who will commence her term at the AGM on 6 December at BSI Congress and who I am sure will expertly build upon this work. I am looking forward to continuing to work to advance the field and environment in immunology through my research and as a close ally of the Society. With best wishes, Arne Akbar President, British Society for Immunology Email: president@immunology.org VIEW FROM ... THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE Welcome to our BSI Congress bumper issue of Immunology News. First and foremost, we are very much looking forward to hosting many of you at Congress! It is shaping up to be our most exciting one yet - four days of fabulous science and plenty of opportunities to network with colleagues, collaborators and collaborators-to-be. Check out page 8 for more information and please do pop by the BSI stand to meet the team and find out more about what we are doing. You may be pleasantly surprised with a new addition to our cell badge collection! I am also delighted that we are joining forces with the clinical immunology community to form the new BSI Clinical Immunology Professional Network (page 13). This will be the result of a merger between the BSI and the UK Primary Immunodeficiency Network (UKPIN) and builds on several years of successful collaborative working. Bringing our communities together will undoubtedly lead to greater impact for research, clinical delivery and patient outcomes. From page 28 you will see information on our corporate members who are an incredibly valuable part of the BSI. I'm sure that you will all join me in thanking them for their support and I look forward to working with them on more exciting initiatives going forwards. And finally from me, it would be remiss if I didn't say a huge goodbye and thank you to our outgoing BSI President, Arne Akbar. He has had such an enormous impact over the last four years taking the BSI to places we've never been before. We have been lucky to have his stunning leadership and we wish him all the best in his future endeavours (though we will be sure to keep him close to the BSI!). I have no doubt that Tracy Hussell, our President-elect, will continue to take the BSI from strength to strength! As always, please do reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Doug Brown Chief Executive, British Society for Immunology Email: d.brown@immunology.org Immunology News | December 2022SOCIETY NEWS 5 SOCIETY NEWS BSI Diversity & Inclusion focus groups: understanding the needs of our community The British Society for Immunology recently held two focus groups with BSI members to better understand the equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) needs of our membership and the immunology community, and to inform our upcoming work in this area. After the publication of our Diversity & Inclusion Framework, which outlined our commitment to collaborating closely with our community to raise the bar for EDI in immunology, we invited BSI members to help shape our future work in this area. Our aim was to engage with people from different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to gain feedback from the membership around our EDI work across all Society activities and ultimately, better represent the community's needs. In August and September 2022, BSI members came together for two open and honest discussions about what the Society does well, what we could be doing better and views on areas where we could provide additional support. We had a diverse attendance, comprising those who had sent through expressions of interest to participate and share their experiences and perspectives, as well as representatives from the BSI Forum, our committee who ensures the voice of the different sectors, career stages and locations are fed into our activities. The two sessions were incredibly valuable and productive, offering a safe and inclusive space to communicate emerging challenges and opportunities, and attendees reported having a positive experience and wishing to continue being involved with the Society's activities in this area. We covered a wide range of topics that matter to our members, including the various BSI grant schemes and additional ways in which the Society can provide impactful financial support; the importance of recognition of EDI activities and how showcasing the work of our members in this area can help inspire others and move the needle in this area; and event accessibility, for example, considering new ways of planning poster sessions to create a more welcoming and supportive environment. In these focus groups, we also \u00a9Shutterstock/Songquan Deng All BSI members are invited to join us for our Annual General Meeting, which will be held at BSI Congress in Liverpool. Come along to find out about the work of your Society, what activities we have carried out in the past year and what our plans are to support you and represent immunology in the UK. We encourage as many of you as possible to attend. If you have any queries, please contact us at bsi@immunology.org. Annual General Meeting 17:30-18:00, Tuesday 6 December 2022 ACC Liverpool, BSI Congress 2022discussed the progress of EDI in the wider immunology sector, examples of good practice and partnerships. Tackling the leaky pipeline in immunology to ensure diversity higher up in the career ladder, as well as working with universities and organisations to provide guidance and best practice in EDI, are a couple of examples of the areas covered. We are proud to have started implementing ideas put forward, including opening up the Education and Public Engagement poster category at BSI Congress 2022 to include best practice examples of promoting diversity and inclusion within immunology. In line with our commitment to tracking our progress openly, we will be publishing more information shortly on the progress that the BSI has made on the back of the discussions from these meetings. Many thanks to our wonderful members who attended the focus groups. We look forward to continuing to build a platform to learn and grow together.

The British Society for Immunology is run for its members and by its members. Over the next year, we have a number of vacancies that will become available on our committees. The BSI Forum is the place where the voice of our membership is fed into our activities. Chaired by Professor Ann Ager, the 18 elected members come from all sections of the Society's membership. Their role is to act as our 'think tank' on issues relating to education and careers, public engagement, policy and public affairs, and communications. Forum aims to help the Society in implementing its strategic plan by providing a mechanism by which the views of the membership can be inputted into our activities. The most recent meeting opened with a welcome to our newest Forum representatives Dr Gareth-Rhys Jones (Clinical representative), Dr Julia Makinde (England representative), Dr Becca McLean (Veterinary representative) and Dr George Robinson (Early Career representative). As part of our Diversity and Inclusion framework, the BSI hosted two EDI focus groups in August and September. Displaying their passion for EDI, Forum members who attended had a constructive and open discussion on the topics raised at the groups. Our session also focused on several other important topics, including the effect of the rising cost-of-living on PhD students with members suggesting Society members who are willing to stand for election and contribute their knowledge, expertise and experience as part of our committees are vital to ensure that we are doing all we can to support our members and the field of immunology as a whole.

Here, researchers from Oxford discuss a recent informal survey on the barriers to these important collaborations, reigniting a discussion around potential ways to enable cooperation in biomedical research. As a group of academics and clinicians, we are aware both that interdisciplinary collaborations are critical to translational research, but also that establishing these collaborations is often challenging. To explore possible obstacles to collaboration, we conducted a survey of nearly 200 biomedical academics, clinicians, and clinical academics working at the University of Oxford or Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (with those from 'Infection and Immunology' making up a quarter of respondents). Our central question was 'What are the main barriers preventing you from establishing an academic-clinical collaboration?'. Over 80% of respondents indicated that they had personally encountered barriers to collaboration. While both academics and clinicians flagged 'Funding' and 'Difficulties with contracts, data sharing, or other legal issues', the major barrier we encountered was 'Identifying someone with the right skill set or expertise'. We believe this is problematic and that translational research is undermined by inefficient identification of cross-disciplinary collaborators. When lab-developed concepts cannot be moved from bench to bedside, this leads to reduced research output, reduced positive impact on patients, and wasted potential in the expertise of the biomedical research community. Conversely, institutions or Hospital Trusts that better facilitate links between cross-disciplinary collaborators would be expected to improve these outputs as compared with environments with more pronounced research silos. While our survey was conducted in the Oxford context, we suspect these trends are more universal. There are many potential reasons an individual academic or clinician may struggle to identify a collaborator. Websites are often out-of-date or too high-level. Perhaps there is an issue of jargon around specific techniques and, for example, a clinician does not know a sufficiently specific term for the type of analytical expertise they are seeking in an academic. The language used for the same concepts may also differ between different specialities, making comparing notes difficult. Also probable is that 'cold' contacting potential collaborators is met with a limited response rate. Indeed, of the survey respondents who had previously participated in an academic- clinician collaboration, over 60% reported they had met the collaborator through an introduction by a colleague. The power of social / professional networks in enabling new collaborations therefore continues to appear - unsurprisingly - profound. This may render initiating new cross-disciplinary collaborations disproportionately difficult for early career researchers or other historically disenfranchised groups. The reliance on interpersonal introductions and networking poses potential ethical issues if it propagates a lack of diversity in research teams and reduction of inclusion of thought. Based on our survey results, the most successful strategy to enhancing successful collaborations is likely to be a multipronged approach, embedding opportunities to facilitate introductions within frameworks that integrate academic and healthcare systems. Such opportunities could include in-person opportunities to engage, as well as online platforms that allow clinicians and academics to easily search for each other. For the latter, careful planning is required to ensure details remain up-to-date for any opt-in system (the preference of our survey respondents, as opposed to an automated enrolment approach). Our own preliminary efforts in this area also highlighted how difficult it can be to give virtual access to platforms across different University and Trust systems; strong institutional support will be central to overcoming such digital infrastructure hurdles. Efforts to address the other major barriers to academic-clinician collaboration - such as funding - may be equally thorny; indeed costs for even small pilot studies are often substantial. Furthermore, while our survey did not garner specifics of the funding concerns, anecdotally we hear from clinicians and clinician scientists that this is often related to needing to 'buy time' due to a lack of dedicated research hours. Here again, institutional support may be able to play a role in supporting managers and their teams to participate in research activities, perhaps through honorary contracts or other similar mechanisms. Our survey does not represent a formal academic study, but rather a more informal starting point for a discussion about facilitating collaborations in the biomedical research environment. This is critical to support translational research and also the career development of staff with diverse backgrounds. Other institutions may benefit from conducting such surveys to understand the extent of the problem in their area in order to design bespoke solutions.

Arne Akbar Professor Arne Akbar is stepping down from the post of President of the British Society for Immunology. His Presidency has spanned a tumultuous four-year period that has seen huge societal changes including the C OVID-19 pandemic, establishment of the Black Lives Matter movement, the cost- of-living crisis and Brexit. During this time, the Society has published an ambitious new strategy, influenced Government policy during the pandemic, published a new Diversity and Inclusion Framework and expanded its journal portfolio. As Professor Akbar leaves this role, he reflects on his time as President, the unique role the Society plays and the challenges immunology as a profession still faces. What were your hopes for this role when you first started as BSI President? I took the role of President because I wanted to give back to the Society, after benefiting so greatly from being a member of the BSI for the last 44 years. When I started as President, I was most concerned with keeping the BSI stable and for nothing to go wrong on my watch. I also hoped my Presidency would see the Society grow greater international links, bring the BSI Board of Trustees and staff team closer, and find new ways of harnessing the expertise of immunologists from the beginning to the end of their careers. Did things go as you expected? Little did I know that the COVID -19 pandemic would come along during my Presidency and present unprecedented challenges to the BSI and the field of immunology. As a Society we needed to support our members during this challenging time, keep the BSI going, while making sure the public and policymakers heard the views of immunologists and had access to knowledge from the latest research findings. What do you see as the most important role of the BSI? Everything the BSI does is for its members and our membership is growing every year. We constantly ask what we can do to make things better for immunologists at every stage of their career. Our five- year strategy lays out our big ambitions for the future. We want to build a more interconnected immunology ecosystem to support collaboration between sectors and disciplines. We will provide sector-leading careers support to attract and retain talent in immunology. We are also making sure our immunology knowledge improves health and influences policy, and that immunology research has the right conditions to thrive. These are bold ambitions given our lean size and resources. The BSI staff team is small - just 20 people - but they are highly qualified and all work together for the members. They achieve so much and punch way above their weight; we use our limited resources to make the biggest difference. How has the role of the Society evolved during your time as President? The Society has become even more outward facing - both in terms of our public engagement and influencing policymakers during the pandemic. We have always cared about public engagement, but COVID -19 made this work even more important. Along with our work to engage with different communities about COVID vaccines, the BSI has also worked with members of the public to provide patient and public involvement (PPI) input into some of the most high- profile COVID -19 immunology studies. We work very closely with patients and members of the public in many areas - as scientists we must listen to the views of the public to better our research, and they can help us make our work more accessible. Everyone is expected to write public summaries of their work now, but many of them are not written in a way that is truly accessible. We do a lot to make sure our members can produce accessible information, striving to connect them both to the public and patients. Awarding the BSI Global Impact & Innovation Award to the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine team. The award was accepted by Prof Teresa Lambe, Prof Sarah Gilbert & Prof Andrew Pollard on behalf of the wider group.Immunology News | December 202219 FEATURE ARTICLE Over your time as President, what are you most proud of? I feel so strongly about the important role of the BSI; I really wanted to protect the Society and make sure nothing went wrong while I was President. Far from it, through the incredible uncertainty and challenge of the last few years, the BSI has tackled everything that has been thrown at it effectively. I am pleased at the progress we have made in bringing early career researchers closer to heart of the Society and they now have a role on our Board. They have helped us develop our innovative new BSI Career Enhancing Grants. Researchers come to us with a variety of suggestions about how they would spend the money to aid their career development - it is a very flexible scheme. It means early career researchers can do something different, that would be hard to fund from other sources. We are also looking to make sure we don't lose the knowledge and expertise of Society members as they move towards and beyond retirement. Recently we held a dinner with very senior immunologists to ask how they can continue to share their valuable knowledge and experience from a lifetime of hard work with the Society. I am also proud of the work we have done to develop and expand our journal portfolio. We launched Immunotherapy Advances in 2021, the BSI's first journal launch in over 60 years, and Discovery Immunology in 2022. These journals provide important new places to publish immunology research for the immunology community and provide a valuable source of income for BSI activities that aim to support our membership, such as grant schemes and BSI Congress. Can you tell us more about the important role the Society played during the pandemic? The BSI played many different and essential roles during the pandemic. Perhaps most importantly we brought researchers together to give collective opinions to share with the public and policymakers - this was very important as the situation was evolving so quickly. Very early on we sent an influential letter to Government, the Chief Scientific Advisor and Chief Medical Officer. We stressed that herd immunity would not provide a short-term solution to the pandemic. Moving from herd immunity to isolation was a radical step early in the pandemic, but an important one. We also rapidly assembled a BSI COVID -19 Taskforce of researchers with diverse backgrounds and worked with the Academy of Medical Sciences to produce a report on COVID and immunology. The conclusions of this work influenced SAGE, Government, and were shared widely within the scientific community and beyond. At that point we didn't know why certain sectors of the public were particularly affected by COVID -19, beyond knowing that age, ethnic background and co-morbidities were important factors. We broke down the questions that most urgently needed answering and were clear about what actions needed to happen in the short and longer term. The BSI office did an incredible job of bringing key opinions and documents together at speed for review by the group. The BSI also worked to increase confidence in vaccines during the pandemic? It was fantastic that vaccines for COVID -19 were developed so quickly, with British immunologists at the forefront of their development. However, the speed of development also brought challenges. When the vaccines were first introduced there was a great deal of worry about which vaccine people received, whether it was Pfizer or AstraZeneca. There was a lot of space for the spread of misinformation. Our BSI COVID -19 Taskforce, working with other members of the Society, did a great job during this time. They brought together the very latest research and distilled it into clear and accessible information for the public. This allowed us to be a sensible and trustworthy voice on COVID vaccination. We never told anyone what to do - that was really important. Instead, we made sure people had the best information to make their own decisions. We also did a great deal of work to support our members to have their own discussions with the public, media and their family and friends. What do you think science has learnt from the pandemic? Scientists have learnt that they can put competition aside and come together to rapidly solve problems. I didn't expect the scientific community to come together quite as well as it did. In normal times scientists need to compete with each other to be successful. Yet, during the pandemic, data and samples were shared widely and we excelled at collaboration. It was particularly pleasing to see significant papers being published with 50 or more authors, with the research itself carried out unbelievably quickly. Opening ceremony at BSI Congress 2019 With members of the Board of TrusteesImmunology News | December 202220 FEATURE ARTICLE 'Immunology will make the greatest advances if people from many different disciplines and backgrounds work together. We need academia, industry and clinicians to come together, but that won't happen without encouragement. The BSI has an essential role here as the glue to bring all the strands of immunology together as a whole.'What are the biggest challenges that the field of immunology still needs to overcome? We need to persuade more younger people there is a career in immunology. Academia is an uncertain path with job insecurity, though it is a rewarding and fascinating career for those who pursue it. An immunology degree can also lead to many other careers; there is interesting work in healthcare, industry, grant giving bodies, policy work and in the media. We need to do more to communicate this to people at an early age so they can find immunology as a career. Another major challenge is to encourage different ethnic groups to study immunology. Despite seeing ethnic diversity in those studying science degrees, there still are very few people from minority groups in senior positions in immunology - or indeed - wider science. The BSI is working hard to change this, and this is one of the aims of our recently published Diversity and Inclusion framework - which will help us strive to foster a culture within immunology that ensures that fair treatment and opportunity for all no matter their gender, ethnicity, other factors or background. I haven't talked a lot about my own ethnicity, but I do hope that by being President of the BSI, I have inadvertently opened the door to others. I hope other people from minority ethnic groups will be encouraged to apply for senior positions in science. Why should researchers from all sectors and backgrounds engage with the BSI? Immunology will make the greatest advances if people from many different disciplines and backgrounds work together. We need academia, industry and clinicians to come together, but that won't happen without encouragement. The BSI has an essential role here as the glue to bring all the strands of immunology together as a whole. Bringing clinicians and industry, in particular, into our activities and our membership is very important for immunology as a sector to thrive. How important is international work to the BSI? It was a priority for my time as President to make sure that BSI had a greater international reach. For a small country, our immunology research packs a big punch and the calibre of UK immunology is world renowned. I wanted to integrate our immune experience in the UK with that of the rest of the world and I think we are achieving this. Our work is supporting the British immunology community to build collaborative links around the world, and in fact I have just returned from trips to Singapore and the US. We chair the European Federation of Immunological Societies' Vaccine Task Force, bringing together stakeholders from around Europe to share best practice in improving vaccine uptake. You joined the BSI in 1978, can you tell us how being a member has supported your career? Attending the BSI Congress has always been incredibly important to me. These get-togethers include junior and senior researchers and see people from all areas of immunology coming together to share ideas. I always felt included, felt welcomed - and they were the best meetings I went to every year. It is these events that really made me feel part of the BSI throughout my career and made me want to give back to the Society. What advice would you give to someone embarking on an immunology career today? You have to be driven by curiosity; everything else is secondary. Find something you are interested in and give it a go, have the courage to take it forwards. Embrace the excitement - if you are not excited by it, don't do it. It is also important to know that you don't need to be conventionally disciplined and serious to have a career in immunology. I wasn't a stellar academic all the way through my education. I could have been described as bad boy at school, but I was curious and fascinated by science. I can see now that having a slightly undisciplined mind is an advantage that helps me go in a different direction and see things differently from my peers. Any advice to the next BSI President? I am delighted that Tracy Hussell will be taking over as President; I have known her for a long time and know how able she is. She will bring her own style to the role and I really look forward to seeing what she delivers. I wish her all the best and have total confidence that the BSI will go from strength to strength under her leadership.

Changing the rules of TCR engagement Jade R Hopkins, Bruce J MacLachlan, Stephen Harper, Andrew K Sewell & David K Cole https://doi.org/10.1093/discim/kyac001 Professor Simon Milling, Founding Editor-in-Chief, said: \"I'm very pleased that our first issue includes this thought-provoking review which describes how our understanding of MHC I:peptide complexes (pMHC) needs to consider that both the peptide and the presenting MHC molecules are flexible. This flexibility affects how the pMHC complex is recognised by the T cell receptor and can have a significant influence on the outcome of the T cell response. The article describes interesting molecular mechanisms and places them in the wider context of their effects on the immune response.

Katie J Smith & Emily Gwyer Findlay https://doi.org/10.1093/discim/kyac003 Professor Fran J Quintana, Senior Editor, said: \"This article explores the intriguing potential roles of antimicrobial host defence peptides (HDPs) in the CNS. This is an important subject, because although HDPs are usually studied in the context of their antimicrobial activity, they possess immunomodulatory activities which suggest multiple roles in the regulation of the immune response in the CNS in health and disease.

The role of IL -33 as an anti- or pro-fibrotic cytokine is unclear and dependent on tissue, species and more importantly on other factors that work in unison. A detailed understanding of the protective or detrimental effect of the role of IL -33 in different stages and different organ fibrosis is absolutely required to position or not the various anti-IL -33 agents for fibrosis.

PIPS are three-month placements conducted by BBSRC-funded PhD students. Other UKRI-funded doctoral training programmes have their own versions, but all have the three-month internship integrated into their funding timelines. The only rule is that it must be unrelated to your PhD project. Expanding career pathways My project is on the genomics of neglected Anopheles mosquitoes, specifically vectors of the malaria species Plasmodium vivax. My background is predominantly microbiology, with a side of immunology. I previously had the chance to get involved with public engagement around the gut microbiome while working as a project scientist, which kick-started my interest in public engagement and science communication, which is how I ended up at the BSI. I knew who the BSI were but hadn't had any interactions with them. Having seen the internship scheme on their website, it sounded like a great opportunity to do some more public engagement and get experience in a charity/learned society. So, I applied, and here I am! My main role, initially, was to update vaccine engagement resources; this covered existing COVID-19 vaccine resources such as the COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy infographic and the guide to COVID-19 At the BSI, we offer an internship scheme for graduates interested in exploring the career possibilities available within learned societies. In August 2022, Holly Acford-Palmer joined the BSI team as an intern to work on important public engagement activities over three months, as part of a placement during her PhD. Here, Holly shares some of the highlights and learnings during her time. vaccinations. This also led into the creation of new resources, such as infographics around polio vaccination and the autumn 2022 COVID-19 booster programme. Alongside these, I've helped to finish a guide to older adults' vaccines due to be published soon after finishing my internship in November. Engagement is key In recent years, childhood vaccination rates in England have been falling, and the disruption from COVID-19 and increasing spread of vaccine misinformation have had a negative effect on these. This shows the importance, more than ever, of engaging with the public to have open conversations about how vaccines work and why they are so important! As we've seen recently with polio virus detected in sewage water in some London boroughs, diseases we thought confined to history can come back to haunt us if we don't continue to actively encourage vaccine uptake. All of this has highlighted the importance of my work over the past three months and made this experience feel worthwhile. Outside of the vaccine resources, I had the opportunity to help organise a public engagement event at Cambridge Big Public engagement during my PhD: my experience as an intern at the BSI Biology Day, which gave me the chance to build some project management skills. We built origami viruses and antibodies, used magnets to demonstrate antibody/ antigen specificity, and had a pathogen treasure hunt to show the variety of micro-organisms that can cause disease. Breaking complex scientific concepts in a way that everyone can understand is the basis of public engagement, and the reason I applied for the internship scheme at the BSI. It was great to experience it with such an enthusiastic audience and excellent volunteers! Networking and tweeting! Throughout my time, I've also seen the different aspects of public engagement such as enabling other people to communicate science by assisting the BSI Communication and Engagement Grant process (www. immunology.org/communication- engagement-grant). I attended the National Core Studies Immunity Patient and Public Involvement panels where representatives of different patient groups get to hear about the latest research around COVID-19 and feed back directly to researchers about the wider implications of their research. 24 REPRESENTING IMMUNOLOGY Holly Acford-Palmer at the Cambridge Big Biology Day.Immunology News | December 202225 REPRESENTING IMMUNOLOGY 'Breaking complex scientific concepts in a way that everyone can understand is the basis of public engagement, and the reason I applied for the internship scheme at the BSI.' www.immunology.org All COVID-19 vaccines boost your immunity and protect against serious disease.

But the rest of the team have also been incredibly welcoming, helpful, and the breadth of the work they do is amazing. In three months, a new journal has been launched, alongside a new membership system and website, while BSI Congress 2022 is fast approaching, and among the countless other things. To see all the BSI does has been a great experience. To see the inner workings of a learned society, and yet with a relatively small team running everything, it meant getting an insight into how these different areas function and interact was possible. My previous career experience has been heavily laboratory focused, and this internship has showed me, I can still be involved in science without being the one doing it! I was aware of the wide variety of roles I could go into post-PhD, but this internship has given me an insight as to what those jobs could entail day to day, which has been an invaluable experience. And one I would recommend to anyone! Holly Acford-Palmer, PhD Student, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine/University College London\"An internship with the BSI can be beneficial for PhD students wanting to explore career options outside of academia and gain experience within a learned society while developing transferable skills, including science communication, public engagement, event management and relationship building with various stakeholders. If you're keen to learn new skills and want to champion immunology, a BSI internship might be for you! Holly was a pleasure to work with and supported impactful public engagement projects aligned with our aim to help everyone make informed decisions about their health.\" Erika Aquino, BSI Public Engagement Manager BSI internship scheme We are looking for graduates with good organisational skills who are willing to undertake a range of diverse tasks.

And all this was coupled with an irrepressible and sometimes edgy sense of humour. Born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire on 12 March 1932, Tony earned a bachelor's degree in Botany at the University of Manchester in 1952 and, following National Service in the Royal Air Force, returned to Manchester graduating with a PhD in plant cytogenetics in 1958. He was recruited to Prof Peo Koller's Department of Cytogenetics at the Chester Beatty Research Institute in London, a constituent of the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) with strong ties to the adjacent Royal Marsden Hospital. At that time, immunology as a discipline was realistically a subsidiary of pathology or clinical microbiology with focus upon viral diseases, vaccines, and antisera, a direct result of the effective poliovirus vaccines developed independently by Salk and Sabin. It was into this environment that Tony entered as postdoctoral researcher. In Koller's department, a PhD student, Jacques Miller, established that the thymus was essential for immunocompetence. There is an apocryphal story about a rail journey to a conference that Tony made with Jacques Miller, during which they argued about how the thymus acted: Miller espoused a humoral role, while Tony was for production of lymphocytes. In 1963, while still at the Chester Beatty, Jacques Miller published an article in Nature entitled 'Evidence for a humoral thymus factor responsible for the maturation of immunological faculty'. A year later, also in Nature , Tony published a short report entitled 'A cellular component of thymic function'. In this latter article, the first real evidence for thymic emigrant cells restoring immunocompetency was presented. In the articles coming from Tony's group from 1964 onwards to 1967, there is often a discussion giving room to the humoral hypothesis despite his results clearly supporting thymic lymphopoiesis. With hindsight, we can imagine that this was a prerequisite for publication, acknowledging the uncertainty in the field but, knowing Tony, one can sense his likely frustration of having to address what to him should now have been a footnote to canon. He was committed to the cellular hypothesis. Two articles from Tony's group stand out in this period, both in Transplantation . The first, in 1966, demonstrates unequivocally that cells from a neonatal thymic graft may form only a minor percentage of cells in the host peripheral immune organs but upon antigenic challenge or attachment of an allogeneic skin graft the cells responding by proliferation in the periphery were of thymic origin with the same observation upon secondary challenge. This report was a robust elaboration of the earlier 1964 article and provided incontrovertible evidence that antigen-responding immune cells were of thymic origin. The second article, published in 1967, was a truly elegant approach designed to differentiate cells of differing origin in an age before monoclonal antibodies, molecularly defined cell surface antigens, FACS cell sorting and genome-encoded fluorescent labels. As Tony relates, \"These experiments were first completed and spoken of at an international conference at the Institute of Cancer Research in London in 1965. They were greeted with polite scepticism and had little impact at that time...Formal publication of these experiments was delayed partly, I suspect, because the contemporary referees were unable to deal with something that contradicted the monophyletic notion of lymphocytes in the immune response.\" In one fell swoop, Tony and colleagues had demonstrated that lymphocytes of thymic origin (T cells, of course) cannot produce antibody, but they provide Anthony John Swainson Davies 1932 - 2022 Anthony (Tony) John Swainson Davies, immunologist and mentor, died on 8 August at the age of 90. He was one of the visionaries that established the foundations of modern cellular immunology as the field developed in the 20-year period from 1960 to 1980. It is no exaggeration to state that once the thymus was identified as being critical for immune function in the mammal, Tony laid the path for discriminating the thymus as the origin of the T cells circulating in the periphery in addition to identifying their essential role providing help for B cell function. He never stopped working, never stopped thinking, about immunology. He continued publishing articles even in 2020 addressing the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, based on his more than 60 years of experience as an immunologist. 'There is an apocryphal story about a rail journey to a conference that Tony made with Jacques Miller, during which they argued about how the thymus acted: Miller espoused a humoral role, while Tony was for production of lymphocytes.'\u00a9Andrew KeatImmunology News | December 2022OBITUARY 35 help for lymphocytes of bone marrow origin (B cells) thus identifying not only independent lymphocyte functionalities but also their necessary co-operativity. The following year, a series of three consecutive articles in the Journal of Experimental Medicine by Graham Mitchell and Jacques Miller demonstrated, using similar techniques, exactly the same phenomena. Remarkably, even in a review by Av Mitchison in 2004, multiple groups are given credit for demonstrating T-B cooperativity, with 1968 being described as the pivotal year for this functionality, but nowhere are the earlier results of Tony and his group given recognition or credit. Between 1967 and 1974, Mike Doenhoff joined Tony's laboratory as a PhD student. Mike was the second student to have his PhD directly supervised by Tony, preceded by Elizabeth Leuchars, though he subsequently mentored many more. In a remarkable series of papers spanning a decade, Mike and Tony exploited the mouse T6/T6 marker chromosomes, and using a lymphocyte in vitro culture system developed by Hilliard Festenstein showed that the blood cells responding to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were thymus-derived, which in turn provided an opportune and incontrovertible marker for T cell identification prior to the routine use of Thy-1 and subsequent CD markers for cell characterisation. Using the T6/T6 markers and/or 3H-thymidine incorporation together with generation of mitotic T cell populations using PHA, Tony, Mike and colleagues were able to enumerate organ representation and kinetics of T cells during immune responses and during development and ageing. Tony referred to these articles as \"the most satisfying of my career\". Tony helped supervise a total of 22 PhD, MPhil, MD, and MS (Surgery) students, was an external examiner for 33 PhD students globally, and was a visiting examiner for BSc degrees at seven University of London Colleges and Medical Schools. Deciding upon retirement in 1991, Tony was appointed Emeritus Professor of the University of London whereupon he continued to challenge himself academically, becoming a consultant especially to groups needing help in navigating grant applications through successive cycles of the massive European Union Framework funding mechanism. He served on Scientific Advisory Committees including the Prostate Cancer Research Centre at King's College (1999-2019) directed by Dr Aamir Ahmed, who became a close friend. He also became highly involved together with Prof Max Murray in ventures aimed CosMx Webinar Series Addressing questions rising from immunology to metabolism, see how ten leading researchers have used CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager to gain deeper insights into cellular and subcellular gene and protein expression.

Tony's colleagues, students, mentees, and collaborators feel as a group that he probably didn't receive the proper recognition he deserved for his early work on defining the elements of adaptive immunity. He never really talked about it - for several reasons. First, he was generous; this is clear from his recollections of that critical time published in 1993. He respected his colleagues and was appreciative of their science and insight. He could be sharp and incisive with words, but never with malice. Usually, such words were delivered with a twinkle in his eye. He enjoyed life - he had much to do and didn't have the time to mull over the past and harbour grudges. He has left a lasting impression on all who knew him, and he will be sorely missed. Collated by Dr Jonathan S. Duke-Cohan on behalf of his colleaguesImmunology News | December 2022Michael Sela, renowned Israeli immunochemist and major figure in international immunology died at the age of 98 on 27 May 2022, just one month after the death of his colleague Professor Hugh McDevitt (28 April 2022). Together they largely founded the field of the genetic control of the immune response with their seminal Journal of Experimental Medicine paper (1965, 122: 517-531) 'Genetic control of the antibody response. I. Demonstration of determinant-specific differences in response to synthetic polypeptide antigens in two strains of inbred mice'. Sela was born in Poland in 1924 and named Mieczyslaw Salomonowicz, later changing this to Michael Sela. He grew up in the courtyard of his father's textile factory but, as antisemitism worsened, the family moved, first to Romania and finally to Palestine - at the time the British administered League of Nations Mandate for Palestine, in 1941. Following a short period of detention, the young Sela worked as a weaver producing gauze for the British military and then the same year entered the Hebrew University in Jerusalem to study chemistry, obtaining his Master's degree in 1946. Intending to specialise in synthetic polymers and dyes he pursued his doctoral studies in Geneva but, passionate about the formation of the State of Israel, he moved to Italy where he helped European Jews, mostly Holocaust survivors, travel to Israel. Although his immediate family escaped to Israel many of his relatives were killed by the Nazis. When Israel's independence was declared in 1948, he became a commercial secretary in the Israeli legation in Czechoslovakia. When I first met Michael, in the early 1970s at his international course in immunochemistry for young immunologists at the kibbutz Nof Ginnosar, I could not fail to be enthused by his passion for immunology but also by his delight in showing us around the historic and beautiful features of his adopted country. In 1950 Sela returned to science, and to Israel, enrolling at the Weizmann Institute for his chemistry PhD with the biophysicist Professor Ephraim Katzir, who was later to become President of Israel. Katzir was a pioneer in synthesising defined polypeptides as a means to discovering the properties of proteins. Sela worked on polytyrosine (a chain of phenols) and poly-p-aminophenylalanine (a chain of anilines) and reasoned that he would be able to produce polypeptidic azo dyes from them. In his reading he encountered the work of Karl Landsteiner on attaching haptens to proteins via an azo bond. Studying Landsteiner's classic book, The Specificity of Serological Reactions, he learned that gelatin was not antigenic and that this was speculated to be due to the lack of tyrosines. Intrigued, Sela and Ruth Arnon showed that coupling tyrosines to gelatin enhanced immunogenicity without altering specificity. This led to a fascination with what constituted an antigen and the concept that immunogen was different from antigen, and immunogenicity was different from antigenicity. From then on Sela was an immunochemist rather than simply a chemist. Much of what we now know about immunogens stems from the work of Sela and his students. Synthesising defined polypeptides as antigens, in contrast to whole proteins, Sela was able to dissect the immune response. In work with John Humphrey using Sandylop and Himalayan rabbits, and with Hugh McDevitt on inbred strains of mice, Sela established the existence of immune response genes. Although principally a basic scientist Sela made enormous contributions to human health. Working with Ruth Arnon, Sela was able to prevent the induction of experimental autoimmune disease - experimental allergic encephalomyelitis - by administration of a positively charged polypeptide leading to his development of the revolutionary drug Copoxone for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Sela published more than 800 articles, chapters and books. He spoke nine languages, was a strong supporter of the arts in Israel and chaired several artistic organisations. His first wife Margalit Liebman who he married in 1948 died in 1975. The following year he married Sara Kika, who survives him, together with his daughters Irit and Orlee from his first marriage, and Tamar from his second. An inspiring teacher, a recipient of numerous international awards, Michael Sela was fundamental to the development of modern immunology and immunotherapy.

Discovery Immunology Interleukin-33 (IL -33) is one of the most recently described cytokines and its expanding role in various physiological and pathological processes remains an active subject of debate. In this review, Di Carmine et al . provide an excellent summary of the literature around the role of IL -33 in fibrosis. Fibrosis is an aberrant wound healing response caused by proliferation and remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) but also chronic inflammation. Here, the authors describe various studies showing the bivalent role of IL -33 in different organs. Whilst IL -33 can be pro fibrogenic Immunotherapy AdvancesThe BSI journalsImmune Update De-risking clinical trial failure through mechanistic simulation Around 54% of therapeutic drugs being tested fail in late-stage clinical development, costing the pharmaceutical industry billions each year. One strategy to reduce the risk of drugs trials failing would be through clinical trial simulation, combined with mechanistic modelling, which would allow you to test hypotheses for mechanisms of failure and to improve trial designs. In this study, Brown et al . tested their hypothesized mechanism of action for IMA901, a short-peptide cancer vaccine, using in silico models of the vaccine site, lymphatics and the lymph node. They found that the results of their simulation were consistent with the outcomes observed in the clinical data; however, there were limitations in the predicted response due to factors like peptide binding and dendritic cell migration. The authors showed how mechanistic models can complement clinical, experimental, and data-driven studies to understand, test, and improve trial designs. Brown et al. 2022 Immunotherapy Advances 2 ltac017 http://bit.ly/3THIfV8 Summary by Robyn Taylor, BSI Journals Manager Clinical & Experimental Immunology Immunopathology of the optic nerve in multiple sclerosis Optical neuritis (ON), an acute inflammatory condition of the optic nerve leading to visual disturbances and eventually to visual loss, is a common clinical manifestation in multiple sclerosis (MS). ON is thought to occur as a consequence of demyelination of the optic nerve; however, the immunopathology of the optic nerve during MS is not well understood. In a recent study, Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco et al . assessed optic nerve pathology in 154 MS cases and characterised marker expression of innate and adaptive immune responses within in the parenchyma, meninges and the perivascular regions in the optic nerve in a sub-cohort of 30 MS and 6 non-neurological control cases. The study discovered that inflammation is present in the optic nerve lesions in MS while the pathology, as well as microglia/ macrophages profiles, is similar to brain and spinal cord lesions. Further, the authors reveal that optic nerve pathology is a frequent phenomenon and optic nerve lesions present in the absence of clinical symptoms. Fern\u00e1ndez Blanco et al . 2022 Clinical \u00a9Shutterstock/SciePro \u00a9Shutterstock/SkazovDIL-33 in fibrosis; the jury is still decidingin the lungs and liver, its role during fibrosis is still unclear in the gut, skin and kidney, and IL -33 seems protective in the heart by protecting cardiomyocyte death. The authors highlight the use of translational models such as human organoids to better understand IL -33 in humans. Finally, they mention the careful use of blocking anti-IL -33 antibodies in clinical trials and how the latter could impact fibrosis.

Written by Edd James, Louisa James and Holly Acford-Palmer. Primary immunity modulates na\u00efve B cells recruitment in secondary responses Repeated exposure to an antigen, through infection or booster vaccination, can induce secondary germinal centre (GC) responses, which are largely seeded by na\u00efve B cells. To investigate how primary responses influence secondary GCs, Tas et al. immunised mice following the passive transfer of B cells or serum from mice that were either primed (i.e. previously immunised) or unprimed (i.e. na\u00efve). Depending on the affinity, abundance and epitope specificity of pre-existing antibodies, primary immunisation resulted in either restricted or enhanced recruitment of na\u00efve B cells to secondary GCs. For example, serum containing low-affinity immunoglobulin enhanced secondary GCs whereas the reverse was true for high-affinity immunoglobulin. Importantly immunisation with excess antigen abrogated the inhibitory effects of high-affinity antibody on GC responses. Understanding how circulating antibodies influence secondary immune responses will aid in the design of booster vaccination regimes that enhance secondary immunity. Tas et al . 2022 Immunity 55 1876-1871The breakdown of immune tolerance for microbiota is involved in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) flare ups. Immune cells expressing transcription factor ROR t+ are often a key contributor in the maintenance of this tolerance, or the breakdown into inflammation. In this study, Lyu et al . show in mouse models, group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are key to establishing tolerance to gut microbiota through interactions with ROR t+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and T helper 17 cells (Th17). By selecting for ROR t+ Tregs and against Th17 cells, ILC3s help maintain tolerance. Microbiota-induced Th17 cells protect from metabolic disease Metabolic syndrome leads to many pathologies such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Diet is a major factor in the development of metabolic syndrome with a western-style diet (high in fat and sugar) important in its initiation. Here, Kawano et al. show that sugar, but not fat, mediated a change in the gut microbiota which led to the loss of protective Th17 cells. A high-fat, high- sugar diet resulted in the loss of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), which induced Th17 cells, leading to protection through the regulation of lipid absorption dependent on IL -17. Interestingly, it was sugar together with ILC3, and not fat, that was shown to promote growth of Erysipelotrichaceae leading to the displacement of Th17- inducing commensal SFB. These findings provide valuable insights into the factors important in the development of metabolic syndrome and for future therapeutic approaches. Kawano et al . 2022 Cell 185 3501-3519 \u00a9Shutterstock/Proxima Studio ILC3s select microbiota-specific Tregs to establish tolerance in the gut In human IBD inflamed tissue samples, interactions between ILC3 and ROR t+ Tregs were altered compared with non-inflamed samples. Quantities of both cells were reduced in areas of inflammation compared with non-inflamed regions. These results could potentially explain the breakdown of immune tolerance in IBD patients and could identify new therapies, which redirect the immune system to prevent chronic inflammatory responses to gut microbiota.
