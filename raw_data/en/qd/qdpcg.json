History of Qigong \"Qigong is the deepest root of traditional Chinese medicine, as well as traditional Chinese martial art,\" says [Chris Bouguyon](https://www.simplyaware.com/meet-the-simplyaware-founders-sifu-chris-bouguyon-and-sifu-fayne-bouguyon), a co-founder of [SimplyAware Wellness and Training Center](https://www.simplyaware.com/) in Richardson, Texas, the president of the [National Qigong Association (NQA)](https://www.nqa.org/), and a certified medical qigong therapist who specializes in trauma. \"One of the earliest forms of qigong that we have knowledge of is the Five Animal Frolics,\" Bouguyon says. After a day of labor, field workers would perform gentle movements to help ease tension in their bodies. They settled on the movements by observing the nearby animals and imitating their motions. Eventually, the practice evolved into an understanding of the TCM concept of meridians, or energy channels, within the body, according to Bouguyon. Today, people around the world turn to qigong and later iterations like tai chi for health, spiritual, and wellness benefits. How Qigong Works It may sound simple, but there's a lot happening within the body and mind during a qigong practice. By tapping into the parasympathetic nervous system, qigong can help reduce stress and anxiety, which has many implications for health. \"Qigong offers the beautiful gift of working to quiet the mind, settle the emotions, and relax into the body,\" Bouguyon says. From the traditional Chinese medicine perspective, qigong optimizes the flow of energy in your body to help mitigate or attend to any number of conditions. Take [constipation](/constipation/guide/), for example. It can be thought of in relation to the spleen, which regulates the primary digestive process in traditional Chinese medical thought, says [Bernard Shannon](https://medicalqigong.org/index.php/about/the-founder), a doctor of TCM, the chair of the NQA, and the founder of the [International Medical Qigong College](https://medicalqigong.org/index.php) in Bradyville, Tennessee. (Shannon notes that the spleen is similar to but conceptualized differently than the conventional medical understanding of the physical organ.) \"If you have a yin deficiency, there's not enough moisture, and so you're constipated because it's too dry. If there's too much yin, it becomes stagnant and can't move forward. It's kind of like quicksand \u2014 you take a step forward, and it slides back,\" Shannon says. (This is one view of constipation from TCM. Other theories and schools of thought that involve qi, blood, and other patterns share similarities to the yin-yang theory but have different approaches.) A practitioner who specializes in using qigong for health purposes, like a licensed acupuncturist and TCM practitioner who also offers qigong, will help you determine potential qigong postures to help move more of that energy toward your spleen to relieve constipation, according to Shannon. [Red Thread International Qigong Institute](https://redthreadinstitute.org/certified-clinical-practitioners-and-teachers), the [International Medical Qigong College](https://www.medicalqigong.org/index.php/directory), and the [NQA](https://www.nqa.org/what-is-qigong). It's also essential to work in an integrative way with your primary doctor to make sure you are evaluating any symptoms and concerns via a conventional medical perspective alongside your visits with an acupuncturist and qigong practitioner. Types of Qigong There are likely thousands of qigong styles. However, each style has three components: breath, movement, and intention. \"Within that, there are different ways that qigong can be used for one's benefit,\" Bouguyon says. Health and Medical Qigong Martial Qigong Spiritual Qigong Possible Health Benefits of Qigong Like other mind-body practices, qigong offers a long list of potential physiological benefits. Here are a few notable ways that starting a qigong practice may help improve your health and wellness overall. Lowers Blood Pressure The deep breathing, meditation, and relaxation components of qigong may benefit your heart health. [hypertension](/high-blood-pressure/guide/). Together, systolic and diastolic blood pressure indicate how much pressure your heart exerts with every beat and at rest. In one study included in the review, the blood-pressure-lowering effect of qigong was similar to that of a conventional exercise routine. The authors theorize that qigong's benefits to the heart may be partly thanks to the repetitive movements, which boost blood flow and improve organ function, yet more studies would be needed to fully understand how qigong helps. Eases Pain from Knee Osteoarthritis [osteoarthritis](/osteoarthritis/guide/), a condition in which the cartilage in the knee joint gradually deteriorates, due to overuse, injury, or both. [knee osteoarthritis pain](/hs/osteoarthritis/dos-donts-osteoarthritis-knee-pain/), stiffness, and physical function more than a control group or health education program. However, researchers warn that the evidence is weak, as only three of the studies were adequately designed. Therefore, more high-quality studies in people with knee osteoarthritis are needed. Improves Well-Being in People With Cancer [Complementary therapies](https://www.everydayhealth.com/what-are-alternative-complementary-integrative-health-approaches/) like qigong are often used to help [people with cancer](/cancer/guide/) cope with the side effects and stress of [cancer treatment](/cancer/guide/treatment/). [benefits of deep breathing](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/deep-breathing/)and the mood-boosting effects of movement and exercise. Qigong Safety and Side Effects In addition, \"because the poses are standing, people with poor balance should be aware of fall risk,\" says [Yufang Lin, MD](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/22463-yufang-lin), an integrative medicine physician with the [Center for Integrative Medicine at Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/wellness/integrative) in Ohio. There may also be risks to relying on videos for qigong instruction. For example, if you're using qigong to help heal a physical injury, you may push too hard when practicing on your own and potentially make the injury worse. \"It's always best to take a class from a teacher who has the ability to check your [posture](/drugs/posture) and make sure you're doing the exercises safely,\" Dr. Lin says. Still, online classes may help supplement your in-person practice, Bouguyon notes. Who Should Potentially Try (or Avoid) Qigong Risks during qigong may come from working with an inexperienced instructor with limited training or trying to push beyond your body's boundaries. People using qigong as a complementary therapy for a medical condition should be especially picky when choosing a qigong practitioner. Use directories offered by the [Red Thread International Qigong Institute](https://redthreadinstitute.org/certified-clinical-practitioners-and-teachers), the [International Medical Qigong College](https://www.medicalqigong.org/index.php/directory), and the [NQA](https://www.nqa.org/what-is-qigong) to help you find a qualified medical qigong practitioner. Tips for Getting Started With Qigong Thanks to its ever-growing popularity, there are many options for trying qigong. Here are a few tips for beginning your practice. Define Your Goals \"Identifying why you want to try qigong will help inform what type of practice is best for you,\" says [Michael Sweeney](https://redthreadinstitute.org/about-us), a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, a doctor of medical qigong, the deputy chair of the NQA, and the director of academics at the Red Thread International Qigong Institute in Carbondale, Colorado. If you're interested in becoming stronger, faster, and more agile, you may want to check out martial forms of qigong. If you're simply looking for general health benefits, aim for wellness-focused classes in your area. Intrigued by the spiritual side of qigong? Opt for classes that advertise a spiritual practice. And if you want to see how qigong might improve a chronic or acute condition, search for a qualified medical qigong practitioner and have a discussion with your primary care or integrative medicine provider. Verify the Credentials of Your Teacher Once you find an online or in-person qigong class you'd like to try, take a peek at the instructor's credentials. \"Qigong is exploding in popularity right now, and in this day and age, it's becoming more and more difficult to separate celebrity status from actual authority,\" Sweeney says. On that note, if someone claims to practice medical qigong, ensure that they've had traditional Chinese medical training. This may not be as critical if you're taking qigong for general health, wellness, and fitness, but it may lead to a better experience overall. \"There can be a significant difference in the capabilities and knowledge of a teacher with 100 hours of training and someone with thousands of hours of training experience,\" Sweeney notes. Be Open to the Practice Lin recommends going into your qigong sessions with curiosity and an open mind. Observe any sensations and changes you experience throughout the practice and be prepared to ask questions. \"Learn about the postures, practice them at home [as recommended by your teacher], and know that it will take time to become comfortable with the postures and breathing patterns,\" Lin says. What to Expect Before, During, and After Qigong At Bouguyon's training center, instructors begin a typical class with a discussion of one of the eight foundational principles of qigong as Bouguyon has interpreted them over years of his own practice. \"Basically, it gives students a point of focus for the class,\" he says. Other qigong instructors and classes may have their own approach. When done for general health and well-being, the effects of qigong are, for many, immediately noticeable. \"After class, I would say the majority of students feel relaxed but energized,\" Bouguyon says. This mellow but uplifted state is generally due to qigong's focus on the breath. \"Any time you do deep-breathing work for 20 minutes or more, hormones are released in the body that relax the muscles and open up the blood vessels to increase deep tissue circulation,\" he believes. However, benefits also may increase with repetition. \"Over time, you should [in general] see improvement in strength, balance, and flexibility, and also a greater state of calm and overall reduced stress response,\" Lin says. If you're using qigong for a medical purpose, such as injury recovery or pain or symptom management, it may take longer to see significant improvements. \"Generally, the more acute the condition, the quicker the results. The more chronic the condition, the longer it may take to see results,\" Sweeney says. How long it takes to feel results will ultimately depend on the condition being addressed, how often you practice qigong, how knowledgeable your practitioner is, and what other medications or therapies you're using as part of an integrative healthcare plan, approved by your doctor.
