The more I researched into the ingredients in the products that we put onto our skin everyday, the more shocked I became. There are so many nasty chemicals in makeup, body lotions and haircare. The big nasties are sodium lauryl sulfate and parabens, which are found in nearly every product. Parabens are preservatives which have been found in breast cancer tissue, as they have been found to mimic estrogen in the body, too much estrogen can be linked to breast cancer. Sodium lauryl sulfate is a foaming agent it is the main ingredient found in engine de-greaser, and as you can imagine its very drying for the skin. It gets absorbed by the skin and mimics estrogen, and have many negative effects on the body. The good news is that there are lots of lovely natural products out there. And just a few small changes can make a big difference. Here are a few I have tried and loved. [Korres CC cream](http://www.feelunique.com/p/Korres-Wild-Rose-CC-Cream-SPF-30-30ml), its got light coverage and a lovely rose smell. [Yes to Carrots ](http://yesto.co.uk/product/yes-to-carrots-nourishing-shampoo--280-ml?product_id=1215105)shampoo and conditioner, this stuff also smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. It also is around the same price as my normal brand too. I use coconut oil as a body lotion, and it's great as a hair mask too. It's cheap to buy and has so many uses. I just pick mine up from my local grocer. [Green people's](https://www.greenpeople.co.uk/shop/by-product/organic-make-up/organic-mascara-products/volumising-mascara-black-7ml) mascara is great and makes lashes lovely and long. [Dr Bronner soap ](https://www.drbronner.co.uk)makes my skin soft and clean in the shower and has a great natural fragrance. March 16, 2016 "}
