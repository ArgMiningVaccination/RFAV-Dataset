Polypeptides (3,000 - 10,000 dalton) in Cervus & Cucumis polypeptide injection (CCPI), the extract Temmick) bones and muskmelon (Cucumis melo L) seeds, are the active ingredients with bone healing, pain relieving, and anti-inflammation properties. PAE was administrated orally 600 mg twice a day for at least 12 months.
