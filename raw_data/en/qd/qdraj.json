Welcome to this space, you're not here by coincidence but because of your heart's guidance My name is Dominique, human and student of life, woman, friend, and passionate about the Vedic Sciences. 2018 was the year in which I first met Yoga. A little over 2 years after, Ayurveda found me. It took me over 2 years to fully digest the effects yoga had on my body and mind. Being a high achiever since a young age, the accumulated years of pursuing fulfilment in external achievements left me burned out and unhappy. Anxiety started knocking on my door more often than I could handle leaving me with a sense of depletion and disconnection. Yearning to heal from the anxiety attacks I was experiencing as a result of unresolved traumatic events in my life, I enrolled in an Introduction to Ayurvedic Principles course in July 2020. This was also the month in which my yoga asana and meditation practice became a cornerstone in my daily routine. In 2022 I attained my certificate as an Ayurveda Health Educator at the California College of Ayurveda (and my heart knows this is just the beginning) In the process of living Ayurveda and getting on my mat everyday I have met my heart at a deeper level and that is what I desire for you and all souls who are open to receiving the knowledge I seek to share. The purpose of this group, therefore, is to make a contribution to peoples' lives through sharing with them and guiding them into how to embody health and heal through simple yet effective Ayurvedic practices that have been a cornerstone in my healing journey and I'm certain that can be a cornerstone in yours, should you decide so. Through this group I look forward to create more freedom and peace in my corner of the world, through supporting your physical body, your mind and your soul. In coming months, I will create events and workshops open for everyone who is interested in inviting Ayurveda into their lives. Keep your eyes peeled! I can't wait to meet you. With "}
