I was reading in the book, \"The Empowered Mama, \" by Lisa Druxman, and she talks about how she asks the mothers she meets four questions: Do you want your children to take care of themselves the way you do? Do you want them to eat like you do? Do you want them to exercise like you do? And, do you want them to stress like you do? She says that the answers they give are almost always \"no.\" If this is true for you, then pardon me, I 'm going to step in and do some mothering here. You 've probably heard this one: actions speak louder than words. Moms are powerful catalysts for change, and knowing that you lead by example, how can we support you in leaving a legacy of values, attitudes, and habits that you want to pass on to your children? You've probably heard this one, too: to help others, you must first help yourself (Right? The airplane attendant instructs you to put on your oxygen mask first!). To be the best anything you can be, it is important that you take the time to realize your value, then take the time to do what you need to do to replenish both your body and your mind. This is the time to reconnect and rediscover your self, add balance to your life, and live with a calm, connected confidence. Whether that means cleaning up your diet, reducing stressors, greening up your environment, releasing things that no longer serve you, getting massages on a regular basis, taking classes to pursue passionate interests and gain new education, or whatever it is that supports your best self, those in your life whom you mother are counting on you to do this. Because whatever you do for you, you are also doing for them. We thank you for your mothering and look forward to seeing you take time for you, because we know and appreciate your worth!

But her support system and drive to succeed pushed her through to the end earning her diploma as a Certified Naturopath, and successfully passing the National Exam and earning her ND - Board Certified Traditional Naturopathic Doctor. As an alumnus of the program, Dr. Sappington has accomplished a lot in just a short time. Of course, the program allows for students to start building a clientele while taking classes. She experienced no difficulty in getting established. She was building her clientele from first year and she was able to work with more like - minded people like the local chiropractor, massage therapists, and now, a local Physicians Assistant that refers clients to her. Social media and word of mouth are her best advertisers. While at the Institute, Rhonda found other interests. Since graduation, Rhonda has taken genetics, allergy correction and more herbology classes. Rhonda plans on expanding her West Branch office to include a salt room, various other healing equipment, and maybe even a homeopathic pharmacy. She currently has consultation rooms and a massage therapist practicing with her. Rhonda Sappington came to the Naturopathic Institute not quite sure that she would make it through the first year: time constraints, a busy life with a family business, but still thinking that there was something different for her to accomplish! This is her story that is not unlike many of the Naturopathic students ' stories. Rhonda Sappington was your typical student starting out in a new program. After investing in purpose driven life books and taking classes at Dr. Jan Doerr 's office (Health Naturally, Bay City, MI) where she learned more about natural health and therapies, she kept learning and hearing bits and pieces about the Institute as well. After one such class at Dr. Doerr 's, Rhonda left with a sense of peace and purpose knowing that something very deep inside her had changed. When she woke up the next morning, she promptly called the Institute, and that 's where it all began! Rhonda says that the Institute chose her. She fell in love with the energy of the school, the people and the instructors. She feels that she received the best education you can get in this industry, and it shows. Her experiences at the Institute did not come without challenges, personal, familial and Class of 2018 Rhonda Sappington, N.D. Alumni Spotlight 45 An 'aha' moment happened just recently for Rhonda: All through school my greatest goal has been to bridge the gap between medicine and naturopathy. I tried to get my medical internship hours with a PA who was very open to more holistic options. We had a really good conversation, and she was so excited to have me intern with her; but, Mid-Michigan Medical shut me down. Fast forward one year; I finally made an appointment with the same PA to have some blood work done. She walked into the room with another PA. They both looked at each other and smiled and said, IT'S HER! Lol. I'm like, who? You are the ND that opened a wellness clinic in town, and we are so excited! I talked to them about homeopathy and told them phase two will be a homeopathic pharmacy. Their eyes got so big. \"You are going to open a homeopathic pharmacy? \" \"Yes, I am! \" I replied. The nurse from the PA office called. She said they would like to have a stack of my business cards on hand. I immediately ran my cards to them at Mid -Michigan Medical. The PA, herself, met me behind the side door and told me she is sending people to me. Times are changing folks. Bridging the gap between medicine and Naturopathy one PA at a time. Because Naturopathy ROCKS!! I've said this since my first year at NITE. It 's a GREAT time to be a Naturopath. Whatever you might be going through right now, remember this story, because this is coming to a town near you.... SOON!! If not already. Sunshine & Dragonflies Naturopathy, LLC 1887 South First St. West Branch MI (989)343 -5285 Rhonda 's Advice to New Students: Don't fight the system Everything is put into place for a reason Do your homework! Teach your classes with the intention of growing your business not just because it is your homework. Teaching classes requires you to stand up for what you believe, have confidence in what you 're talking about. Just get it done - don' t put it off. Be open to changing yourself Be ready for growth Keep an open mind Be very prepared for relationships to change and embrace it It's a great time to be a Naturopath. The public voices are being heard, and their feet are doing the voting every time they march into one of our offices. Never back down. Believe in yourself It's still an education, long after you graduate Being a Board Certified Traditional Naturopathic Doctor has affected her life in so many ways. Her purpose is more direct. Her thoughts are much clearer than in the past. While at the Institute, she had to learn to take the stones being thrown at her and use them to build her empire. Rhonda learned to pause, breathe and then, respond without over - reacting. She learned how to manifest what she wanted, and both her and her husband are putting all their attention on this new wellness center. From the very first class at the Institute, Rhonda found that this school is the real deal. The teaching style really worked with her learning style, and it piqued her interest even more so that she kept going. Her clients kept her going as well. Whatever she may have thought it was going to be, it surely exceeded her expectations. The life experience, self - discovery and gratitude that comes from this education isn 't something you expect. You change, and everything else seems to follow. 5 Because ... \"Mama Don't Want No Vacuum!\" 6 Massage Package Gift Certificates One-and-a-half-hour Massage with Foot Reflexology Mother's Spa Day Gift Certificate (Includes: Foot Soak, Migun Massage Bed, and \u00bd Hour Infrared Sauna) Stress Relief Essential Oil Sprays and Roll Ons: Peace and Calming, Stress Away, Lavender, and Bergamot!

The Gift of Health, Is it on Your Holiday List? 7 Welcome to the Oak Street Canopy Hormone Balance Let's take a quick inventory: Do you wish you had more energy? Does it seem like you have extra weight that just won't budge? Could your sleep be better? Does it feel like all the work you put in to being healthy isn't really making a difference? Then, this class is for you! As agricultural practices and the environment have changed, so has the amount of toxins to which we are ex- posed and with which we are constantly bombarded. And, most of these toxins are what are termed \"endocrine disruptors,\" meaning that they affect the function of your glands and metabolism, leading to obesi- ty, depression, cancers, and other conditions. In this class, you will learn the hidden sources of these toxins and how they are negatively affecting your body's hormones and their functioning. Most importantly, you will discover how to avoid and minimize these toxins in your life, how to restore balance to your glandular system, and how to reset your hormones and metabolism so that you can have the energy you want, release weight, get quality sleep, and feel happy and healthy!

Or, everyone in the family got the flu but one? Even the medical community is stumped by what seems odd and hard to explain. The reason that some orthodox practitioners are stymied is simply that they cannot see the process whereby one individual will catch meningitis, while another will be completely unaffected. But, to those practitioners who take the time to find out about their patients ' history and lifestyle, there is generally no mystery. We soon learn that if the explanation is not immediately apparent, we need to look a little further, not dismiss it as 'a lottery. ' These sorts of comments create fear and panic and encourage people to feel like helpless victims whose only protection is vaccines and drugs. This is a good marketing position for the drug companies but far from the truth. What would be more helpful would be empowerment of the individual through the acknowledgement that we have a great degree of influence over our health and therefore, responsibility to look after ourselves. Through eating, rest, and by avoiding toxicity (both physical and emotional), we can always be healthier than if we do not look after ourselves and simply demand a quick fix from the doctor. Fortunately, homeopathy focuses on the whole person, which gives us very clear insights into why particular individuals get sick, even why they get a particular disease. Drawing on their own medical history and that of their family, it is even possible to ascertain their likely susceptibility to diseases in the future. Diseases are all around all of us continually. Our best protection is to be fit and healthy. In addition to the factors mentioned above, a wide variety of therapies are available to help us achieve and maintain an optimum level of health. Homeopathic treatment can help us to achieve and retain a healthy state in the face of twenty -first century pressures such as pollution and stress. As Louis Pasteur, father of the germ theory, said shortly before he died, 'disease is nothing, the soil is everything. ' We need to focus not so much on the disease, but on the soil in which disease can flourish \u2014 our minds, bodies, and spirits. The aim here is to encourage and support you in the use of homeopathy, to enable you to seek the best of health for yourself and your children, to know when and how to treat yourself and your family, and when and how to seek help from a professional homeopath. The Philosophy of Homeopathic Medicine In 1796, Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician and chemist, developed a new way to heal the sick. He called this new form of medicine homeopathy, from the Greek words meaning 'similar suffering ' and set out his philosophy in a book entitled The Organon: the Role of the Physician in Sickness and in Health. Why Choose Homeopathy 1213 Like Hippocrates in the fourth century BC, Hahnemann had realized that you could treat the sick by applying an opposite force to the sickness or a similar force. Orthodox treatment developed the system of using medicines to produce opposite effects to the patient 's symptoms, which would aim to cancel out the illness. Homeopathy uses medicine which, in a healthy person, would produce symptoms similar to those seen in the patient to be cured. This stimulates the patient her/himself to respond against the direction of force of the medicine (and, of course, the symptoms), restoring a natural health. For this reason, we call orthodox medicine allopathy (opposite suffering), as opposed to homeopathy which, through same suffering, stimulates the body 's own power to heal itself. However, the great advantage of homeopathic medicine lies in Hahnemann 's discovery that by a special process of dilution and agitation, we can get rid of the potentially harmful chemical side -effects common to so many orthodox drugs while retaining that which stimulates the curative response in a person. Even more remarkable is that the more we dilute and agitate the original remedy, the greater is its potency, or capacity, to produce a curative response in the person. One of the major advantages of homeopathy is that we do not have to think we know exactly what complaint someone is suffering from before we can help them. We simply need to find a remedy that matches the symptoms that are evident in the person. Why is this such an advantage? Simply because we can use the facts before our eyes: the first -hand evidence of the person sitting in front of us. We may be aware of the diagnosis, but we are also aware that they are very often wrong. Fortunately, we do not have to base a treatment on such an uncertain premise, nor do we have to subject a person to batteries of unpleasant worrying and potentially harmful tests. Instead, we are guided by careful observation of the symptoms, the constitution, and the past medical history of the person and their family. Increasingly, homeopathy and other therapies are becoming the first choice for a disillusioned public. This despite the fact that, unfortunately, it is often less accessible than they would like, due to the continuing political support for the very powerful and wealthy drug companies. The more we learn from an early age to take responsibility for our health, mental, physical, and emotional, then, increasingly, in the future, we will not tolerate much of what passes today for medical treatment: the suppression of the disease but at what cost to the person 's overall health? Because homeopathic remedies are diluted to minute doses, they do not damage organs or turn people 's minds or emotions off. Instead, they need the physical, mental, and emotional (whole person) to process their disease and thereby, reach a higher level of health. This is a true cure rather than suppression by continually having to supply an opposing force to stop symptoms reappearing or surgically cutting something out and hoping you can weaken the body so much with cocktails of toxic chemicals that it will not grow back. Surgery and drugs do have their uses, of course, but preferably, as a last resort! Homeopathy offers a very safe and well - proven alternative \u2014one that does not seek to stop the body from showing the symptoms of ill health but rather, seeks to restore health so that the individual no longer has any reason to produce symptoms. Homeopathic remedy kits are a must to have on hand at home to address acute conditions for you, your family, and even your pets. To address more chronic health concerns, consider seeing a homeopath or a naturopath who utilizes homeopathy. Homeopathy is safe, cost effective, and a natural way to boost one 's health; these are reasons you may want to choose homeopathy for part of your own healthcare.

He has studied the interactions of minerals for over 30 years and has made some incredible discoveries. He has found that our genome calls for 64 minerals. If a trace mineral is unavailable to make the amino acid required by the DNA code, the human system will try another way, using a different set of amino acids and minerals. This can have profound impacts on health. Dr. Olree is a favorite speaker year after year, at every event our organization offers! He has an incredible ability to pull together the details of nutrition and disease in a way that brings clarity and hope. Dr. Olree is also the author of several resource books every practitioner should own. Zach Bush, MD Dr. Bush is a physician specializing in internal medicine, endocrinology, and hospice care. He is an internationally recognized educator on the microbiome as it relates to health, disease, and our food production systems. Dr. Bush founded Seraphic Group to develop root -cause solutions for human and ecological health and extend his passion for educating the world on topics such as the state of our soil - including the need to eradicate toxins such as glyphosate from our farming chain - and the importance of gut/brain communication as a vital part of our overall health/wellbeing. Dr. Bush is a respected speaker and authority in health and wellness. He travels the world speaking to medical and farming communities as well as consumers who are interested in taking proactive control of their health. Tyrone Hayes, PhD At the University of California, Berkeley, and in ponds around the world, professor Tyrone Hayes studies frogs and other amphibians. He's become an active critic of the farm chemical atrazine, which he's found to interfere with the development of amphibians' endocrine systems.
