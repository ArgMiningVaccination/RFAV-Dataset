And good digestion starts with a balanced, healthy diet! Therefore, one of the most important things you can do for your health is to give your daily diet some attention. Food is considered to be [as powerful as medicine in Ayurveda](https://mapi.com/blogs/videos/add-healing-power-to-your-diet). In fact, there is a sloka (excerpt of verse from the ancient texts of Ayurveda) that says \"food is medicine when consumed properly.\" If we eat foods uniquely suited to our physiology, and follow a sattvic (life supporting) routine that enhances digestion, our bodies will reap the benefits, and we will find that our days will be happier, healthier and filled with real vitality \u2014 at any age. The Ayurveda-Digestion Connection According to Ayurveda, one of the most important factors in health is good digestion. When your agni (digestive fire) is strong, ojas (life essence) is abundant in your mind and body. On the other hand, when your digestion is poor, ama (toxins) are deposited in the digestive tract. Over time, when ama accumulates it can give rise to all manner of discomforts in the mind and body, ranging from acid stomach, constipation, and/or diarrhea, to skin issues, allergies, brain fog, hampered immunity, and a host of other problems. The Ayurvedic Diet: Eat According to Your Dosha Type One of the key tenets of Ayurveda is that no two people are alike, so no two people's dietary needs are exactly the same. For this reason, there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" Ayurvedic diet. In Ayurveda, the ideal diet is based on an individual's constitution, also known as their \"dosha type\" or \"mind-body The and [Kapha](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/understanding-kapha-dosha). The doshas are mind-body elements that govern all facets of our bodies' functioning\u2014from the size and shape of our body to the power of our digestion, the way our thoughts move, and the way we speak. Not sure what your Ayurvedic mind-body type is? Take our [Dosha Quiz](https://mapi.com/pages/dosha-quiz-landing) and get personalized recommendations for your ideal diet and lifestyle. 10 Ayurvedic Dietary Dos and Don'ts Knowing your dosha (mind-body) type is the first step toward finding the perfect diet for you. That being said, there are some basic Ayurvedic dietary foods and practices that apply to everyone. They are as follows: Favor a Vegetarian Diet The Ayurvedic diet is, generally speaking, a whole foods diet rich in plenty of fresh, organic produce, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, herbs, spices, and\u2014if tolerated\u2014dairy foods like milk, yogurt, and soft cheeses like panir. Fruits and vegetables (largely cooked) are valued in Ayurveda not only for their nutritional value, but also because they are good natural internal cleansers. The specific food guidelines for Vata, Pitta, and Kapha dosha diets will help you choose a variety of fruits and vegetables suited to your physiology and the season. If meat is currently part of your daily diet\u2014don't worry! Simply aim to reduce the quantity you eat and favor lighter proteins like fish and chicken, over heavier, harder-to-digest proteins like red meat. Avoid Processed Foods, Leftovers, and Raw/Cold Foods Whereas whole foods promote ojas, foods that are overly processed, frozen, canned, and full of additives and sugar are harder for your body to break down efficiently into nutrients. Leftovers fall into this category, too. As a result, it's better to avoid \"junk foods\" like these and turn your attention to whole foods instead. Note: [Raw foods](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/the-ayurvedic-take-on-paleo-keto-vegan-and-raw-diets), while technically whole foods, are harder to digest than cooked foods. For this reason, Ayurveda generally favors well-cooked, lightly spiced veggies over raw salads. Ice-cold foods and drinks are also better avoided, as they dampen the digestive fire and can lead to indigestion (ice water and cold soda, we're looking at you!). Caffeinated beverages and alcohol are best avoided, or consumed in moderation. Include all Six Tastes in Every Meal In Ayurveda, taste plays a big role in food selection, because different tastes affect the doshas. The six tastes are: sweet; sour; salty; bitter; astringent; and pungent. Each one has a different effect on the doshas. From the perspective of Ayurveda, a healthy meal includes [all six tastes](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/taste-as-medicine-the-six-tastes-of-ayurveda), thereby harmonizing the doshas. Eat Three Meals a Day Routine is everything in Ayurveda! For this reason, it's helpful to \"train\" your agni to receive three solid meals per day, rather than grazing and snacking throughout the day (which can overburden the digestive system), or fasting and skipping meals (which can throw your digestive fire out of balance). Make Lunch Your Biggest Meal and Dinner Your Lightest As the sun reaches its highest point in the sky, at noon, your digestive fire is at its highest, too. For this reason, Ayurveda recommends eating your largest meal of the day at noon, when your inner fire is burning brightly and better able to digest and assimilate. [Eat a lighter, well-cooked meal](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/the-maharishi-ayurveda-approach-to-a-light-diet) at least three hours before bed, and try to be in bed around 10:00 p.m. or before. Eating a big, heavy meal late in the evening can tax your body when it's doing its nightly \"rest and repair\" cycles. Eat in a Calm, Settled Environment Balanced health goes beyond physical wellness to well-being in mind, spirit, emotions, and the senses as well. The food we eat can nourish our mind, body, and emotions, not just our body. Cooking and eating in a harmonious atmosphere turns food into nectar. A pleasant, tidy, cheerful environment and the nurturing company of friends or family will actually make mealtimes more nourishing. When eating, try to avoid watching TV, reading, checking your screens, scrolling the news, or discussing stressful topics. Eat a Balanced Amount Your mother told you to always clean your plate, but Ayurvedic wisdom advises you to eat until you feel comfortably full, and no more. When you start to burp, that would be about enough! Try to avoid eating to the point of discomfort, or eating rationed portions that leave you feeling hungry and dissatisfied. Be Spice Wise Spices not only add flavor and aroma; they also bring therapeutic value to any meal. Spices help [boost natural immunity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7815254/), and most of them can rev up your digestion so your body is able to absorb and assimilate the nutrients from the foods we eat! If you are new to the world of spices and aren't quite sure what to choose, try one of our ready-to-use Churnas. Stay Well Hydrated An Ayurvedic diet would be incomplete without a mention of liquids! It's important to stay hydrated throughout the day by drinking pure water (either room-temperature, or warm for cleansing). At lunch, you can also drink lassi, a probiotic Ayurvedic beverage made from yogurt, water, and spices. And don't forget the balancing power of Ayurvedic teas! Our [Raja's Cup](https://mapi.com/products/rajas-cup) comes with antioxidant power as well as rich coffee-like flavor. Our delicious, therapeutic [Herbal Teas](https://mapi.com/collections/herbal-teas) have balancing effects ranging from calming and cooling to soothing worries and helping with sleep. For Vata and Pitta-predominant types, try a cup of Organic Vata Tea, or boiled milk at bedtime. Try boiling milk with a slice of fresh ginger, or blended with a spoonful of [Organic Rose Petal Spread](https://mapi.com/products/organic-rose-petal-spread). Alternatively, try it with our Organic Vata Tea (Vata Milk), or with a pinch of cardamom or nutmeg to aid sleep.
