Mind and body practices focus on the interactions among the brain, mind, body, and behavior. There are many types of meditation, but most have four elements in common: a quiet location with as few distractions as possible; a specific, comfortable posture (sitting, lying down, walking, or in other positions); a focus of attention (a specially chosen word or set of words, an object, or the sensations of the breath); and an open attitude (letting distractions come and go naturally without judging them). Mindfulness is a state of mind where you are fully present in the current moment. When you practice mindfulness, you are aware of your thoughts, feelings, sensations and environment and accept them without judgment.
