Indications for a role of LAG-3 in APC DISCUSSION Toll factor NFtumor necrosis factor WTwild-type9SUMMARYLymphocyte activation gene-3 the structural homologue of a well-knownTCR co-receptor CD4. Recently, it has been suggested that LAG-3 might play a role inmodulation of immune response, by being a negative regulator of T cell activation.To further characterize its expression and function in the immune system, monoclonalAbs were generated against mouse LAG-3. The availability of different mAbs allowedthe identification of LAG-3 on various immune subpopulations.The main finding of this work is that, unlike previously thought, LAG-3 expression is notlimited to activated T and NK cells, but can also be induced on B cells and DCs. B cellswere found to express LAG-3 in a T cell dependent manner; LAG-3 was expressed on Bcells in the presence of activated T cells, but not upon stimulation with thymusindependent stimuli like CpG or LPS. Furthermore, requirements for LAG-3 inductionon B cells were defined; this event requires B cells proliferation and is mediated by asoluble factor released by activated T cells.Among DCs, two populations, ('myeloid') and plasmacytoid DCs, expressed surface LAG-3 upon stimulation with LPS and CpGs, respectively.To evaluate the potential role of LAG-3 in APC function, LAG-3 deficient and OT-IItransgenic mice were used. Antigen presentation assay showed, that LAG-3 presence onthe surface of APC can affect T cell responses. T cells stimulated with OVA peptidepresented by LAG-3 deficient B cells proliferated poorly compared to T cell stimulatedwith OVA-pulsed LAG-3 positive B cells. This finding suggests a novel co-stimulatoryfunction of LAG-3 on APCs.In addition, experiments re-evaluating published data concerning the role of LAG-3 on Tcells were performed. In agreement with previous reports, the ectopic expression ofLAG-3 on the surface of T cell line exerted an inhibitory effect on T cell activationinduced by relevant antigen. However, in disagreement with recent report (by Huang etal. 2004), the standard regulatory cell assays performed with normal as well as LAG-3deficient CD4+CD25+ cells, suggested no involvement of LAG-3 in regulatory T cellfunction.10Furthermore, the experiments demonstrating the surface expression on murine CD4 andCD8 T cells in vivo are presented. LAG-3 was identified on homeostatically expanding Tcells after transfer into lymphopenic mice.To investigate structural aspects of the LAG-3 molecule, soluble LAG-3 (sLAG-3),composed of four extracellular domains was produced. For this purpose Drosophilaexpression system was employed. The conditions were developed for production of twoforms of sLAG-3, the original glycosylated form and its non-glycosylated version.Biochemical analysis of soluble protein showed that in solution LAG-3 forms stabledimers, which suggests the presence of such dimers on cell surface. Becauseheterogenous glycosylation of WT form likely prevents protein crystallization, attemptsare now made to crystallize non-glycosylated form of sLAG-3 alone or in complex withits ligand, MHC class II. The detailed structural information would significantly enhanceour knowledge about LAG-3 and allow for rational drug design, if desired.111. INTRODUCTION1.1 The Immune SystemThe immune system of our body is responsible for protection against the myriad ofpotentially pathogenic microorganisms that inhabit the world we live in. It is anorganization of cells and molecules with specialized roles, which work around the clockin many different ways.In an adult organism, the cells of the immune system originate in the bone marrow, wheremany of them also mature. Others, like T cell progenitors, need to migrate to the thymusto undergo maturation. They then leave these primary lymphoid organs to patrol thetissues by circulating in the blood and in a specialized structure called the lymphaticsystem. Organized lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes (LN) and spleen as well asPeyer's patches of the intestine and tonsils, called secondary lymphoid organs, are theplace where the initiation of the adaptive immune responses occurs. Variousmacromolecules or any foreign substance (such as virus, bacteria or protein) able to elicitimmune responses in the body are termed antigens. The responses to antigens present inthe lymph are mounted in lymph nodes while the spleen is a site of the induction ofimmune responses to antigens in the blood stream.There are two fundamentally different arms of the immune system: the innate and theadaptive responses. Both are tightly linked and work in concert to eliminate the pathogen.The innate immunity is the less specific component, which provides the first line ofdefense against infections. Most of its 'weapons' are present before the onset of infectionso it can act very fast. It has the property of pattern recognition, an ability to recognize aclass of molecules unique to microbes. Phagocytic cells (such as macrophages andneutrophils), anatomic barriers (such as skin and mucous membranes), physiologicfactors (temperature, low pH, chemical mediators) and a variety of antimicrobialcompounds synthesized by the host, all play important roles in innate immunity.12The adaptive immunity is aimed at the particular antigen, but the primary response takeslonger (five to six days) to develop. It involves the proliferation of antigen-specific B andT cells, which occurs when the surface receptors of these cells recognize the relevantantigen. Specialized cells display the antigen to lymphocytes and collaborate with themin the response to antigen. The adaptive immunity possesses the remarkable property ofmemory manifested by faster and stronger attack upon secondary encounter with theantigen that induced the primary response. It is also capable of discriminating self fromnon-self (the foreign particle) or altered-self (a cell infected by a virus or a cancerouscell), which prevents it to be aggressive against the own tissue.1.1.1 Players of adaptive immunityThe key players of adaptive immunity are B cells and T cells. For a proper immuneresponse, however, they need assistance from Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs).B cells produce Immunoglobulins (Igs, also called antibodies), and manage humoral (thatis pertaining to extracellular fluid) immunity, while T cells are non antibody-producinglymphocytes and constitute the basis of cell-mediated immunity.1.1.1.1 B lymphocytesB lymphocytes are generated in the bone marrow and migrate to the periphery as short-lived and functionally immature cells. Through the blood stream they reach the spleenwhere they develop into long-lived mature B cells (Carsetti et al., 2004; Rolink et al.,2004). Each B cell expresses a unique antigen binding receptor (B- cell receptor or BCR)on their surface. BCR is a membrane-bound Ig molecule consisting of two identicalheavy (H) chains and two identical light (L) chains that are held together by disulfidebonds and non-covalent interactions. It is associated with two trans-membrane proteinsIg- and Ig-, which are crucial for triggering downstream signaling pathways. Eachchain of the antibody folds into a series of compact domains of similar structure, the so-called immunoglobulin fold (Ig fold). This structure of approximately 110 amino acidsconsists of a \"sandwich\" of two -pleated sheets, each containing anti/parallel strands,which are connected by loops of various lengths (Frazer and Capra, 1999).13When a na\u00efve B cell first encounters its specific antigen, the binding of the antigen to theBCR causes the cell to divide rapidly and undergo differentiation into antibody-secretingB cells (also called plasma cells) and memory B cells.Depending on the nature of antigen, the B-cell activation proceeds by two differentroutes: thymus dependent (TD) or thymus independent (TI). TD antibody responses toprotein antigens require antigen-specific T cell help in the form of surface molecules'interactions as well as secretion of soluble factors. Microbial repetitivedeterminants (like lipopolysaccharides, polysaccharides, lipoprotein A) can stimulatena\u00efve B cells on their own and thus are thymus independent. The TI antigens can befurther divided into two TI-2 able tocrosslink Toll-like (TLRs). TI-1 antigens, for example LPS, can cause thepolyclonal proliferation and differentiation of many B cells regardless of their antigenicspecificity.Mature B cells can be subdivided into at least 3 groups: B2 B cells, B1 B cells and themariginal zone B cells;- B2 B cellsB2 B cells, the conventional B cells, constitute the majority of B cells found in spleen andlymph nodes. This pool of B cells is constantly replenished by differentiation ofprogenitor cells in the bone marrow (Rolink et al., 2004). B2 B cells produce high affinityantibodies after they have been stimulated, expanded and selected in germinal centers inthe presence of T cell help (Carsetti et al., 2004; Fagarasan et al., 2000). They can giverise to memory B cells as well as plasma cells.- B1 B cellsB1 cells arise before B2 cells and compose about 5% of B cell population. B1 B cells,originally defined by the surface expression of CD5 molecule and high levels of IgM,have a capacity for self-renewal (Herzenberg et al., 1986; Marcos et al., 1989). They aredominant in the peritoneal and pleural cavities, rare in the spleen and extremely rare inlymph nodes (Forster et al., 1991; Hayakawa et al., 1985; Herzenberg and Kantor, 1993).They exhibit different variable heavy chain repertoire and Ig specificities, compared to14B2 cells (Fagarasan et al., 2000). B1 B cells are the source of so-called natural antibodiesthat are pre-existing or produced during early phase of infection. These antibodies, thatappear to be produced in a T-cell independent manner (Fagarasan and Honjo, 2000), tendto have a low affinity and broad specificities (Carsetti et al., 2004; Lalor and Morahan,1990). B1 B cell subpopulation recognizes common bacterial pathogens and plays animportant role in mucosal immunity. But the antibodies produced by B1 B cells oftenreact to self-antigens (Berland and mariginal zone B cellsMariginal zone (MZ) B cells are the B cells residing in the splenic mariginal zone, thejunction of white and red pulp. They have a distinct surface phenotype, including higherexpression of complement receptors and IgM (Oliver et al., 1997). MZ B cells play animportant role in T-independent antibody responses (Fagarasan and Honjo, 2000). Theymore rapidly express activation markers and co-stimulatory molecules than conventionalB cells. In some aspects they resemble peritoneal B1 cells. They participate very early inimmune responses and are very sensitive to LPS stimulation, which can induce their rapiddifferentiation into plasma cells (Martin and Kearney, 2000; Oliver et al., 1997).1.1.1.2. T lymphocytesT cells also derive from cells of the bone marrow, but their precursors migrate to thethymus gland to mature. During maturation a T cell comes to express the T cell receptor(TCR) on its surface. And it is in the thymus, where the T cells-to-be learn how todistinguish self from non-self, and where the useless cells (the cells not able to recognizeanything) are eliminated (von Boehmer et al., 1989).Unlike BCRs, TCRs are produced only as transmembrane molecules. A TCR unitconsists of / or / heterodimer in complex with CD3 components. Only as such it canplay its role in T cell activation. The antigen-binding site is formed by the combinationof N-terminal Ig-like domains of the / or / dimers, while C-terminal Ig-like domainsare constant for each type of TCR chain. CD3 complex consists of the CD3 , and chains associated with a homodimer of chains or a heterodimer of and chains andprovides the connection to the intracellular signalling machinery.15In contrast to BCR, which can recognize antigen alone, TCR can recognize it only inthe form of antigenic peptides that are bound to the major histocompatibility (MHC)molecules, polymorphic glycoproteins found on cell membrane. The ability of T cells torecognize antigen exclusively in the context of MHC is called MHC restriction. When aT cell encounters its specific antigen presented by MHC, it proliferates and differentiatesinto effector T cells and memory T cells. T cellsThere are two well defined subpopulations of T cells: helper T cells and cytotoxiccells and two less well defined subpopulations of regulatory T cells and natural killer Tcells.- Helper T cellsHelper T cells (Th) express the CD4 glycoprotein surface molecule and thus are alsoknown as CD4 T cells. CD4 is an accessory molecule (often called co-receptor)facilitating interactions of T cells with MHC class II, due to its specific affinity for MHCclass II molecules. CD4 T cells can recognize the antigen only when it is presented in theMHC class II context (in other words, they are MHC class II restricted). The antigenicpeptides presented on MHC class II derive mainly from exogenous proteins acquired byendocytosis.Besides stabilizing T cell- MHC class II bearing cell interactions, CD4 molecule maymediate signal transduction, thereby promoting the subsequent functional responses. CD4T cell activation is tightly controlled; by MHC class II restriction and by limiting theexpression of MHC class II on the cells of the body. MHC class II is expressed only onspecialized cells, called antigen presenting cells (APCs).After a T helper cell recognizes and interacts with peptide-MHC class II complex it getsactivated and gives rise to a clone of effector cells that secrete various cytokines. Thesecytokines play an important role in activating other cells that participate in the response.They are needed for optimal protection and they may also reduce allergic andautoimmune responses (Delves and Roitt, 2000; Gately et al., et 1997).16The differences in pattern of cytokines produced by CD4 T cells result in distinctresponses. Based on the cytokines they produce, CD4 effector T fall into twofunctional The Th1 cells produce Interleukin-2 (IL-2),Interferon- (IFN-) and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that have an effect on theproduction of opsonizing and complement-fixing antibodies, activate macrophages,support inflammation and activate T cells. Th2 response, on the other hand, involves theproduction of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9 and IL-13 and induces strong antibody responses,favors eosinophil differentiation and activation, but inhibits phagocytic cells (Abbas etal., 1996; Mosmann et al., 1986; Romagnani, But more cytokine patterns arepossible; T cells expressing Th1 as well as Th2 cytokines have been designated as type 0(Th0), while T cells producing high amounts of TGF have been termed as type 3(Th3)(reviewed in (Romagnani, in the form of heterodimer or homodimer, and therefore are also called CD8 T cells. CD8 molecule,by binding to MHC class I, serves as adhesion molecule and as enhancer ofsignal transduction. CD8 T cells are MHC class I restricted and since MHC class I, unlikeMHC class II, is expressed virtually on all nucleated cells of the body, any cell can markitself as a CD8 cell target. These cells display peptides derived from intracellular proteinson their surface in the context of MHC class I all the time. A cell becomes a target whena foreign, for example viral, peptide is presented on the cell surface. Under the influenceof Th1 derived cytokines, a CD8 T cell recognizing an antigen- MHC class I complexproliferates and differentiates into an effector cell. CTL can kill the infected cell in atleast two different ways; (1) perforin/granzyme pathway or (2) (Delves 2000; Kagi et al., 1994).- Regulatory cellsRegulatory T cells (T regs) represent the minor subpopulation of T cells that are thoughtto perform a specialized role in controlling both the innate and adaptive immunity (Maloyand Powrie, 2001; Maloy et al., 2003; Sakaguchi et They are able to actively17suppress self-reactivity of lymphocytes or their excessive response to pathogen, both ofwhich can cause damage to the host (Sakaguchi et al., 2001). Specifically, T regs includethose that are able to suppress na\u00efve T-cell proliferation in vitro and to control CD4+ andCD8+ T cell numbers in vivo in lymphopenic host (O'Garra and Vieira, 2004).There is no clear-cut definition of suppressor cells, but in recent years the evidence hasaccumulated that CD4+ CD25+ cells can perform such a function. The CD4+CD25+subset of T cells represents 5-10% of the CD4+ T lymphocytes in healthy human andmice. Their development and function depends on the forkhead/winged transcriptionfactor Foxp3. Foxp3 is restricted to Tregs and is expressed in these cells irrespective oftheir state of activation. Moreover, it was demonstrated that ectopic expression of Foxp3confers suppressor function on peripheral CD4+CD25- T cells (Fontenot et al., 2003;Hori et al., 2003). In contrast, the induction of CD25 expression by stimulating CD4+CD25- cells with anti-CD3, mitogens, or specific antigen does not render the stimulatedcells suppressive (Shevach et al., 2001).T regs require TCR triggering in order to be suppressive in vitro. But, although theiractivation is antigen specific, once activated these cells inhibit both CD4+ and CD8+responses in an antigen non-specific manner (Takahashi et al., 1998; Thornton andShevach, 2000). Interestingly, the suppression of T cell proliferation by T regs does notinvolve killing of the responder cells and is mediated through a cell contact dependentmechanism (Maloy and Powrie, 2001; Shevach et al., 2001). The cell surface moleculesinvolved in T reg - T responder interaction, however, remain to be characterized.Furthermore, regulatory cells do not prevent the initial steps of responder T cellactivation (the expression of early activation markers is not affected), but the activatedcells fail to proliferate due to cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 stage (Thornton and Shevach,2000).- NK T cellsNatural killer T cells (NK T cells) are a distinct population with certain phenotypiccharacteristics of NK cells (see below), but also express CD4 and intermediate levels ofTCR with a highly restricted repertoire of specificities. These cells recognize antigen18presented by the non-classic MHC molecule CD1 and may have an immunoregulatoryrole, because they can secrete IL-4 and IFN- (Burdin and Kronenberg, 1999). T cellsIn human and mice, T cells represent a small percentage (less than 5%) of thelymphocytes in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes andspleen and in circulation), but they are a major population (up to 70%) in the mucosalepithelia (Hayday et al., 2000). During development in the thymus T cells appearbefore T cells. They are recruited and expand in response to various infections inhumans and rodents (Bukowski et al., 1999). The vast majority of T cells are CD4 andCD8 negative (Fisher and Ceredig, 1991). TCRs are of and canrecognize unprocessed ligands and even nonproteinacious phospholigands directly,without a requirement presentation on MHC (Kaufmann, 1996). The role of cellsin the immune system, however, is still enigmatic.1.1.1.3. Antigen Presenting CellsAntigen Presenting Cells (APCs) are specialized cells characterized by the expression ofMHC class II on their surface and the ability to deliver co-stimulatory signals required forT cell activation. APCs include Dendritic Cells (DCs), macrophages and B cells.T cells require two types of signals from APC for activation and subsequentdifferentiation into an effector cell. First one is an antigen-specific signal provided byinteractions between the TCR and antigenic peptide presented by MHC molecules onAPC. The second signal (co-stimulation) is antigen-independent and mediated byengagement of the T cell surface molecule CD28 with the members of B7 family (likeB7-1/CD80; B7-2/CD86) on the APC.Molecular events leading to T cell activation occur in a so-called immunological synapsebetween T cell and APC (Figure 1.1). This synapse has a complex supramolecularstructure containing many different cell surface proteins whose individual functions arenot yet completely understood.19- Dendritic CellsDendritic cells are 'professional' antigen presenting cells, i.e. they are specialized for theuptake, processing, transport and presentation of antigens to T cells. They are sparselydistributed in non-lymphoid tissue, but have a distinct migratory capability (Hart, 1997;Matzinger, 1994; Steinman, 1991). Recruitment of DCs from the bone marrow intoperipheral non-lymphoid tissues as well as migration of mature DCs from the peripheryinto the lymphoid tissues are coordinated by chemotactic cytokines (chemokines).Chemokines interact with corresponding receptors on DCs (Hackstein and Thomson,2004). Figure 1.1 Overview of a mature T cells synapse. The key ligand pairs and signalingmolecules that are involved in T cell recognition are shown. The MHC moleculepresenting the stimulatory peptide is shown in red, activating molecules are blue, B7family surface molecules in pink, inhibitory molecules are yellow and molecules that arenot contributing to signaling are shown in grey (Huppa and Davis, 2003).DCs arise from the bone marrow progenitor cells or blood monocytes and differentiateinto immature DCs (Banchereau et al., 2000). At 'immature ' stage of development DCsact as sentinels in peripheral tissues or circulate in blood continuously sampling theenvironment. They are already capable of antigen uptake and processing, but yet areunable to activate T cells due to low level of expression of surface MHC class II20molecules and lack of expression of co-stimulatory molecules (Shortman and Liu, 2002)((Hackstein and Thomson, 2004). At the encounter with the 'danger' signal (for examplemicrobial products or tissue damage), the antigen processed and displayed on the DCsurface as peptide MHC complex is stabilized by decreasing MHC class II turnover, andthe maturation and concomitant migration of DCs to LN takes place. On the way,maturing DCs down-regulate endocytic activity and up-regulate the co-stimulatorymolecules that are required for effective interactions with T cells (like CD40, CD80 andCD86) (Banchereau et al., 2000; Cella et al., 1997). This process is accompanied by theproduction of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12 and TNF (Hackstein andThomson, 2004). DC maturation can be elicited by numerous stimuli; (1) by endogenousfactors that are released by necrotic cells (for example, heat shock proteins), (2) byexogenous microbial products including lipopolysaccharide, LPS, peptidoglycans or CpGrich DNA, that bind to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or other pattern recognition receptors,(3) by pro-inflammatory cytokines that are produced by bystander cells (like TNF), and(4) by activated T cells expressing ligands for like CD40ligand (CD40 L/ CD154) (reviewed in (Hackstein and Thomson, 2004)).After migration to the LNs, the mature DCs efficiently trigger an immune response byactivating T cell with the receptor specific for the foreign peptide-MHC complex presenton the DC surface (Shortman and Liu, 2002). In addition to the interactions with T cells,DCs interact with other cell types including B cells and NK cells present in the lymphoidorgans. Alternatively, DCs might also remain in peripheral tissues and act as mediators ofinflammation.Besides the insult-induced migration, DCs show continuous low-level migration fromperiphery to LNs. These DCs are not activated and, since immature DCs trigger T cellanergy rather than activation, they probably contribute to the peripheral tolerance of Tcells (Inaba et al., 1998; Probst et al., 2003).DCs are not a homogenous population, but comprise of at least five different subtypesrelated to their origin, differentiation state and their specific location. The functionalsignificance of this heterogeneity is currently under intense study.211.1.1.4. Natural Killer CellsNatural Killer (NK) cells are another class of lymphocytes that posses a potent cytolyticactivity. Because they lack antigen specific receptors, NK are defined as a component ofthe innate immune system, but they were also shown to participate directly in adaptiveimmune responses, mainly by interacting with dendritic cells (Raulet, 2004). Also, NKcells produce a number of cytokines, especially IFN-, and therefore are important forimmune regulation and influence both innate and adaptive immunity.NK cells destroy infected and malignant cells. To identify target cells NK cells use lessspecific broad-spectrum receptors (Wang et al., 1997), one kind of which are the Fcreceptors. Fc receptors on the surface of NK cells link them to antibody (IgG) coatedtarget cells, which are then killed by a process called antibody-dependent cellularcytotoxicity (ADCC). The second system of recognition involves the killer-activating andkiller-inhibitory receptors. The killer-activating receptors recognize a number of differentmolecules present on the surface of nucleated cells, whereas the killer-inhibitoryreceptors recognize MHC class I molecules (Moretta et al., 1997) (Lanier, 1998). If theactivating receptors are engaged, the NK cell becomes cytotoxic, but this signal isnormally overridden by an inhibitory receptor upon recognition of MHC class I molecule.Cells without MHC class I on their surface (the loss of which can be a consequence ofviral infection or malignant transformation) are unable to activate inhibitory receptorsand thus are killed (Moretta and Moretta, 2004).1.1.2. an adult mammal the total number of lymphocytes remains steady throughout ananimal's life, thanks to a \"return tendency, due to a density-dependent process tomaintain a stationary distribution of population densities\" et al., 2000).New lymphocytes are continually being produced in primary and secondary lymphoidorgans, and old or useless cells are continually being eliminated (Rathmell, 2004).Because the potential to produce new cells exceeds the number needed to replenishperipheral pools, the new cells must compete with resident ones for survival signals and22resources (Freitas and Rocha, 2000). Since each lymphocyte has a different Ag-bindingreceptor, the decision about which cell survives and which dies shapes the repertoire ofthe immunocompetent cells. Thus the homeostatic control of cell number provides one ofthe mechanisms of lymphocyte selection.The homeostatic control of cell number is also important after the antigenic challenge.After an infection, there are bursts of cellular proliferation, but once the infectious agentis eliminated, the number of cells returns to the state before the infection (Gaudin et al.,2004). This is a result of death of most of the activated cells, with a small fractionsurviving as memory cells. The number of long-lived memory cells also must be limitedin order to preserve the diversity of repertoire (Grossman et al., 2004).The mechanisms of such immunoregulation are complex and act at different stages of theimmune response. Both membrane-bound molecules (receptors, co-receptors) and solublefactors (cytokines) are involved in homeostatic regulation.1.1.3. T cell responsesThere are 4 steps to the T cell response; activation - during which the cell receives'instructions' in the form of antigenic stimulation, followed by a burst-like expansion (thenumbers of activated cells increase rapidly), which after reaching a plateau (upon antigenclearance) eventually decreases - contraction, a process accompanied by a massive celldeath and memory cell development.The engagement of TCRs and co-stimulatory proteins on the surface of T cells leads toactivation. Signal transduction pathways associated with T cell activation includecascades of kinase signalling, Ca2+ -mediated and small G -protein mediated pathways(Lin and Weiss, 2001). The combination of those initiates proliferation of cells andmakes them receptive to stimulatory signals delivered through IL-2 receptor. They alsoinduce production of cytokines such as IL-2 (June et al., 1990), which act in an autocrinefashion to support further division of activated cells (Marrack et al., 2000).The activated T cells differentiate into a variety of cell fates. For example, CD8 T cellsbecome CTLs, capable of killing virus-infected cells. CD4 T cells polarize toward Th1 orTh2 and mediate protection from intracellular or extracellular pathogens.23Yet, activated T cells are short lived. The process of elimination of effector cells is drivenby several different pathways, among them, Fas-FasL (Ettinger et al., Abbas, or tumor necrosisfactor (TNF) receptor (Sytwu et al., 1996; Zheng et al., 1995) and another way triggeredby reactive oxygen species produced within the activated cell (Hildeman et al., 1999).Other control mechanisms include (1) competition for growth and viability signals (theproduction of cytokines by activated lymphocytes and APCs decreases once antigen iseliminated)(Ahmed and Gray, 1996) (Freitas and Rocha, 2000), (2) competition foraccess to APCs or peptide-MHC ligands (Grossman et al., 2004), (3) elimination of APCby cytotoxic T cells (Wong and Pamer, 2003), and (4) by specializedregulatory cells (Maloy and Powrie, 2001; Shevach, 2000).Interestingly, the rapid disappearance of activated T cells during the contraction phasedoes not affect the number of na\u00efve nor memory cell pools (Marrack et al., 2000).Only 5-10% of antigen specific population survives the contraction phase of primaryimmune response and is maintained indefinitely for years (Masopust et al., 2004). Thesememory cells provide immediate protection and generate more rapid and effectiveresponses when again encountering the antigen (Ahmed and Gray, 1996; Dutton et al.,1998; Zinkernagel et al., 1996).The regulation of T cell activation and effector T cell expansion during immuneresponses is essential for maintenance of T cell homeostasis.Many surface molecules have been identified that participate in the activation of a T cell;such as CD28, OX 40, 4-1 BB, LFA-1 by (Marrack et al., 2000)(Watts and DeBenedette, 1999)), but few are known that are important for termination ofactivatory signals.A well-documented example of a molecule important for down-regulation of T cellresponses is cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 and Allison,1995; Walunas et ofthe et al., CD28 isconstitutively expressed on both activated and na\u00efve T cells (Gross et al., 1990), CTLA-4is absent in na\u00efve T cells, but is readily detectable on the cell surface within 24 hrs ofstimulation, with maximal expression at 2-3 days post-stimulation (Lindsten et al., 1993;24Linsley et al., 1992) (Linsley et al., 1992). After appearing on the cell surface CTLA-4competes favourably with its homologue CD28 for B7 because of asignificantly higher avidity for B7 (Greene et al., 1996; van der Merwe et al., 1997).CTLA-4 deficient mice show a strong phenotype. Their T cells proliferate massively,which leads to enlarged lymph nodes and spleen, multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration anddeath within 3 to 4 weeks after birth, showing that indeed CTLA-4 is vital forlymphocyte homeostasis (Tivol et al., 1995; Waterhouse et al., 1995).Recently, another molecule was identified and suggested to play an inhibitory role in Tcell activation - Lymphocyte Activation Gene-3. Characterization of LAG-3 surfacemolecule is the topic of this thesis (for detailed information on Lymphocyte ActivationGene-3 see section 1.2).1.1.4. T cell-B cell collaboration in B cell responsesThe cooperation among the components of the adaptive immunity is absolutely requiredfor efficient antibody production in response to antigenic challenge.Ag-specific B cell - T cell interactions occur within defined areas of secondary lymphoidorgans, namely the edges of the T and B cell zones (Garside et al., 1998; Goodnow,1997). In the white pulp of the spleen, T cells are arranged in the T-cell area around acentral arteriola and make up the periarterial lymphatic sheath (PALS). B cells collect inthe primary follicles surrounding PALS and in the mariginal zone, external to the follicles(Timens, 1991; Witmer and Steinman, 1984).According to the two-phase B cell activation model it is the second phase of the B cellactivation cascade, characterized by the germinal center reaction, that is T cell dependent.The initial Ag-specific B cell activation is induced in secondary lymphoid tissues, bybinding of antigens to the BCR. At the same time as initial activation and clonalexpansion of B cells takes place, T cell activation and expansion occurs driven by theirinteractions with professional APC, that provide all signals necessary for T cellstimulation (Baumgarth, 2000) (Figure 1.2, Phase 1).Because DCs very efficiently focus and transport antigens from peripheral tissues to Tcells zones of secondary lymphoid tissues, and are potent activators of T cells(Banchereau and Steinman, 1998), it is generally thought that T cell are initially activated25by DCs in response to tissue localized antigens, while splenic B cells may be theinitiating APC for blood-borne antigens (Mills and Cambier 2003).Na\u00efve B cells do not collaborate effectively with T cells, but antigen encounter preparesthem to activate T cells and to receive T cell-derived help signals. Within minutes afterBCR triggering, BCR-antigen complex is internalized and antigenic peptide presented inthe MHC class II context (Siemasko and Clark, 2001). Concomitantly, B cells increasethe expression of cell-surface molecules important for productive interaction with T cells,including CD80/CD86 (B7.1/B7.2) and MHC class II. Antigen-specific B cells thenmove to the edge of the follicles and undergo cognate stimulatory interactions withantigen activated T cells. The B cells subsequently become primary antibody formingcells (AFCs) or precursors destined for the germinal center (GC) (Figure 1.2, Phase II)(Manser, 2004)Besides Ag peptide-MHC complex - TCR interplay, several membrane molecules areinvolved in the generation of TD humoral responses, of which a TNF receptor familymember - CD40 interaction with its ligand-CD40L (CD154) plays the pivotal role. CD40is constitutively expressed on mature B cells and upon aggregation triggers a number ofintracellular signaling pathways leading to clonal expansion, germinal center formation,affinity maturation, and generation of long-lived plasma cells (Bishop and Hostager,2001; Garside et al., 1998). Interestingly, the CD40L is expressed at high levels primarilyon the surface of activated T cells particularly following CD80/86 mediated CD28 co-receptor signaling. This demonstrates, that CD40 signal transduction is tightly regulatedby ligand availability and normally occurs after B cells have encountered cognateantigens and contacted antigen-specific CD4+ T cells (Mills and Cambier, 2003).Activated B cells can reciprocally trigger cognate T cells to clonally expand anddifferentiate (Quezada et al., 2004). It was shown that the induction of optimal levels of Tcell priming to a protein Ag requires the involvement of Ag-specific B cells (Constant,1999).Although contact-mediated signals are critical for productive T-B cell collaborations, Tcells produce soluble factors that are important for B cell differentiation as well. One ofthe best characterized of these cytokines is IL-4. It enhances B cell survival, primes themfor MHC class II signaling, increases expression of co-stimulatory molecules and26prepares them for maturation steps (Nelms et al., 1999). Other T cell-derived cytokinesinvolved in B cell differentiation include IL-2, IL-3, IL-6 and IL-10 (Mills and Cambier,2003) (Coffman et al., 1988). The B cell responsiveness to the cytokine signals, however,was shown to occur only after stimulation of their cell membrane molecules by activatedT cells (Bartlett et al., 1990). Figure 1.2. Helper T-cell regulated B-cell differentiation. The response begins withmigration of activated DC to the LN and triggering of na\u00efve T cell (Synapse I). At thesame time B cell get activated either by soluble antigen or antigen-bearing DC. Followingclonal expansion, antigen activated T cells contact antigen-specific B cells at thefollicular border (Synapse II). At this point B cell undergoes one of two differentiationoptions, either to become short-lived plasma cell and progress into T cell area or to formsecondary follicle in the B-cell zone. The interaction involving germinal center (GC) Thcells and GC B cells (Synapse III) is critical for late stages of B cell development leadingto formation of high affinity antibody producing plasma cell and memory cell.Adapted from M.G. Mc Hayzer-Williams, Current Opinion in Immunology (McHeyzer-Williams, 2003).The last phase of TD response, the GC reaction, begins when GC precursor B cellsmigrate back to a follicle and rapidly proliferate within the environment provided byfollicular DCs (FDCs). In spite of their name FDCs are not related to the T zone DCs.They are specialized stromal cells possessing the ability to hold the antigen on their 27surface in an unprocessed form for very long periods of time (Park and Choi, 2005; Liu etal., 1996a).The events occurring in GC (Figure 1.2, Phase III) are described in more detail below.- Germinal Center reactionTD B-cell stimulation continues within germinal centers. There, B cells undergo somatichypermutation with affinity maturation, resulting in secretion of antibodies with anincreased affinity for antigen, as well as Ig class switching (Berek et al., 1991; Jacob etal., 1991; Liu et al., 1996b).During B cell proliferation in the follicle, in the so-called dark zone, the gene segmentscoding for the antigen-binding site of the antibody are mutated at high frequency,resulting in the generation of diverse progeny (Manser, 2004). This process, calledsomatic hypermutation, greatly contributes to antibody diversity (Brenner and Milstein,1966) (Tonegawa, 1983). The rapidly dividing B cells of the dark zone are termedcentroblasts and are characterized by low surface BCR. They then exit the cell cycle andmigrate to FDC-rich GC area that also contains CD4 T cells, termed the light zone. Thelight zone B cells, called centrocytes, will die unless are provided with survival signals byFDC that retain antigen on their surface (Rajewsky, 1996; Wagner and Neuberger, 1996).Only the centrocytes, which express mutant BCRs with high affinity for the antigensurvive (this process is termed affinity maturation). Later they re-enter centroblast pool orprocess and present antigen to GC T cells. The latter results in the induction of H chainclass switching, and differentiation to antibody secreting plasma cells or to long-livedmemory cells (Manser, 2004). The mature na\u00efve B cells express surface Ig of the IgMand IgD class (Pernis and Forni, 1976), the class switch recombination (CSR) howeverleads to the production of Abs that are better suited to achieve certain biologicalfunction(s). During CSR immunoglobulin heavy chain constant gene segment C\u00b5 isreplaced by C, C and C, switching immunoglobulin isotype from IgM to IgG, IgE andIgA, respectively (Honjo et al., 2002). IgM, besides representing the major membrane-bound form of immunoglobulin expressed by mature B cells, is mainly secreted (as apentamer) in primary immune responses, it activates complement and phagocytic cells.IgG is the most abundant class in serum, it is the major type of Abs secreted during28secondary immune responses. IgA (a dimer or tetramer) is predominant in externalsecretions such as milk, saliva, tears and gastrointestinal tract mucous. It is a first line ofdefense at mucous membrane surfaces, which are entry sites for most pathogenicorganisms. IgE activates mast cells and basophils via Fc receptors. This class is importantfor parasite immunity, but also can cause allergies. No biological function has beenidentified for IgD yet.1.2. Lymphocyte Activation Gene-31.2.1. Identification and the predicted structureLymphocyte activation gene - 3 (LAG-3 /CD223) was first identified as a cell surfacemolecule selectively expressed in activated human NK and T lymphocytes (Baixeras etal., 1992; Triebel et al., 1990). Interestingly, it was found to be related to CD4 at bothgene and protein level. The two genes are located next to each other in human and mousegenomes (on chromosome 12 in human and chromosome 6 in mice). Actually, Lag-3gene is located within the enhancer region of the CD4 gene. Furthermore, CD4 and LAG-3 have a very similar intron/exon organization. It has been, therefore, suggested that theymight have evolved from the common ancestor (Huard et al., 1994a). The overall aminoacid sequence similarity of LAG-3 with CD4 is barely above the background level(< 20% sequence identity) but there are notable patches of identity with stretches ofamino acid sequences and the two proteins probably share structural homology at theirfour extracellular Ig-like domains (Figure 1.3). However, regionsclearly have diverged (Huard et al., 1994a; Triebel et al., 1990). The amino acidsequences of intracellular tails of CD4 and LAG-3 are compared in Figure 1.4.Mouse LAG-3 shows 70% protein sequence identity to its human homologue. Allputative structurally important residues are well conserved thus predicting the samefolding pattern (Mastrangeli et al., 1996). Also, the RGD motif in D1 domain isconserved in human and mouse. RGD motif can be recognized by integrins and thusmodulate cell adhesion (D'Souza et al., 1991). The mouse LAG-3 cDNA and proteinsequence, including all the special features of LAG-3 are shown in Figure 1.5.29Figure 1.3. The predicted structure of LAG-3 is very similar to the structure of CD4.Both proteins contain four immunoglobulin-like domains, a stretch of hydrophobictransmembrane residues and a cytoplasmic tail. The LAG-3 molecule is slightly biggerwith predicted molecular weight of 70 kDa, as compared to 55 kDa of CD4. The amino-terminal domain, D1, of LAG-3 contains a unique looplike insertion. Figure 1.4.

Yetit has three distinguishable motifs: potential motif (red) Glutamic acid-Proline (EP) rich region (in pink). All threemotifs are conserved between human and mouse (Mastrangeli et al., 1996).RKQLLLRRFSALEHGIQPFPAQRKIEELERELETEMGQEPEPEPEPQLEPEPRQLLAG ICCD4 ICCRHQQRQAARMSQIKRLLSEKKTCQCPHRMQKSHNLIlcklapD1D2D3D4D1D2D3D4CD4LAG-3NH2NH2 COOHCOOH30Figure 1. 5.

(Yan and Lennarz, 2005)).The immunoprecipitation experiments on human activated 70 treatmentmobility from 70 kDa to 60 kDa was observed (Baixeras et al., 1992). Mouse LAG-3 protein sequence contains five potential N-glycosylation sites, of which 3 (Figure 1.5)overlap with human counterparts (Mastrangeli et al., 1996), but so far there have been noreports that any of them is used.The close relationship between LAG-3 and CD4 has been strengthened by thedemonstration that both share the same ligand, which is MHC class II molecules on thesurface of antigen presenting cells (APC) (Baixeras et al., 1992). However, LAG-3 wasshown to bind MHC class II with much higher avidity (at least 100 fold) suggesting thatit might act as natural competitor of CD4 (Huard et al., 1995; Workman et al., 2002b).This notion was supported by experiments showing that LAG-3 can interfere with MHCclass II-CD4 interaction (Hannier et al., 1998; Huard et al., 1996; Huard et al., 1995;Huard et al., 1994b), although LAG-3 and CD4 binding sites on MHC class II do notoverlap (Baixeras et al., 1992).Most of the residues that are essential for interactions with MHC class II proteins areclustered at the base of the extra-loop structure in the LAG-3 D1 domain. The deletion ofthe loop itself also affects MHC class II adhesion. D2 domain is required for successfulLAG-3 - MHC class II interactions as well. It is either involved in the binding itself, or inpositioning of D1 for interaction. Domains 3 and 4 were found to be dispensable forbinding to MHC class II (Huard et al., 1997).Interestingly, unlike CD4, LAG-3 does not bind to et al., 1992).1.2.2. LAG-3 expression patternA number of activated human T and NK cell lines, as well as PHA blasts of CD4 andCD8 T cells express LAG-3 on their surface al., 1990). Inimmunofluorescence studies, expression of human LAG-3 protein was reported mainlyon activated T cells in the inflamed secondary lymphoid organs, with a few scatteredpositive cells in normal lymphoid organs. The morphology and distribution of LAG-3 +cells were consistent with that of lymphocytes. No LAG3+ cell (Huard et al., 1994a) wasfound in nonlymphoid organs including muscle, nerve and kidney. The distribution ofLAG-3, compared with CD3 and CD25, in normal human tissues is shown in Table 1.1. Table 1.1. The distribution of LAG-3 in normal tissues, detected by staining of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, - no positive cells, + a few positive cells, ++ manypositive cells, +++ most cells positive (Huard et al., 1994a).Consistent with human studies, mouse antigen-activated T cells (CD4 and CD8populations) as well as poly(I)-poly(C), the synthetic double-stranded ribonucleicacid, activated NK cells express LAG-3 on their surface (Miyazaki et al., 1996;Workman et al., 2002b).Northern blot analysis of mouse tissues revealed LAG-3 transcripts only in the spleen,thymus and brain and not in stomach, liver, lung, testis, heart, kidney and skeletal muscle.Furthermore, a very small percentage of T and NK cells in na\u00efve mice express surfaceLAG-3, about 2% and 10 % respectively. Interestingly, in contrast to T cells,significant percentage of T cells (almost 19 %) show LAG-3 expression (Workman et33al., 2002b). In addition, LAG-3 mRNA (Fahrer et al., 2001).However, it must be mentioned that all the above in vivo T cell expression data isreported in the form of tables and no primary results are shown (Huard et al., 1994a;Workman et al., 2002b).1.2.3. Regulation of Lag-3 expressionThe studies concentrating on potential factors inducing LAG-3 expression on human Tand NK cells did not(Bruniquel et al., 1998). In fact, IL-12 proved to be the most potent stimulus for LAG-3expression on activated T and NK cells (Annunziato et al., 1997; Bruniquel et al., 1998).None of the above mentioned cytokines were able to down-regulate LAG-3 expression.Aditionally, the most activated CD4+ T cell clones with established Th1 profile ofcytokine secretion expressed LAG-3 on their surface, whereas the great majority of Th2clones showed neither surface LAG-3 nor LAG-3 m RNA expression (Annunziato et al.,1996; Scala et al., 1998).The analysis of the 5' region of human Lag-3 gene revealed that LAG-3 has a TATA-lesspromoter and, like many genes lacking a TATA box, it has multiple transcriptional startsites. The LAG-3 transcription initiation sites are the putative Inr motives, as shown inFigure 1.6a. transcriptional initiator DNA element (Javahery etal., 1994). In addition, a number of regulatory regions upstream from the transcriptionstart site have been identified including the DNA binding motifs of GATA, c-Ets, NF-kBand NFAT transcription factors and GC site of Sp1 transcriptionfactor (Figure 1.6b) (Bruniquel et al., 1998). In particular, -1061/-541 region wasidentified as positive regulatory element, while +211/+311 located in the first exon wasfound to hamper the activity of regulatory elements upstream of the transcriptional startsite.34a) b) Figure 1.6. The human LAG-3 5' region. a) multiple Lag-3 transcription initiation sitesare compared with Inr sequence. b) The major transcription start site is marked as +1 andthe minor sites as (+1). The potential transcription factor binding sites are indicated.Adapted from Bruniquel et al. 1998. 351.2.4. Suggested function of LAG-3The physiological role of LAG-3 is not clear. Since LAG-3, like CTLA-4, is expressedonly after lymphocyte activation, it cannot play a role in the induction phase of theresponse. Because it has a higher affinity for MHC class II than CD4 (and thereforepotential for displacing CD4), however, it was thought that LAG-3 might act as anegative regulator of T cell activation. Consistent with this prediction, addition ofblocking anti-LAG-3 antibodies to IL-2 dependent human T cell lines resulted insustained proliferation, increased CD25 activation marker expression and increased INF- and IL-4 secretion (Huard et al., 1994b). Subsequent studies with polyclonal human Tcells showed that TCR-induced activation was inhibited by anti-LAG-3 Ab cross-linking(Hannier et al., 1998).It was also demonstrated that LAG-3 co-caps with CD3 at the immunological synapse,but surprisingly it was preferentially associated with the CD8 rather than the CD4 co-receptor at the cell surface (Hannier and Triebel, 1999). In addition, LAG-3 was found tobe enriched in lipid rafts of activated T cells (Iouzalen et al., 2001). Lipid rafts aredetergent insoluble, cholesterol and glycosphingolipids rich membrane microdomains,which have been implicated in signal transduction, cholesterol trafficking andendocytosis (Pike , 2004).The initial analysis of LAG 3-/- mice did not reveal any defect in T nor B cell function(Miyazaki et al., 1996). But two more recent studies showed that murine LAG-3 can actas regulator of T cell expansion. These studies, however, showed different effects in vitrothan in vivo. In vitro, defective expansion of activated LAG3-/- T cells afterstaphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) stimulation was observed. The effect was attributedto the increased cell death, since the cells were proliferating at the normal rate (Workmanand Vignali, 2003). Similar observations were made with LAG3-/-CD4+ OT-IItransgenic T cells following antigenic peptide stimulation. constitutive expression via retroviral-mediated stem cell genetransfer (Workman and Vignali, 2003). Yet, in vivo, LAG3-/- T cells exhibited a delay incell cycle arrest following stimulation with SEB resulting in increased T cell expansionand splenomegaly. Moreover, increased T cell expansion was observed in adoptiverecipients of LAG-3 -/- OT-II transgenic T cells following in vivo Ag stimulation36(Workman et al., 2004). Similarly, the infection of LAG3-/- mice with Sendai virusresulted in increased numbers of memory and CD4+ and CD8+ cells (Workman et al.,2004). This in vivo data supports the idea of LAG-3 being a negative regulator of T cellactivation and expansion.The initial analysis of LAG3-/- deficient mice, nevertheless, showed a defect in thenatural killer cell compartment. Killing of certain tumor targets by NK cells from thesemice was inhibited or even abolished, whereas lysis of cells displaying MHC class Idisparities remained intact. It was thus suggested that LAG-3 is a receptor or co-receptordefining different modes of NK killing (Miyazaki et al., 1996). This notion, however, wasnot supported by studies with human NK cells (Huard et al., 1998).Very recently, a new aspect of LAG-3 function was investigated. It was suggested thatsurface LAG-3, besides modulating effector T cell activity, influences regulatory T cellsuppressor activity. Not only CD4+ CD25+ T cells from LAG3-/- mice exhibited reducedregulatory activity, but also ectopic expression of LAG-3 on CD4+ T cells conferred onthem suppressor activity toward effector T cells (Huang et al., 2004).LAG-3 expression is thought to be limited to activated T and NK cell populations, but ithas been shown to exert an effect on other cell types as well, particularly monocytes anddendritic cells. For example, LAG-3 expressed on the surface of human proinflammatorybystander T cells (that is T cells in co-cultures with autologous monocytes and IL-2,activated in the absence of TCR engagement) synergizes with low level of CD40 Lexpressed on these cells to trigger TNF- and IL-12 production by monocytes (Avice etal., 1999). Furthermore, in the same way as soluble CD40 L, soluble LAG-3 can directlyinduce DCs to produce Th1- and chemokines, known to direct the migration ofmaturing DCs to lymph nodes (Andreae et al., 2002; Buisson and Triebel, 2003).1.2.5. Mode of action of LAG-3The mechanism of LAG-3 action has not been clarified. In some studies, it wasconcluded the extracellular part is important, others suggested that the intracellular tail37and thus the potential downstream signalling pathways play a role. For example, theinhibitory effect of LAG-3 on CD4-dependent T cell function was lost upon deletion ofthe LAG-3 cytoplasmic tail (Workman et al., 2002a), in accordance with the idea thatLAG-3 does not disrupt CD4 - MHC class II interactions but rather directly inhibits Tcell activation through intracellular signalling. LAG-3 could, therefore, be considered asan independent (negative) co-receptor, like the other two TCR-assisting MHC ligands,CD4 and signal LAG-3, however, havenot yet been delineated. It is clear that the intracellular tail of LAG-3 not receptors (Burshtyn et al., 1996; Vely and Vivier,1997). But, three regions of putative conserved in mouse and human(Figure 1.4); EP (Glutamic acid - Proline) repeated motif is a binding site for LAP (LAG-3 associated protein) a candidate molecule for a new type of signal transduction and/orcoupling of the immunological synapse et al.,2001; Triebel, 2003). KIEELE motif was reported to be important for the inhibition ofCD4-dependent, but not CD4-independent T cell function by LAG-3. serine 454 isa potential phosphorylation site for casein kinase II, cAMP and cGMP dependent proteinkinases (Workman et al., 2002a; Workman and Vignali, 2003). In contast to CD4, theintacellular tail of LAG-3 contains no binding motif for Lck, a protein tyrosine kinasecrucial for early signal transduction events downstream of TCR.Several alternate splice variants of human were them encodingpotential truncated forms: LAG-3V1 D1 LAG3V3(domains D1 to D3 of 52 kDa) suggesting the existence of soluble form of LAG-3(sLAG-3) (Triebel, 2002). However, very recently it was shown that sLAG-3 isolatedfrom activated mouse T cell hybridoma cultures is a result of proteolytic processingoccurring at the connecting peptide region of surface LAG-3 rather than an alterativesplicing product. This soluble LAG-3 migrated at apparent molecular weight of 54 kDa.In addition, the cross-linking experiments indicated that LAG-3 is present at the cells'surface as a dimer and in oligomeric form (Li et al., 2004). Thus, it is possible thatsoluble LAG-3 exists also as a multimer.38The extracellular part of LAG-3 is thought to mediate its effect through binding to MHCclass II. It is conceivable that membrane bound LAG-3 and soluble LAG-3 (sLAG-3)perform different functions in the immune system.The longer form of LAG-3 was detected by ELISA in the serum of healthy individuals aswell as tuberculosis patients with favorable outcome (Lienhardt et al., 2002; Triebel,2003). In fact, since LAG-expression correlates with IFN- production by activated Tcells, soluble LAG-3 has been even suggested as a serological marker of Th1 responses(Annunziato et al., 1996). Soluble LAG-3 was also detectable by ELISA in the serum ofwild type mice (Li et al., 2004). The potential function of LAG-3 has been probed withrecombinant soluble LAG-3 composed of to humanIgG1 Fc region (mLAG-3Ig). Soluble mLAG-3Ig fusion induced MHC class IImediated signaling in monocytes and dendritic cells leading to their activation and/ormaturation as well as production of cytokines (Andreae et al., 2003; Andreae et al., 2002;Avice et al., 1999; Demeure et al., 2001). Moreover, sLAG-3 stimulated immature DCshad a 4- to 5-fold increased capacity to stimulate na\u00efve T cell proliferation (Demeure etal., 2001). Consistently, co-administration of soluble mLAG-3Ig was shown to increaseCTL and CD4 Th1 responses in mice (El Mir and Triebel, 2000).1.2.6. LAG-3 and cancerLAG-3 has also been implied to have anti-tumor activity. For example, Lag-3 transfectedtumors completely regressed or their growth was markedly reduced in mice, and thechallenged mice were significantly protected against a re-challenge with parental tumorcells. Likewise, the co-administration of soluble recombinant LAG-3 (mLAG-3Ig) withwild-type tumor cells also reduced primary tumor growth (Prigent et al., 1999).Another study, exploiting mammary tumor model in transgenic mice, found that co-injection of soluble LAG-3 (mLAG-3Ig) enabled DNA vaccination with plasmids codingfor the oncogene product to establish effective protection against mammarycarcinogenesis. It elicited stronger and sustained (unlike DNA vaccination alone)protection and kept 70% of 1-year old mice tumor free (Cappello et al., 2003).39In human, T lymphocytes infiltrating various tumor types (melanoma, renal cellcarcinoma, diffuse large cell lymphoma, peripheral T cell lymphoma) were found toexpress LAG-3 (Demeure et al., 2001).402. THESIS OBJECTIVESProperly functioning immune system is essential for our health. Inadequate responses topathogens or tumors as well as hyper-reactivity leading to destructive autoimmunedisease have a direct impact on our survival. Hence, the immune responses have to beunder tight control. Especially, the regulation of T cells, the key players of adaptiveimmunity, their activation and expansion, is crucial for the maintenance of the harmonyin the system.Recently a novel cell surface molecule, called LAG-3 (Lymphocyte activation gene -3 /CD223), was identified which has a potential regulatory role in the immune system. Thisprotein was detectable on activated T cells in human inflamed lymphoid tissues but not innormal lymphoid organs. In vitro studies strongly suggested that LAG-3 plays a negativerole in T cell activation. However, the physiological role of LAG-3 remains unclear.The goal of this thesis was to characterize mouse LAG-3. Mouse system allows for moreeasily accessible and manipulable experimental approach needed to gain deeper insightinto the functional significance of this molecule. As there were no reagents available, thefirst objective was to generate tools enabling the characterization of LAG-3 in the form of(i) monoclonal antibodies against LAG-3, (ii) the recombinant soluble LAG-3, as well as(iii) LAG-3 transduced cell lines. There was only scarce information about murineLAG-3 expression pattern, this surface glycoprotein was found only in activated T andNK cells. Monoclonal antibodies would offer the possibility to undertake detailedanalysis of LAG-3 expression pattern and function in the immune system. It would alsoallow for studying how different activation regimes of purified immune cell populationsor their mixtures induce LAG-3 expression. Recombinant soluble LAG-3, on the otherhand, would open the possibility to undertake structural investigations of the protein.Therefore, another goal was to find and optimize the conditions for a large-scaleproduction of soluble recombinant LAG-3, in Drosophila cells expression system. Thepurified soluble LAG-3 would be subjected to crystallization trials alone or in complexwith its reported ligand - MHC class II. If successful, the detailed structural informationmay help understanding how LAG-3 interacts with its ligand. LAG-transduced cell linescould give us indications about the biological role of LAG-3.41The last objective was to use LAG-3 deficient mice to confirm the specificity of ourreagents and to verify our in vitro observations.All these approaches were aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of LAG-3 function inthe immune system.423.

The Geneclean TM RPM Kit was used according to the supplied protocol.For large plasmid DNA preparation bacteria from 100 ml overnight culture (seeded with2 mL of small scale culture) were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 minand the QIAGEN\u00ae maxi plasmid purification protocol was followed using suppliedreagents.49- DNA sequencingFor sequencing of DNA constructs, 2 \u00b5l of plasmid DNA (200-500 ng) was mixed with 2\u00b5l appropriate of BigDye sequencing mix(Applied The reaction was subjected to 25 extension cycles (96\u00b0C 30 sec.,50\u00b0C 15 sec., 60\u00b0C 2 min.) and followed by isopropanol precipitation (2 \u00b5l of 3M NaAcand 20\u00b5l of isopropanol). The pellet was dissolved in 18 \u00b5l of TCR (template suppressorreagent, BigDye\u00ae Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit), heated up to 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. andrun on Genetic Analyzer 310 (Applied Biosystems).- RNA purificationRNA was purified using the TRIazol reagent. Cells were lysed by pipetting up and appropriate amount of reagent (1ml per 5-10x106 cells). The mixture wasadditionally incubated for 5 min. at RT, then 0.2 ml of chloroform was added per 1 ml ofTRIazol used at the beginning, the tube was shaken vigorously by hand for 15 secondsand incubated for 3 min. at RT. Following centrifugation at 12000x g for 15min. at 4\u00b0C,the upper (aqueous) phase was transferred to a fresh tube and RNA was precipitated bythe addition of 0.5 ml of isopropanol per 1ml TRIazol used for cell lysis. After anothercentrifugation and washing with 70% ethanol, RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water,and the A260 was measured to determine the yield.- RT-PCR reverse transcription - polymerase chain reactionFor the first strand synthesis the RNA was dissolved in RNase-free water, 500ng ofthe cDNA synthesis oligonucleotides and the mixture washeated for 15min. at 65oC. Then the was added.In that volume up to 5\u00b5g mRNA can be reverse transcribed.The obtained cDNA was used as a template for PCR. PCR is a technique that allows theamplification of a given DNA fragment that is flanked by short known sequences. TheDNA from which the DNA fragment has to be amplified, is mixed with large excess ofsingle-stranded oligonucleotides that are complementary to the flanking sequences, Taqpolymerase, dNTP's and the buffer. One oligonucleotide is complementary to theantisense of the 5'-flanking sequence, the other to the sense of the 3'-flanking sequenceand they are typically 20 bp long. When the mixture is heated the DNA gets denatured,then the oligonucleotides can anneal to the DNA and the Taq polymerase can amplify theappropriate fragment.

The culture supernatant was filteredover Hyflo Super Cell \u00ae on 0.45um filter to remove cells and prevent the clogging of thesubsequently used affinity column. Sodium azide (0.05% final) was added to thesupernatant and the supernatant was run twice through protein G+ Sepharose column at4oC. After washing with 10-20 column volumes of PBS the antibody was eluted in 3mlfractions with HCL-glycine buffer of pH 2.8. Elution was monitored by UV absorption at =280 (A280). Immediately after collection, pH of each fraction was adjusted to 7 with~2M Na2PO4. The antibody concentration was determined by measuring A280 (OD 280of 1 corresponding to approximately 0.75 mg/ml of purified Ab). The Abs were stored at4\u00b0C for short-term and at -20\u00b0C for long-term storage.52- labelling of antibodies with biotinPurified antibodies were dialysed against 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.2-8.6) in order to removeglycine. Glycine needs to be removed because it inhibits biotinylation reaction. To 1mg/ml of antibody, 40\u00b5l of biotin succinimidyl ester stock solution (10 mg/ml in DMSO)was added for every ml of antibody. After incubation for 1h at RT unbound biotin wasremoved by gel filtration on PD-10 columns. The biotinylated antibodies were stored at4\u00b0C for short-term use or aliquoted and stored at -70oC.- preparation of affinity columns1g CNBr activated Sepharose was suspended and washed in low pH (1mM HCl inwater), resuspended in PBS containing 3mg of monoclonal antibody per 1 mlof Sepharose and incubated over night at 4\u00b0C under head-to-tail rotation. The ligand wasremoved and the groups were blocked in 125mM Tris-HCl 1M glycine(pH 8) for several hours. The beads were then washed with PBS and column was set up.The column was primed with elution buffer, neutralized with PBS before use.- at 4oC with 1-10 \u00b5g/mlprotein in PBS. The plates were thoroughly washed with PBS and blocked for 1h at 37oCwith 4%BSA in PBS. After washing with PBS, the desired antibody, protein or cellculture supernatant was applied for 1h at RT. The plates were then washed 3 times withPBS and secondary HRP linked antibody (anti-rat) or HRP linked straptavidin wereadded for 30 min. After washing (3 times with PBS) the ABST substrate solution wasadded (100\u00b5l/well) and incubated at RT for 20-30 min. ABTS produces a green colouredproduct upon reaction with HPR, which can be measured photospectrometrically at405nm.For sandwich ELISA experiments the plates were coated with purified monoclonal anti-LAG-3 Abs at 2\u00b5g/ml.53For isotyping of monoclonal antibodies, the plates were coated with soluble LAG-3D4t(2\u00b5g/ml in PBS), and anti-rat IgG2a or anti followed by Streptavidin -HRP.-SDS-PAGEPolyacrylamide separating gel was prepared according to the following gel was poured and left to polymerize for one approx. 1 hour at RT. Then thestacking gel was prepared. Samples were loaded on a gel in 1x loading buffer. Forreducing conditions DTT at final concentration of 100 mM was added to the samples.The samples were subjected to electrophoresis in Tris-Glycine buffer at 200V for 45min-1 hr along with BENCHMARKTMsize in minigel ReagentThe polyacrylamide gels were washed 3 times for 5 minutes with deionized water, thenimmersed in GelCode\u00ae Blue stain reagent, and incubated at RT for 1 hr gently rocking.After staining the gel was washed in water at RT for 1 hr, the gels were scanned to savethe image.54- preparation of the total protein lysates from cellsCells were lysed in the lysis buffer at the concentration of 107-108cells per ml of lysisbuffer by repeated pipetting and 30 min. incubation on ice. Then the insoluble fractionwas spun down ( 20 000 xg, 10 min, samples were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the electrophoretictransfer to the membrane was done in the Tris-glycine transfer buffer containing 20%methanol for 1 hr at 350mA. After blocking for 1 hr with 4% non-fat milk in PBS at RT,the membrane was incubated with the first step antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-LAG-3)for 1h at RT and washed in the same buffer for 15 min. The secondary antibody (goatanti-rabbit labelled with horse radish peroxidase (HRP)) was added for 45 min. at RT andafter washing 3 times for 10 min. with PBS the blot was developed with the ECL Kit.The chemiluminescence was recorded using LAS-1000 Imaging System (Fujifilm).- saturated ammonium sulfate (SAS) precipitationSplenocyte culture supernatants were centrifuged 30 min at 20 000xg at RT andtransferred to a fresh tube. Saturated ammonium sulfate (SAS) was added slowly withstirring up to 45% (v/v). Precipitation was carried out at 4 C for 2 hrs. Samples werecentrifuged again 30 min at 20 000 x g at RT. Precipitates were dissolved in PBS andused immediately or stored at -20\u00b0C.- production and purification of soluble LAG-3After a 3-week selection period, the expression of recombinant proteins was induced instably transfected SL-3 cells (see below) by adding CuSO4 to a final concentration of1mM. Three days later (longer induction times are not recommended, since prolonged Cu55treatment leads to a decrease in cell number (Bernard et al., 1994)), cell lysates andsupernatants were tested for the presence of soluble LAG-3 with SDS-PAGE andimmunoblotting.For large-scale cultures roller-bottles were used (450-500ml culture per roller bottle).LAG-3D4t cultures reading the cell density of 5x 106 /ml were induced with CuSO4 for 2-3 days and the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 2100g, 4\u00b0C)followed by 0.45 \u00b5m membrane filtration. At this point protease inhibitors (from 500xstock) were added to the supernatant to prevent degradation of soluble protein. Inhibitorsstock azide (0.05%) to prevent bacterial contamination) was then loaded on an anti-LAG-3 antibody column (monoclonal Ab G40) at 1-2 liters per day flow rate. Theaffinity column was extensively washed with PBS. Bound material was eluted withGlycine-HCL buffer of pH 3.2. Fractions were immediately neutralized with Na2PO4(app. 2M ) to bring pH up to 7.0, and stored at 4\u00b0C.For production of de-glycosylated LAG-3D4t, tunicamycin (from Streptomyces sp.T7765, Sigma), at final concentration of 1\u00b5g/ml was added to the cultures at the point ofinduction. Tunicamycin was diluted from stock cultures prepared by dissolving 5 mg/mltunicamycin in alkaline water (pH 11) and stored at -20 \u00b0C in 0.25 ml aliquots.Purification of the de-glycosylated protein was carried out as for glycosylated LAG-3D4t.-immunocytochemistryFirst, the poly-D-lysine glass slides were prepared in the following way: cover slips werewashed with ethanol, dried and flooded with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/ml in PBS from10mg/ml stocked prepared in water) for 30 min at RT. The excess of poly-D lysine wasremoved by aspiration, the slips were rinsed with cell culture grade H20 and dried.Everything was done under sterile conditions.A5 or A5LAG-3 cells were grown on poly-D lysine coated glass slides to 60-80%confluency. The cells were fixed in 1.8% paraformaldehyde 10 min at RT washed withPBS and blocked with 2% BSA 10% FCS at RT. Incubation with theprimary reagent; biotinylated Abs in blocking buffer was carried out for 1hr (RT). The56cells were washed with PBS and streptavidin Texas Red was used as secondary reagent(1hr at RT). After PBS wash, the slips were placed on microscope slides and viewedunder fluorescent microscope (Nikon).3.2.3. Cellular biology techniques- cell cultureFor cell culture work all the media and reagents were filtered through 0.2\u00b5m Milliporefilters before use. Lymphocytes isolated from spleens and lymph nodes of mice andmouse cell lines were cultured in SF-IMDM supplemented with 2% FCS, in this workreferred to as normal growth medium, in 95% humidity, 5% CO2 and 37oC.For culturing of A5 cells to the growth medium.For culturing of LAG-3 transfected cell lines added to thegrowth medium.For culturing of sorted cells Ciproxin was added (at final concentration 10 \u00b5g/mL) to thenormal growth medium to prevent contamination.For freezing of mouse cells 40% FCS 10% DMSO normal growth medium was used.- transfection of cell linesA5 (HA specific CD4 T cell hybridoma) cell line cellsGP-E 86 packaging cell line (Markowitz et al., 1988) (provided by prof. Antonius Rolink,University of Basel) was stably transfected with pLXS-puro vector et al.,1996) carrying murine Lag-3 in the following way: 1.6 x 106 cells were plated in 75 cm2flask a day be fore to reach 80% confluency on the day of transfection. 12 \u00b5g of plasmidDNA were diluted in 600 \u00b5l of serum free medium (DMEM) and separately 36 \u00b5l ofLipofectamine\u00ae Reagent were diluted in 600 \u00b5l of serum free DMEM, the two solutionswere combined and incubated at RT for 30 min. Cells were washed with serum free57medium. 4.8 ml of serum free DMEM were added to the tube containing lipid-DNAcomplexes and the mixture was overlayed onto washed cells, followed by 5 hrsincubations at 37 \u00b0C. Then 6 ml of 20% FCS DMEM was added to the cells (withoutremoving transfection mixture). Next day the medium was replaced by normal growthmedium and the puromycin selection (2.5 \u00b5g/ml) was started day after.Stably transfected GP-E86 cells were grown to 60-80% confluency (without puromycin)and irradiated (3000 rads), the growth medium was changed and A20 cells were co-culture with irradiated GP-E86 cells for 2-3 days, followed by transfer to a new flask andpuromycin selection in the normal growth medium.- cell culture and transfection of Drosphila melanogaster cellsSchneider cells were SFM supplemented with 1% FCS atdensities between 5x105 per mL and 2x106 per mL at room temperature. SL-3 cells weretransfected with 1.5 \u00b5g of pRmHa-3LAG-3D4t or pRmHa-3LAG-3D2t with 0.1\u00b5g of phshspuro-2 DNA plasmid (containing the puromycin resistance gene under thecontrol of heat shock promoter (Steller and Pirrotta, 1986)) using Lipofectin\u00ae reagentaccording to performed in 24-well plateand puromycin selection (5\u00b5g/ml) was started two days later. Puromycin was chosen as aselection marker, rather than commonly used hygromycin B or geneticin, because itreduces the time required for selection to 2 weeks (compared to 3-4 weeks forhygromycin B and 5-6 weeks for geneticin (Towers and Sattelle, 2002)).Colonies of drug-resistant cells could be seen about 1 week later. Cells were expandedand kept in culture or frozen in SF-900 II SFM containing 30% FCS and 10% DMSO.- generation of B cell hybridomas by cell fusionLymph node single cell suspension taken from an immunized rat and the SP2/0 myelomacell line were washed with pure IMDM and spun down together in one tube. 1-2 largeflasks of SP2/0 cells in logarithmic growth phase per lymph node were used per fusion.1.0 ml PEG1500 was added to cells within 1 min. while shaking in a 37oC water bath.After another 90 seconds of shaking, the suspension was diluted with 5ml IMDM drop-58wise over the course of 90 seconds. All was done in 37oC water-bath in 50ml Falcontube. The tube was finally filled up with IMDM and after centrifugation, the cells wereresuspended in 1 liter of HAT, IL-6, and 2%FCS SF-IMDM medium and plated out in 96well plates (200 \u00b5l/well).- preparation of cell suspension from mouse lymphoid organsFreshly isolated spleen(s) and/or lymph nodes were transferred on a nylon net (Nitex) inpetri dish with PBS 2% FCS. The cell suspension was made by gently pushing the organsthough the net. The cell suspension was transferred into a 15mL Falcon tube and pelletedby centrifugation at 300g for 5-10 min. If the cells were used for biological assay, theprocedure was done under sterile conditions.- lysis of erythrocytesSplenocytes were collected by centrifugation (10 min, 300g) and resuspended in normalgrowth medium (1 ml of per 1 mouse spleen). 4 ml of Gey's solution was added per 1mlof cell suspension, the mix was incubated at room temperature for 1 min., after which 5ml (per 1 ml of original cell suspension) of normal growth medium was added to thetube. This treatment is based on hypotonic shock to which erythrocytes are very sensitive.- preparation of dendritic cells from lymphoid organsThe total spleen or LN cell populations of wild-type mice (Balb/c strain) were enrichedfor dendritic cells and spleens of Balb/cmice were collected. Tissues were cut into small pieces and digested twice for 30 min. at37\u00b0C in IMDM supplemented with 5% FCS and 100\u00b5g/ml collagenase D (37 \u00b0C room,gentle shaking). Cells were recovered, passed through a mesh (to get single cellsuspension), centrifuged (5 min., 300g 4\u00b0C) and resuspended Hepes and 5mM EDTA (6 ml for4-5 spleens). 3 ml of cell suspension was mixed well with 1 ml of OptiprepTM reagent59and placed in a 14 ml Falcon polycarbonate tube, 5 ml of 1 to 4.2 dilution of OptiprepTM(1 unit Optiprep to 4.2 units Optiprep dilution buffer) was then layered over cellsuspension followed by 3 ml of HBSS. The gradient was centrifuged at 600g for 15 min.at RT without a brake. The layer between HBSS and OptiprepTM dilution (DC-enrichedphase) was collected and washed with 5% FCS IMDM. The enrichment varied between30 to 60 fold. The obtained cells were cultured or stained with antibodies for flowcytometric analysis and/or cell sorting. - surface staining of cells for FACS analysis and purificationStaining of cells was performed in 96-well V-bottom plates. For all stainings involving Bcells, the with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (2.4G2) antibody at 10\u00b5g/mlfor 5-10 min on ice to block Fc receptors. 105-106 cells per well were stained with thegiven antibody at the pre-determined dilution (usually 10-20\u00b5g/ml was optimal) in2%FCS PBS on ice for 5-15 min. MAbs were used alone or in various combinations.They were either directly labelled with werebiotinylated. The latter ones had to be revealed by secondary staining with Streptavidin-PE or FITC. After each incubation cells were washed once with 2%FCS PBS. Untilanalysis was undertaken, samples were kept on ice. Analysis was done on a FACScaliburflow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).If cells were to be sorted and cultured, all procedures were done under sterile conditions.For larger cell numbers (106-108) 14 ml Falcon tubes were used. Cells were suspended ata concentration of 5x106 per ml for FACS and 30x106 per ml for cell sorting, and filteredthrough a nylon mesh. Cell sorting was performed on FACSAria (Becton Dickinson).- MACS purification/enrichment of cellsMACS (Magnetic Cell Sorting) LS Separation Columns were used for enrichment and/orpurification of T cells or B cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (MiltenyiBiotec). Biotinylated primary antibodies (CD4 or by Streptavidin MicroBeads.60- CFSE labellingCFSE was dissolved in DMSO to 5mM (stock solution), aliquoted (10 \u00b5l per tube) toavoid repeated freezing and thawing which may degrade the reagent and stored at- 20\u00b0C.For labelling, cells were resuspended in 0.1 % BSA/PBS at 107 cells/mL and CFSE at afinal concentration of 5\u00b5M was added to them. The cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C(water bath) for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 10-20 x volume of 0.1 %BSA/PBS. The cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 300g, washed once with the growthmedium (room temperature) and used right away for culture.- stimulation of T cellsTotal splenocytes, sorted T cells or A5 cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 Ab(145.2C11) alone or in combination with anti-CD28 Ab (37.51). The 24 or 96 flat bottomplates were coated with the antibodies at 2\u00b5g/ml in PBS for 2-3 hours at roomtemperature or overnight at 4\u00b0C, and washed once with PBS before plating cells. Cellswere plated at 2x106 per well (24 well plates) or 0.2 - 0.3 x106 per well (96 well plates).For antigen specific stimulations A20 B cell lymphoma was used as antigen presentingcells. After -irradiation (30Gy) A20 cells were washed once with the growth mediumand loaded with various concentrations of HA peptide (SSFERFEIFPK) for 2hrs at 37\u00b0C.- stimulation of B cellsPurified B cells were plated 0.1 mln cells/well (96 well flat bottom plates) in normalgrowth medium supplied with 2%FCS.

Cultures were stimulated with various doses of soluble anti-CD3 Ab (145.2C11)for 4 days. Effector T cells activation was determined by CFSE dilution analysis.- removal of dead cells with Ficoll-PaqueCells were resuspended in normal growth medium at 1-5 x108 cells/ml and 5ml of Ficoll-Paque solution was layered under the cell suspension. The samples were then centrifugedfor 15 min at 800xg at RT without brake. The live cells floating on the top of the high-density solution were transferred to another tube, washed twice with the growth mediumand used for subsequent procedures.- OT-II transgenic T cell activation assayRBC depleted splenocytes and LN cells from OT-II mice were pooled and stained withanti-CD4 FITC Ab (for positive selection of transgenic CD4 T cells), anti-CD8 PercP Ab(to make sure that all CD8 cells, that also could respond to OVA peptide are excluded)and anti-CD44 PE (to exclude activated cells). The CD4+ cells were sorted and labelledwith CFSE (as described above). For activation, LAG-3 positive or LAG-3 negativeAPCs were loaded with various concentrations of 323-339 OVA peptide for 2 hours (50000 cells per well, in 96-well round bottom plates), and 25 000 of CFSE labelled reporter62CD4 T cells was added per well.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 4.1. Generation and characterization of monoclonal antibodiesagainst mouse LAG-3In order to study the expression pattern and function of LAG-3 we produced a number ofmonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against mouse LAG-3. Lewis rats were into foot pads transduced rat myeloma cells. Specific antibody-producing by flow cytometry (surface staining of LAG-3expressing cell line) and by ELISA with LAG-3hIgG1 fusion protein as antigen. MAbsproduced by selected clones were then epitope mapped using recombinant LAG-3 moleculesconsisting of either D1 to D2 (D1-D2) or D1 to D4 (D1-D4) domains, as shown in Figure4.1.1, and grouped into 2 specificity categories: D1-D2 and to D2 (D1-D2) domains (for more information seesection 4.2) in the form are represented bynumbers indicated at the top), followed by goat anti-rat Ig HRP linked conjugate. goat anti-rabbit HRP conjugate were used asa positive control (C). Sample blots are shown.Twelve hybridomas G24, G27 and G40 specific for D3-D4region.

Two of them:G31 and G37 Abs are of IgG2b isotype, the other 10 Abs are IgG2a.The monoclonal antibodies were purified, biotinylated and their specificity wasascertained by the ability to stain CD3 and CD28 Abs- activated splenocytes fromwild-type, but not from LAG-3 deficient mice, as exemplified in Figure 4.1.2.Furthermore, sandwich ELISA results showed that at least 8 different epitopes wererecognized by various monoclonal Abs (Figure 4.1.3).The obtained antibodies were also tested in immunocytochemistry. T cell line stablytransfected with LAG-3 (A5LAG-3 cells, see below) was plated on cover slips,paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixed and stained with various antibodies. In this type ofapplication G24 and G37 Abs were working well (Figure 4.1.4) Figure 4.1.4. Immunocytochemical analysis of LAG-3 expressing T cell line, A5LAG-3(left and middle panel). Biotinylated G37 and G24 Abs were used for detection, followedby streptavidin Texas Red. Non -transfected A5 cells served as negative control (NC),right panel.It was also analyzed if the generated monoclonal antibodies were functionally active. Forthis purpose A5 cells, an HA-peptide specific T cell hybridoma carrying GFP gene underthe control of minimal IL-2 promoter (Andersen et al., 2001) was used. These cells turngreen upon activation, which can be easily detected by FACS. Figure 4.1.5 shows bothtime course and concentration curve of A5 cells' response to proliferation stimuli.LAG-3 positive variant of T cell hybridoma (A5) was made stably transfecting thecells with a control of EF-1apromoter.

LAG-3 reagent only) - black line.When A5 and A5LAG-3 cells were stimulated with APCs pulsed with the relevantantigen, we observed that the T cells with LAG-3 on their surface showed poor activationas compared to WT A5 cells (Figure 4.1.7, pink line versus dark blue line). This result isconsistent with the results of similar experiments done by others (Workman et al.,2002a). The inhibitory effect was very strong (more than 95%), and decreased slightly (toabout 60 %) with increased HA peptide concentrations used for loading of APCs. A5A5LAG-3 67Subsequently, it was tested if mAbs against LAG-3 can counteract the activity ofectopically expressed LAG-3. Indeed, the majority of monoclonal antibodies were able toefficiently neutralize the inhibitory effect of surface LAG-3. Upon addition ofmonoclonal antibodies, the activation levels of A5LAG-3 cells came close to that A5cells, as shown in Figure 4.1.7. The strength of 'neutralizing effect' did not strictlycorrelate the mAbs G19 and G27were efficient as all D1-D2 Abs tested. Figure 4.1.7. Monoclonal antibodies are able to neutralize inhibitory effect of surfaceLAG-3 on T cell activation. A20 cells were pulsed with HA peptide at indicatedconcentrations and used to activate A5 or A5LAG-3 cells in the absence or presence ofvarious mAbs. The activation of A5 cells was not affected by mAbs. The effect of mAbson the activation A5LAG-3 cells is shown.Altogether, the above results indicate that the new mAbs against LAG-3 we generated arehighly specific and are functionally active in vitro. They work in various types of assaysand hence are ideal for investigating LAG-3 expression and function in the immunesystem.0102030405060708090100 0.1110100HA peptide ug/mLactivation ( % of soluble LAG-3 for structural studiesAs insect cells are known to be suitable hosts for heterologous protein expression andproduction, we chose Schneider cell line (Schneider, 1972), a cell line derived fromprimary cultures of late-stage of Drosophila melanogaster embryos, for the production ofsoluble LAG-3.It was first tested if the LAG-3 consisting of all four extracellular domains (D4t) and itsshorter truncation (D2t) consisting of the two outmost domains can be expressed inDrosophila SL-3 cells. for by PCR and cloned intopRmHa-3 vector. The important feature of pRmHa-3 vector is the metallothionein (MT)promoter, which contains heavy metal response elements. This allows for inducibleexpression of protein under investigation, upon addition of cadmium or copper, the latterbeing less toxic to the Drosophila cells (Bunch et al., 1988).SL-3 cells stably transfected with pRmHaLAG-3D4t or pRmHaLAG-3D2t plasmid weretreated with CuSO4 for 3 days to induce the production of recombinant proteins. Culturesupernatants as well as cell pellets were collected. The supernatants and cell lysates weretreated with protease inhibitors to prevent protein degradation. Western Blot analysis wasperformed to check the levels of the recombinant LAG-3 production. As shown in Figure4.2.1, D4t truncation was present in both in cell lysate and in culture supernatant, whileD2t was produced in the cells but could not be secreted. D4t protein migrated withapparent molecular weight of 53 kDa and D2t product of 25 kDa.Because LAG-3 D2t was retained inside the cells, two additional short truncations (D2sencoded by nucleotides 357-1092 wereconstructed. As for D2t, although both of them were produced in SL-3 cells, they werenot secreted into the media (Figure 4.2.2). This indicated that the shorter truncated formsof LAG-3 do not fold correctly and would not be suitable for further analysis.At this point we focused on the longer version - D4t of recombinant LAG-3. Its presencein the SL-3 culture supernatant facilitated subsequent purification.69Figure 4.2.1.

The soluble LAG-3 D4t was produced in a batch-wise manner(1.5 L at a time) and loaded on the G40 affinity column. After each load the absorption tothe column was ensured by Western blot as shown in Figure 4.2.3a. The level ofabsorption to the column varied slightly from batch to batch, possibly due to smalldifferences in speed of loading of the supernatant and/or the amount of protein present in66453020 to 11 Liters of SL-3 culture),affinity column was eluted with pH 3.2 Glycine-HCL buffer. The protein content of theeluted fractions was determined by measurement of Absorbance at 280 nm (A280). LAG-3 D4t elution profile is presented in Figure 4.2.3b. Approximately 50 mg of recombinantprotein was obtained. Figure 4.2.3. The production of soluble LAG-3.

And it is known thatheterogenous glycosylation can prevent protein crystallization. To optimize theconditions for LAG-3 crystallization, we produced a non-glycosylated version of sLAG-3in addition to wild-type glycosylated form of soluble LAG-3.First, we tested if tunicamycin - a specific inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation wouldwork in our culture conditions.

When inhibitor was added 3 hrs after induction the glycosylated 'band'(the upper band, Figure 4.2.5a) was already visible. There is a clear shift in mobility ofrecombinant LAG-3 D4t after tunicamycin treatment, the non-glycosylated LAG-3D4tmigrates kDa (compared to 53 kDa of glycosylated version).The above assessment of tunicamycin activity was performed with a quite highconcentration of tunicamycin (5 \u00b5g/mL). It was then tested if, for a larger scaleproduction, lower concentrations of tunicamycin could be used. Indeed, theconcentration as low as 0.8 \u00b5g/ml worked well (Figure 4.2.5b). However, when 0.5\u00b5g/ml of tunicamycin was used the level of inhibition showed variation betweenexperiments (not shown). Finally, we decided on the 1 \u00b5g/ml concentration; at thisconcentration no toxic effect was observed on sLAG-3 producing SL-3 cells, the problemoften encountered using Baculovirus expression system involving Sf9 insect cells.Next, the production of LAG-3D4t was repeated, this time in the presence oftunicamycin. Before the chromatography purification each batch was checked forefficient de-glycosylation (Figure 4.2.6, e.g. lane 7 to 9).

If successful the detailed structural information can tell us moreabout LAG-3 itself as well as LAG-3-MHC class II interaction(s). In addition thisstructure may help us to understand how CD4, a well-known TCR co-receptor and arelative of LAG-3, binds to MHC class II - one of the key interactions in the immunesystem but of so low affinity that good quality complexes are extremely difficult toobtain.Biochemical analysis of soluble protein showed that in solution LAG-3 forms stabledimers. This observation strongly suggests the presence of such dimers on cell surface.LAG-3 dimers on T cells could augment its avidity for MHC class II, or other ligand, andthereby enhance LAG-3 mediated signaling. This notion is supported by recent data by Liand colleagues. Their cross-linking studies of LAG-3-transduced T cell hybridomashowed that LAG-3 can form dimers and even oligomers at the cell membrane (Li et al.,2004). Human LAG-3 studies have previously also suggested that LAG-3 might beexpressed as a dimer, but no biochemical support for this hypothesis has been presented(Huard et al., 1997).Furthermore, as analysed by Western blot, soluble LAG-3 isolated from splenic culturesupernatants (described in section 4.4 of this report) closely approached, in terms ofmolecular weight, the recombinant LAG-3 composed of 4 extracellular domains(glycosylated form). This observation supports the 'proteolytic na\u00efve, and regulatory T cells.Although there have been a number of reports about LAG-3, its function in the immuneresponses has remained enigmatic. The discrepancies between a human and a mousesystem led to confusion. LAG-3 function as negative regulator of T cell activationconcluded from studies with human cells was not confirmed in LAG-3 knock-out mice(Hannier et al., 1998; Huard et al., 1994b; Miyazaki et al., 1996). While the function forLAG-3 in NK cell killing, suggested from LAG-3 knock-out studies was not supportedby evidence from human cells (Huard et al., 1998; Miyazaki et al., 1996). Also the latermore detailed analysis of LAG-3 deficient mice was not consistent (Workman et al.,2004; Workman and Vignali, 2003).Having new tools for LAG-3 analysis at hand, we decided to first re-examine theexpression pattern and function of LAG-3 on mouse T cells.4.3.1. Expression of LAG-3 on CD4 and CD8 T cells and its role inhomeostasisFirst, we looked at the LAG-3 expression on the surface of CD4 or CD8 T cells over timeafter CD3 triggering. Figure 4.3.1 shows the time course of LAG-3 expression onactivated T cells. Freshly isolated mouse splenic and lymph node T cells do not expressLAG-3 (not even approximately 2%, as reported by Workman and colleagues (Workmanet al., 2002a)). It appears on the surface of T cells within 24 hours of CD3 engagementand reaches plateau on day 3 of activation (Figure 4.3.1 a and b).Furthermore, the levels of LAG-3 were slightly (approximately 2 fold) but consistentlyhigher on CD8 T cells than on CD4 T cells. Similar observation has been reported byHuard and colleagues working with human PHA blasts (Huard et al., 1994a). Thisdifference in LAG-3 expression pattern may be due to the fact that Lag-3 gene lies withinCD4 locus (Bruniquel et al., 1997) and its promoter may be partially silenced when CD4gene is activated. In addition, upon CD8 T cell triggering with the relevant peptide,LAG-3 co-capped with CD3 much more efficiently then in case of activated CD4 T cells(Hannier and Triebel, 1999). The observation that CD8 cells express more LAG-3 ontheir surface is difficult to reconcile with LAG-3 being the only MHC class II ligand.76But, LAG-3 function on CD8 T cells has not been extensively analyzed as the LAG-3studies concentrated more on MHC class II restricted CD4 cells.How could LAG-3 play a role in class I restricted responses?Frederic Triebel, in his recent review, suggested the model of molecular interactionsbetween a CD8 T cell and APC, in which he considers LAG-3 as independent co-receptor(Figure 4.3.2), supporting the idea that LAG-3 does not interfere with CD4-MHC class IIinteractions but rather directly inhibits T cell activation through intracellular signaling(Triebel, 2003). However, it is possible that a ligand other than MHC class II could beinvolved in LAG-3 function on CD8 cells.a) b) Figure 4.3.1. Activated T cells express LAG-3 on their surface. (a) Lymph node cellswere activated on immobilized CD3 Ab for 24 hours. Triple staining (CD4/CD8/LAG-3) before and after activation is shown. (b) Splenocytes were cultured on CD3 coatedplates for indicated times, staining was done as in (a) and the samples were gated on CD4or CD8 Shown are the consequences of LAG-3interactions when a CD8 T cells meets an APC. Two motifs of the intraplasmic regionpotentially involved in signaling are shown (from (Triebel, 2003). In such scenariosignaling downstream from LAG-3 would interfere with signaling pathways activated byTCR tiggering.Then, we looked at the kinetics of LAG-3 down-regulation and asked if continuousstimulation is necessary for surface LAG-3 expression. In order to see how long LAG-3persists on the surface of T cells after removal of proliferation stimulus, purified T cellswere activated on immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs for 3 days, then collected,washed and cultured in normal growth medium supplied with IL-2. As shown in Figure4.3.3, after removal of the stimulus, T cells kept high levels LAG-3 on their surface for atleast 24 hours; followed by about 50% loss after 4 days, and after 7 days going down to Figure 4.3.3. Surface expression of LAG-3 on activated T cells after removal ofproliferation stimulus. Purified T cells were activated on immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 3 days and transferred to IL-2 supplied growth medium. The time of transfer isindicated by the dotted line.020406080100120 024681012141618days in culture *LAG-3 ( Mean fluorescence)78the level before activation. Therefore, it can be concluded that continuous stimulation isrequired to maintain high levels of surface LAG-3.Until now, all of the studies on murine LAG-3 demonstrating its presence on T cells werecarried out in vitro. In an attempt to find LAG-3 in vivo, we looked at homeostaticallyexpanding T cells. Using our new monoclonal antibodies we show that LAG-3 appearson the surface of T cells undergoing homeostatic proliferation in lymphopenic hosts. LNcells from normal mice were transferred into sublethally irradiated recombinaseactivating gene-2 and common cytokine receptor chain (RAG 2/CC) double ko mice(Mazurier et al., 1999). RAG/CC are suitable hosts for the lymphocyte reconstitutionexperiments, because they are completely alymphoid (they lack T, B as well as NK cells).After 10 days spleen cells were analyzed by FACS. Normal ratios of CD4 to CD8 T cellswere found in reconstituted mice (Figure 4.3.4). The majority of them were blasting,indicating active proliferation. LAG-3 was clearly detectable on about 50% of blasts(Figure 4.3.4). This data suggests a role for LAG-3 in homeostasis. In fact, the functionof LAG-3 during T cell homeostasis was recently implied from the experiments involvingLAG-3 deficient mice, but the surface expression of LAG-3 in wild type animals has notbeen demonstrated. Workman and Vignali reported that, CD4+ and CD8+ LAG-3deficient T cells show enhanced homeostatic expansion in the spleen of lymphopenic host(2.6 fold), which was abrogated by ectopic expression of WT LAG-3 (Workman andVignali, 2005). Based on the findings that the spleens of 16 weeks old LAG-3 ko micenot only have increased numbers of T cells (2 fold), but also of B cells, granulocytes,macrophages and DCs they go on to suggest that cells that express LAG-3 (that is T cells)regulate the expansion of cells that do not (other leukocyte subtypes). Of particularinterest is the observation that there was a substantial increase in splenic pDCs (4 fold) inLAG-3 ko mice. In the light of the findings presented in this thesis, especially the highexpression of LAG-3 on activated B cells and pDCs (see section 4.5), their data could bereinterpreted as indicating LAG-3 mediated regulation of B cell and DC homeostasis.79Figure 4.3.4. CD4 and CD8 T cells undergoing homeostatic expansion express LAG-3.LN cells from normal mice were transferred into a lymphopenic recipient. After 10 days,splenocytes of reconstituted and WT mice were analyzed for LAG-3 expression. Analysisof large blasts is presented. CD4+ and CD8+ populations are shown in left side panels.LAG-3 staining of CD8 gated cells is shown in red (secondary reagent control in grey), ofCD4 gated cells in blue (secondary reagent control in black) and of CD8-CD4- cells ingreen (right side panels). The small cells do not express LAG-3 (not shown). The data arethe representative of two independent experiments.4.3.2. Is LAG-3 required for T reg suppressive activity?The experiments involving ectopic expression of LAG-3 on A5 cells (section 4.1)suggested that this molecule has an immunoregulatory function on T cells, in agreementwith reports by others (Hannier et al., 1998; Huard et al., 1996; Workman et al., 2002a);LAG-3 can act as a negative regulator of T cell activation. Interestingly, it was recentlyproposed that LAG-3 controls T cell function not only intrinsically (on the surface ofeffector T cells) but also extrinsically by its presence on regulatory T cells. In the recentreport Huang and colleagues suggested that LAG-3 is important for the suppressivefunction of regulatory T cell subpopulation (Huang et cells do not express LAG-3 on their surface.Freshly isolated or CD3 and CD28 activated days) WT mice werestained for CD4, CD25 and LAG-3. The analysis was done on CD4 gated cells. TheCD25+ population representing about 9% of total CD4 population (left panel) is LAG-3negative.Figure 4.3.5 shows that the CD25+ CD4+ T reg cells freshly isolated from a mouse areLAG-3 negative. In contrast, most of CD4 T cells activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28Abs for two days stain positively for LAG-3. However, at this stage all activated cellsexpress CD25 and T regs cannot be distinguished anymore. To verify LAG-3 expressionon T regs, the experiment was repeated with purified na\u00efve/effector (CD4+CD25-) andregulatory (CD4+CD25+) T cell populations. The purified cells were additionallylabelled with CFSE allowing for easy detection of their proliferation.Mouse regulatory T cells when stimulated and cultured alone show anergic phenotype,they proliferate poorly after TCR stimulation, when compared to effector T cells (Figure4.3.6 a and b). This is the consequence of their dependence on exogenous IL-2, to such adegree that CD4+ CD25+ T cells are absent from IL-2 deficient mice (Papiernik et al.,1998). Yet, the regulatory cells that managed to proliferate up-regulated surface LAG-3,just like the effector population. It could be argued that this population resulted fromcontaminating effector T cells, unfortunately without a specific marker for T regsavailable, it is impossible to rigorously examine it. However, when T regs were mixedwith non-labelled effector cells in 1 to 4 ratio and stimulated via their TCR, theyproliferated just as well as effector cells alone and expressed the same levels b)c) Figure 4.3.6. LAG-3 expression on regulatory versus effector T cells. The purified LNand spleen (a) effector (CD4+CD25-) and (b) regulatory (CD4+ CD25+) T cellpopulations were CFSE labeled and independently stimulated with soluble CD3. After 4days LAG-3 surface staining was performed. (c) CFSE labeled regulatory T cells (blue)were mixed with non-labeled effector T cells (red) in 1 to 4 ratio, respectively, andstimulated with soluble CD3 for four days. LAG-3 staining and T regs CFSE dilutionprofile are shown.In conclusion, consistent with the results of Huang et al., we could show that naturalCD4+ CD25+ T regs express LAG-3 upon activation, which is enhanced inthe presence of effector cells. Na\u00efve CD4+ CD25+ regulatory cells have no surface LAG-3, although reportedly they show significantly higher levels of LAG-3 mRNA (Huang etal., 2004). This discrepancy could be explained by the possibility of intracellular LAG-3storage. Furthermore, after activation (monitored by CFSE dilution) the level of LAG-3on T regs is the same as on classical effector cells, suggesting that LAG-3 cannot be usedas a marker to distinguish T reg population.To assess whether LAG-3 is indispensable for the suppressive function of regulatory Tcells, we subjected WT as well as LAG-3 deficient T cells to the standard in vitrosuppressor assay. The CFSE labelled WT effector T cells were cultured alone or weremixed in 1 to 1 ratio with WT or LAG-3-deficient unlabeled regulatory T cells, and theproliferation of effector cells was followed by CFSE dilution. As shown in Figure 4.3.7,the WT and LAG-3 deficient T regs were able to suppress the proliferation of WTeffector T cells to the same extent suggesting that LAG-3 is dispensable for suppressoractivity of T regs. The suppressive the suppressive activity of T regs.CFSE labeled WT effector cells were mixed with unlabeled WT effector cells (in red) ascontrols, WT Tregs (in blue) or LAG-3 deficient Tregs (in green) in 1 to 1 ratio. The cellswere stimulated with 0.1ug/ml of anti-CD3 in the presence of irradiated APCs for 4 days.The effector cell proliferation was followed by CFSE dilution.over a range of anti-CD3 concentrations (0.1 ug/ml to 5 ug/ml) and was independent ofLAG-3 expression on T cells as also LAG-3 deficient effector cells could be suppressedby both T reg variants (not shown). Furthermore, the addition of monoclonal anti-LAG-3antibodies to WT T regs also did not affect their activity (not shown).The above results are clearly in disagreement with the report by Huang and colleagues(Huang et al., 2004). This discrepancy can be partially explained by different assays andmodels used. Huang et al. used a very specific in vivo model and non-standard in vitroassays. Also they do not clearly define 'regulatory ' population and the effects theyobserved were generally quite weak.Our results do not support the notion that LAG-3 is a specific marker for T regs. Anytype of in vitro activated T cell becomes strongly LAG-3 positive.100101102103104FL1-H: FL1-H020406080100% of Max834.4. T-cell induced expression of B cells'Expression of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) on B cells is inducedby T cells' Kisielow Immunol. 35: 2081-2088.8485 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 934.4.1 Analysis of B cells - supplementary dataTo complete the kinetic analysis of LAG-3 expression on B cells, we looked at the rate ofdown-regulation of LAG-3 on this lymphocyte subpopulation.LAG-3 expression on the surface of B cells peaks on day 3 to 4 of culture with activatedT cells and stays on at least till day 6. Purified B cells need both the proliferation stimulus(for example, provided by BCR triggering together with anti-CD40 help) and a solublefactor produced by T cells in order to express LAG-3 on their surface.After withdrawal of proliferation stimuli LAG-3 disappears from the surface of B cellsquickly, as demonstrated by the following experiment. B cells were purified by cellsorting from splenocyte cultures 3 days after stimulation with CD3 and CD28 Abs. Figure 4.4.1. Down-regulation of surface LAG-3 on B cells after removal of proliferationstimuli. CD19 positive cells were sorted from splenocyte cultures activated for 3 days onimmobilized CD3 and CD28 Abs, and resuspended in the normal growth medium(blue line) or in the day 3 activated splenocyte culture supernatant (pink line). LAG-3levels were determined by surface staining with LAG-3 mAb G15.Purified B cells were then transferred to normal growth medium or kept in thesupernatant collected from day 3 cultures from which B cells were sorted (containing thesoluble factor(s) needed). LAG-3 surface expression of the 0481224time off-stimulus (hrs)LAG-3 ( which display high surface LAG-3 for at least 24 hrs after removal ofproliferation stimulus (Figure 4.3.3), B cells loose surface LAG-3 within hours. After 4hours 'off-stimulus' B cells show only 50% of the initial amounts of LAG-3 and after 8hours almost all surface LAG-3 is gone (Figure 4.4.1). Thus the rate of LAG-3 down-regulation is much faster for B cells than for T cells, as T cells needed four days to reducetheir LAG-3 surface expression by half. The soluble factor alone provided in thesupernatant of activated splenocytes, that is responsible for up-regulation of LAG-3 on Bcells, can delay surface LAG-3 down-regulation, but only to a small extent (about 30%).These results suggest that proliferation stimulus is required not only for up-regulation ofLAG-3 on B cells, but also to keep LAG-3 surface levels up.954.5. Characterization of LAG-3 expression on dendritic cells.In order to comprehensively describe the expression pattern of LAG-3 in the immunesystem we also looked at various subsets of DCs.First, two subsets ('myeloid') cells wereanalyzed for LAG-3 expression. The isolated cells were cultured in the normal growthmedium in the absence or presence of various stimuli: TNF-, LPS, anti-CD40 Ab orcombination of all three (mix). The two DC populations were defined using CD11c andCD8 as markers (Figure 4.5.1 a). CD11c/CD8/LAG-3 DCs do not express LAG-3 on theirsurface. After 24 hours in culture without any stimulus, the subset of CD8- DCs up-regulated LAG-3 while CD8+ not. The LAG-3 expression on CD8- DCsubset increased even more upon treatment with various stimuli, of which LPS was mosteffective. LAG-3 expression on CD8- without any stimulus is likely the consequence, ofintegrin-mediated DC maturation caused by adhesion of DCs to plastic.Interestingly, none of the stimuli induced LAG-3 expression on CD8+ DCs and themajority of non-DC population remained negative as well. Staining of B7.2, a moleculeknown to be up-regulated after DC stimulation, confirmed that both DC subsets wereactivated (not shown).The observation that LPS can induce expression of LAG-3 on CD8- DCs in vitro wassupported by a set of in vivo experiments. C57BL6 mice were injected i.p. with LPS. Thistreatment was shown to induce DC maturation in the spleen (De Smedt et al., 1996).When both DC subsets, CD11c+CD8+ and CD11c+CD8-, were isolated from LPStreated mouse, only the CD8- fraction showed higher levels of LAG-3 compared to DCobtained from untreated animals (Figure 4.5.2).CD8- DCs are widely distributed in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, while theCD8+ DCs are found in the lymph nodes and spleen, and in the thymus where theypredominate (Steinman and CD8- express Spleen cells were enriched forDCs on Opti-prep\u00ae gradients and cells were cultured in the presence or absence ofindicated stimuli. (a) CD11c/CD8 staining upon LPS treatment in vivo.Balb/c mice were injected (i.p) with LPS (25 \u00b5g/ mouse) and LAG-3 staining wasperformed on spleen DCs after 24 hours. LAG-3 staining is shown in grey (dotted line),isotype control in black (solid line).absence of LAG-3 on CD8+ DCs, as well as on thymic T lymphocyte populations(Workman et al., 2002b), one could infer that LAG-3 is not important for developmentalevents in the thymus; consistent with the observations that positive and negative selectionof T cells appeared normal in LAG-3 deficient mice (Miyazaki et al., 1996).Perhaps the most striking biological difference between CD8+ and CD8- DC populations,however, is the ability of the DCs to induce Th1 biased cytokine response inreactive CD4 cells, whereas CD8- DCs tend Th2-biased response in vivo(reviewed in (Ardavin, 2003; Shortman and Liu, 2002)). Yet, both DC populations arecapable of inducing CTL responses and protective antiviral immunity in vivo (Ruedl andBachmann, 1999). Identification of LAG-3 CD8+ DCs, suggests thatLAG-3 on DCs might play a role in Th2 biased responses, B-cell activation andplasmablast differentiation.Subsequently, we also analyzed DC populations present in the LN.

G15shown shown in black.The presence of LAG-3 on pDCs suggests that this surface molecule might be involved inanti-viral responses. pDCs, also called interferon-producing cells, circulate as precursorcells in the blood or reside as immature cells in all lymphoid organs. They are the mainsource of type I interferons in response to viral infection (Asselin-Paturel et al., 2001).Type I interferons in turn, induce resistance to viral replication in all cells. The additionalobservation, supporting the involvement of LAG-3 in fighting viral infections, is that (aspresented in section 4.3) the activated CD8 T cells (the professional killers of infectedcells) show the highest levels of LAG-3 among in APC function.Since we were able to detect LAG-3 on the surface of activated APCs (DCs as well as Bcells) we wondered whether it is important for APC function. To address this question,we generated LAG-3 positive high levels of surfaceLAG-3, as detected by surface staining with mAb G15. A20LAG-3 - blue line, line, negative control- shaded area.A20 and A20LAG-3 cells were then loaded with increasing concentrations of HA-peptideand used to activate HA-specific CD4 T cell hybridoma - A5 cells (described in moredetail in section 4.1). At lower peptide concentrations and for all the time points tested (4to 14 hours) the higher percentage of A5 cells was activated by A20LAG-3 cells than byA20 cells transduced with an empty vector (Figure 4.6.2), indicating that A20 cellsexpressing LAG-3 are more efficient in triggering T cell activation. At high peptideconcentration and increased stimulation times, however, the effect was abolished, likelydue to saturation of the system. These experiments hinted that ectopic expression of highlevels of LAG-3 on the surface of B cells can indeed enhance their function as antigenpresenting cell.We then turned to a more physiological situation, that is the ex vivo B cells and examinedtheir potential to activate antigen specific T cells. In order to obtain LAG-3 positive andLAG-3 negative B cells, splenic cells from WT or LAG-3 deficient mice were activatedon immobilized anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs for 3 days. After this time of culture WT Bcells express LAG-3 on their surface (Figure 4.6.3). Live cells were isolated using Ficoll-PaqueTM density separation and loaded with various concentrations of OVA peptide. 100101102103104FL4-H101Figure 4.6.2. T cell activation by relevant peptide presented by A20 and A20LAG-3 cells.B cells loaded with HA peptide at indicated concentrations and used to activate A5 cellsfor varying times. The level of T cell activation was assessed by the percentage of greencells. The degree of T cell activation by A20LAG-3 cells is shown in blue. The level ofT cell activation by A20 cells transduced with empty pLXSP vector (A20vec) is shown inpink. Figure 4.6.3. B cells in co-culture with activated T cells express intermediate levels ofLAG-3 on their surface. Day 3 Abs activated splenocyte cultures were stained with antiCD-19 (a B cell marker) and anti-LAG-3 Abs. Both LAG-3 deficient (left panel) and WT(right panel) mouse cells cultures are shown. In both cultures the large majority of cellsare B cells; T cell probably die quicker by apoptosis under these efficient stimulatoryconditions.Since the activation state of APCs strongly affects the quality of T-B cell interactions, wealso made sure that the levels of co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of LAG-3positive and LAG-3 negative presenting cells do not differ. As shown in Figure 4.6.4,LAG-3 positive and LAG-3 negative B cells show the same levels of B7.1, B 7.2 andMHC class II. The levels of all three molecules are increased as compared to non-treatedsplenocytes, making them potent antigen presenting cells.HA 0.1 ug/mL LAG-3 negative (blue line) B cells showthe same level of activation. Day 3 anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 activated splenocytes (thesame culture as in Figure 4.6.4) were stained with anti-B 7.1 (left panel), anti-B7.2(middle panel) and anti- MHC class II (right panel) Abs. Both LAG-3 positive and LAG-3 negative B cells show increased levels of expression of these activation markers ascompared to non-treated splenocytes (red line).The peptide-loaded B cells were then used to activate CFSE labeled OVA-specifictransgenic CD4 T cells, isolated from OT-II mice (Barnden et al., 1998). After 6 days Tcell proliferation was determined by CFSE dilution, as shown in Figure 4.6.5a. Thestrength of the response of transgenic T cells was dependent on the OVA peptideconcentrations, over a wide range.Interestingly, at low peptide concentration (0.01 \u00b5M), LAG-3 deficient B cells were lessefficient in triggering T cell proliferation; only 50% of T cells activated by LAG-3deficient B cells divided, while more than 94% T cells divided when they were activatedwith LAG-3 positive B cells. At higher peptide concentration (0.1uM), the proliferationof T cells activated by LAG-3 deficient B cells was also clearly delayed, but much lowerpercentage of cells remained undivided (Figure 4.6.5 b).When presenting cells were flooded with the OVA peptide (1uM), the difference inantigen presentation by LAG-3 positive and LAG-3 negative B cells was not observed.This peptide concentration, however, led to the over-stimulation of T cells and increasedT cell death, unlikely resembling a healthy in vivo activation process.The observations that B cells expressing LAG-3 were more efficient in stimulatingantigen specific T cell proliferation than cells lacking LAG-3 shows that LAG-3 surfaceexpression can affect T cell triggering in trans.100101102103104FL2-H020406080100% of Max 100101102103104FL2-H020406080100% of Max 100101102103104FL2-H020406080100% of MaxB7.1 B7.2 class II103a) b) Figure 4.6.5.

As LAG-3 is known to formhomodimers, the interaction of LAG-3 on APCs with LAG-3 on T cells can beconsidered as a possible mode of action.Nevertheless, the above data indicates the LAG-3 involvement in APC GFP020406080100% of Max 100101102103104FL1-H: GFP020406080100% uM 0.1 uM 1 uMCFSE 05101520253035404550 WT B cellsKO B cells presenting cellspresenting cells% of non-divided OVA specific T cells1045. GENERAL DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTSAt the beginning of this study LAG-3 was considered to be a T and NK cell specificmolecule, involved in negative regulation of T cell responses. The work presented hereshows that LAG-3 expression in the immune system of a mouse is much broader. B cellsand DCs (especially pDCs) can be induced to express LAG-3 and LAG-3 positive B cellsare better APCs. These findings indicate a more complex role for LAG-3 in the immunesystem possibly also as a novel co-stimulatory molecule. One of the practical benefits ofthis work could be a new immunization protocol involving LAG-3 transfected APCs.Consistent with this idea, soluble LAG-3 has been previously shown to be a potentimmunostimulant for inducing antigen- or et al., 1999).LAG-3 expression on B cells is mediated by a soluble factor. Unfortunately, we havefailed to identify this factor among the known cytokines we tested. More intensive studiesare required to solve this issue. Potentially, it is a novel lymphokine involved in T-B cellcommunication. Identification of a T cell line producing this factor would greatlyfacilitate subsequent analysis.It is clear that MHC class II is a ligand for LAG-3. However, since activated CD4 andCD8 T cells, NK cells and APCs are all positive for LAG-3 it can be hypothesized thatLAG-3 has alternative ligand(s). To research this area one could produce LAG-3immunoglobulin (Ig) fusion proteins and use these as specific reagents in flow cytometryand in immunohistology to detect any binding to cells or tissues derived from MHC classII deficient mice. Further analysis could then lead to the characterization of the newputative ligand(s).The potential multiple roles of LAG-3 in the immune system are further emphasised bythe fact that LAG-3 exists not only in membrane bound form but also in a soluble form.Initially, soluble human LAG-3 was identified in the serum of healthy individuals(Annunziato et al., 1996). We show that soluble LAG-3, with the approximate molecularweight of 53kDa, can be easily detected in the supernatant of murine splenocytes105activated by TCR ligation (results section 4.4 Figure 4). Soluble LAG-3 can be producedby activated CD4 as well as activated CD8 T cells. It was found in high concentrations inculture supernatants, reaching 2 ug/ml, as determined by ELISA (data not shown).Concominantly, Li and co-workers showed that soluble LAG-3 (with the predictedmolecular weight of 54 kDa) is present in the supernatants of splenocyte cultures fromOT-II transgenic mice activated with OVA (Li et al., 2004). Moreover, they detected lowamounts of soluble LAG-3 in the sera ng/ml). of serum LAG-3 was also detectable in RAG-1- deficient mice (mice lacking Tcells and B cells), suggesting that NK cells might be the main source of soluble LAG-3 inthese mice. Alternatively, soluble LAG-3 could be produced by DCs (in particularpDCs).Furthermore, in the light of the classical regulatory T cell assay results presented here,LAG-3 involvement in regulatory T cell function becomes questionable. LAG-3 shouldnot be used as a specific marker for T cell activation, nor can it provide the means fordistinguishing the regulatory T cell population.Our results suggest that, indeed T cell function can also be controlled extrinsically byLAG-3, but when it is expressed on APCs, rather than on T regs.1066.
