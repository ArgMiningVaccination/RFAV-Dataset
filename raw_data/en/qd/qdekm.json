Welcome. This book is for both the beginner and the more advanced, and I have tried to cover as much as I can to encompass all levels. It not only explains in detail how to create wonderful natural products you can use for yourself or friends and family, it also provides a holistic view of working with the plant spirit - in itself, a potent medicine that works on the emotional and spiritual aspects of ourselves. Indigenous peoples from all around the world have worked with plant spirits for thousands of years, and this is how they came to know what specific plants were used for. There are many books already published on Plant Spirit Medicine that go into detail on how to connect with different plants and the theory behind it. This book is about exploring the 'making' side of things. I suggest you read some of the many wonderful books on this subject to help you learn about Plant Spirit Medicine more wholly. I recommend Sacred Plant Medicine by Stephen Harrod Buhner, who also wrote The Secret Teachings of Plants and The Lost Language of Plants. Other books I recommend are Plant Spirit Shamanism by Ross Heaven and Howard G. Charing, Plant Spirit Healing by Pam Montgomery, and Sacred Plant Initiations by Carole Guyett. I would ask you to do your own research where you can, experiment often until the processes become familiar and don't take shortcuts. If you are time poor, don't try and cram your practice into a small time slot. Make some time when you can immerse yourself into the work. Take time out of your routine, make a cuppa, slow down and give this your attention. Nature isn't out there racing, and to connect to it we need to be in alignment with it. As with any relationship, it takes time to get to know one another and it requires you to listen well. chapter 1 Plant Spirit Medicine lant Spirit Medicine. What is it? Why do we need it? How can it help me? All valid questions in this day and age. Our Western society has grown accustomed to quick fixes - drugs, painkillers to help us keep going despite the pain, cold and flu drugs to push us through our colds instead of resting. We've all done it - we've all had to at some stage. We have to keep pushing through to make money to put a roof over our head and food on the table. The world is travelling at such a speed, it feels like we are going to hit the wall soon, and for many of us, that time has already come. We are exhausted; we are depleted; we are losing stamina, motivation and hope at times. Many of us are becoming increasingly unwell, and this is not only from constant stress, poor diet and a sedentary life, but also from our disconnect to the natural world around us. Our modern world has created such stressors and separation from the natural world that we have become spiritually malnourished. This lack of attending to our spirit's needs is creating dis-ease on a mass scale. We are so busy looking at how to fix our physical body that we are not spending enough time looking at what our spirit needs. We have isolated ourselves from that which should be sustaining us physically, emotionally and spiritually. We are searching for meaning and wanting to look after ourselves better. We are dealing with traumas in our lives, while still needing to soldier on. These are the issues that can stop us from getting better. There is no magic pharmaceutical pill for these kind of issues. Obviously not all of us feel like this, not all of us are in search of medicine at this time. For those who are, Plant Spirit Medicine can help heal the parts of our soul and psyche that is so desperately needed at this time. Having trained in both Western Herbal Medicine and Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine, I felt one essential piece was completely overlooked in my training - working with the plant spirit. In fact, working with the physical plant, full stop. When I had finished my Western Herbal Medicine degree, I knew the properties of the herbs inside and out and how to treat many conditions effectively, yet if I were to walk through an actual herb garden, I wouldn't be able to point out more than a handful of herbs. Our learning was all on paper and the herbs we used came as tinctures - herbal liquids in brown bottles. Sometimes we are referred to as the brown-bottle herbalists. We didn't gather our own herbs; we didn't get to know the herbs and their cycles. I would leave at the end of the day with herb dust in my hair and up my nose - and I felt great! The same can be said for my Chinese Herbal Medicine degree, although we did work more closely with the dried herb in many dispensaries, and these were the days I cherished in clinic. I came alive when I walked in the door. I could feel, smell and see the herbs everywhere. I tasted them, I handled them, and I just wanted to make things with them. I always put my hand up to do all the herb grinding to make powders, and I would leave at the end of the day with herb dust in my hair and up my nose - and I felt great! Other clinics, however, only stocked herb pills and powdered herbs in plastic bottles. Now don't get me wrong - all these methods of herbal treatment still work, and I've seen incredible results in patients that doctors have had no success with. I don't get on the bandwagon of taking sides of herbalists vs doctors either. Each have their place and one must always seek out the treatment that works for them. In the hospitals in China, the doctors are dual trained in western and eastern medicine. I did a three-week internship in a hospital in Nanjing. It was incredible to see the whole hospital use both pharmaceuticals, herbs and acupuncture if required. It was all about what the patient needed and what worked the most effectively, and there was no contest between which was better. One thing I did notice in clinic was a very high success rate when people opted to use the raw Chinese herbs. The less processed western herbal tinctures also worked well, but there was still something missing. For me, I always wondered if the processing of a herb, which meant the more interference with it, decreased the effectiveness due to not respecting the plant spirit. In both Western and Chinese Medicine we look at the individual as a whole. Emotions, environment, diet - everything is taken into consideration when looking at an imbalance and the cause. But when it comes to prescribing herbs, we look at the physical action on the body, and not what a herb can do with the emotional or spiritual body. In Western Herbal Medicine, we could also use flower essences to address emotional or behavioural issues. A person's lifestyle, behaviours or emotional status may be the major factor contributing to or creating their illness and this needs to be addressed. We learn at university how these factors have a big impact on the body, but we don't address the many ways to change them. Some issues are obvious, and others are multi-layered. Sometimes it is not our place to delve into matters that we are not trained in, so why then are we not trained in these matters more fully? There are subjects that a university will not touch on generally because they will never get it passed through the appropriate channels. This is where Plant Spirit Medicine falls. I doubt in my lifetime anyone will be able to go to uni to learn about shamanic principles, like that of soul loss and journeying to meet plant spirits. This is where our disconnect lies in our healing training. Obviously, we are able to refer people on to psychologists and counsellors, and these modalities can also help greatly, but there is still the spiritual healing side of things that is so grossly left untouched and so needed at this time. This is why there has been such growth in the spiritual industry - people are searching for their own answers and healing. Soul loss is an important area in shamanism. When we experience trauma, sometimes it can be too much for the soul or spirit to handle. The soul is then said to fragment, and these fragments can remain trapped in that time and experience, too afraid to move forward. Our soul can fragment many times over our lifetimes and also in previous lives as well. This causes a feeling of being not quite ourselves and can manifest as illnesses that won't budge or patterns that keep playing out in our lives and we can't understand why. This is where we would call on a shaman to journey for us to find our missing soul pieces, ask them to come back and let them know it is now safe for them to return. I have experienced profound changes within myself after completing these exercises. Celtic shamanism There are many forms of shamanism around the world and each have their own deities and totem animals, but all have common traits that link them. Shamanism is not a religion; it is a spiritual practice. It can be practised alongside any religion or not encompass religion at all. It is not about worship; it's about respect for nature and every living creature on earth. It's about becoming one with nature's cycles and learning that we are a part of everything. Spirit resides in every living creature on this planet, and shamans believe we can communicate with all living beings because we are all created by spirit, and we are spirit. People may view shamans as having a special ability - however, my belief is that anyone is capable of this. It's just that, as a species, we have forgotten how to do it. Why have I chosen Celtic shamanism? Being of Scottish descent, perhaps that's why I was drawn to it - ancestrally, it is in my blood. I cannot describe it, but I have always felt drawn to my heritage. As I looked into Celtic shamanism more and more, it made so much sense to me. I really resonated with the teachings. The Celts are recognised as being from Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales; however, many Celts came from all over Europe and incorporated their own practices with those of the indigenous people of the United Kingdom. The Celts themselves actually never used the word 'shamanism'. They called such people 'walkers between the worlds'. They were seen as being interpreters of the spirit realms. In other countries, shamans are described as 'having one foot in both worlds', which again indicates their ability to communicate with other realms. A natural gift for many Celts, second sight (da shealladh) enabled a person to have visions, strong intuition and divinatory abilities, and was another way they could communicate with other-world beings. Western society has lost a significant portion of the knowledge our ancestors once had, knowledge that allowed our ancestors to understand the workings of nature and our part in it. They knew they were not separate from the world around them but were part of it. They worked in harmony, and if only there had not been such a disruption in their practices I can only imagine where we would be now. This knowledge is still practised in many indigenous cultures around the world. Regardless of which continent they are from, the indigenes have many common practices, but most importantly they have respect for all of nature and creation both big "}
