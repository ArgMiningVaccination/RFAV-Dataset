Accreditation Overview Affirmative Action Nondiscrimination Policy Accommodation for Disability The Academic Calendar\u20142008-2009 12 UNIVERSITY CATALOG President's Welcome It is a privilege to welcome you to Loma Linda University. This is a very unique place\u2014one that balances on the twin foundations of Faith and Science. We believe we have a divinely ordained mission to push these boundaries into increasing avenues of service and discovery. Being a student here will expose you to a group of faculty and staff who have chosen to be part of this experience we call Loma Linda. They have chosen to work here because they share in the belief that this is a special place. We have chosen to concentrate on what we call Mission-Focused Learning. This means that all we seek to offer here at Loma Linda is centered on a much greater theme than producing knowledgeable professionals, because we believe that who you are is even more important than what you know. To assist in this life long process, we are encouraging the enculturation of our seven core values, known by the acronym of JCHIEFS. These are Justice, Compassion, Humility, Integrity, Excellence, Freedom, and Self-Control/Purity. I encourage each of you to search your own heart and find ways to strengthen these virtues in everything you do. You also will find here an incredible mixture of cultural diversity. Revel in our differences and use each exposure to help you understand the issues that separate us. With understanding comes acceptance. And with acceptance, comes peace and fellowship. So use your time at Loma Linda to seek out those from other countries and cultures to learn and understand. We will all be better by bridging those barriers that often separate us. All this uniqueness is centered on the profound belief that God is here, active in the lives and experiences of each of us. Thr ough our weekly Campus Worship, the prayers of faculty in class, and the daily interchanges across campus, I invite you to join me i n getting to know Him better. Place your future in His hands. Have confidence in His leading. Seek out opportunities to fellowshi p and grow in His love. Thank you for joining our campus family. I hope it will become as special to you as it has for so many of our 25,000 alumni. Cordially yours, Richard H. Hart, M.D., Dr.P.H. President Loma Linda University PROGRAMS, DEGREES, AND CERTIFICATES 13 Programs, Degrees, and Certificates The degree and certificate curricula at Loma Linda University are under continuous review and are, therefore, subject to change and improvement without prior notice, as the need occurs.

The University's affirmative action policy is to provide equal access to admissions, educational programs and activities, financial aid, student services, and employment. In compliance with Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a grievance procedure has been established to process student complaints alleging violation of these regulations or of the University's policy of nondiscrimination based on gender or disability. Inquiries concerning Title IX may be directed to the affirmative action officer. Employment-related discrimination complaints, including those filed by student employees, are processed in conformity with the provisions outlined in existing staff pers onnel policies. Complaints related to discrimination in academic areas are reviewed in conformity with the procedures established by the academic administration. ACCOMMODATION FOR DISABILITY 19 Accommodation for Disability Loma Linda University is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Sec. 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as well as with local and state requirements. The University is committed to providing education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applicants for whom such accommodation does not fundamentally alter the chosen program or create an undue burden. For information regarding accommodation for disability, the student should consult the office of the dean of the school to whic h application for admission is being made. Following acceptance, the student may be asked if he or she has a disability requiring accommodation. A student who desires accommodation for a disability (e.g., physical, learning, or psychological) identified after acceptance should consult the offi ce of the dean regarding a request for accommodation. The accommodation request must be submitted in writing on the designated form. The completed form and the required supporting documentation will be evaluated by appropriate University entities to determine whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. All discussions will remain confidential. 20 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Nondiscrimination Policy Loma Linda University was established by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as an integral part of its teaching ministry. The University affirms that Christian principles are incompatible with various forms of discrimination that have divided societies, and that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and should be so regarded by all His people. Therefore, the University is committed to equal education and employment opportunities for men and women of all races; and does not discriminate on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national origin in its educational or admissions policies, financial affairs, employ ment programs, student life and services, or any University-administered program. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended; and is in substantial compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (34 CFR 106 et seq.), Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Adjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employees or applicants for employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans of the Vietnam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without discriminati on on the basis of age\u2014except in those programs where age is a bona fide academic qualification for admission\u2014in accordance with the provisions of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The University reserves Constitutional and statutory rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seven th- day Adventists in admissions and employment, including but not limited to 42 U.S.C. Secs. 2000e-1, 2000e-2; Sec. 6-15 of Sec. 12926 (d)(1); Title II, Division 4, Chapter 2, Sec. 7286.5 of the California Code of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and Article 1, Sec. 4, of the California Constitution. The University believes that Title IX regulations are subject to constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entanglement with or infringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The University expects students and employees to uphold biblical principles of mora lity and deportment as interpreted by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The University claims exemptions from the provisions of Title IX set forth in ACADEMIC CALENDAR 21 The Academic Calendar Academic dates for Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) and the Schools of\u2014

truth; Expanding knowledge through research in the biological, behavioral, physical, and environmental sciences; and applying this knowledge to health and disease; Providing comprehensive, competent, and compassionate health care for the whole person through faculty, students, and alumni. In harmony with our heritage and global mission: We encourage personal and professional growth through integrated development of the intellectual, physical, social, and spiritual dimensions of each member of the University community and those we serve. We promote an environment that reflects and builds respect for the diversity of humanity as ordained by God. We seek to serve a worldwide community by promoting healthful living, caring for the sick, and sharing the good news of a loving God. To achieve our mission we are committed to: Our Students Our primary responsibility is the education of students\u2014who come from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, enabling them to acquire the foundation of knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors appropriate for their chosen academic or healt h care ministry. We nurture their intellectual curiosity. We facilitate their development into active, independent learners. We provide continuing educational opportunities for our alumni and professional peers. We encourage a personal Christian faith tha t permeates the lives of those we educate. Our Faculty, Staff, and Administration We respect our faculty, staff, and administration who through education, research, and service create a stimulating learning environment for our students. They contribute to the development of new understandings in their chosen fields. They demonstrate both Christian values and competence in their scholarship and professions. Our Patients and Others We Serve We provide humanitarian service through people, programs, and facilities.

We support the global mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church by responding to the need for skilled Christian health professionals and scholars. We seek to honor God and to uphold the values of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and its commitment to awakening inquiry. We are drawn by love to share the good news of God expressed through the life and gospel of Jesus Christ and to hasten His return. A Seventh-day Adventist health-sciences institution UNIVERSITY PHILOSOPHY 29 University Philosophy As implied by its motto, \"TO MAKE MAN WHOLE,\" the University affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. \"Wholeness means the lifelong, harmonious development of the physical, intellectual, emotional, relational, cultural and spirit ual dimensions of a person's life, unified through a loving relationship with God and expressed in generous service to others.\" Quoted in \"The Grace of Wholeness\" by Gerald R. Winslow, Ph.D., SCOPE, Spring 1999. Also quoted as the adopted definition of wholeness in the Loma Linda University Wholeness Inventory. 30 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Core Values The University affirms these values as central to its view of education. COMPASSION \u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and sufferings of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which Loma Linda University has taken as a central symbol of our work. INTEGRITY \u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are well-considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. EXCELLENCE \u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. FREEDOM \u2014The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery but to freedom. JUSTICE \u2014The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could be genuine only when it led the believers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" PURITY/SELF-CONTROL \u2014The commitment to be morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. HUMILITY \u2014The willingness to serve others in a sacrificial manner, and the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance. STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES 31 Student Learning Outcomes The Loma Linda University Student Learning Outcomes are in the process of being implemented throughout all degree programs within the university. The Office of Assessment and Institutional Learning is working with programs to guide the assessment of these outcomes. All degree programs have articulated their learning outcomes that will also reflect the universi ty's value of educational effectiveness. Outcome 1 Students understand and apply the University philosophy of wholeness into their personal and professional lives. Outcome 2 Students understand the importance of integrating LLU's Christ-centered values in their personal and professional lives. Outcome 3 Students demonstrate critical thinking. Outcome 4 Students develop a commitment to discovery and life-long learning. Outcome 5 Students demonstrate effective communication skills in English. Outcome 6 Students demonstrate effective use of technology appropriate to the discipline. Outcome 7 Students understand the importance of embracing and serving a diverse world. Outcome 8 Students demonstrate the importance of collaborating with others within and across disciplines. 32 UNIVERSITY CATALOG University Mace, Coat of Arms, and Seal Traditionally the ceremonial mace represents the authority vested in the highest officer of a governing body. In an educational institution, the authority symbolized by the mace derives from respect for the authority of knowledge and for the rights and va lue of the individual. Thus the leader of an academic community assumes the obligation and challenge to ensure for its members a climate conducive to growth in knowledge and grace. The construction of the ceremonial mace of Loma Linda University evokes further ideas. Its two metals, bronze and aluminum, suggest the value of lessons both ancient and contemporary. Rather than lying prone, an instrument to be wielded, this mace stands upright in celebration of the human spirit. Its open cons truction implies free exposure to questions, ideas, and conflic t. The eight vertical supporting elements (at three points bound together as for strength and stability in unity) uphold a graceful ov al that points outward to the universe, the province of inquiry. Within the oval, the University seal appears to float unfettered. The basic design of the coat of arms and the seal of Loma Lin da University\u2014established in 1905 as the College of Medical Evangelists\u2014is a contemporary modification of the shield, a heraldic device. Within the seal, the broken sword suggests the compassion and mercy of those who serve others with love, selflessness, and restraint from attitudes of self-aggrandizement and acts of destructiveness. The lighted torch symbolizes the learner's zeal to advance truth. It also suggests the illuminating power of knowledge and the University's central purpose of forwarding and perpetuating good through the enlightened, searching, caring mind and conscience of the individual. The ancient staff of Aesculapius, long associated with medicine, represents in the modern and broad sense the combined services of all the healing arts and sciences. Across the base of the shield the open book symbolizes the Word of God\u2014the foundation of all truth, the source of the Christ- centered commission, the inspiration for all endeavor of humanity for humanity. Framing the shield are, at the left, the wreath of oak leaves and acorns, presented in ancient times to honor the civic contrib ution of one who had saved his brother-citizen's life; and, at the right, the wreath of laurel, presented to honor personal achieveme nt. The emblems of the seal imply that one who has the privilege of learning also has the obligation of valor and honor. On the scr oll below the shield is the motto\u2014adopted in 1955 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this institution\u2014To Make Man Whole. UNIVERSITY FOUNDATIONS 33 University Foundations HISTORY Loma Linda University is part of the Seventh-day Adventist system of higher education. In 1905 the University (formerly College of Medical Evangelists) was founded\u2014through a series of divine providences\u2014at Loma Linda, California, by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The School of Nursing began in 1905. In 1909, the College of Medical Evangelists received its charter as a medical school with the express purpose of preparing physicians who could meet the needs of the whole person. Both schools emphasized the need for healthful living as a part of medical care, a revolutionary concept in 1905. The University was designated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church as a center for educating health professionals. The original schools\u2014Nursing and Medicine\u2014have been joined by Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Public Health, Science and Technology, and Religion; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The curricula of the University are approved by their respective professional organizations. From its small beginnings, the University has achieved widespread recognition, having sent more of its graduates into international service than has any other university. It remains committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. From 1918 to 1962, the University operated within health facilities in two cities: Loma Linda and Los Angeles. In September 1962 all health-professional education was consolidated at Loma Linda. In 1967 Loma Linda University Medical Center opened in its new three-tower facility, a landmark cloverleaf structure. The medical center continues on the cutting edge of health ca re, providing excellent service for patients and expanding educational opportun ities for students. In 1990 the Board of Trustees designated Loma Linda University a health-sciences university\u2014part of a complex comprised of Loma Linda University Medical Center, faculty-practice plans, and affiliated institutions. The University is a leader in the field of health-sciences education, research, and service. The most current campus census figures (April 2008) indicate that the core of the combined faculties consists of 1,299 full-tim e teachers. Part-time and voluntary teachers (1,423\u2014largely clinicians in the professional curricula) bring the total to 2,722. A s of Autumn Quarter 2007, 732 students from 95 countries outside the United States are represented in the enrollment of 4,078. 34 UNIVERSITY CATALOG A CENTURY OF SERVICE Today the original 1905 property is part of an expanding health sciences campus, which includes: three medical facilities, licensed for approximately 900 beds\u2014 o Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC), 1966 o Loma Linda University Children's Hospital (LLUCH), 1993 o Loma Linda University East Campus Hospital (LLUECH), 2003 licensed under LLUMC as Loma Linda University Community Medical Center (LLUCMC), 1993\u2014formerly known as Loma Linda Community Hospital; an acute psychiatric care facility, licensed in 1991 for 89 beds\u2014the Loma Linda University Behavioral Medicine Center (LLUBMC); five Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center (LLUAHSC) institutes, two LLU research centers, and various school-related research centers (see Learning Resources); and Loma Linda University (on-campus, distance-education, and online degree programs through the Schools of Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health, and Religion; and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. 1905 School of Nursing opens 1909 School of Medicine, renamed the College of Medical Evangelists (CME) 1922 Department of Dietetics 1937 School of Medical Technology* 1941 School of Physical Therapy* 1945 Radiologic Technology Program* 1948 School of Tropical & Preventive Medicine (reorganized as School of Public Health, 1964) 1954 Graduate School (restructured as Faculty of Graduate Studies in 2005) 1953 School of Dentistry 1958 Dental Hygiene Program 1959 Occupational Therapy Program* 1963 Medical Records Administration Program* 1966 Schools/Programs (see * above) consolidated as the School of Allied Health Professions 1967 Loma Linda University campus merges with La Sierra College 1968 Loma Linda University Medical Center dedicated 1990 Loma Linda and La Sierra campuses become two separate universities 1990 School of Religion 1991 Loma Linda University designated a health-sciences university 1997 Loma Linda University and Medical Center (corporately linked together through Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center\u2014LLUAHSC) 2002 School of Pharmacy 2003 School of Science and Technology A UNIQUE UNIVERSITY 35 A Unique University Loma Linda University has always combined a devotion to academic excellence with a concern for spiritual values and a high sense of mission. The motto of the University, \"to make man whole,\" illustrates the sense of destiny felt in the University community to act its part in God's ongoing plan for healing and restoring human beings to live with Him in wholeness, both now and in eternity. While Loma Linda University has changed in many ways since its beginning in 1905, the biblical principles that provide its foundation have remained unchanged. SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST HERITAGE Loma Linda University is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and has a deep commitment to respecting the rich diversity of its student body. It views respect and sensitivity for all people, regardless of their culture and ethnic ity, as a part of true Christianity. We recognize that students come from many different faiths. This University has a tradition of relig ious liberty, and it highly respects students' religious values that differ from ours. We look upon the various perspectives of each spiritually committed student as enriching to our campus and educational environment. OUR UNIQUE FEATURES Two distinctive features of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which are a part of the Loma Linda experience, become evident to first-time students. The first is the concept of the Sabbath rest, which reminds us of God as Creator. Adventists realize th is in part by celebrating Saturday as the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. During these hours University offices, laboratories, libraries, study halls, and recreation facilities are closed to give time for physical and spiritual renewal and worship. A second distinctive feature worth noting is the emphasis on health and wellness. Students will be able to exercise in our recreation and wellness center, a health-and-fitness complex that received a national award for excellence in utility and desig n. The cafeterias on campus feature well-prepared vegetarian meals. Note also that the University holds that a drug-alcohol-, and tobacco-free lifestyle is essential for achieving the goal of \"wholeness.\" This means that all students agree to refrain from t he use of tobacco, alcohol, and other \"recreational\" drugs while enrolled at the University. 36 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Spiritual Life Worship experiences represent a critical dimension of the educational experience at Loma Linda University and are available to the student many times throughout the week. In addition to regular Friday evening and Saturday services, many class, school, club, and University activities include a component of worship and praise to God. CHAPEL SERVICES In keeping with the commitment of our mission, Loma Linda University students have special requirements, such as chapel service attendance each Wednesday morning in the University Church. The chapel programs provide a variety of opportunities to integrate faith and learning. Undergraduates who live in the residence halls are also expected to attend worships in the reside nce halls each week. RELIGION CLASSES Classes in religion are part of the core curriculum in each of the University's schools and programs. These classes deal with th e study of the Bible, ethics, clinical ministry (which concentrates on ways to understand and meet the spiritual needs of patient s in a manner that is noninvasive and individually appropriate), and a variety of other issues related to the student's field of stu dy and personal spiritual journey. All students who choose Loma Linda as their university make a commitment to conduct their lives in a manner that reflects their sense of responsibility for the honor and integrity of the University and themselves as members of its community. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT 37 Learning Environment Loma Linda University is dedicated to creating a learning environment that promotes the lifelong pursuit of knowledge, wisdom, and skills used for selfless service to mankind. Through intentional educational strategies, Loma Linda University interweaves its vision, mission, and core values with its student learning outcomes. The University's mission of wholeness giv es focus to the learning environment that balances mind, body, and spirit (psycho-social-physical-spiritual)) and gives meaning to the motto of mission-focused learning. In this health care institution critical and analytical thinking skills in the health, behavioral, and natural sciences are blended with a commitment to spiritual and moral development. Loma Linda University pledges to students, staff, faculty, alumni, and to the local and global community its commitment to upholding integrity, valuing diversity, engaging with the community in service-learning scholarship, and honoring the process o f ongoing self-assessment for the purpose of continuous quality improvement. The University and each of its schools, programs, and classes provide clearly defined student learning outcomes and measurable performance indicators to create a learning atmosphere that is clear and focused. The University is engaged in systematic academic program review. Curricular maps are maintained for each program to assure alignment between student learning outcomes and planned academic activities. Program review follows carefully developed schedules as outlined in each sc hool-specific assessment matrices. Loma Linda University is committed to using assessment data to guide academic and fiscal master planning for the University. The total resources of the University offer a wealth of opportunity to the student with initiative and willingness to develop individual capacity to the fullest extent. The academic resources, affiliated clinical facilities, and community agencies const itute a rich educational environment both in classroom instruction and in guided experience. Major facilities utilized for clinical affiliations and internships include the University Medical Center; the Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center; and numerous other hospitals and agencies located in the Redlands, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Los Angeles areas, as well as throughout the United States and abroad. In addition, students find varied opportunities for service and learning in the immedi ate University community, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs. 38 UNIVERSITY CATALOG UNIVERSITY STUDENT MISSION-FOCUSED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES Students for International Mission Service (SIMS) Students find varied opportunities for service and learning in the immediate University community, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs.

UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES Major library resources Specialized libraries are located in various medical and school departments and other entities on campus. In addition, the following four major library resources on campus support the University's academic programs: the Del E. Webb Memorial Library, the Jesse Medical Library and Information Center the Rehabilitation Library (East Campus), and the Veterans Administration Library Services. The central library The historical roots of the Del E. Webb Memorial Library\u2014the central library of Loma Linda University\u2014go back to 1907, when a small library collection was started in a room of the old Loma Linda Sanitarium. In 1953 the growing collection was moved to its own building on the Loma Linda campus. In 1981 a new library was built, funded by a Del E. Webb Foundation grant, giving the library a total floor space of 87,670 square feet. This structure now houses the main library; while the old structure is now shared between the Department of Archives and Special Collections and the bound retrospective journals. As of June 2007, the library had a total collection of 391,754 books and bound journals; 227,989 print and electronic books; and 19,2 69 current print and electronic journal titles. For more detailed information consult <http://www.llu.edu/llu/library/about/librarystats.html>. Library mission The mission of the Library is to stimulate and support the information needs of the University's instructional, research, and service programs. To this end, the Library provides a full range of information-support services\u2014including, but not limited to, reference, circulation, reserve, and access to the Internet. The Library also provides online databases, some with full text; e nd- user training programs; interlibrary loans; photocopy services; a computer laboratory; class-integrated, library- instruction programs; and services that support distance education and University outreach programs. Access to resources The Del E. Webb Memorial Library's Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) provides integrated access to all campus library collections. In addition to the collections of the Del E. Webb Memorial Library and of the Jesse Medical Library, there are LEARNING ENVIRONMENT 39 Nursing Skills Lab, Bioethics, East Campus, Nutrition, Occupational Therapy, and Geoscience Research Center collections. The OPAC also provides access to the combined collections of some thirty-nine libraries through Link Plus, a book-request service and union catalog of more than 8 million records. The Library's Web site serves as a gateway to all electronic resources in ou r system, as well as those resources available on the Internet. The Library participates in national and regional networks\u2014such as the National Network of the Libraries of Medicine, founded by the National Library of Medicine. This structure is divided into eight regional sections, one of which is the Pacific Southw est Region. The Del E. Webb Memorial Library belongs to this region and is the designated medical-resource library for San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Local library cooperatives include the Inland Empire Academic Library Cooperative (IEALC) and San Bernardino, Inyo, Riverside Counties United Library Services (SIRCULS). Membership in these cooperatives gives Loma Linda University students, faculty, and staff access to the collections of these libraries, archives, and special collections. Archives and special collections The Department of Archives and Special Collections is the central repository of information on the history of Loma Linda University, the health sciences, and major collections on Adventism. It includes print materials; rare sound recordings; several thousand photographs; and archival materials, including papers of various denominational and University officials, as well as the congressional papers of the Honorable Jerry and Shirley Pettis. Searchable digitized indexes for various document files are also available via the Library's Web site.

This deposit is deducted from the tuition and fees due at the initial registration. Applicant's records The application and all supporting records and documents become the property of the University. TRANSCRIPTS Incoming Applicants must provide official transcripts of all postsecondary education prior to offers of admission. Official final transc ripts documenting completion of all course work taken between the time of application and matriculation must be received within the first quarter of enrollment. Applicants to programs that require a bachelor's degree must submit documentation (e.g., letter fr om registrar, school dean, or designee) of completion of bachelor's degree prior to matriculation. Subsequent enrollment is contin gent upon the previous submission of all official final transcripts. Applicants are required to furnish evidence (transcripts, GED, CHSPE, or equivalent) of completion of high school in order to be granted admission to undergraduate programs of the University. The final transcript must include the date of graduation. Those students who hold an associate's degree from a regionally accredited college/university upon admission do not need to furnish a high school transcript, unless required to validate specific course work. The University accepts only official transcripts sent directly to Loma Linda University from the college, university, or high school issuing it. Transcripts submitted by the student are not considered official. Applicants who have attended international schools are required to submit official transcripts (mark sheets) in the original language, which convey the grade and credits earned in each subject; and an English translation of their transcripts, if not al ready in English. In accordance with the United States immigration regulations, international applicants can be evaluated on the basi s of a previewed unofficial copy of their transcripts, on the condition that the University receives official transcripts before the admission is finalized. Applicants to programs that require a bachelor's degree must submit documentation of completion of a bachelor's degree prior to matriculation. Official education transcripts (or mark sheets), degrees earned from international institutions, or professional credentials mu st be sent to an evaluation center approved by Loma Linda University. The center reports the evaluation results directly to the Offic e of University Admissions. Transcripts and evaluation results received by the University become the property of the University and will not be released to the student or forwarded to any other institution. Outgoing The University provides transcripts to other institutions or to the student or graduate only upon written request of the student or graduate. The University reserves the right to withhold all information concerning the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of accounts or other charges, including student loans.

(Example: A student who enrolled for Autumn Quarter, but who does not enroll for Winter Quarter, will be inactivated at the close of registration [two weeks into the quarter] for the subsequent Spring Quarter). Inactivated or formally withdrawn students who wish to return to complete their degree program are required to reapply with sufficient time for adequate review of any new transcript credits and advisement of any new program requirements. The reapplication process also requires the submission of official transcripts from all colleges/universities attended since th e student last attended this University. Official transcripts from colleges/universities the student attended while enrolled at t his University must also be submitted if they were not submitted prior to inactivation. Students who reapply to a program are subject to the program requirements published in the Catalog in effect at the time of re- entry. All graduates are expected to have documented current knowledge in their field of study as of the date of graduation (da te on diploma). Leave-of-absence status does not extend the student's five-year (master's) or seven-year (doctoral) time limit for completion o f a degree program. If the re-applicant is within a year of his/her time limit at the time of reapplication, or if the time limit h as expired and the re-applicant is requesting re-admission and a time extension, then s/he must submit a quarter-by-quarter plan f or meeting all degree requirements.

Continuing education (CE) Continuing-education status is given to a student who is registered for a continuing-education course earning continuing- education units (CEUs). ADVISEMENT Upon admission into a degree program, each student is assigned an academic adviser\u2014a faculty member in the student's major department who serves as the student's first line of communication in addressing professional and personal successes and potential challenges. Faculty advisers are prepared to discuss career opportunities, academic policies, academic problems, curriculum, and personal circumstances. It is the student's responsibility to consult with his/her adviser in planning the program of study. Thereafter, advisees shoul d schedule counseling sessions with their advisers to monitor progress and assure completion of degree requirements. When questions arise relating to curriculum or policy requirements, students should always refer first to the CATALOG and their own program curriculum outline. Next, they may seek counsel from their academic adviser. Questions arising after discussion with th e adviser should be referred to the department chair or the academic dean. Orientation and advisement sessions are scheduled for all new students. These sessions provide general guidance regarding student services, health care, library resources, safety and security, registration procedures, and academic policy. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS International applicants (non-U.S. citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents) must meet all admissions requirements for the chosen program before an offer of acceptance can be issued. This includes providing evidence of their ability to meet estimated living expenses and all financial obligations to the University that will occur during their program. ENGLISH PROFICIENCY Regardless of nationality or citizenship, an applicant whose native language is not English and whose secondary education has been completed outside the U.S. is required to pass the TOEFL, the MTELP, or their equivalents.

Finances and employment United States immigration regulations and Loma Linda University require that international students must be prepared to provide an advance deposit and must provide documentation that additional funds will be forthcoming to meet school expenses. The deposit will be held by the University during the program of study and will be applied to the last quarter's tuition charge. Alternatively, the deposit may be refunded, less any outstanding balance on the account, if the student is denied a visa or terminates his/her program. Scholarships and assistantships for international students are scarce, and employment is limited for F- and J-visa students to no more than twenty hours per week. Unless special permission is given by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, international students are restricted to employment on campus. 46 UNIVERSITY CATALOG VISAS F-1 student visas Loma Linda University is authorized by the United States Department of Homeland Security to issue F-visa applications (i.e., I- 20 forms). The F-1 student visa is the visa of choice for most international students coming to Loma Linda University. This vis a allows some nondegree study (e.g., certificates, preceptorships, and English-as-a-second-language studies). Degree-earning students are subject to study-load requirements and are allowed limited on-campus employment. The I-20 is issued after a student: 1. has been accepted into a program and all official transcripts (mark sheets) have been received by the University, 2. has paid the advance deposit, and 3. has documented his/her financial plan for the chosen program. International Student and Scholar Services can be contacted at 909/558-4955 for further information regarding F-1 student visas and the regulations governing these visas. J-visa exchange program Loma Linda University has an Exchange Visitor Program that is approved by the U.S. Department of State. This J-visa exchange program is authorized to sponsor/host degree-earning students, nondegree (continuing education) students, short-term scholars, visiting professors, and research scholars. The J-visa form, DS-2019, is issued after an exchange visitor has been accepted int o a program, scholar position, or professor position; and has documented his/her financial plan (including health insurance for J-1 and J-2 dependents). Loma Linda University also hosts exchange visitors who are sponsored by other organizations (e.g., Fulbright scholars). As a hosting institution, Loma Linda University has limited authority over an exchange visitor since the authority resides in the sponsoring organization. Under current exchange visitor regulations, J-2 dependents are allowed to enroll part or full time at Loma Linda University. Al so, their credits earned can be either degree or nondegree applicable. J-1 exchange visitors are allowed to work; but employment guidelines differ, depending on the exchange category. Contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955 for further information and regulations governing the Exchange Visitor Program. Other visas Internationals may enter the U.S. on a wide variety of visas. However, a visa may have to be changed before a student can commence academic studies at this University. For further information regarding regulations and study options for specific visa types, contact International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. Study load Both the F- and J-student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full study load during each quarter of each academic year (as defined by each program). A minimum of 12 units per quarter is usually considered full time for an undergraduate program; 8 units per quarter is considered full time for a graduate program. In any quarter in which there will b e a reduced study load, prior approval is needed from an international student adviser in International Student and Scholar Service s. Transfer students International students currently attending other schools in the United States who have either an I-20 or a DS-2019 and who wish to attend Loma Linda University must do a school-to-school transfer. The timing of a transfer is critical in order to maintain visa status; therefore, it is important to consult with an international adviser at each school as soon as the acceptance letter is received. Study load Both the F- and J-student-visa regulations require the successful completion of a full study load during each quarter of every academic year (as defined by each program). A minimum of 12 units per quarter is usually considered full time for an undergraduate program; 8 units per quarter is considered full time for a graduate program. In any quarter in which there will b e a reduced study load, prior approval is needed from an international student adviser in International Student and Scholar Service s. DIVISION OF GENERAL STUDIES 47 Division of General Studies GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS The Division of General Studies offers general education courses that contribute to the fulfillment of requirements that apply to the Bachelor of Science degree programs in the Schools of Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing, and Public Health. In addition, these schools offer a variety of general education courses that are open to students across all schools. The Division of General Studies also provides oversight for courses that may be selected to enrich a student's academic experience but which do not fulfill Loma Linda University general education requirements. LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY PHILOSOPHY OF GENERAL EDUCATION As a Seventh-day Adventist health-sciences institution, Loma Linda University seeks to exemplify a life of service and sensitiv ity beyond the requirements of academic excellence within a professional discipline. With its rich spiritual heritage, the Universi ty places special emphasis on educating its students for a life of service in a global community. General education at Loma Linda University consists of courses, lectures, programs, and activities coordinated with the intent to integrate faith and learning. In addition to the basics of cultural heritage and diversity, scientific inquiry and analysis, communication, and wellness, the curriculum emphasizes the University's spiritual heritage; as well as moral and ethical decisi on making that is grounded in Christian principles. Thus, a general education is considered to be the cornerstone upon which students begin cultivating their abilities to: 1. Understand the fundamental Christian principles and Adventist heritage that undergird Loma Linda University. 2. Make informed moral and ethical decisions. 3. Incorporate critical-thinking skills into personal and professional experience. 4. Value individuals with diverse capabilities and ideological, ethnic, gender, and generational perspectives. 5. Communicate effectively. 6. Undertake scientific inquiry and analysis. 7. Appreciate the contributions of the arts and humanities to society. 8. Examine the historical basis of the health-sciences professions. 48 UNIVERSITY CATALOG 9. Develop self-awareness through balance of mental, physical, social, and spiritual aspects of daily living. 10. Model servant-leadership in health care as exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The Loma Linda University philosophy of general education creates a unique learning environment committed to the concept of human wholeness. Faculty are selected who embrace the spirit as well as the specifics of general education and who purpose to extend its goals into all aspects of university life\u2014from the residence hall programs to the core of professional studies\u2014thus adding an invisible curriculum to the required course offerings. It is this spirit in tandem with the specifics of a liberal ar ts education that inspires students to achieve academic excellence, value diversity, pursue lifelong learning, and live to bless o thers. LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY CRITERIA FOR GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES The course assists the health-sciences student in cultivating abilities in one or more of the preceding ten aspects described in the Loma Linda University philosophy of general education for baccalaureate degrees.

The most current Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies, and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. FROM UNIVERSITY TO STUDENT Loma Linda University was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment. Students are expected to respect the standards and ideals of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Prospective students have the freedom to choose or reject University or school standards, but the decision must be made before enrollment. Application to and enrollment in Loma Linda University constitute the student's commitment to honor and abide by the academic and social practices and regulations stated i n announcements, bulletins, handbooks, and other published materials; and to maintain a manner that is mature and compatible with the University's function as an institution of higher learning. It is inevitable that the student will come under question if academic performance is below standard; student duties are neglec ted; social conduct is unbecoming; or attitudes demonstrate deficiencies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy, or other forms of immaturity. Procedures for evaluation of academic and nonacademic performance\u2014as well as for the student to exercise his/her right of appeal\u2014are described in the current CATALOG and in each school's section of the Student Handbook. Grievances regarding both academic and nonacademic matters must be processed according to these published grievance procedures. After a student files an appeal or grievance, the faculty assesses the student's fitness for a career in the chosen profession and recommends t o the dean appropriate action regarding the student's continuance or discontinuance. Prospective students who have questions concerning the University's expectations should seek specific information prior to enrollment. STUDENT LIFE 65 WHOLE-PERSON HEALTH The University regards the student from a cosmopolitan and comprehensive point of view. It is cosmopolitan in that historically the University's global mission has promoted bonds and opportunities in education and service without regard to gender, or to national, racial, or geographical origin. It is comprehensive in that the University's concern for the welfare of the student traditionally has been an integrated concern for assisting the student toward whole-person health\u2014balanced development of spiritual, social, physical, and mental health. Cultivating the health of any one part enhances the health of all parts. Neglec ting or abusing the health of one harms the health of all. Before one can experience whole-person health, there must be a practical appreciation of the interdependent interaction of each part of the whole. Students from all schools of Loma Linda University may congregate and participate in the multifaceted programs offered that involve the holistic concept of social, intellectual, physical, emotional, and spiritual wellness. These programs support Loma Linda University's motto, \"To make man whole.\" Spiritual health In addition to personal quiet times, opportunities for the student to further develop rich, personal spiritual resources are pr ovided in scheduled religious exercises and activities and in informal association with others who cherish spiritual values. Religion classes as well as weekly chapel services are part of the required curriculum. Social health Situated within easy access of the ocean, mountains, and desert, the University provides numerous opportunities for students to complement their formal learning through participation in a wide variety of recreational, cultural, and other activities. A var iety of University-, school-, and group-sponsored events encourages students to relax and become better acquainted with one another. Through these activities and events, students can enrich their group interaction and leadership experiences, increase their enjoyment of and interest in fields outside their profession, develop their talents, enhance wholesome and memorable associatio n with others, and cultivate supportive and lifelong social relationships. Mental health The University promotes mental health by encouraging students to study and practice principles of sound psychological health and to access state-of-the-art counseling and mental health services, as needed. Physical health The University promotes physical fitness by encouraging recreational interests and by providing courses in field exercises, bod y building, and health instruction. An effort is exerted to interest each student in some recreational and health-building activi ty that may be carried over to enhance future life. RECREATION/WELLNESS: THE DRAYSON CENTER The Drayson Center, Loma Linda University's recreation and wellness center, provides state-of-the-art fitness facilities.

For further information regarding these identification cards, please contact Student Services. Residence hall The University is coeducational and accepts both single and married students. Any single student who prefers to live on campus may do so. Students are expected to live on campus unless they are: married, twenty-one years of age or older, in a graduate program, or living with their parents. Students who wish to live off campus but who do not meet one of the foregoing requirements may petition the associate vice chancellor for student services for an exception. This should be done well in advance of registration to allow the student adeq uate time to plan. Additional information about campus housing can be obtained from the housing Web site at <www.llu.edu/llu/housing>. The student must keep the Office of the Dean of the school informed of his or her current address and telephone number and other contact numbers.

Copies of the brochure entitled \"Loma Linda University Traffic and Parking Regulations\" are available at the Department of Security. Vehicles used by students on campus must be registered with the Department of Security. Returning students must go to the Department of Security annually in September to renew registration. Confidentiality The Health Insurance Portability and Accountabi lity Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires that all health care professionals maintain the highest level of confidentiality in matters pertaining to clients. Discussions or written assignments relating to client inform ation, either health related or personal, may not include identifying data. Clients' privacy and rights are to be protected. Failure to maintain confidentiality could result in legal action. For additional information, see \"What is HIPAA\" at <http://wisdom.mc.llumc.edu/hipaa/education/whatishipaa.htm>. Substance abuse As a practical application of its motto, \"To make man whole,\" Loma Linda University is committed to providing a learning environment conducive to the fullest possible human development. Because the University holds that a lifestyle free of alcohol, tobacco, and recreational/illegal drugs is essential for achieving this goal, it maintains policies that foster a campus enviro nment free of these substances. All students are expected to refrain from substance abuse while enrolled at the University. Substance abuse is considered to be any use of tobacco, alcohol, and/or other recreational or illegal drugs; any use of a nonprescription mood-altering substance t hat impairs the appropriate functioning of the student; or any misuse of a prescription or nonprescription drug. Also, possession o f an illegal drug may be cause for dismissal. The University offers counseling and other redemptive programs to assist in the recovery from substance abuse. Continuation as a student with the University will be dependent upon the abuser appropriately utilizing these programs. Failure to comply with these policies will result in discipline up to and including expulsion and, if appropriate, notification of law-enforcement age ncies for prosecution. For details regarding the University's drug-free environment\u2014as well as information regarding prevention, detection, assessment , treatment, relapse prevention, confidentiality, and discipline\u2014see the Loma Linda University Student Handbook, Section V, University Policies: Alcohol, controlled substances, and tobacco policy. STUDENT LIFE 71 Sexual harassment Sexual harassment is reprehensible and will not be tolerated by the University. It subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being, educational experience, and careers of students, faculty, employees, and patients. Because of the sensitive nature of situations involving sexual harassment and to assure speedy and confidential resolution of these issues, students should contact one of the school's designated, trained sexual harassment ombudspersons. A more comprehensive statement of the policy regarding \"Sexual harassment\" and \"Sexual standards policy\" can be found in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook, Section V, University Policies. Employment It is recommended that students limit work obligations (outside employment for income) that divert time, attention, and strengt h from the arduous tasks of class preparation, clinical practice, and/or training in their chosen career. A student wishing to wo rk during the school year should consult the Office of the Dean regarding employment restrictions or prohib itions. Employment for international students International students must obtain written authorization from International Student and Scholar Services before accepting any o n- campus employment. Off-campus employment requires prior issue of a work permit by the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. F- and J-visa students must limit their employment to twenty hours or less per week while registered for courses and while classes are in session during three of four quarters in an academic year. Regulations allow full-time work (f orty hours or less per week) during school breaks and summer vacati ons (if students' programs allow summer quarters off). For questions, please telephone International Student and Scholar Services at 909/558-4955. ACADEMIC AUTHORITY The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all academic matters, with the exception of General Education requirements, an d is charged with the interpretation and enforcement of academic requirements. Any exceptions or changes in academic requirements, graduation requirements, or grades are not valid unless approved by the dean. Any actions taken by individual faculty members with regard to these matters are advisory only and are not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the dean. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The academically dishonest act considers that academic dishonesty intentionally violates the community of trust upon which all learning is based, intentionally compromises the orderly transfer of knowledge from teacher to student, and is inconsistent wit h good professional and moral behavior. Accordingly, the penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. Acts of dishonesty include but are not limited to: theft; falsifying or changing grades or other academic records; plagiarism or excessive paraphrasing of someone else's work; knowingly giving, obtaining, or falsifying information during examinations or other academic or professional practice assignments; using unauthorized aids during examinations; loud and disruptive behavior during lectures, demonstrations, or examinations; excessive unexcused absences from classes or from clinical assignments \"Examinations\" are defined as regularly scheduled tests, quizzes (scheduled or unscheduled), final examinations, comprehensive assessments, take-home tests, open-book tests, and any other assignment given by an instructor or preceptor whether for a grade , points toward a grade, or for zero points (e.g., a learning exercise). Instructors and students are responsible for reporting instances of academic dishonesty for investigation. An instructor may ta ke immediate action during an examination or other point-generating activity in order to maintain the integrity of the academic process. Substantiated violations are to be brought before the designated disciplinary body for action. Disciplinary action may include receiving a failing grade on the examination or assignment, receiving a failing grade in the course, suspension, or permanent dismissal from the program. CONDUCT Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner during didactic and clinical training. Professional conduc t includes (but is not limited to) punctuality; and respect for other people, their property, and their right to learn. It also i ncludes an appropriate respect for those in authority. Students of Loma Linda University are expected to behave in a manner that will not bring criticism upon themselves, the program, the school, or the University. 72 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Because students may be exposed to patients' relatives and friends in any public place, and because their conversations and the ir attitudes have an effect on those around them, students are asked to observe the following: Any information given to the student by a patient or contained in a medical record must be held in strict confidence. Therefore, the discussion of a patient's diagnosis and treatment and other clinically related topics should be extremely guarded. A patient's family and community people may be listening and may incorrectly interpret the things discussed. Careless talk may lead to malpractice litigation. A joking or casual attitude toward illness and medical treatment should not be displayed since it may seem uncaring and be disturbing to those who are ill and suffering, as well as to the family members. Student and staff behavior in professional situations may be the deciding influence for or against Christian beliefs, values, and a health-enhancing lifestyle. An in-depth description of the professional conduct expected of students is contained in the Loma Linda University Student Handbook. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE Grievances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the disabled shall be pursued in accordan ce with University policies specifically relating to these items. Grievances related to academic matters or other issues covered b y specific policies shall be made pursuant to the policies of the school in which the student is enrolled. A student who question s whether the process provided by the school has followed the policy of the school in regard to his/her grievance may request the office of the chancellor to conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to his/her academic grievance. Students who believe that an error has been made or that they have been dealt with in an inappropriate manner by an office or nonacademic department of the University such as records, student finance, student affairs, health services, Drayson Center, et c., may seek correction by the following steps: 1. The student may put his/her complaint in writing and provide it to the head of the department or office involved. The student may request an appointment and discuss this matter with the department head. The department head will make a decision and provide a written answer to the student within 14 days of receiving the student's written complaint or meeting with the student, whichever is later. If the answer is not satisfactory to the student, s/he may: 2. Put the complaint in writing and send it to the dean of student affairs for review. The matter will be considered at the next meeting of the dean's council and the student will be informed in writing of the council's response within seven days of the council's consideration of the complaint.

ACADEMIC POLICIES AND INFORMATION 73 Academic Policies and Information Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. In this section (Section II) are the University regulations. See Section III for regulations that pertain to each school and program. REGISTRATION Registration dates are published on the Web at <www.llu.edu/registration>. Posted deadlines for registration and change of registration are in effect and binding. The school will not intercede to obtain a variance. After consultation with their academic adviser, students register online. Registration procedure includes entering classes onli ne, clearing financial arrangements with the Office of Student Finance, and having a student-identification picture taken for the I D card (first-quarter registration only). Students are advised to print the Request for Clearance Submitted Web page to retain written documentation that they have requested financial clearance. A late-registration period of at least a week prior to the beginning of the quarter and extending to five days after the quarte r begins is provided, during which a late-registration fee of $50 will be charged. (Always check the Web for specific dates of registration, since they vary during some quarters due to holiday schedules.) Students may not attend class without being registered, and in no case may registration take place later than the seventh calendar day of a term unless the course is offer ed as an intensive that requires registration before the end of the first day of class. No credit is granted for academic work performed during any quarter without registration. Change in registration A change in registration requires filing a Registration Change Request (Add/Drop) form with the Office of University Records. Students receive written verification each time a change of program is officially approved. Students are advised to retain this written verification as documentation of their registration. Changes in registration after the second week affect the student's grade record. Course changes A student may add courses that follow the general University calendar during the first seven calendar days of the quarter. Cour ses that follow the general University calendar may be dropped during the first fourteen days of the quarter without academic or financial penalty. Course changes after the fourteenth day of the quarter affect the permanent grade record. A Change of Progra m form must be filed. Students may withdraw from a course prior to the fourteen calendar days before the final examination week, after which time withdrawals are no longer permitted. Study load Usually an academic study load is defined in terms of credit units. A full undergraduate load is considered to be 12 or more un its per quarter; a full graduate load is considered to be 8 units per quarter. Professional programs, however, require considerable clinical experience, for which only partial academic credit is given at times. Consequently, a full study load often is not ref lected by the number of academic credit units carried. To be considered a full-time student, an undergraduate student must be registered for at least 12 units of course work per quar ter; and a graduate student must be registered for at least 8 units. A registration of 400 clock hours per quarter is also considere d to be full time for any student. This is based on forty hours per week for a ten-week quarter. The normal course load, including all course work for which a student may be registered at this or another institution, is 16 quarter units for an undergraduate student and 12 quarter units for a graduate student. Full-time study loads are those specifi ed by the departments for each program. Students of exceptional ability may register for additional course work upon recommendation of the department and consent of the dean. Non-LLU courses as part of total load for financial aid Regular courses for which a student is registered at another financial-aid eligible institution constitute part of the student' s study load. Courses must be transferable and required for completion of the student's Loma Linda University degree program. Correspondence and independent study courses are excluded, per federal-aid regulations. Only when the student enrolls in such courses using the Consortium Agreement form (from the Office of Financial Aid) will the course(s) count on the student's total load as eligible for financial-aid and loan-deferment purposes. A person who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is occupied in research, dissertation, or thesis, is classified as a st udent. By filing an Academic Load Validation form every quarter at registration, the academic load may be validated for loan deferment. 74 UNIVERSITY CATALOG BACKGROUND CHECK Some clinical affiliation sites require background checks for all incoming students; these checks must be completed no later th an two weeks prior to clinical placement. The student will be responsible for obtaining the background checks, including the cost. The following elements must be covered by the check, at a minimum: past 7 years, 3 counties, Office of Inspector General (OIG), Social Security number, other names (maiden, married, etc.), addresses, and sex-offender database. STUDENT LEVEL Students enrolled in a professional program in which they are classified as freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior will be classified according to the level of the course work they are taking (e.g., a student with a previous baccalaureate degree purs uing another baccalaureate degree would be classified as a sophomore while taking sophomore-level courses, etc.). Students enrolled in block programs are classified according to the level of the block in which they are enrolled (e.g., master 's- 1st, 2nd, or 3rd year; or freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, as is appropriate for the degree program; or PY1 [professional y ear 1]). clinical; 901-999, continuing education\u2014without academic credit. 500-level course work may not apply toward a baccalaureate degree unless the instructor approves it, and both deans (dean of th e school offering the course and dean of the school in which the student is enrolled) give permission; and provided the credit do es not apply toward both an undergraduate and a graduate degree. Approval is not needed if the course is part of a coordinated program. No courses numbered in the 700s, 800s, or 900s may apply toward a baccalaureate degree. UNIT OF CREDIT Credit is recorded in quarter units. One unit represents 10-11 class hours in lecture or 30-40 hours in laboratory practice. ATTENDANCE Regular attendance at all appointments (class, clinic, laboratory, chapel) is required beginning with the first day of each ter m. A pattern of absence, excused and unexcused, will be referred to the school's designated academic authority for consideration and action. Excused absences are defined as follows: Illness, verified by a physician's statement or official statement from Student Health Service submitted to the school's designated academic authority; Participation in an institution-sponsored activity (verified by a written statement from a faculty sponsor); Recognizable emergency approved by the school's designated academic authority. Tardiness is disruptive, distracting, and inconsistent with professional behavior. Students who arrive after the beginning of c lass may be counted absent. Information regarding the school's designated academic authority can be obtained from the Office of the Dean. COLLEGE LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM (CLEP) The College Level Examination Program (CLEP), a national program of credit by examination, offers persons of all ages and backgrounds new opportunities to obtain recognition for college-level achievement, no matter how acquired. ACADEMIC POLICIES AND INFORMATION 75 As of July 2001, general examinations are no longer offered; however, the policy remains in effect for students who took genera l examinations prior to that date. No credit is granted for the CLEP general examinations in English composition, mathematics, or science courses requiring a laboratory. As of July 1, 2004, in order to receive Loma Linda University credit, students must complete all examinations for CLEP credit within six months after having received their initial degree-compliance report. A student will be allowed to challenge a given course by examination only once. CLEP scores will be accepted at C or better until percentiles are available from CLEP. Credit is granted for scores at or above the 50th percentile for the subject examinations, and at the 65th percentile for general examina tions in the humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences/history. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION For certain courses offered by the University, a student in an undergraduate degree program may earn credit by passing an equivalency examination administered by the appropriate school and department. Such an examination is at least equal in scope and difficulty to a final examination in the course and may include materials supplied by CLEP or other agencies. A graduate program should be used to acquire new knowledge. Since the purpose of credit by examination is to validate prior knowledge, graduate credit may not be earned by examination. If a required course in the degree program is a repeat of prior learning, the student may request a waiver, thus making it possible to take elective courses that would increase knowledge. A student currently enrolled in a degree program at this University who desires credit by equivalency examination petitions the dean of the school offering the course, and, upon approval, pays a testing fee. See Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section for examination fee. Equivalency examinations may not duplicate credit already earned through course work, including courses taken for audit. A grade of CR (Credit) is given only after the student has completed one quarter, or the equivalent, at this University; and ha s earned 12 units of credit with a grade-point average of at least 2.0 in undergraduate courses. Units earned by equivalency may not be used as part of the enrolled load. Equivalency examinations must be taken before the final quarter of residency. The maximum amount of credit that may be earned by equivalency examination is determined by each school but may not exceed a maximum of 20 percent of the units required for the degree or certificate. COURSE WAIVER Certain course requirements in a program may be waived on the basis of previously completed course work, experience, or licensure. An examination for waiver credit, if required, may be taken only once and must be taken before the last quarter of t he program of study. Waiver of a specific course requirement does not reduce the number of units required for a program or residency requirements. A waiver examination does not carry academic credit and cannot be used to make up for a course in which an unsatisfactory grade was received. For examination fee, see Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section. Permission to waive a course requirement in the School of Pharmacy requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. INDEPENDENT STUDY Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair and/or the Office of the Dean. The student i s responsible for completion of the Directed/Independent Study Title Request form in add ition to the regular registration. University policy limits directed study to 12 quarter units of undergraduate credit and 8 units of graduate credit in a degree program. Individual programs may further limit these units. The Office of the Dean should be consulted regarding limits on cred it earned through independent study. Independent study is to be completed in adequate time before graduation to allow recording in the Office of University Records. CORRESPONDENCE COURSE Independent study may be undertaken subject to the consent of the department chair and/or the Office of the Dean. The student i s responsible for completion of the Directed/Independent Study Title Request form in add ition to the regular registration. University policy limits directed study to 12 quarter units of undergraduate credit and 8 units of graduate credit in a degree program. Individual programs may further limit these units. The Office of the Dean should be consulted regarding limits on cred it earned through independent study. Independent study is to be completed in adequate time before graduation to allow recording in the Office of University Records. 76 UNIVERSITY CATALOG EXTENSION STUDY To be acceptable for credit, an extension course must be evaluated as to its equivalence to an accepted course. To assure that the course will transfer to Loma Linda University, the student should contact the Office of University Records prior to taking the course. Registration for extension study requires prior approval of the department chair and consent of the dean. SCHOLASTIC STANDING Grades and grade points The following grades and grade points are used in this University. Each course taught in the schools has been approved for eith er a letter grade and/or an S/U grade. A 4.0 Outstanding performance. A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 Very good performance for undergraduate credit; Satisfactory performance for graduate credit. B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 Satisfactory performance for undergraduate credit.

S none Satisfactory performance counted toward graduation. Equivalent to a C grade or better in undergraduate courses, or a B grade or better in graduate courses. An S grade is not computed in the grade-point average. A student may request a grade of S in only a limited amount of course work as determined by the school. This is done by the student's filing with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week. Once filed, the grade is not subject to change. U none Unsatisfactory performance\u2014 given only when performance for an S-specified course falls below a C grade level in an undergraduate course or a B grade level in a graduate course. Similar filing procedures as given for S grade above are required. The U grade is not computed in the grade-point average. S/N none Satisfactory performance in a clock-hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the S grade given for a credit-hour course. U/N none Unsatisfactory performance in a clock-hour course. Not included in total units. Same grading criteria as the U grade given for a credit-hour course. R none Credit for Credit by Examination. Counted toward graduation/units earned but not units attempted. Such credit cannot be counted for financial aid purposes. NC none No credit for Credit by Examination. Does not count for any purpose. W Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawal from a course prior to fourteen calendar days before the final examination week. Withdrawals during the first fourteen calendar days of a quarter or the first seven calendar days of a five-week summer session are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the cut-off date. Withdrawals outside this time frame, upon recommendation of the dean, may be removed at the discretion of the vice-chancellor for academic affairs. In the case of nontraditionally scheduled courses, W will be given for withdrawal from a course prior to completion of 80 percent of the course, excluding the final examination period. Withdrawals during the first 20 percent of a course, excluding the final examination period, are not recorded if the student files with the Office of University Records the appropriate form prior to the date when this 20 percent of the course is completed. A student may withdraw only once from a named cognate course that s/he is failing at the time of withdrawal. UW Unofficial Withdrawal\u2014indicates that the student discontinued class attendance after the close of registration but failed to withdraw officially. ACADEMIC POLICIES AND INFORMATION 77 I Incomplete\u2014given when the majority of the course work has been completed and circumstances beyond a student's control result in the student being unable to complete the quarter. An I notation may be changed to a grade only by the instructor before the end of the following term (excluding the summer sessions for those not in attendance during that term). Incomplete units are not calculated in the grade-point average. By use of the petition form\u2014available online at <www.llu.edu/ssweb/registration>\u2014the student requests an I notation from the instructor, stating the reason for the request and obtaining the signatures of the instructor, the department chair, and the associate dean. The form is left with the instructor. The instructor reports the I notation on the grade-report form, as well as the grade the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the time limit. The petition form is then filed with the Office of University Records along with the grade-report form. The notation I is not granted as a remedy for overload, failure on final examination, absence from final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. IP In Progress\u2014indicates that the course has a duration of more than a single term and will be completed by the student no later than the final term of the course, not to exceed five quarters for independent study and research courses (original quarter of registration plus four add itional quarters). The student's final grade will be reported on the instructor's grade report at the end of the term in which the course is completed. If the course work is not completed within the five- quarter time limit, a grade of U will be given. AU Audit\u2014indicates registration for attendance only, with 80 percent class attendance considered a requirement. A request to change a credit course to audit or an audit course to credit may be made no later than the fourteenth calendar day after the beginning of a quarter, or the seventh calendar day after the beginning of the five-week summer session. (This does not apply to short summer courses lasting only a week or two.) AUW Audit Withdrawal\u2014given for withdrawing from a course, or to indicate that the 80 percent class attendance requirement was not observed. ACADEMIC STANDING The following classifications are based on scholastic performance, as defined by each school within the University: regular standing or academic probation. VETERANS BENEFITS Under Title 38 of the U. S. Code, Loma Linda University is approved for the training of veterans and other eligible persons. Information regarding eligibility for these programs may be obtained by calling 888/GIBILL1 or 888/442-4551. Application for benefits must be made directly to the Veterans Administration (VA) and may be done via the Web. The Office of University Records serves as the certifying official for Loma Linda University. Students should contact the certifying official prior to their first enrollment certification. Students receiving veteran's benefits who fail for three consecutive quarters to maintain the cumulative grade-point average (G.P.A.) required for graduation will have their benefits interrupted, and the VA office will be notified. School of Medicine students must maintain satisfactory grades for all required courses for the year in which they are currently enrolled. If a grade in a required course reflects unsatisfactory progress, the School of Medicine student will not be certifie d until his/her probationary status (usually one year) has been removed. For more information, open links to the VA Web site (\"Students\" or \"Prospective Students\") on the University home Web page at <http://www.llu.edu>. PRIVACY RIGHTS OF STUDENTS IN ACADEMIC RECORDS Under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), students have full rights of privacy with regard to their academic records, including their grade reports. Grades are available to the student online at <www.llu.edu/ssweb>. The Office of University Records sends one copy of the student grade report to the school. The campus is authorized under FERPA to release \"directory information\" concerning students. Such information may include a student's picture, name, telephone listing, month and day of birth, and major field of study. This information is subject to re lease at any time unless the campus has received prior written request from the student that such information not be released. 78 UNIVERSITY CATALOG GRADE CHANGE Faculty members are responsible for evaluating and assigning grades. A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in arriving at or recording a grade. Such changes are permissible up to the end of the succeeding term. The faculty member must obtain the dean's signature on the Change of Grade form after the initial grade has been entered. REPEATING A COURSE Once grades have been posted for a course, a student wishing to improve his/her grade must repeat the course. When repeating a course, the student must attend class and laboratory sessions as ordinarily required and take all regularly scheduled examinati ons. The amount of tuition paid for repeated courses is determined by the school. Both the original and the repeat grades will appea r on the student's permanent record, but only the repeat grade is computed in the G.P.A. and included in the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once, and no more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program. PERSONAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE A leave of absence, which may be as short as one day but no longer than one year, is defined as being away from school for obligations other than personal health, which may or may not be school sponsored. The appropriate personal-leave-of-absence form must be obtained from the University Web site and approved by the dean or his/her designee prior to the student's departur e. Stipulations for re-entry are given to the student in writing. The student should consult the Office of the Dean regarding the possibility of maintaining health coverage and continuous registration during the leave period. WITHDRAWAL To withdraw from a course(s), the student must complete a Change of Program form. If a student finds it necessary to withdraw from a degree or certificate program, the dean (or his/her designee) must be notified in writing. The student then arranges for formal withdrawal from the program by filing a Program Withdrawal form in the Office of University Records. The Change of Program form or the Program Withdrawal form should be completed and submitted on the last day of class attendance. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term are not included in the student's permanent record. If a student is discontinuing the entire program, the date the Program Withdrawal form is properly submitted to the Office of University Records will be the date of withdrawal used to calculate tuition refunds. Tu ition is refunded according to the practice outlined in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG. Failure to file the Program Withdrawal form may result in avoidable charges to the student's account. The tuition-refund policy for off-campus students is listed under the applicable school in Section III of this CATALOG. ADMINISTRATIVE WITHDRAWAL Students who fail to make arrangements for a leave of absence and continuing registration may be administratively withdrawn from school. Information regarding the period of inactivity allowed prior to administrative withdrawal can be obtained from the Office of the Dean. FACILITATING THE TRANSFER OF CURRENTLY REGISTERED STUDENTS The following steps apply to processing an application for a student who is currently registered at Loma Linda University: 1. The student submits application (online or paper) to a new program that is not part of a joint/combined-degree arrangement. 2. The Office of University Records prominently flags the transcript as being from a currently registered student. 3. The flagged University transcript is forwarded to new program for evaluation. 4. The new program contacts a designated person in the home school/program to obtain relevant information about the student without revealing that an application is under consideration. 5. If the new program decides to accept the student, the acceptance letter instructs the student to take one of the following actions\u2014 6. Send a letter/deposit accepting the offer of admission and process a Total Withdrawal form or a Leave of Absence form for the program s/he is leaving, or 7. Decline the offer of admission. 8. The home program has an opportunity to speak with the student when s/he attempts to get an adviser's signature on the Total Withdrawal form. 9. The Office of University Records updates the student's program in Banner upon the Total Withdrawal and acceptance into the new program. ACADEMIC POLICIES AND INFORMATION 79 ACADEMIC RESIDENCE A student must meet the residence requirements indicated for a particular degree or certificate. CATALOG IN EFFECT FOR DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Subject to department approval, students may complete degree requirements outlined in any CATALOG in effect during the time they are enrolled as accepted students in a school. However, students who have been on leave of absence for more than one year, or who failed to register without leave of absence (consult Office of the Dean regarding number of quarters) may be required to re-enter the program under the CATALOG in effect at the time of re-entry, with the exception of students who are on leave from a school to pursue a medical or dental degree at this University. Such students may complete their program under their original CATALOG. GRADUATION The responsibility for meeting graduation requirements rests primarily upon the student. Therefore, students should read and understand the requirements as set forth in this CATALOG and consult carefully with their adviser to plan a sequence of courses each term that fulfills these requirements. A student's program of study is governed by the requirements listed in the Universi ty CATALOG at the time of admission; however, when circumstances demand, the University reserves the right to make changes with reference to admission, registration, tuition and fees, attendance, curriculum requirements, conduct, academic standing, candidacy, and graduation. The undergraduate who plans to graduate must submit an \"Undergraduate Intent to Graduate\" form two quarters prior to graduation. The form is available online at <www.llu.edu/ssweb/forms/intgrad.pdf>. COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES The candidate completing requirements in the Spring Quarter is expected to be present at the commencement exercises and receive the diploma in person. Permission for the degree to be conferred in absentia is contingent upon the recommendation of the dean to the chancellor and can be granted only by the chancellor. If a candidate has not satisfactorily fulfilled all requirements, the University reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises. DIPLOMAS All diplomas issued to graduates list the degree only. No official diploma is awarded that identifies a specific area of specialization. 80 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Financial Policies and Information The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Accounts with other schools or with this University must have been settled. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees for each term are paid; therefore, the student should be prepared to make these payments during scheduled registration periods for each academic year. Tuition and fees may vary from amounts shown. STUDENT FEES Students attending this University will be charged an enrollment fee, based on the criteria indicated below. Neither the fee in total nor any portion of the fee will be waived under any circumstances. Other school-specific charges\u2014such as technology fees, laboratory fees, etc.\u2014may also appear on the student account. The following criteria govern the enrollment fee: 1. Students who are accepted into a degree program and registered will be charged the enrollment fee, regardless of the number of units for which they are registered. 2. Students who are not accepted into a degree program but who are registered as nondegree students for more than 4 units will be charged the enrollment fee. 3. Students who are working on \"In Progress\" courses and who are not registered for any other units will be charged the enrollment fee. 4. A student who is charged the enrollment fee but who drops all units before the deadline for a full refund (generally one week after the first day of classes), will receive a full refund of the enrollment fee and will have no access to any University benefits. Please refer to the percent refund policy. 5. LLUAHSC employees who are \"full time benefit eligible\" will not be charged the enrollment fee, whether they are using their education benefit or not. Spouses of employees who are using the employee benefit will be charged the enrollment fee. 6. Students participating in an off-campus or online program will not be charged the enrollment fee unless the program specifically requires this fee. 7. Other school-specific fees will be charged independent of the enrollment fee. Note: The student enrollment fee includes health coverage. GENERAL PRACTICES Advance payments/refunds For students whose student loans are pending at the time of registration\u2014where applications were not filed at least 30 days pri or to registration\u2014a $50.00 late-payment fee will be charged. Tuition and fees are due and payable in full before or at registrati on each term. If a student withdraws from a per-unit course or from a block or nonblock registration up to 60 percent into a term, tuition will be refunded on a pro-rata basis. Students who drop a course from a block program of courses will not receive a ref und (please refer to the quarterly registration and refund dates (<http://www.llu.edu/ssweb/0terms/regdates.hrtml>). Monthly statement The amount of the monthly statement is due and payable in full upon presentation of the statement. A student unable to meet thi s requirement must make proper arrangements with the director of student finance. An account that is more than thirty days past due is subject to a finance charge of .833 percent per month (10 percent per year). Failure to pay scheduled charges or to make proper arrangements will be reported to the respective school and may cause the student to be considered absent, discontinued, or ineligible to take final examinations. Financial clearance The student is expected to keep a clear financial status at all times. Financial clearance must be obtained\u2014 each term in order to complete registration; before receiving a certificate or diploma; before requesting a transcript, statement of completion, or other certification to be issued to any person, organization, or professional board. To obtain financial clearance from the Student Loan Collections Office, students with campus- based student loans must be current on all scheduled loan-account payments and must have fully completed a loan exit interview, after ceasing to be enrolle d for at least half time at this University. If the student's loan accounts are not current, or an exit interview has not been fu lly completed, a hold will be placed by the Student Loan Collection Office on transcript, diploma, or degree verification; and P1E FINANCIAL POLICIES AND INFORMATION 81 requests and other services may be denied. Please note that all student loans are reported to a credit bureau organization on a monthly basis. If a student fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the promissory note, the Student Loan Collection Office will accelerate the loan(s) and will place the student loan(s) in collection with an outside agency and will demand immediate payment of the entire unpaid balance\u2014including principal, interest due, late fees, other fees, collection costs, atto rney costs, and legal costs. Payments Bankcard, ACH, check, wire transfer, and cash payments are accepted. Checks should be made payable to Loma Linda University and should indicate the student's ID number to ensure that the correct account is credited. In case a payment is returned, there will be a $25.00 returned-item fee assessed. Payments are accepted online, by mail, and in person at Student Finance. (<http://www.llu.edu/ssweb/studentfinance/>). DEPOSITS Acceptance Deposit Upon notification of acceptance, the student makes the required deposit (see school or program for specific deposit amount). Th is amount is deducted from the tuition and fees due at registration or forfeited if student does not enroll. Room and key deposit Residence hall room and key deposits for Daniells Complex and for Lindsay Hall are forfeited after August 15 if occupancy does not follow for the Autumn Quarter. At the close of the term of residence, both the room deposit and the key deposit are refunde d after the dean's inspection and clearance and the student's return of the key. HOUSING If a student is interested in on-campus/ residential housing, application may be made online at <www.llu.edu/llu/housing>. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS United States immigration regulations and Loma Linda University require that International students must be prepared to provide an advance deposit, and must provide documentation that additional funds will be forthcoming to meet school expenses. The deposit will be held by the University during the program of study and will be applied to the last quarter's tuition charge. Alternatively, the deposit may be refunded, less any outstanding balance on the account, if the student is denied a visa or terminates his program. Scholarships and assistantships for international students are scarce, and employment is limited for F- and J-visa students to no more than twenty hours per week. Unless special permission is given by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, international students are restricted to employment on campus. HEALTH SERVICE A student registered for more than 4 units per quarter or enrolled in a certificate or degree program is automatically covered by the Student Health Plan provisions. A non-degree student may request and pay for health-plan coverage if you are part-time student who has been accepted in to a Board approved (degree or certificate) program and are currently registered for 1-6 credi t hours. For further information, see the Student Health Plan in the Student Life section of this CATALOG. STUDENT AID The University participates in grant, scholarship, and loan programs. Financial assistance is available to students from Univer sity and government loan funds and other special trust funds. A needs-analysis system approved by the federal government is used to evaluate the need for financial aid. A parental contribution factor is considered for dependent students. It is necessary for students who are seeking financial assistance to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as soon as possible for the current academic year. Loans Loans are available both to undergraduate and graduate students who are eligible to participate in government loan programs.

EVALUATION OF MISSION AND GOALS\u2014WHOLENESS PORTFOLIO-DEVELOPMENT PRACTICUM Portfolio is a tool by which students develop and personally achieve goals established by the School of Allied Health Professio ns. The School conducts an evaluation program that includes courses, validation of writing, and standardized measures related to wholeness. The evaluation courses\u2014Wholeness Portfolio I, II, and Graduate Wholeness Portfolio\u2014are intended to be a means of integrating the wholeness concept into the lives of the students and of assessing the outcome of their educational process. The portfolio faculty and staff assist students in understanding and modeling the mission of Loma Linda University and the School o f Allied Health Professions. MISSION AND GOALS 89 Each portfolio course is in progress for three to four quarters, during which time the student is developing a portfolio based on the fifteen goals of the school (see Mission and Goals above). The final portfolio provides the student with an organized, goal - driven documentation of growth and achieved competence of abilities in a personal and professional realm of skills. An Associate in Science degree program student completes the one-year Portfolio Practicum; all other undergraduate students complete Portfolio Practicums I and II over a two-year period. Each graduate student completes a graduate portfolio. 90 UNIVERSITY CATALOG General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school and the subj ect and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirement s in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. ADMISSIONS POLICIES AND INFORMATION The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the propose d curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualiti es of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Allied Health Professions looks for evidence of self-disciplin e, personal integrity, and intellectual vigor. The committee also looks for evidence that students possess the capabilities requir ed to complete the full curriculum in the allotted time and to achieve the levels of competence required. Acceptance of the applicant into any program is contingent on the recommendation of the department conducting the program. An interview with faculty is required by most programs. Loma Linda University was established to provide education in a distinctively Christian environment, and its students are expected to adopt Christian ethical and moral standards as a basis fo r their conduct. It must be understood further that, in harmony with the University's emphasis on health and the health professio ns and the practices of the supporting church, applicants who use tobacco, alcoholic beverages, or narcotics should not expect to be admitted. Loma Linda University is committed to equal opportunity and does not discriminate against qualified persons on the basis of handicap, gender, race, color, or national or ethnic origin in its educational and admissions policies, financial affairs, empl oyment programs, student life and services, or any University-administered program. It does, however, retain the right to give prefere nce in student admissions to qualified Seventh-day Adventist applicants. While this right is retained, it should be emphasized that admissions are not limited exclusively to Seventh-day Adventist applicants. APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE Where to write Correspondence about admission to all programs and requests for application information should be addressed to the Office of Admissions and Records, School of Allied Health Professions, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350. Apply early One class is admitted annually to most of the professional programs. Most programs begin with the Autumn Quarter. Exceptions are noted in the respective programs of this CATALOG. Late applications are considered as long as space is available. Notifications generally are sent between January 1 and May 15, depending on the completeness of information provided and the date of application. Applicants should inquire at the Office of Admissions and Records if notice of action is not received by April 15 for occupational therapy and physical therapy, and by May 15 for other programs. Application-review process All completed applications are first reviewed by the department chair and faculty. A recommendation on each application is then submitted to the School's Admissions Committee, which makes the final decision regarding acceptance. Procedure The procedure for application and acceptance is given below. All correspondence and documents are to be sent to the Office of Admissions and Records, School of Allied Health Professions, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92350. 1. File the complete application form (including recommendations, if received), accompanied by the $60 application fee. 2. Request that transcripts of all college course work be sent to the school. High school transcripts are required of all applicants in order to verify graduation and completion of high school mathematics. 3. Upon receipt of the notice of acceptance, return the required deposit and the card provided to confirm acceptance. 4. Provide health records or certificates, as required. GENERAL REGULATIONS 91 Online application Applications are available online at <http://www.llu.edu>. (Click on \"apply\" under Loma Linda University.) Applicant's records The application and all records submitted in support of the application become the property of the University. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Subject/diploma requirements High school and college subject requirements for each program are ou tlined in the respective programs. Students are required to furnish evidence of completion (official transcript) of high school in order to be granted admission to undergraduate programs in schools of the University. A high school diploma or its equivalent, the GED, is required. Grade requirement Eligibility for consideration by the Admissions Committee is based on a grade-point average of at least 2.0 (on a 4.0 scale) fo r all course work (science and nonscience subjects computed separately) presented in fulfillment of entrance requirements for all programs in the school. A grade-point average considerably higher than the minimum is expected because of the nature of the studies in many professional programs and the competition for the limited number of openings. In general, grade-point averages between 2.5 and 3.0 are considered minimal, depending on the program. A minimum grade of C (2.0) is required for all college- transfer courses. Transcripts Transcripts (the documents by which institutions officially c onvey the grades and credits earned in specific subjects and the stage of completion of curriculum requirements) are accepted only when sent directly to the University by the issuing institution. Transcripts received by the University become the property of the University and will not be released to the student or forward ed to any other institution upon request of the student. Academic probation Students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than the minimum required by the school or program will be placed on academic probation, and the number of units for subsequent registrations will be restricted to a maximum determined by the school of program. A student on academic probation jeopardizes his or her standing in a degree or certificate program. 92 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Student Life The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The most current Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Additional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS Personal grooming Good taste indicates that haircut, hairstyling, and personal grooming be neat, and conservative rather than ostentatious. Grooming and style should also be practical, so that the student can perform assigned duties without embarrassment or inconvenience. Specifically: Men's hair must be neatly trimmed and not fall below the collar. Ponytails, spikes, and dreadlocks are not acceptable. Mustaches and beards, if worn, must be neat and closely trimmed. Women's hair, if long, may be required to be tied back. Spikes and dreadlocks are not acceptable. The wearing of hats indoors is not acceptable. Words, pictures, and/or symbols displayed on clothing should be consistent with a Christian institution and sensitive to a diverse student population.

ACADEMIC POLICIES AND INFORMATION 93 Academic Policies and Information Students are responsible for informing themselves of the policies and regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation; and for satisfactorily meeting these requirements. ACADEMIC RESIDENCE In order to graduate from Loma Linda University with a bachelor's degree, a student must complete at least 32 of the last 48 units, or a minimum of 45 total units of course work, at this University. A minimum grade of C (2.0) or better is required for all B.S. and postbaccalaureate degrees. GRADUATION CEREMONIES Graduation events include formal ceremonies identified as conferring of degrees, awarding of diplomas, and recognition of candidates for degrees. Other related graduation events include the baccalaureate and vespers services. The conferring of degre es ceremony(ies) occurs at the close of the Spring Quarter and includes an academic procession, the formal conferring of degrees b y the president, and the presentation of diplomas by the dean of the school. Candidates who complete the requirements for degrees and certificates are invited, with families and friends, to attend and participate in these important and colorful events. To be eligible to participate in graduation events, candidates must have completed all requirements for the degree, including prerequisites and/or corequisites, as specified by the school. In certain degree programs, upon authorization of the dean, exceptions will be made for candidates who: Have only clinical experience requirements to complete and can project completion by the end of the calendar year; Can complete remaining degree requirements by the end of the Summer Quarter; or Are in a block program. The still in-progress course work may not exceed 8 units for graduate students or 12 units for undergraduate students. A studen t who completes the requirements for a degree or certificate (other than clinical experience) at the end of the Summer, Autumn, o r Winter Quarter is invited to participate in the subsequent June commencement events. The official date of graduation on the diploma is ordinarily the last day of the term in which the requirements for a degree are completed. Superior academic performance and achievement in scholarship and leadership are recognized in the printed graduation program for persons who complete their baccalaureate degree and who at the end of the quarter preceding their final term have acquired a cumulative grade-point average for all college work (includes course work taken at other colleges/universities, except for remedial courses), as follows: 3.5 Graduation cum laude 3.8 Graduation magna cum laude 3.9 Graduation summa cum laude Although the official commencement program indicates names of graduates who qualify for honors on the basis of their grade-point average as of the end of the quarter preceding their final term, the subsequently issued diploma and transcript may indic ate graduation with honors if the student's final quarter's record has increased the grade-point average sufficiently to qualify fo r honors at that time. SCHOLASTIC STANDING Repeating a Course A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required course and is required by the faculty to do additional work may request permission of the faculty to pursue one of the following plans. In either plan the student must register and pay the applicable tuition. 1. Review the course work under supervision and take a make-up examination (usually not given before a minimum of two weeks of study). A passing grade resu lting from a repeat examination will be limited to a C (2.0). (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate for tutorial course work.) 94 UNIVERSITY CATALOG 2. Repeat the course, attend class and/or laboratory, and take the final course examination. Full tuition will be charged whether regular or occasional attendance is required. (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the tuition rate.) A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required clinical-experience course and is required by the faculty to do additional work must re-register and pay the applicable fee. (See the Schedule of Charges in the Financial Information section of this CATALOG for the fee for repeat of clinical experience.) Both the original and repeat grades are entered in the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade is comput ed in the grade-point average. A course may be repeated only one time. Promotion and Probation Each student's record is reviewed quarterly by the faculty. Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic and professional performance and on factors related to aptitude, proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the school and of th e profession. As an indication of satisfactory academic performance, the student is expected to maintain the following grade-poin t average: 2.0 Associate and baccalaureate degree programs 2.5 Master's degree program 3.0 Doctoral degree program A student whose grade-point average in any term falls below the minimum required for the degree, or who receives in any professional or required course a grade less than a C (2.0), or whose clinical performance is unsatisfactory is automatically p laced on academic probation. Continued enrollment is subject to the recommendation of the department. If continued enrollment is not recommended, the case is referred to the Administrative Council of the school for final action. If continued enrollment is recommended, the student will be required to institute a learning-assistance plan within the first t wo weeks of the following quarter and meet regularly scheduled appointments with the academic adviser. The learning-assistance plan should: identify the problem, identify and list the goals, state the time frame, and include student and adviser signature s and date. A student who is on academic probation and fails to make the minimum required grade-point average the following quarter or fails to have an overall minimum grade-point average after two quarters will have disqualified him-/herself from the program. Standard of student progress (time framework) After initial enrollment in a program, students must complete program requirements within the following timeframes: A.S. degree 3 years B.S. degree 5 years Master's degree 5 years Doctoral degree 7 years ALLIED HEALTH STUDIES 95 Allied Health Studies The Department of Allied Health Studies provides a variety of administrative and support services to the school's academic departments, including: development, marketing, admissions, computer support and training, portfolio, and financial services.

Shain Katherine Vogel Patricia A. Williams Jane N. Zappia A student who has an interest in science, an investigative mind that enjoys the challenge of solving problems quickly and accurately, and a desire to help others should consider a career as a clinical laboratory scientist. Clinical laboratory scientists examine and analyze body fluids, tissues, and cells. They look for bacteria, parasites, or other microorganisms; analyze the chemical content of fluids; match blood for transfusions; and test for drug levels in the blood to show how a patient is responding to treatment. Clinical laboratory scientists perform complex chemical, biological, hematological, immunologic, microscopic, and bacteriologic tests. They use, maintain, and troubleshoot sophisticated laboratory equipment that is used to perform diagnostic tests. The clinical laboratory scientist possesses the scientific and diagnostic skills required for DNA and biomolecular technology and genetic engineering applications, analyzes these test results, and discusses them with the medical staff. Opportunities Employment of clinical laboratory workers is expected to parallel the growth of other health care occupations through the year 2014, particularly as the volume of laboratory tests increases with population growth and with the development of new technology. Employment opportunities are excellent, with current vacancy rates of 16 percent. The twenty-first century is offering clinical laboratory scientists new avenues for test development, experimental design, administration, and education. Clinical laboratory scientists work in hospitals or similar medical facilities, clinical and reference laboratories, home-healt h diagnostics, transfusion services, physicians' offices, and private medical clinics. Employment is also available in pharmaceut ical and biotechnology companies, health information systems, DNA-technology and genetic engineering corporations, research laboratories, federal government agencies, forensics and crime investigation, veterinary hospitals, U.S. Public Health Service facilities, areas of medical-product development, and in customer and patient education. The program The Clinical Laboratory Science Program is a two-year professional program that culminates in a Bachelor of Science degree. Prerequisite courses may be taken at any accredited college or university, and are completed during the freshman and sophomore years. Accepted students transfer into the program at the junior-year level, which begins in August during the post-summer session. After satisfactory completion of the program, the student is awarded a Bachelor of Science degree and is eligible to t ake the state and national board examinations and to become a licensed clinical laboratory scientist. The junior year is a ten-month program of lecture and laboratory. Emphasis is on the basic clinical science courses, including theory and correlations. CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE\u2014AH 111 The senior year is a ten-month clinical practicum that provides professional clinical experience in the hospital laboratory environment. Emphasis is on technical proficiency, application of theory to patient care, laboratory organization, and manageri al skills. Senior students must coordinate their time with the operation of Loma Linda University Medical Center's clinical laboratory and with supplemental affiliate training laboratories in the community. Clinical Affiliations Multiple clinical affiliations enrich the student's clinical training by providing e xposure to procedures in different types of medical facilities. During the forty-week clinical practicum, supplemental training may be scheduled at any of the following clinical sites: Primary affiliation Loma Linda University Medical Center Loma Linda, California Supplemental affiliations Blood Bank of San Bernardino and Riverside counties San Bernardino, California Community Hospital of San Bernardino San Bernardino, California Hoag Hospital Newport Beach, California Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center Loma Linda, California Kaiser Permanente Medical Center Fontana, California St. Joseph's Hospital Orange, California Transportation to scheduled assignments Transportation to training laboratories is the responsibility of the student. Depending on the clinical assignment, commuting times may be up to two hours one way. Senior students must coordinate their time with the operational schedules of the Loma Linda University Medical Center Clinical Laboratory and affiliate laboratories in the community. The senior schedule is a full- time week (forty clock hours) arranged on a Monday through Friday, day-shift schedule.

ROATH, Chair, Department of Clinical Laboratory Science MARLENE M. OTA, Program Director DARRYL G. HEUSTIS, Medical Director PAMELA J. WAT, Medical Co-Director FACULTY Darryl G. Heustis Claro Y. Masangcay Marlene M. Ota Margaret A. Tavares Pamela J. Wat Cytotechnology is a specialty within the broad field of clinical laboratory science. The cytotechnologist, working under the direction of a pathologist, detects cell changes caused by different disease processes; and is able to differentiate between no rmal, atypical, and malignant cell changes. In recognizing microscopic abnormalities of cells and cellular patterns from various body sites, the cytotechnologist assists the pathologist in detecting cancer at its earliest and potentially most curable stage. As a result, physicians are able to diagnose and treat cancer long before discovering its existence by alternate methods. Opportunities Cytotechnologists work in hospitals, clinics, and independent pathology laboratories. The employment outlook for cytotechnologists is favorable, with the demand for trained workers exceeding the supply. Cytotechnologists can advance to supervisory positions, participate in research activities, or become teachers in the field. Advancement is based on experience, skill, and advanced education. The program The Cytotechnology Program, based on the completion of two years of study at an accredited college or university, leads either to a certificate or to a certificate and a Bachelor of Science degree. The program of study begins with the Autumn Quarter. A certificate is awarded at the completion of the fourth quarter of study, and those electing to continue are awarded the Bachelo r of Science degree upon the completion of an additional two quarters of study. With the certificate in cytotechnology and the baccalaureate degree, the student is eligible to take a national examination and become a registered cytotechnologist. Register ed cytotechnologists entering the program to receive the Bachelor of Science degree are considered to have completed, on the basis of registry, the equivalent course work listed in the first four quarters of the program. A total of 64 quarter units is applie d toward the graduation requirements, provided the course work in pathology is equivalent to that offered in the certificate program at this University. Where credit in pathology is not equivalent, the requirement may be met by taking AHCJ 402, 403 at this University; or by completing a minimum of 8 quarter units of upper-division course work in developmental biology or comparative animal physiology at an accredited college or university. A writing-validation examination will be administered to all students.

The data provide a basis for patient care, quality assurance, legal defense, reimbursement, risk management, accreditation, planning, and decision making. Health information management has assumed increased importance with the advent of prospective payment, corporate compliance, and the electronic health record. A career in health information management is likely to appeal to a person who has organizational and leadership abilities and who is interested in and has aptitude for medical science, but whose talents are su ited for participation other than physical involvement in human illness. The health information administrator (formerly known as medical record administrator) designs, develops, and maintains systems for storage, retrieval, and dissemination of information in accordance with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. This person works with the medical staff and other health professionals in research, administrative studies, functions relative to h ealth information, and patient-care evaluation. The health information administrator in a health care facility will provide managemen t leadership in planning and organizing the department, motivating and evaluating employees, and providing in-service programs for departmental employees or other personnel in the facility. Opportunities While many health information administrators are employed in various areas of acute-care facilities, others work in alternative - delivery health care systems, research facilities, quality assurance, software development companies, industrial establishments , government agencies, medical departments of insurance companies, accounting firms, or as consultants to skilled-nursing and other facilities. The multiplicity of new technologies, the advent of electronic health records, the demand for health information, the emphasis on evaluation of care, the surge in research, the emphasis on cost control, and other factors combine to require comprehensive knowledge and increased utilization of administrative talent and judgment.

MEDICAL DOSIMETRY\u2014AH 141 Medical Dosimetry\u2014AH (Certificate) BALDEV PATYAL, Program Director FACULTY Carol Davis Dolly Kisinger Anh Ly THE PROGRAM The Medical Dosimetry Program is designed to educate personnel in the discipline of dosimetry within a radiation oncology environment, and to prepare them to take the certified medical dosimetrists board examination (CMD). Medical dosimetry is a very dynamic, exciting field involving a combined knowledge of mathematics, physics, and the biological and medical sciences. Dosimetrists plan optimal isodose distributions and treatment-dose calculations for a variety of external beam as well as brachytherapy treatments. Medical dosimetrists must possess excellent analytical skills, an ability to critical ly evaluate data, and an aptitude for physics and mathematics. They must also be able to work closely as a team with physicists, physicians, radiation therapists, and other personnel. Due to a lack of training programs in medical dosimetry throughout the United States, there is a shortage of medical dosimetris ts in many areas of the country. This program will aim to provide a supply of well-trained dosimetrists who will be able to meet t he needs of radiation oncology facilities in the local area and beyond. The program objectives Upon completion of the program, the graduate should be qualified to: 1. Demonstrate ability to accurately complete dosimetric calculations and procedures as they pertain to all aspects of treatment planning for external beam and brachytherapy. 2. Develop and define critical-thinking skills to enhance ability to analyze and compute dosimetric data as it relates to all aspects of radiation therapy treatment. 3. Exhibit professional behavior, which includes ability to communicate with other professionals and work well both individually and as a team member. 4. Manage patients in an empathetic manner and exhibit basic patient-care proficiencies. 5. Support the professional code of ethics and comply with the stated scope of practice. Admission\u2014educational background Students will either need to have: ARRT registration in radiation therapy technology with a minimum of two years postgraduate clinical experience or a baccalaureate degree in physics or mathematics from an accredited university. Program design The length of the program will depend on the entering qualifications. For ARRT candidates, the program will be four quarters in length. For B.S. degree candidates, the program will be five quarters long. Instruction will include a mixture of lecture, laboratory, and clinical work. Students will be exposed to a variety of differen t methodologies within dosimetry, including work with proton therapy treatment planning. All instruction will be conducted in the Radiation Medicine Department of Loma Linda University Medical Center. The only exceptions to this will be a short clinical rotation to Long Beach Memorial, and City of Hope Medical Centers. The program faculty consists of physicists and dosimetrists who are extremely experienced in their field; many, in both photon and proton therapy treatment planning. Accreditation The American Association of Medical Dosimetrists (AAMD) strongly supports the concept of formal dosimetry training, which leads to board eligibility for the certificate in medical dosimetry (CMD). This qualification is considered to be the gold stan dard in dosimetry education. 142 UNIVERSITY CATALOG The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) accreditation of dosimetry programs became available in 2003. As soon as regulations allow, application for accreditation will be made for this program.

Admission to the professiona l program at this University begins with the junior year of college. The applicant will present at least two years of education from an accredited college or university to meet specific subject requirements for 2008-2009. The professional program of seven quarters includes theory, laboratory, research, and clinical experiences. Ten weeks each of clinical experiences are scheduled at the end of the junior year and during the Spring Quarter of the senior year. Students participate as active members of the nutrition care team in multiple clinical settings. Administrative affiliation experiences involve decision-making assignments in volume-feeding operations in school food service or health care. M.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics The M.S. degree prepares entry-level dietitians to join the profession in areas of advanced practice and in specialty areas tha t will allow them to contribute to the wholeness of humankind. The graduate is awarded a B.S. degree in health science and an M.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics at the conclusion of the program. This program is comprised of didactic and supervised professional practice experiences in an environment of liberal arts education to prepare an educated graduate. Admission to th is professional program at this University begins with the junior year. The applicant will present at least two years of educatio n from an accredited college or university to meet specific subject requirements for 2008-2009. The prerequisite requirements ar e identical to the B.S. degree program requirements. The professional program of ten quarters includes theory, laboratory, research, and clinical experiences. Eight weeks of clinical experiences are scheduled at the end of the junior year; and two, ten-week affiliations in medical nutrition therapy are schedu led during the last two years of the program. Students participate as active members of the nutrition care team in multiple clinic al settings. Students may c hoose an emphasis in medical nutrition therapy or public health nutrition. Students choosing to earn the M.P.H. degree in public health nutrition should consult the Nutr ition Program in the Sc hool of Public Health section of this Catalog. M.S. degree in nutrition and dietetics for DPD graduates The M.S. degree for didactic programs in dietetics (DPD) is specifically designed for graduates who choose not to pursue a standard dietetic internship, but who wish to complete a combined master's degree and supervised practice experience in order t o establish eligibility to write the registration examination for dietitians and become a registered dietitian. This program buil ds upon previous course work in nutrition and dietetics and culminates with an M.S. degree and a verification statement covering both didactic and supervised practice requirements. The prerequisite for this degree is a DPD verification statement. A 3.0 or above G.P.A. and GRE scores are required. Opportunities Members of the dietetics profession practice in a variety of environments\u2014including hospitals and other health care facilities, schools and universities, government and community agencies, business, and industry. A growing number of dietitians are employed in physicians' offices, clinics, home-health care agencies, mass communication, and many other entrepreneurial roles. NUTRITION AND DIETETICS\u2014AH 151 By successfully passing the registration examination for dietitians, practice opportunities as a specialist in medical nutritio n therapy, administrative dietetics, nutrition education, community nutrition, or research are available. There is increased recognition of the importance of nutrition in the fields of medicine, dentistry, and health promotion\u2014with emphasis on fitness and optimal well-being. This indicates that the dietitian's scope of practice is steadily broadening. The registered dietitian in medical nutrition therapy applies the science of nutrition to the care of people through health promotion and disease prevention, and uses medical nutrition therapy in the treatment of disease. The effective dietitian must be aware of the cultural, social, economic, aesthetic, and psychological factors that affect eating patterns. As a member of the patient-care team, the registered dietitian (RD) is responsible for assessing, implementing, and monitoring the nutritional car e of patients. In addition, the RD may serve professionally as a nutrition practitioner in health care; a teacher in an educational institution; a research dietitian; or a nutrition consultant-educator in municipal, state, or federal departments of health. The registered dietitian (RD) in management is accountable for the food-service systems. In a health care institution, the RD i s responsible for the effective functioning of food service from the standpoint of patients, administration, medical staff, and personnel. The administrative RD may also teach; manage food systems in educational, public, or commercial facilities; serve as a consultant to health care or educational institutions; or enter the field of research. Community registered dietitians practice in diverse settings, translating nutrition science into improved health status. Chall enges may include forming partnerships with various organizations, mastering technology, enacting regulations and policies that prote ct and improve the public's health, and creatively managing scarce resources. Dietitians working in the community exhibit high- quality leadership and planning skills, and many create positions that are entrepreneurial as well as financially rewarding.

The primary concern of the therapist is to stimulate those changes in behavior patterns that will increase the patient's person al independence and ability to work within his/her cultural and personal milieu. To accomplish this goal, the occupational therapi st evaluates the patient; sets up treatment goals; and works together with the occupational therapy assistant in selecting tasks f rom the gamut of normal daily self-care activities, using them to assist the patient in gaining independent-living skills regardles s of disability or handicap. Essential to the role of occupational therapy is an interest in the behavioral sciences and a concern for the individual's need to find proper adjustments to life's circumstances. A desire to teach and a background or interest in medical science are benefici al. Those inclined to mechanical or scientific techniques are suited to helping patients develop their capacities for employment. Others find that they can use their interests in creative arts, crafts, music, and teaching to work with disabled homemakers, children, and retired persons. Opportunities Occupational therapists practice in general hospitals, rehabilitation centers, pediatric or psychiatric clinics, schools, skill ed- nursing facilities, home care, and outpatient community-centered programs (including hand-rehabilitation, work-evaluation, and OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY\u2014AH 159 adult day-care facilities). Occupational therapy professionals have a wide choice of positions (using varied therapeutic skills with individuals of varying age and disability) and opportunities for advancement.

Newborn, pediatric, adult, and elderly patients are treated for a wide range of problems\u2014infant respiratory distress syndrome; trauma; cardiopulmonary by shock; postoperative surgical complications; and respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, asthma, cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. The respiratory care practitioner is a member of the health care team in medical centers, skilled-nursing facilities, outpatien t rehabilitation programs, physician offices, and in-home care. Many are involved in research and development of new and innovative care and equipment. They are effective communicators and compassionate caregivers, possessing an awareness of cultural sensitivity and diversity. They have leadership roles in patient education, wellness intervention, and development of respiratory care plans. Respiratory care professionals apply critical-thinking skills in cardiopulmonary diagnostics and patien t assessment to optimize decision making and delivery of patient care. In a time of high technology, increasing growth of the elderly population, and increasing numbers of patients with asthma and chronic lung disease, there is a greater demand for educated and skilled respiratory care practitioners.

Dean, School of Dentistry SCHOOL FOUNDATIONS 237 School Foundations HISTORY A small but determined group of dentists met during the summer of 1943 in Grand Ledge, Michigan. Their purpose was to form an organization that would serve as a catalyst, urging the Seventh-day Adventist Church to sponsor a dental school where young adults could learn the dental profession in an environment consistent with their religious beliefs. These men were the founders of the National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD). Under the leadership of Dr. J. Russell Mitchell, the organization's first president, the goal of a Christian dental school bega n taking conceptual form. NASDAD expanded in membership and objectives through men such as Dr. C. C. Ray, who toured the country on his own time in search of fellow Seventh-day Adventist dentists who were willing to pursue NASDAD's goals. Dr. M. Webster Prince served as president of NASDAD in 1948 and 1949. At a meeting in San Francisco in 1949, NASDAD members voted unanimously to support the dental school project. Later that year at a NASDAD session in Hinsdale, Illinois, the members pledged a strong financial base in support of their goals. The momentum of the effort became evident in the early 1950s. The General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, under the guidance of President W. H. Branson, asked Dr. Prince to conduct a feasibility study. Official action was taken in 1951 to authorize establishment of the School of Dentistry as a unit of Loma Linda University's School of Medicine. Dr. Prince was selected as the first dean of the School of Dentistry. His leadership in organizing and eventually administering the new School of Dentistry was facilitated by his prior experience as president of the Michigan Dental Association and as chair of the American Dental Association Council on Dental Education. Forty-two students comprised the inaugural class in the late fall of 1953. A dental hygiene curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science degree was developed in 1959 under the direction of Dr. Gerald A. Mitchell, chair of the Department of Periodontics. Violet Bates became chair of the new department, and the first class of ten dental hygienists graduated in 1961. In 1960 Dr. Charles T. Smith became dean. During this period the school experienced pos itive growth in many areas. A dental assisting curriculum was developed in 1968 under the leadership of Betty Zendner. The first class graduated in 1969, receiving the Associate in Science degree. A dental auxiliary utilization (DAU) program was initiated to provide enhanced learning for dental students. The Monument Valley Dental Clinic for Navajo Indians was started in 1966, and Dean Smith succeeded in finding from public sources fiscal support for the clinic building and for faculty housing. New advanced-education (postdoctora l) programs were initiated in five clinical disciplines: orthodontics, oral surgery, periodontics, endodontics, and oral pathology . During the 1970s the School of Dentistry continued its evolution into one of the premier clinical programs in the United States . Dr. Judson Klooster became dean in 1971. One of his major contributions was the expansion of Prince Hall, which was completed in May 1976. The new building more than doubled the number of clinical units; provided facilities for specialized areas of clinical instruction; and included eight new research laboratories, new classrooms, seminar rooms, amphitheaters, urgently needed teacher office space, and a commensurate expansion of support facilities and services. The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic was remodeled, and an outpatient surgicenter was developed to meet the needs of those patients requiring general anesthesia for dental treatment. The School of Dentistry became an important regional resource for providing dental care for developmentally disabled children and adults, many of whom require such a treatment setting. The Biomaterials Research Laboratory was constructed; and new advanced-education programs were initiated in pediatric dentistry, implant dentistry, dental anesthesiology, and prosthodontics . A new program was established in 1985 to provide a U.S. dental education for foreign-trained dentists. An increasing number of dental professionals from other countries were seeking an American education and the opportunity to practice dentistry in the United States or to gain advanced knowledge to share in their own countries. The International Dentist Program continues to offer an intensive, twenty-one-month course of study leading to a D.D.S. degree. The program has added a six-month certificate program limited to dental missionaries from other countries who sense the need for updated continuing education. In 2000, the first major expansion of the School of Dentistry in more than twenty years added 15,000 square feet to Prince Hall on the east side and provided two new patient entrances. The expanded Special Care Dentistry Clinic and the enlarged Pediatric Dentistry Clinic were relocated to the ground floor. An add itional student laboratory was also included on that level. On the second floor, the new space allowed for expansion of the predoctoral clinic, with thirty-six additional operatories. 238 UNIVERSITY CATALOG OUR MISSION Loma Linda University School of Dentistry seeks to further the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ by providing an environment in which: Students learn to provide high-quality oral health care based on sound scientific principles.

The application should be completed and returned to the Washington address indicated on the application. AADSAS processes this application and sends copies to the schools of the applicant's choice. The School of Dentistry at Loma Linda University recommends that applicants file their AADSAS application before August 1 in order to be competitive. To be given consideration for the next entering class, the student's application deadline is December 1. The following is a step-by-s tep process for completing an application to Loma Linda University. 1. Supplementary application . When an AADSAS application arrives at Loma Linda University, it is screened; and qualified applicants are sent a supplementary application for the School of Dentistry. 2. Supplementary written materials . The applicant must return the completed supplementary application and materials within 30 days. This includes: an essay specific to Loma Linda University, a wallet-sized photograph, and the application fee of $75. 3. Transcripts . Official transcripts may be sent to AADSAS and then released by AADSAS to the School of Dentistry. When an applicant becomes an accepted student, official transcripts, mailed directly from all colleges/universities, are required in order for the student to be registered for the first quarter of classes. GENERAL INFORMATION 245 4. References . The applicant is asked to supply a minimum of three personal references. It is recommended that these include an academic reference from a science instructor; a reference from an employer; a character or religious reference such as from a minister; and a reference from a friend in the dental profession. If the applicant has attended a college or university that has a preprofessional committee that prepares a preprofessional evaluation, it is required that Loma Linda University be sent a copy of this evaluation from the committee. Members of the applicant's family are excluded from writing the required letters of reference, although letters will be accepted for the file in addition to those required. Recommendation letters may be sent to AADSAS and then released by AADSAS to Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. 5. Dental Admission Test . The applicant is required to complete\u2014and must meet specific criteria related to performance on\u2014the Dental Admission Test (DAT). Preference is given to applicants who have taken the test by October of the academic year preceding that for which admission is desired.

STUDENT LIFE 249 Student Life SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY TECHNICAL STANDARDS In harmony with its own education, research, and service objectives, and using the American Dental Education Association suggested guidelines, Loma Linda University School of Dentistry has identified technical standards for its programs. The qualified applicant will meet, or will have the potential to meet, the following technical standards\u2014standards that every stude nt in the dentistry programs is expected to reach. Cognitive abilities School of Dentistry students must have abilities that allow them to accurately and effectively measure, verify, calculate, reas on, analyze, and synthesize. Students must be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures in order to fully and completely solve dental problems. In addition, students must be able to visua lize and comprehend physical demonstrations in the classroom, laboratory, and clinic. Effective problem solving requires students to gather, organize, and assess relevant information in order to arrive at an integrated solution. Observation For learning to occur, students will be required to observe and interpret demonstrations and experiences. Such observation requires the functional use of vision, touch, hearing, and somatic sensation. Observation is further enhanced by the sense of smell. Students must be able to acquire information from written documents; and to visualize information presented in images from papers, films, slides, or videos. They must be able to interpret radiographic and other graphic images, with or without the use of assistive devices. Students must be able to observe patients accurately, at a distance and close at hand. They must be able to observe and appreciate verbal and nonverbal communications when performing dental operations or administering medications. All students in the School of Dentistry must possess adequate visual and tactile skills to perform dental examinations and prov ide treatment. Visual acuity, accommodation, and color vision are necessary to discern differences and variations in color, shape, and general appearance between normal and abnormal hard and soft tissues. Touch and somatic sensation are required for effective learning, as well as for effective evaluation and treatment of patients. A student must also possess sufficient visual acuity t o read charts, records, small print, and handwritten notations. 250 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Communication Students in the School of Dentistry must be fluent in the use of standard written and spoken English. Thus students' communication with patients, faculty, and staff will be facilitated when eliciting or providing information; or when documentin g changes in patients' mood, activity, and/or posture. Students must also be skilled in observing and understanding nonverbal communication. In addition, they must develop the professional judgment that will enable them to discern when and how to maintain patient confidentiality. Motor skills School of Dentistry students should have sufficient motor and sensory capability in both hands to be able to provide general dental care. They must possess the motor and sensory capabilities to perform diagnostic procedures\u2014including such diagnostic maneuvers as palpation, percussion, and auscultation; and to perform basic laboratory tests. Exercising these capabilities requ ires coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium, and functional tactile and visual senses. Students must be able to operate foot controls, utilizing fine movements; and to operate high- or low-speed dental instruments, accurately performing movements of less than one-half millimeter. They must also demonstrate well-developed tactile sense and precise control while using dental hand instruments. Behavioral and social attributes Students must be able to perform basic life-support (e.g., CPR), transfer and position disabled patients, and physically restrain patients who lack motor control. Additionally, they must be able to position or reposition themselves ar ound the patient and dental chair while sitting or standing. Students must possess the emotional stability and resilience required for full utilization of their abilities in the context of a full and challenging education program. Success in the educational program requires use of good judgment; prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients; and development of mature, sensitive, and effective relations hips with patients. It is also imperative that students be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. S tudents must be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility, and to learn to function in the face of uncertainties i nherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, cultural sensitivity, and motivation are all personal qualities that will be assessed during the admissions and education proce ss. Disabled applicants and students It is Loma Linda University's policy to comply fully with the provisions of The Americans with Disabilities Act [42 U.S.C., Sec . 12131 (2) (1990)]. The school is committed to providing dental education\u2014including support services and reasonable accommodations for disabilities\u2014to qualified applicants who will be able to perform all technical standards with or without accommodations; and for whom such accommodation does not fundamentally alter the School of Dentistry courses or create an undue burden. During the application process, the school requests that an applicant disclose any disability for which an accommodation may be needed. The Admissions Committee requires written documentation of the disability, which they will review prior to making an assessment as to whether or not the applicant can be expected to perform the essential functions of the program. A student who desires accommodation for any disability identified after admission must complete a request form available in the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs for evaluation with appropriate University entities. Appropriate and reasonabl e accommodation will be provided, as necessary. POLICIES FOR THIS SCHOOL The information on student life contained in this CATALOG is brief. The Student Handbook more comprehensively addresses University and school expectations, regulations, and policies; and is available to each registered student. Students need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the Student Handbook. Add itional information regarding policies specific to a particular school or program within the University is available from the respective school. CODE OF ETHICS A school of dentistry is a place where the professionals of tomorrow are selected and trained in the development of professiona l and ethical attitudes that are consistent with the highest goals of the profession. It is for this purpose that the School of D entistry has a code of ethics. This code is a means of educating and training the future dentist in areas of professional ethical activity, and is a means of developing an ethical and moral awareness that will help professionals serve the public and the profession. The Code of Ethics of the School of Dentistry applies to all students in the School\u2014including dental hygiene, dentistry, internatio nal, graduate, and certificate students. In addition, residents, fellows, preceptors, research scholars, and exchange students invol ved in School programs shall also be subject to school policies. STUDENT LIFE 251 STUDENT ASSOCIATION Membership in the Dental Students Association is open to all students. The objectives of the organization include creating a common bond among students\u2014orienting them to organized dentistry, encouraging and fostering community outreach activities, stimulating interest in current scientific development, providing programs of broad academic scope, promoting students' various interests, and providing social activities for students. SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES Conventions The annual Alumni-Student Convention, sponsored since 1960 by the Alumni Association, gives opportunity for students to meet alumni and hear presentations by prominent guest lecturers in dentistry. Students have the opportunity to make research presentations in the form of table clinics. The winners are then invited to pres ent their table clinics at state and national dental conventions. A dedication service is held during the convention, giving students an opportunity to dedicate their professional life to Chris t. First-year students (D1) are presented with personalized Bibles; graduating students are given personalized Loma Linda University laboratory coats. 252 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Academic Information GENERAL POLICIES Registration The student must register on or before the dates designated by the Office of University Records. Early registration is encourag ed. Registration procedures are completed electronically at the MyLLU Registration Portal <http://myllu.llu.edu>. Once at the porta l a student must clear registration holds (Student Health, transcript holds, housing holds) and clear finance. At the beginning o f the first quarter of attendance, a student is required to have a picture taken for the student identification badge. International students must also register with the International Student Affairs office each quarter. Late registration is permissible only in case of a compelling reason; a charge is made if registration is not completed by the designated dates. The student may not attend class without being registered, and in no case may registration take place later t han the first week of the term. A change in registration after the second week affects the grade record. A student may not concurre ntly register for courses in another school of the University without permission of the associate dean for academic affairs. Attendance Regular attendance at lectures, clinics, and other assemblies is required of all students. All lectures and laboratories provid e information essential for successful completion of the program. Each student is responsible for all material covered and assignments made. Absences in excess of 15 percent may be sufficient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Clinics and individual courses/instructors may have more stringent requirements. Length of academic residence To fulfill the requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, the student must be registered for a full course load at the University for the entire senior year for the Bachelor of Science degree; and the entire D3 and D4 years for the Doctor of Dent al Surgery degree. Dean's list Outstanding academic performance will be rewarded by publication of the Dean's List each quarter. The eligibility requirements are: complete at least 12 units of graded course work during the quarter; achieve a term grade-point average of at least 3.5 with no grade lower than a B-; receive no Incomplete grades on the grade report. Course waiver A course requirement may be waived if the applicant has previously taken the course and earned a grade of B or above, but no credit results. Evaluation for waiver of courses will be completed only after an applicant has been accepted to the program, an d must be approved by the course director at this University and the school's associate dean for academic affairs. Tuition is not reduced if courses are waived or if a student takes less than a full load. Special examination It is the policy of the school that all students are expected to take examinations at the scheduled time. The only acceptable e xcuse for not taking an examination on time is major illness (documented by the Student Health Service and conveyed to the course director and the Office of Student Affairs prior to the examination). The consequences of missing an examination under the circumstances of documented illness are determined by the course director. If a student appears late for an examination, s/he m ay be denied admission to the examination site. If a student arrives late for an examination and is allowed to take the examinatio n, s/he will be required to finish the examination at the same time as students who arrive on time. Repeating/remediating a course If a student receives an unsatisfactory or failing grade in a required course, it will be necessary for him/her to do additiona l work. Based on the original grade earned by the student, and upon the recommendation of the Academic Review Committee, one of the following plans will be pursued: 1. For courses with unsatisfactory performance (D+/D/U grades) the student must reregister for the course, review the course work independently, repeat required assignments or quizzes, and take any or all course examinations as required by the course director. The highest grade allowed for a remediated course is C. At the discretion of the Academic Review Committee and course director, the student may be required to repeat the course at the next course offering. ACADEMIC INFORMATION 253 2. For courses with failing performance (F grades), the student must reregister for the course, attend the class and/or laboratory, and take all course examinations at the next regular course offering. 3. Both the original and repeat grades are entered into the student's permanent academic record, but only the repeat grade units are computed in the grade-point average.

NATIONAL DENTAL BOARDS Successful completion of the National Board Examination Parts I and II (NBE-I and NBE-II) is a requirement for graduation. The National Board examinations are designed to assess cognitive knowledge of the basic, behavioral, and clinical sciences. Eligibility to sit for either part of the National Board Examination is determined by successful completion of the curriculum leading up to the examination. In addition, students are required to pass a comprehensive examination that assesses mastery of the test specifications prior to each National Board Examination. The eligibility requirements and timetable for passing the National Board Examination are stated below: PART I First attempt\u2014 Scheduled during June or July following completion of the second year. If a student fails the examination, s/he will have her/h is scheduled clinic time substantially reduced. During this time, students will be required to study for a re-examination no later than December. Second attempt\u2014 If a student does not successfully complete the second attempt of the Part I examination by the end of Autumn Quarter, s/he wil l be required to take a two-quarter leave of absence to prepare for re-examination the succeeding summer quarter. Third attempt\u2014 After taking the re-examination in the succeeding Summer Quarter, the student will be allowed to work on the clinic until examination results are received. If the student successfully completes the Part I examination, s/he will continue to work on t he clinic for the Summer and Autumn Quarters and will begin didactic courses again during the Winter Quarter with the current third-year students. If the student does not successfully complete the National Board Examination Part I on the third attempt, s/he will be discontinued from the program. PART II First attempt\u2014 Scheduled in December of the fourth year. If the examination is not successfully completed, access to the clinic will be restri cted in order to provide additional time for study. The student will be given an opportunity to retake the examination in the follow ing Spring Quarter. National Board Examination policy requires subsequent attempts to be at least ninety days apart. If a student f ails the Part II examination, s/he will not be permitted to participate in licensure examinations. Second attempt\u2014 A student who fails the Part II examination a second time will be required to take a leave of absence to prepare for a re- examination. A candidate for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree must have successfully completed Parts I and II of the National Board Examination before being awarded the D.D.S. degree. ACADEMIC INFORMATION 255 PROCEDURES FOR ACADEMIC REVIEW There are six Academic Review Committees: D1, D2, D3, D4, IDP, and Dental Hygiene. Membership of each committee consists of the associate dean for academic affairs, the associate dean for student affairs, the associate dean for admissions, and the course directors of all courses required of the respective class in the academic year. The associate dean for clinic administration and primary attending faculty are members of the D3/D4 Academic Review Committees. In addition, each committee has two student members appointed by the dean in consultation with the DSA officers. Student committee members will be in the class one year ahead of the class being reviewed. The Academic Review Committees meet once per quarter to evaluate student academic and clinical performance and progress records. Students whose performance does not meet the stated academic standards and students who are being considered for discontinuation may be scheduled for a hearing with the committee. The committee also recommends to the dean all appropriate candidates for promotion, academic probation, repeat, or other appropriate actions; as well as students who should receive special recognition for academic excellence. The process for evaluation of academic performance is as follows: 1. The Academic Review Committee\u2014by reviewing grades, reports, and other pertinent information\u2014identifies students whose academic and/or clinical performance is below acceptable levels. 2. The associate dean for student affairs notifies a student facing possible academic sanctions regarding the time and place for a meeting called for the purpose of allowing the student to appear before the committee to present reasons why action should not be taken. The Academic Review Committee considers the student's presentation and all available information before making a recommendation. 3. The dean may enforce one or more of four academic sanction options: o Academic probation o Remedial action o Academic leave of absence o Academic discontinuation Please refer to Academic Disciplinary Policy for more specific descriptions regarding each academic sanction. 4. A student may appeal the decision of the Academic Review Committee to the dean. Such appeals are not expected to be routine and should be considered only in circumstances where new and relevant information exists that was not available for consideration by the Academic Review Committee. The dean will review the matter and either render a decision or appoint a three-member ad hoc committee. Members of this committee will not have been involved in the Academic Review Committee decision process. The ad hoc committee will determine whether the process was appropriately followed, review new information, and judge whether the record supports the decision. They will report their findings and recommendation to the dean, who will decide if the appealing student will be permitted to continue participating in classes and/or clinical assignments during the appeal proceedings. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINARY POLICY Academic probation Academic probation is a specified period of time during which the student is given an opportunity to comply with specific academic standards. Such action must be confirmed by letter to the student. Criteria for placement on academic probation (predoctoral and dental hygiene students) A student will be placed on academic probation if s/he meets one or more of the following conditions: 1. Term or cumulative grade-point average (G.P.A.) below 2.0. 2. Failing (U/F) or unsatisfactory (D+/D) grades in any course required for the degree. 3. Clinical performance below minimum expected for current academic level. 4. Social/behavioral/ethical problems that significantly impact academic and/or clinical performance. 256 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Criteria for advisory notice of potential for academic probation A graduate student/resident will be sent an advisory letter of the potential for placement on academic probation under the following conditions: 1. Term G.P.A. of 2.7 (B-). 2. One or more courses with grade of B-. 3. One or more courses with a grade of marginally satisfactory (MS). Criteria for placement on academic probation (graduate students and residents) A graduate student/resident will be placed on academic probation if s/he meets one or more of the following conditions: 1. Term G.P.A. of 2.3 (C+). 2. Failing (F/U) or unsatisfactory (C+/C/C- or D+/D/D-) grades in any required course required for the specialty certificate or master of science (M.S.) degree program (if applicable). 3. Clinical performance below minimum expected for their year level. 4. Social/behavioral/ethical problems which significantly impact academic and/or clinical performance. Level of academic probation (pre-doctoral, dental hygiene, graduate students and residents) The level of academic probation indicates the seriousness of the cumulative academic deficiency. However, depending on the seriousness or nature of the academic deficiency, a student may be considered for academic leave of absence or discontinuation at any level of probation. Level 1 First term on academic probation. Level 2 Second term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later term. Level 3 Third term on academic probation, consecutive or nonconsecutive. If a student is unable to remove academic probationary status within the following term, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. EXCEPTION: Continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course cannot be repeated until a later term. Level 4 If a student meets criteria for academic probation for a fourth term, consecutive or nonconsecutive, s/he will be considered for academic discontinuation. Disciplinary Actions Available (graduate students and residents) A student/resident who is not performing up to expectations can receive the following: Restriction of Clinical Privileges by program director Academic Probation (Level 1 to 3) by the Associate Dean for Advanced Education upon the recommendation of the program director Behavioral Probation (Level 1 to 3) by the Associate Dean for Advanced Education upon the recommendation of the program director Clinical Probation (Level 1 to 3) by the Associate Dean for Advanced Education upon the recommendation of the program director Discontinuation by the Associate Dean for Advanced Education upon the recommendation of the program director Probation All recommendations to the Associate Dean for Advanced Education must be supported by well-documented evidence of repeated counseling and other internal measures designed to point out deficiencies and take corrective action through a detaile d remediation program. A remediation program must be specific in design, implemented, and monitored for any student/resident who is not performing up to a program's stated standards. It is helpful to have documentary evidence on record by multiple faculty members with detailed accounts of dates, times, explanations of counseling, discussions, and corrective measures. Written statements from support staff should also be included if they have direct contact or knowledge of a matter involving a graduate student/resident. Graduate students/residents may be placed on academic probation, behavioral probation, and clinical probation. Probation begins at Level 1 and may progress to Level 3. Graduate students/residents should be placed on probation for a prescribed period of time: one quarter, two quarters, etc. This information should be conveyed to a student/resident verbally and in writing. ACADEMIC INFORMATION 257 Continuation Students/residents who are not progressing as expected may be continued in their year group for as long as necessary before promoted to the next year or discontinued. To exercise this option, the Associate Dean for Advanced Education must inform University Records of the decision to continue a student/resident and state the anticipated length of that continuation. Program directors make the determination as to when to continue a student/resident when to discontinue a student/resident and allow him/her to graduate or continue their studies. Invariably, the length of the continuation period will determine when a student/resident actually completes his/her program. Discontinuation Students/residents who do not make any measurable improvement by the end of the prescribed remediation and counseling periods may be discontinued by the Associate Dean for Advanced Education on the recommendation of the respective program director. Restrictions for a student on academic probation A student on academic probation: 1. May not serve as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization. 2. May not take any elective courses. 3. May not participate in any elective off-campus service learning or mission activities. 4. Remains on academic probation until all the terms of the probation sanctions have been fulfilled, unless the student is discontinued. Remedial action (Remediation) As a condition for continued enrollment, remedial action may consist of: 1. Counseling, tutoring; and/or repeating assignments or course work, or completing additional assignments or course work possibly including repeating an academic year or portion thereof. 2. Other specified requirements. Academic leave of absence Academic leave of absence is a specified period of time during which the student is withdrawn from the academic program. Upon request to and approval by the Academic Review Committee, the student may return to the program at a year/term level specified by the committee. The student may be requested to fulfill specific requirements prior to reentering the academic program. The following guidelines pertain to when an academic leave of absence may be considered for a student who is in one or more of the following situations: Student has a serious academic deficit that cannot be removed while continuing with current course work. At the end of the academic year, student does not meet the criteria for promotion to the next academic year. Student has three consecutive quarters on academic probation. Student has not passed the National Board Examination on schedule after two attempts and requires full study time to prepare for the National Board Examination. Student fulfills criteria for academic discontinuation yet shows promise for future success despite current deficiencies. Return from an academic leave of absence requires that the student reapply for admission by written request to the associate de an for academic affairs. The student must meet the requirements for readmission specified by the Academic Review Committee at the time the leave of absence was granted. The requirements for readmission may also be reviewed by the Academic Review Committee. Academic discontinuation Guidelines for academic discontinuation are as follows: D1 Year Any term with one or more failing grades, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Three or more unsatisfactory or failing grades within the academic year, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Three consecutive quarters on academic probation.

STUDENT-INITIATED ACADEMIC GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE If a student wishes to contest a grade, s/he should discuss the grade first with the instructor, where appropriate; then with t he course director, if applicable; and finally with the department chair. If the student is not satisfied, s/he may then appeal to the associate dean for academic affairs (for further discussion of the academic grievance process, see Loma Linda University Studen t Handbook, Section V\u2014University Policies). ACADEMIC INFORMATION 259 SERVICE LEARNING Service Learning at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry continues the original purpose of the school\u2014to train dental health professionals to provide service to underserved populations, both locally and abroad. Field experience for students of dentistry and dental hygiene includes extramural opportunities within the U.S. and in foreign countries. In addition to providing clinical treatment, service-learning experiences include local health fairs and elementary school dental health presentations. Service experiences may last from one day to several weeks. All dental and dental hygiene students are required to complete assigned service-learning rotations and minimum clock hours as described in each program. Dental students are required to complete a minimum of 120 service learning hours. Forty hours must be completed doing local community service dentistry. Up to 30 of the remaining 80 hours may be completed doing non-dental service. Students are also required to be in good and regular standing to be eligible to participate in elective international service-l earning experiences. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT Because the study of dental sciences and arts is based on a foundation in essentially the same science subjects as are studied in medicine and allied health curricula, the School of Dentistry shares with the School of Medicine the facilities for teaching ba sic sciences. Classrooms, laboratories, student lounges, teachers' offices, and clinical facilities related solely to dentistry occupy the Sc hool of Dentistry building, named in honor of M. Webster Prince, the first dean. Prince Hall is on the University mall facing the University Church and adjacent to the Medical Center. The facilities effectively accommodate collaboration with the Medical Center in ongoing research and service programs. The total resources of the University constitute a wealth of opportunity for the student with initiative and willingness to dev elop individual capacity to the fullest extent. Students find varied opportun ities for serving and learning in the immediate University community, in school-sponsored service-learning clinics, in clinical and research electives, and in diverse volunteer programs. BASIC SCIENCES DEPARTMENT SERVING THE SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY The Loma Linda University departments of basic sciences include anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, and physiology and pharmacology. The basic sciences serve as the foundation for the dental sciences by leading toward an understanding of normal structure and function, as well as introducing the basis for pathology in the practice of dentistry. Subjects are taught in the first year of the dental hygiene and the first two years of the general dentistry curricula as parts of three conceptually integrated sequences of courses\u2014sequences in physiology, in anatomy, and in applied science. Throughout the basic sciences, an appreciation of God's creation and His wisdom is reinforced through the study of human biology. Students are encouraged to extend their knowledge and apply it for their own well-being and for the well-being of their patients. The Department of Anatomy provides students with the opportunity to learn the fundamental morphology of the human body, including gross anatomy, histology, neuroanatomy, and embryology. The Department of Biochemistry enables students to learn the fundamentals of biochemistry as they apply to the practice of dentistry. The Department of Physiology and Pharmacology enables the student to describe the normal physiological functions of the major body systems as they relate to the mastery of dentistry; and to apply the principles and basic concepts of drug action, safety, and disposition. This basic science focus provides a basic fund of knowledge that is essential for the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene. The faculty are dedicated to providing students with tools that expand their thinking and challenge them to ask probing questions a nd to earnestly search for answers. Their aim is to prepare students to excel scientifically. The higher aim is, through the Chris tian atmosphere of this University, to prepare students to become truly compassionate dentists. 260 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Financial Information FINANCIAL POLICIES The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on t he School or the University unless approved by the dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prep ared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic cond itions warrant. GENERAL FINANCIAL PRACTICES The student is expected to arrange for financial resources to cover all expenses before the beginning of each school year. Previous accounts with other schools or this University must have been settled. Student financial aid Loans are available only to United States citizens, green-card holders, or those with permanent-resident status.

TRAPP, Director, Advanced Education Program FACULTY Barry K. Krall John W. Leyman Larry D. Trapp The advanced education program in dental anesthesiology is offered to dentists who desire to pursue a career in anesthesiology for dentistry. The educational design of this twenty-four month program provides a strong clinical background in anesthesiology . The program is based in Special Care Dentistry--an outpatient facility utilizing general anesthesia for dental care, located in the School of Dentistry\u2014where approximately 4,000 patients are treated on an annual basis. Additional training at area hospitals is received in structured rotations in cardiology, internal medicine, and anesthesiology. Didactic instruction is coordinated through the School of Dentistry's Department of Dental Anesthesiology. Residents attend an anesthesiology lecture series and weekly grand rounds at Loma Linda University Medical Center. In add ition, regular meetings of the dental anesthesiology residents are held, during which a variety of contemporary topics are discussed\u2014including a review of the current literature. Residents also participate in teaching pain control in the predoctoral curriculum. Upon successful completion of the program, the dental anesthesiologist will be eligible to take the diplomate examination of th e American Dental Board of Anesthesiology, and to apply for a general anesthesia permit in any state of the United States. Following enrollment into the program, residents may apply for acceptance to the Master of Science in Dentistry (M.S.D.) degree track in addition to the specialty certificate. The application should be submitted at the end of the first year and be suppor ted by the program director. Admission into the M.S.D. degree track may extend the length of study. Any additional time must be in residence and continued financial support is not guaranteed. Application deadline Application for admission should be submitted no later than October 1 of the year prior to the summer of intended enrollment. Tuition (2008-2009) No additional tuition required.

CHARLES J. GOODACRE, Dean, School of Dentistry The goal of the General Dentistry Program is to train practitioners in the delivery of high-quality dental care that is preventive in purpose and comprehensive in scope, and that is based on sound biological principles. Curriculum Dentistry, like all health professions, exists to benefit society and, therefore, continually assesses its professional service s to ascertain what measures, attitudes, and skills most effectively serve society. The School of Dentistry is committed to: Beginning the curriculum with a strong foundation in the sciences that are basic to knowledge of the structure and function of the human being in health and in sickness. Providing an educational environment that progressively leads a student to mastery and correlation of clinical sciences and skills. Developing a frame of reference from which to mobilize the resources of dentists and associated professional personnel in both delivery of health care and contribution to community well-being by education for the prevention of illness. These concepts include responsibility for contributing to the body of scientific knowledge by questioning, investigating, and teaching; for remaining sensitive and adaptive to the needs of humanity in ever-changing conditions; and for maintaining consciousness of the individual obligation to live, practice, and strive for the good of humanity. The curriculum in dentistry, organized to be completed in four academic years, fulfills requirements for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Objective The primary objective of the dental curriculum is to graduate men and women who attest to the purpose of the University and the goals of the School of Dentistry, which include advancing knowledge and understanding of health, disease, and ways to improve health and the dental health care-delivery system through basic and applied research. Admission Information and procedures for applying to the Doctor of Dental Surgery Program can be found under Application and Admissions in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CATALOG. Regulations The student is also subject to the conditions of registration, attendance, financial policy, governing practices, and graduatio n requirements outlined in Section II and in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CATALOG. Instruments, textbooks, additional materials The instruments, textbooks, and materials required for the study and practice of dentistry are prescribed by the School of Dentistry. The school issues dental instruments each quarter as needed in the program. Unauthorized or incomplete equipment is not acceptable. Advance administrative approval must be obtained for any exception. Employment Because the dental program is very rigorous, first-year students in dentistry may not accept part-time employment during the first term. Such employment thereafter may be accepted by the student only upon receiving written permission from the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. Academic incentive program Detailed information on the Academic Incentive Program may be found under that heading in the School of Dentistry general information in Section III of this CATALOG. Licensing Eligibility to take examinations given by the state and regional boards of dental examiners is based on essentially the same requirements as are stipulated by the School of Dentistry for the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree. Information about the examinations of the respective states is available from the associate dean for academic affairs. Credentials from the National Board of Dental Examiners are accepted in lieu of the written portion of a state examination in most states. Many states requir e the National Board Examination and provide no alternative. (The national board does not include a clinical examination.) 266 UNIVERSITY CATALOG D.D.S. competencies The curriculum is designed to ensure that by graduation all students will have the skills, attitudes, and competencies importan t to the successful practice of dentistry.

KRISTI J. WILKINS, Chair JEAN M. HONNY, Director, Degree Completion Program FACULTY Darlene A. Armstrong Kellie R. Bergendahl D. Darlene Cheek Janeen C. Duff Debra K. Friesen Jean M. Honny Michelle T. Hurlbutt Shirley A. Lee Joyce H. Sanders Joni A. Stephens Kristi J. Wilkins Colleen Whitt Shelly A. Withers Established in 1959, the Department of Dental Hygiene, the undergraduate program of the School of Dentistry, is largely focused on preventive oral health services and maintenance care. Dental science courses, preclinical lectures and seminars, laboratory exercises, and clinical assignments have been developed to provide training in the variety of procedures delegated t o the dental hygienist within the dental practice setting. These experiences are sequenced in an organized manner that provides f or continual growth and proficiency in performance of all traditional and expanded function procedures. The purpose of the program is to develop professionals prepared for the current practice of dental hygiene, as well as graduate s who are additionally prepared to deal with future changes in dentistry. Courses that encourage critical thinking and problem- solving techniques and that enhance the ability to evaluate the latest in research are important adjuncts to clinical training. Upon completion of this curriculum, graduates will be prepared to enter a variety of career options available to a dental hygie nist. The Degree Completion Program is designed for licensed dental hygienists who graduated from an Associate in Science degree program, or its equivalent, and wish to complete the baccalaureate (BS) degree in dental hygiene. This program is the equivalen t of one full academic year. In addition to the degree completion courses in either education or public health, the participant will need to complete any remaining general education requirements needed to fulfill a baccalaureate degree. The program is designed to be completed primarily online, with a requisite teaching or public health component that may be accomplished in the geographical area of the student. This program offers the challenge and quality of a traditional classroom, yet provides the flexibility to fit education into the life of the busy dental professional. Students can study at their own conven ience, learn in small groups with expert faculty, and meet career goals at their own speed. Students who tend to be the most successfu l in this type of program are self-directed, computer literate, and self-motivated in their learning and study habits. Two areas of focus are included in this program. The first is teaching and prepares the student to instruct in a dental hygiene program. The second is a public health focus, which will allow graduates to work in a community/dental public health program or allow them to teach in a dental hygiene program. Philosophy A profession in the health arts and sciences calls increasingly for persons of intelligence, integrity, responsibility, and dep th of human understanding. Therefore, the program of instruction is planned on a strong liberal arts foundation. The student is encouraged to take electives that contribute to breadth of knowledge and quality of values. The choice of electives in early college work is important for many reasons. The School of Dentistry is interested in applicants with the potential to become hygienists who are well-read and gracious persons\u2014prepared to communicate effectively in professional and community relationships. They should be able to draw on knowledge of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease, applying resources based on Christian ideals and values to aid in the solution of personal problems. They should also be able to develop the at titudes and skills that will most effectively serve society. DENTAL HYGIENE\u2014SD 285 Goal The goal of the Dental Hygiene Program is to educate competent, concerned, and active members of the dental hygiene profession who possess the ability to effectively perform the expanding scope of practice of the dental hygienist. Loma Linda University emphasizes Christian values and beliefs and the concept of whole-person care. Opportunities for spiritual growth and fellowship among faculty and students are interwoven into daily academic pursuits, clinical practice, and social interactions. The advancement of dental hygiene depends on an ever-growing body of knowledge. Therefore, this program also places great importance on providing an atmosphere in which students can develop the skills necessary to objectively assess new theories and trends in dentistry in light of scientific knowledge and principles. By combining Christian values with an appreciation for research and the scientific method, graduates will continually apply sound principles to patient care and exhibit God's love in the quality of service they render. Admission Information and procedures for applying to the Dental Hygiene Program can be found under the Application and Admissions section of the general information for the School of Dentistry in Section III. Curriculum Dental hygiene, a profession dating back to 1913, is largely concerned with preventive health services. The hygienist works in association with the dentist in private-practice offices, industrial organizations, schools, hospitals, state or federal public health services, and the armed forces. The curriculum is organized as a four-year college program leading to the Bachelor of Science degree. The freshman and sophomore years of largely prescribed, preprofessional study may be taken at any accredited college. The professional program begins with the junior year in the School of Dentistry. The program is approved by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association. The first class at this University graduated in 1961.

Roger Hadley, M.D. Dean, School of Medicine SCHOOL FOUNDATIONS 315 School Foundations HISTORY The professional curriculum in medicine, usually requiring four academic years of study and experience in a university and hospital setting, was first offered at Loma Linda University in 1909. More than nine decades later, the events since 1909 seem blurred by the rapid changes that institutions of higher learning experience in an effort to keep pace with the growth of knowledge. Since 1909 The first two years of medicine were always taught on the Loma Linda campus. From 1913 to the mid-1960s, the third and fourth years were taught in Los Angeles at what is now White Memorial Medical Center (the first part of which was built in 1918) and at nearby Los Angeles County Hospital (now Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center). Construction of Loma Linda University Medical Center (inclusive of clinical, teaching, and research facilities) allowed the entire four-year curriculum to be offered on and near the Loma Linda campus, beginning with school year 1966-67. The medical center was occupied in July 1967. OUR MISSION The mission of the School of Medicine is to continue the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ, \"To make man whole\" (Luke 9:6). Preparing the physician Our purpose is the formation of Christian physicians, providing whole-person care to individuals, families, and communities. Fulfilling this responsibility requires: Education Creating an environment in which medical students, graduate students, and residents will acquire the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes appropriate to Christian health professionals and scholars. Research Cultivating an atmosphere of i nquiry and discovering new routes to wholeness through basic and clinical research. 316 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Service Providing timely access to cost-effective, comprehensive, whole-person care for all patients, without regard for their circumstances or status. Developing the whole person The Christian view of wholeness holds that the needs of patients go beyond the healing of the body and that the development of students involves more than the training of the mind. We are dedicated to promoting physical, intellectual, social, and spiritu al growth in our faculty and our students, and to transforming our daily activities into personal ministries. Reaching the world Providing whole-person care wherever the opportunity arises, participating with the world community in the provision of local medical education, providing international physicians and scientists the opportunities for professional interaction and enrichm ent, sharing the good news of a loving God as demonstrated by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ\u2014these are the goals of the students, faculty, and graduates of Loma Linda University School of Medicine. GENERAL REGULATIONS 317 General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school and ou tlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. 318 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the school accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualiti es of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. THE STUDY OF MEDICINE Preparation for the practice of medicine begins early in life and early in the student's schooling. The greater the aptitudes f or and interests in learning widely and appreciatively in the major areas of knowledge\u2014the natural sciences, the humanities, the behavioral sciences\u2014the more able and versatile the student is likely to become. In selecting students, the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine looks for applicants who are best suited to fulfill t he mission of the school and to successfully practice medicine. The school desires students who demonstrate abi lity to learn independently, to think critically, and to articulate clearly\u2014both orally and in written form\u2014their ideas and opinions. It is important that students in the School of Medicine demonstrate excellent interpersonal skills and show evidence of sensitivity t o the needs of humanity. The Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine puts forth considerable effort to ensure that an applicant is qualified for medical school. The applicant's credentials are reviewed to assess scholastic performance. The committee also looks for prerequisite qualities of character and personality, potential for self-direction and the use of discriminating j udgment, and dedication to the ideal of service to society. GENERAL ENTRANCE INFORMATION A total of 85 semester (128 quarter) units of credit from an accredited college is required for acceptance by the School of Medicine. Preference is given, however, to college graduates. Credit must be presented for the following subjects: APPLICATION AND ADMISSIONS 319 SEMESTER/QUARTER HOURS General biology or zoology with laboratory\u20148/12 General or inorganic chemistry with laboratory\u20148/12 Organic chemistry with laboratory\u20148/12 Physics with laboratory\u20148/12 English equivalent to satisfy baccalaureate degree requirement Religion as required by the college attended REQUIRED Keyboard and computer skills RECOMMENDED Introductory course in basic statistics Biochemistry, strongly recommended Science credits earned in professional schools (e.g., allied health professions, business, dentistry, nursing, or pharmacy) do not fulfill requirements for admission to medicine. CLEP and Pass/Fail performances are not acceptable for the required courses. The Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) is required. Scores older than three years will not be considered. APPLICATION PROCEDURE AND ACCEPTANCE It is important to know the specifics of the application process and to begin the application process well in advance of the da te of anticipated (or desired) entrance to medical school. Where to write The School of Medicine is a member of the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Applications must be submitted through AMCAS. Their application is available on the web at <www.aamc.org/students/amcas/application.htm>. AMCAS deadline Application should be made directly to AMCAS between June 1 and November 1 for entry in August of the following year. Fees The AMCAS fee is required each time an application is submitted. An additional fee to the School of Medicine is required with each supplementary application. Procedure The application procedure is as follows: 1. The applicant submits a formal application to AMCAS, with fee and requested transcripts. The applicant's verified data are forwarded to the School of Medicine by AMCAS. 2. When the application is received from AMCAS, Loma Linda University School of Medicine requests completion of a supplementary application and reference forms. The prospective student should provide evidence of exposure to health care through personal involvement, or in other ways confirming the applicant's decision to become a physician. 3. After the supplementary application and letters of reference have been submitted and reviewed, the applicant may be invited for an interview. 4. The information submitted by the applicant through AMCAS, the supplementary application, the letters of reference, and the interview reports are then evaluated by the Admissions Committee of the School of Medicine. This committee determines whether an applicant is accepted or rejected. All applicants are notified of the final decision of the Admissions Committee regarding their application. Acceptance notices are sent to regular applicants beginning December of the year preceding admission to the School of Medicine, continuing until the class is filled. 5. The accepted applicant sends a written acceptance of his/her offer of admission as a student, together with a $100 acceptance deposit, by the announced date (about thirty days after the notification of acceptance). This deposit is refundable until May 15 of the year in which the student has been accepted for entry. 6. In summary, the Admissions Office requires the following: o Verified AMCAS application o Loma Linda University School of Medicine supplementary application and $75.00 application fee. o Appraisal of the applicant's character, ability, and suitability for a medical career by persons knowledgeable about the applicant's past performance. 320 UNIVERSITY CATALOG o A preprofessional recommendation packet, if available, from the applicant's undergraduate college/university. o Applicant's availability for interviews, should an offer for an interview be extended. Pre-entrance health requirement and health insurance Students must meet the immunization requirements as stated. In addition, students are expected to have routine dental and medical care and elective surgery attended to before registering for medical school. All School of Medicine students are provided with a health insurance policy through the University's Department of Risk Management. This policy remains in effect for students who are regularly enrolled, provided they register and pay tuition and fees on time each quarter. Since the maximum benefit of the policy (as of the time this CATALOG went to press) is $100,000 and does not cover preexisting illnesses or dental or optical care, students are encouraged to maintain a personal, current pol icy that covers preexisting illnesses and/or has a higher benefit. A student who does not have health insurance coverage for his/he r spouse/children will need to purchase it through the University's Department of Risk Management at the time of registration. Government regulations prohibit the use of student loan funds to provide medical insurance or services for a student's spouse o r children. Students who wish to review a copy of the current student health plan or have further questions about the plan should call Risk Management (909/558-4386). Annual tu ition also covers the cost of disability insurance. Details will be presented during orientation or upon request. EARLY-DECISION PROGRAM A highly qualified applicant to medical school may apply between June 1 and August 1 and be guaranteed a decision by October 1. During that period of time, the applicant may not apply to any other medical school; and if the applicant is accepted at Lom a Linda University, s/he is committed to that decision. If the applicant is not accepted by October 1, s/he may apply to any scho ol desired. An applicant not accepted by October 1 will be considered in the regular applicant pool. On the AMCAS application, the applicant indicates that s/he is an early-decision applicant and agrees to comply with the constraints of that program. DEADLINES June 1 to November 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission to the School of Medicine) is the period for submission of applications for the first-year class. August 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for submission of application under the Early-Decision Program. September 1 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for the submission of the supplementary application for the Early-Decision Program. November 15 (of the year preceding the year of admission) is the deadline for receipt of the supplementary application for the regular applicant pool. May 15 (of the year of admission) is the date beyond which the deposit of $100 is not refundable. TRANSFER Under exceptional circumstances, the school accepts applicants into the junior year who are transferring from other U.S. medica l schools. Such transfers must be for compe lling circumstances and are subject to availability of space and approval of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine Dean's Administrative Committee. The University reserves the right to require of an applicant satisfactory completion of written or practical examinations in an y course for which transfer credit is requested. Successful completion of USMLE Step I is required. LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TECHNICAL STANDARDS Loma Linda University School of Medicine candidates for the M.D. degree must have abilities and skills of five varieties including observation, communication, motor, intellectual (conceptual, integrative and quantitative), behavioral and social. Technological compensation can be made for some handicaps in certain areas but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner without the use of a surrogate. OBSERVATION: The candidate must be able to observe demonstrations and experiments in the basic sciences, including but not limited to physiologic and pharmacologic demonstrations in animals, microbiologic cultures, and microscopic studies of microorganisms and tissues in normal and pathologic states. A candidate must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of the senses of vision, touch, hearing and somatic sensation. It is enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. APPLICATION AND ADMISSIONS 321 COMMUNICATION: A candidate must be able to speak, to hear and to observe patients in order to elicit information, describe changes in mood, activity and posture, and perceive nonverbal communications. A candidate must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients, colleagues, and other personnel. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. The candidate must be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written form with all members of the health care team. MOTOR: Candidates should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. A candidate should be able to do basic laboratory tests (urinalysis, CBC, etc.), car ry out diagnostic procedures (proctoscopy, paracentesis, etc.) and read EKG's and X-Rays. A candidate should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to provide general care and emergency treatment of patients. Examples of emergency treatment reasonably required of physicians are cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the administration of intravenous medication, th e application of pressure to stop bleeding, the opening of obstructed airways, the suturing of simple wounds, and the performance of simple obstetrical maneuvers. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular movements, equilibrium and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. INTELLECTUAL-CONCEPTUAL INTEGRATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ABILITIES: These abilities include measurement, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. Problem solving, the critical skill demanded of physicians, requires all of the se intellectual abilities. In addition the candidate should be able to comprehend three dimensional relationships and to understan d the spatial relationships of structures.

Specific policies for handling misconduct (academic or nonacademic) are published in the Student Handbook 2006. COMMUNICATIONS Communications to the medical student regarding academic and clinical assignments, scholarship opportunities, and other important information are routed through the Office of the Dean. The student mailboxes and bulletin board are located in the Medical Center. It is the responsibility of students to check their email and mailboxes and the bulletin board daily. REQUIRED SUPPLIES Microscope The student is expected to have access to a satisfactory compound microscope (usually one rented from the school) that meets th e following requirements: The microscope shall be no older than fifteen years. The lenses shall be in good condition and shall include scanning and oil-immersion objectives. The equipment shall include an Abbe condenser with rack and pinion adjustment, an iris diaphragm, and a mechanical stage. Textbooks Students are required to purchase the textbooks adopted by the School of Medicine Curriculum Committee. Instruments Students are required to purchase the instruments adopted by the physical diagnosis course. PRACTICES AND REGULATIONS Length of academic residence To fulfill the degree requirement pertaining to length of academic residence, it is the usual policy that the student must be registered for full-time course work during the entire junior and senior academic years for the Doctor of Medicine degree. Course exemptions Students who seek exemption from registering for courses that they took prior to entering the School of Medicine must qualify for the exemption by passing a comprehensive examination covering the course material in question. Should the student qualify, in lieu of the regular course the student will be required to participate in an advanced program th at may include additional studies, research activities, and/or teaching. A written paper will be required from all students comple ting the advanced program. The course director, the senior associate dean of medical student education, and the student will work together to determine th e content of the advanced program. Full tuition, equivalent to that of the regular program, will be charged. Examinations Students must take examinations at the scheduled time. Students who arrive more than 15 minutes late to an examination\u2014or after another student has left during the examination for any reason\u2014will be denied the opportunity to take the examination. Should a student miss an examination because of an excused absence, the examination cannot be made up at a later time. Instead, the comprehensive final examination in the course for which the missed examination occurred will be weighted an extra amount, proportional to the weighting of the missed examination(s). In addition, course directors may require other remediation at thei r discretion. In order to have an excused absence, the student must obtain a written excuse from the Office of the Dean prior to the administration of the test in question. This written excuse must then be provided to the course director. Students missing examinations for health reasons must provide documentation from Student Health that they were indeed ill. Whether or not this documentation is an adequate excuse for missing an examination will be left to the discretion of the Office of the Dean. Students who miss examinations without prior approval from the Office of the Dean have an unexcused absence. As a result, the student will receive a zero for the missed examination(s). ACADEMIC INFORMATION 325 In the event of a bona fide emergency, where prior approval is not feasible, the Office of the Dean must be contacted as soon a s possible. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. Grading policy Course directors submit grades at the end of the course, indicating the overall evaluation of the student's performance in the course. The grade reflects the success or failure of the student in meeting the objectives of the course in terms of knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values. The grade will be recorded as SATISFACTORY if the student exceeded the minimum requirements for overall performance. The grade assigned will be UNSATISFACTORY if the student did not meet the minimum requirements for overall performance. The grade assigned will be MARGINAL SATISFACTORY if the student met but did not exceed the minimum requirements for overall performance. Complete promotion and retention policies are distributed to each class at orientation. Class standing Class standing is determined by the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education and is based on student performance on in-house, faculty-generated examinations and on NBME subject examinations. Promotion Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic performance. Both cognitive and noncognitive evaluations of academic performance\u2014as well as assessment of personal suitability to assume the responsibilities of the medical profession\u2014are utilized in making promotion decisions. The Academic Review Committee of the School of Medicine periodically reviews student performance and progress and recommends promotion, retention, or dismissal on the basis of the overall academic record. The Student Handbook contains additional details regarding the criteria used by the Academic Review Committee for promotion decisions. Academic probation Students whose cumulative academic record at the end of any academic year is less than satisfactory are placed on academic probation. Withdrawal To withdraw from a course(s), the student must file a Change of Program form; to completely withdraw from school, a Total Withdrawal form must be completed. These forms should be completed and submitted on the last day of class attendance. The date of withdrawal used in calculating tuition refunds will be the date on which the properly completed form is submitted to th e Office of University Records. USMLE Steps I and II policy States vary in the number of times a student can attempt USMLE examinations and still be eligible for licensure. A significant number of states allow no more than three attempts. The school has defined its own limits for number of attempts allowed. Our policy requires students enrolled in the Loma Linda University School of Medicine to pass Step I in no more than three attempts . Students must complete the clinical course work required for graduation within three years of starting the clinical curriculum; they are permitted a maximum of four sequential attempts to pass Step II of the USMLE. The student's first attempt at passing Step II of the USMLE must take place only after s/he has satisfactorily passed all junior clerkships and prior to his/her completion of all required senior clinical course work. A student who has failed Step II but who has completed all course curriculum requirements must remain enrolled in the School of Medicine as a directed-study student until s/he either has passed Step II of the USMLE or failed Step II of the USMLE for the fourth time. During this directed study, the student will be charged tu ition.

Taylor The basic sciences of the School of Medicine offer graduate programs with emphases in anatomy, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, and physiology. The Ph.D. degree curriculum is designed to prepare students for a career of independent research and teaching in an academic or biotechnology setting. Students may enter any of these five Ph.D. degree programs by applying to the Integrated Biomedical Graduate Studies Program. After completing a common first-year core curriculum, the student selects a program and a mentor for the completion of his or her studies, during which advanced courses and laboratory work allow the student to fully develop an area of research interest and expertise. Students usually rotate through up to three research laboratories before selecting a research adviser. The M.S. degree course of study provides education appropriate for technician s involved in biomedical research and for medical technologists seeking career advancement. A pathway to combined M.D./Ph.D. degrees is also offered. The School of Medicine's Division of Biochemistry offers programs leading to the Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Science degrees. These programs include a core curriculum that provides a broad background in biochemistry-related issues and approaches. Advanced courses allow each student to develop fully an area of interest. Research strengths of the department include: cancer biology, DNA damage and repair, measurement of thyroid hormones, coagulation, neurobiology, peptide structure, vaccine development and radiation biology. The program outcomes of the Biochemistry Program are as follows: 1. Students will demonstrate a broad knowledge of the biomedical sciences and subject mastery in molecular, cellular and integrative aspects of biochemistry. 2. Students will be able to interpret current literature in their discipline. 3. Students will be able to apply the scientific method. 4. Students will understand the need to practice scientific and professional ethics. 5. *Students will understand the process of applying for external funding. * This objective is not applicable to MS students 338 UNIVERSITY CATALOG M.S. and Ph.D. degrees The School of Medicine's Division of Biochemistry offers study in the Biochemistry Program leading to the Master of Science and the Doctor of Philosophy degrees. These degree programs provide a broad biochemical background while allowing the student to fully develop a special area of research interest. The Master of Science degree provides content appropriate for per sons preparing to teach at the secondary level or in related professional school areas, or for persons intending to pursue careers a s research technicians. The Doctor of Philosophy degree is designed to prepare the graduate for a career of independent research and teaching in university, clinical, biotechnological or government environments. Ph.D. students are expected to develop creativity and independence in addition to technical skills. Combined degrees Combined degree (Ph.D./M.D. and M.S./M.D.) options are also available. The combination of an M.S. degree with a professional degree provides additional content and research experience as a background for postgraduate medical or dental education. The combination of a Ph.D. degree with a professional degree prepares the student for a future in academic medicine or dentistry\u2014 combining research, teaching, and clinical practice.

SOWERS, Ph.D., Program Director Objectives Loma Linda University is committed to fostering the investigative skills of its medical students. Students interested in pursui ng careers in academic medicine and medical research may wish to enroll in one of the combined-degrees programs. The Medical Scientist Program is designed to develop a student's independence and competence as an investigative scientist and clinician. It provides students with a broad educational base for the practice of medicine and medically related research. The program is administered by the School of Medicine in cooperation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Program description The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and want to contribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined-degrees program through the graduate program. In the first year, students participate in a new and revised scientifically integrated program that includes biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy. While in the first year, students also rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty members. In the second year, students increase their involvement with individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete gradua te course requirements. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for graduate or medical class es. Students pursuing the combined degrees will also be involved with joint basic science and clinical meetings and conferences wit h the aim of understanding the interrelationships between laboratory-based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory success, as indicated by completion of a first-author manuscript, the student will continue on to the traditional first two years of the medical school curriculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonst rate laboratory success will be two to three years. Successful students who have acquired essential laboratory skills should continu e their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculu m. Upon successful completion of the first two years of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE examination, students will begin a series of rotations between the clinical sciences and the research laboratory. During these later years, students will complete all of the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects. It is the intent of this program that students will acquire the requisite skills needed for a successful career at the interface of laboratory-based and clinical res earch. Program admission Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitive and requires evidence that the student is likely to develop into a successful medical scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each of these programs. The application package for the Ph.D. degree program requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Both programs must accept the student scores before the student is admitted to the Medical Scientist Program. Students entering the M.D./Ph.D. combined-degrees program who determine that a research career is inappropriate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree program who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M.D./Ph.D. combined-degrees program at a point after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; however, the standard medical school application process will be required at that point. Financial assistance Financial assistance to students in the Medical Scientist Program may provide: 1. Cost of living stipends during those periods in which students are most directly involved in graduate education. The amount of the stipend is equivalent to that available to Ph.D. degree students in the basic science graduate programs.* 2. Tuition waivers for all graduate program course work. 3. Tuition deferment for the freshman and sophomore years of the M.D. degree curriculum. When a student completes an M.S. or Ph.D. degree, tuition deferred from the freshman and sophomore years is canceled. 4. Tuition waiver for both the junior and senior years of the M.D. curriculum, upon completion of a Ph.D. degree. M.D./Ph.D. students are ordinarily expected to complete their Ph.D. degree before beginning the third year of medical school. Students who have not completed the Ph.D. may apply for a tuition deferment for their junior year of the medical curriculum, and, in unusual cases, for the first quarter of their senior year. Applications for tuition deferment beyond the first two y ears must be approved by the student's dissertation committee and signed by the dissertation advisor, the Associate Dean for Basic Sciences, and the Dean of the School of Medicine. Under no circumstances will a student be granted a tuition deferment or be 342 UNIVERSITY CATALOG allowed to register for the last two quarters of medical school until they have finished the requirements for the PhD. If a st udent withdraws from the Ph.D. Program his/her tuition deferments will be converted to a loan. Completion of the M.D. degree terminates the student's participation in the Medical Scientist Program and ends the availability of tuition waiver. Any tuiti on deferments then in force will convert to loan obligations at that time. * Stipends from the School of Medicine will be awarded for the first two years of the graduate program, provided that the stude nt makes satisfactory academic process and remains in good and regular standing. Stipends covering study beyond the first two years should ordinarily be obtained from the individual laboratories or departments in which the student conducts research. MEDICINE\u2014SM 343 Medicine\u2014SM (M.D.) H. ROGER HADLEY, Dean, School of Medicine CURRICULUM The curriculum in medicine consists of four academic years. Instruction is on the quarter system. The first eight quarters are oriented to the sciences basic to the practice of medicine; the remaining two academic years are made up of clinically oriented core instruction and up to eighteen weeks of clinical electives. THE FIRST YEAR of medical education will begin to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine\u2014 with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of normal development, structure, and function, including the normal changes of aging and the behavioral considerations that influence normal development. Course content will be organized around individual organ systems whenever possible. The first year will also begin to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and profes sional behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical and Christian practice of medicine both now and in t he future. The educational program will make use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods, including but not limited to traditiona l lecture, small-group, problem-based and case-based learning, personalized computer-based instruction, quantitative laboratory experiences, and patient-care experiences. THE SECOND YEAR of medical education will continue to establish a foundation in the sciences basic to the practice of medicine\u2014with emphasis on the principles and mechanisms of abnormal structure and function, principles of therapy, and behavioral considerations that affect disease treatment and prevention. Course content will be organized according to individua l organ systems whenever possible. The second year will continue to develop the skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors that are integral to the safe, competent, compassionate, ethical, and Christian practice of medicine both now and in the future. The educational program will make use of a wide variety of pedagogical methods, including but not limited to trad itional lecture, small-group problem-based and case-based learning, personalized computer-based instruction, quantitative laboratory experiences, and longitudinal patient-care experiences. THE THIRD YEAR of medical education will establish a body of knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, and behaviors in six core clinical science disciplines to build a foundation for patient care in ambulatory and hospital-based se ttings. Students will attain this foundation through a process of self-directed learning, independent study, and guided supervision and teaching by house st aff and faculty. Students will have ample opportunity to learn the value of honor, shared responsibility, and accountabi lity by directly participating in patient-care activities as junior colleagues on the health care team. The didactic program will emphasize: a) understanding the pathophysiology of disease; b) establishing diagnoses through interpretation of physical examination and diagnostic data; and c) applying management principles to patients with acute and chronic conditions. Recurring experiences in whole-person care, medical ethics, laboratory medicine, health maintenance, and disease prevention will be integrated into the six core disciplines. Students will have the opportunity to explore an area of i nterest during an elective experience for the purpose of beginning the process of choosing a career in medicine. THE FOURTH YEAR of medical education will require students to integrate the entirety of their medical knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes gained during the first three years and apply it more autonomously to patient care. Students will partici pate in supervised patient-care experiences in neurology or family medicine, emergency medicine, intensive care medicine, and a sub- intern-level experience in medicine, surgery, or pediatrics. Although repetitive clinical duties during the fourth year are a necessary part of preparing students for the rigors of postgraduate training, students will still have ample opportunity to pur sue individual interests during a minimum 18 weeks of elective rotations. To reestablish the importance of science in medical practice, at least one month of elective may be in the basic science discipline of the student's choosing. Students will have adequate vacation time to study for Step II of the USMLE and successfully participate in the residency selection process. WHOLE-PERSON FORMATION Personal and professional growth for the student in medicine is the focus of the disciplines in the school, the faculty in the School of Medicine, and the School of Religion. Courses and content are offered to emphasize biblical, ethical, and relational aspects of the physician's personal and professional development. The core for whole-person formation\u201414 quarter units of religion and ethics\u2014is provided during the first three years of the medicine curriculum. 344 UNIVERSITY CATALOG CURRICULUM OUTLINE YEAR 1 First Quarter (Summer) Units ANAT 521 Gross Anatomy & Embryology (1) MNES 501 Orientation to Medicine (2) PHSL 515 Medical Physiology (1) MDCJ 566 Evidence-Based Medicine and Information Science (1) MDCJ 553 Cell Structure and Function (1) MDCJ 561 Physical Diagnosis and Interviewing (1) BCHM 521 Fundamentals of Human Biochemistry (1) MDCJ 543 Medical Neuroscience (1) REL Religion and Whole Person Care (2) Second Quarter (Fall) Units ANAT 522 Gross Anatomy & Embryology (5) PHSL 516 Medical Physiology (1) MDCJ 562 Physical Diagnosis and Interviewing (2) MDCJ 554 Cell Structure and Function (3) BCHM 521 Fundamentals of Human Biochemistry (3) MDCJ 567 Evidence-Based Medicine and Information Science (2) REL Religion and Whole Person Care (2) Third Quarter (Winter) Units ANAT 523 Gross Anatomy & Embryology (2) MDCJ 568 Evidence-Based Medicine and Information Science (1) MDCJ 563 Physical Diagnosis and Interviewing (3) MDCJ 555 Cell Structure and Function (2) PHSL 517 Medical Physiology (5) MDCJ 544 Medical Neuroscience (3) PSYT 521 Understanding Your Patient (2) REL Religion and Whole Person Care (2) Fourth Quarter (Spring) Units MNES 502 Orientation to Medicine (4) PSYT 522 Understanding Your Patient (1) MDCJ 556 Cell Structure and Function (1) ANAT 524 Gross Anatomy & Embryology (1) MDCJ 569 Evidence-Based Medicine and Information Science (1) PHSL 518 Medical Physiology (1) MEDICINE\u2014SM 345 MDCJ 564 Physical Diagnosis and Interviewing (1) MDCJ 544 Medical Neuroscience (1) REL Religion & Whole Person Care (2) YEAR 2 First Quarter (Summer) Units MICR 511 Medical Microbiology (1) PSYT 514 Psychopathology (1) PATH 514 Systemic Pathology (2) PHARM 511 Medical Pharmacology (1) Second Quarter (Fall) MICR 512 Medical Microbiology (2) MDCJ 524 Pathophysiology and Applied Physical Diagnosis (3) PSYT 514 Psychopathology (3) PATH 514 Systemic Pathology (2) PRVM 514 Clinical Preventive Medicine (1) MDCJ 571 Diseases of (3) PHARM 512 Medical Pharmacology (3) BCHM 531 Biochemical Basis of Human Disease (1) REL Religion and Whole Person Care (2) Third Quarter (Winter) Units MICR 513 Medical Microbiology (3) MDCJ 525 Pathophysiology and Applied Physical Diagnosis (5) PHARM 513 Medical Pharmacology (2) PATH 515 Systemic Pathology (6) PRVM 515 Clinical Preventive Medicine (1) BCHM 532 Biochemical Basis of Human Disease (1) REL Religion and Whole Person Care (2) Fourth Quarter (Spring) Units PRVM 516 Clinical Preventive Medicine (2) MICR 514 Medical Microbiology (1) MDCJ 526 Pathophysiology and Applied Physical Diagnosis (2) PATH 516 Systemic Pathology (4) PHARM 514 Medical Pharmacology (1) BCHM 533 Biochemical Basis of Disease (1) MDCJ 572 Diseases of Neuroscience (1) 346 UNIVERSITY CATALOG YEAR 3 Clinical clerkships (required) Surgery (12 weeks) Medicine (12 weeks) Pediatrics (8 weeks) Obstetrics/Gynecology (6 weeks) Family Medicine or Neurology (4 weeks) Psychiatry (6 weeks) Electives (2 weeks) YEAR 4 Clinical clerkships (required) Emergency Medicine (2 weeks) Preventive & Community Medicine (4 weeks) Family Medicine or Neurology (4 weeks) Electives (18 weeks) Subinternships: Internal Medicine or Surgery or Pediatrics or Family Medicine (4 weeks) Intensive Care Pediatrics or Internal Medicine or Surgery (2 weeks) CONJOINT COURSES FOR THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MDCJ 553, 554, 555, 556 Cell Structure and Function (1, 3, 2, 1) MDCJ 561, 562, 563, 564 Physical Diagnosis and Interviewing (1, 2, 3, 1) MDCJ 524, 525, 526 Pathophysiology and Applied Physical Diagnosis (3, 5, 2) MDCJ 543, 544 Medical Neuroscience (1, 3, 1) MDCJ 566, 567, 568, 569 Evidence-Based Medicine and Information Sciences (1, 2, 1, 1) MDCJ 571, 572 Diseases of Neuroscience (3, 1) MDCJ 599 Medicine Conjoint Directed Study (arranged) MDCJ 821 Preventive & Community Medicine (4) MDCJ 891 Whole-Person Care (3-6) Residency programs Loma Linda University Medical Center sponsors a variety of accredited residency programs.

In 1907, the first class to graduate included seven students\u2014five women and two men. In 1949, the School of Nursing became a college-based program granting the baccalaureate degree. The first master's degrees in nursing were granted in 1957. The Associate in Science degree program was begun as an integral part of the school in 1970. The School of Nursing received its fir st accreditation by the National League for Nursing (NLN) (61 Broadway, New York, NY 10006) in 1951. The most recent accreditations were by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (One Dupont Circle NW, Suite 530, Washington, DC 20036-1120) in 1999; and the California Board of Registered Nursing (1170 Durfee Avenue, Suite G, South El Monte, CA 91733) in 2003. Consumers are encouraged to contact CCNE with comments about the program. AGENCY MEMBERSHIP The School of Nursing holds agency membership and actively participates in the following major professional organizations: American Association of Colleges of Nursing, National League for Nursing, and Western Institute for Nursing. OUR MISSION 385 Our Mission The mission of the School of Nursing, in accord with the comprehensive mission of Loma Linda University, is the education of professional nurses who are dedicated to excellence in nursing science. Individuals from diverse ethnic, cultural, and racial backgrounds are encouraged to embrace opportunities for lifelong growth and satisfaction from a career committed to health care. Baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs contribute to the development of expert clinicians, educators, administrators, and researchers who benefit society by providing and improving delivery of whole-person care to clients\u2014individuals, families, groups, and communities. Committed to Christian service and distinctive Seventh-day Adventist ideals, the school seeks to reflect God's love through its teaching and healing ministry. LEARNING OUTCOMES\u2014UNDERGRADUATE DEPARTMENT The learning outcomes of the baccalaureate degree program are designed to prepare competent nurses who are committed to compassionate, Christian service. Upon completion of the baccalaureate degree, the nurse will be able to: 1. Respect the universality of humanity and the uniqueness of physiological, psychological, spiritual, sociocultural, developmental perspectives; and recognize the individual's right to self-determination. 2. Demonstrate professional competence, technical skills, and the appropriate functioning in roles essential for promotion of optimal wellness for self and clients. 3. Contribute to society by demonstrating continued growth in personal and professional competence and Christ-centered values. 4.

PHILOSOPHY 387 Philosophy In harmony with Loma Linda University and the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the School of Nursing believes that the aim of education and health care is the development of wholeness in those served. Individuals, created to reflect the wholeness of God 's character, have been impaired by the entrance of sin, disease, and death. God's purpose is the restoration of each person to th e original state at Creation. God works through human agencies to facilitate individual wholeness. Nursing functions to assist individuals and societal groups to attain their highest potential of wholeness. Through a variety o f roles, nurses put into practice a body of knowledge and a repertoire of skills to assist the human system with health problems. The School of Nursing provides an environment in which students and faculty can grow in professional competence and Christian grace. In support of the philosophy, mission, and values of Loma Linda University and the philosophy, mission, and values of the School of Nursing, the faculty affirms the following beliefs: Learning is an interactive process that involves all of the learner's faculties. A learning environment nurtures the development of potential, promotes maturation of values, cultivates the ability to think critically and independently, and encourages a spirit of inquiry. Clinical experiences are essential to the development of professional and technical nursing competence. Students\u2014influenced by the effect of physiological, psychological, sociocultural, developmental, and spiritual variables on their lives\u2014learn in different ways and bring different meanings to the learning experience. Students participate in development of the science and practice of nursing. 388 UNIVERSITY CATALOG General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation.

STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS The following student organizations enable the student to participate in cultural, social, professional, and citizenship aspect s of university life. Associated Students of Nursing (ASN) The ASN is a student organization that is sanctioned by the School of Nursing. This association is comprised of all the student s of nursing and is administered by elected students and two faculty sponsors. The objectives of this organization are to serve a s a channel for communication between students and faculty, and to facilitate personal and professional growth by meaningful participation in all aspects of student life. Loma Linda University Student Association (LLUSA) The LLUSA has three purposes: to promote communication among students, to present students' views to the administration, and to assist in the programming of social and religious activities. The LLUSA provides opportunities to develop and refine a wide range of professional leadership and fellowship skills. The office is located in the Drayson Center. For more information, call 909/558-4978. Class organizations The members of each year-level organize in the baccalaureate program, elect officers, and promote such projects and activities as constitute their major interests and concerns. HONOR SOCIETY: SIGMA THETA TAU INTERNATIONAL In 1975, LLUSN became an official chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International\u2014the honor society for nursing. Students, faculty of the School of Nursing, and other community nurses--upon meeting the established criteria--may, by invitation, become members of the Gamma Alpha Chapter of Sigma Theta Tau International. 394 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Academic Policies and Practices BACCALAUREATE DEGREE PROGRAM Academic residence To qualify for an Associate in Science degree from Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 24 units while in residence at the University; to qualify for a Bachelor of Science degree from Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 32 of the last 48 units\u2014or a minimum of 45 total units\u2014while in residence. A minimum of three clinical nursing courses is required as part of these units. Percentage breakdown for grading The undergraduate division of the School of Nursing uses the following percentages for computing grades: 95-100% A D Below 62% F NURSING COURSES Nursing course grades Most nursing courses in the undergraduate curriculum are divided into approximately equal components of theory and clinical laboratory practice. A grade for a nursing course represents a combination of the theory and the clinical laboratory grades. In order to pass a nursing course, a student must receive a grade equivalent to a C or above in both the theory and clinical labor atory sections of the course. To receive a passing grade in theory the student must obtain a cumulative score of at least 76 percent on examinations within that course. A grade of C- or below places the student on provisional status and requires that the student repeat the course. Clinical laboratory Laboratory assignment is under the direction of the instructor. In this assignment the student has supervised experience in the care of patients. Tardiness or unexcused absences from clinical laboratory is cause for failure. Students must make up for absences due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., personal illness or death in the family). A fee of $50 will be charged for mak e- up of clinical laboratory during nonclinical time. Nursing students are required to practice in client-care settings under the supervision of a registered nurse. Each student wil l be expected to be able to apply basic theoretical concepts to clinical practice by assessing; planning; implementing nursing procedures; and evaluating the care of individuals, families, and communities. In the performance of routine nursing care, all students will function within the policies of the clinical agency and demonstrate the professional behavior outlined in the University CATALOG and the University Student Handbook . Students are expected to be knowledgeable about clients and their problems and about the plans for care prior to actually givin g care. They must come prepared for the clinical experience and must adequately assess a client, using the Neuman-Systems Model. Students are expected to perform skills safely. Students whose performance is deemed unsafe may be dropped from the clinical course. Licensure To be eligible to write the NCLEX-RN examination, the student must have completed all required nursing course work listed in this CATALOG. Further, the student needs to be aware that, under the laws of California, a candidate for the examination is required to report all misdemeanor and felony convictions. If a candidate has a criminal history, the California Board of Registered Nursing will determine the eligibility of that individual to write the licensing examination. ACADEMIC POLICIES AND PRACTICES 395 CREDIT BY EXAMINATION Challenge/Equivalency examination An undergraduate student may meet academic requirements by passing an examination at least equal in scope and difficulty to examinations in the course. Undergraduate students with prior education in nursing or in another health care profession are eligible to challenge nursing courses required for California state licensure. The applicant's background in health care theory and clinical experience must be commensurate with the theory and skills required for the course. Challenge examinations in nursing courses include both a written examination covering theory and an examination of clinical competence. A fee is charged for a challenge examination. See the \"Schedule of Charges\" in this section for fees. Progression to the next level in the program is permissible only after successful completion of the challenge examination. A grade of S is recorded for challenge credit earned by examination only after the student has successfully completed a minimum o f 12 units of credit at this University with a G.P.A. of 2.0 or above. Advanced Placement Credit toward graduation may be accepted by the school for an entering student who has passed one or more examinations of the Advanced Placement (AP) with a score of 3, 4, or 5. Records for AP courses must be sent directly from the Advanced Placement to University Records. For specific policy and time limits regarding CLEP examinations, see \"Academic Policies\" section. ACADEMIC PROGRESSION Progression is contingent on satisfactory scholastic and clinical performance and the student's responsiveness to the establish ed aims of the school and the nursing profession. Students are considered to be making satisfactory progress as long as they maintain a C average (2.0 G.P.A.) and complete the total number of units required per year: YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL 1st 29 2nd 48 3rd 96 4th 144 5th 193 UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS Withdrawing from a course A nursing student may withdraw only once from a nursing or named cognate course. A student may withdraw (W), failing, from no more than two quarters. Repeating a course A grade of C (2.0) is the minimum passing grade for nursing and required cognate courses. Required cognates include: developmental psychology, epidemiology, ethics, nutrition, statistics, and writing. Any nursing or named cognate course taken while a student at Loma Linda University School of Nursing in which the earned grade is C- or lower must be repeated before the student can progress to another course. A nursing course or required cognate may be repeated only once. When a student repeats a course, both the original and repeat grades are entered on the student's permanent record; but only the repeat grade and cred it are computed in the grade-point average and included in the total units earned. Probation status Students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than 2.0, or who have received a C- or below in a nursing course or named cognate, or who have withdrawn (\"W\") due to failing are placed on academic probation. Students on probation status will be required to take NRSG 244 Skills for Academic Success, under the supervision of the Learning Assistance Program (LAP) and to communicate regularly with the academic adviser. Students on probation status may take only one clinical nursing course at a time and no more than 12 units. When the course work has been repeated successfully, the student is returned to regular status. Enrollment in the School of Nursing will be terminated if a student receives two grades of C- or below in nursi ng or required cognates. See Student Handbook for Grievance Procedure.

Permission for the conferral of a degree in absentia is granted by the University upon recommendation of the dean of the school. A student who completes the requirements for a degree at the end of the Summer, Autumn, or Winter Quarter is invited, but not required, to participate in the subsequent conferring of degrees. Degrees are conferred at graduations only. The University reserves the right to prohibit participation in commencement exercises by a candidate who has not satisfactorily complied with all requirements. GRADUATE DEPARTMENT\u2014POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Academic residence To qualify for a degree from the graduate department in nursing at Loma Linda University, the student must take a minimum of 80 percent of the academic curriculum while in residence at the University. For the master's degree, this would be 42-58 units, depending on the selected concentration area. For the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this would be 66 units. Transfer credits A transfer student who has done acceptable graduate study in an approved ins titution may transfer credits up to one-fifth of the units required by the chosen program, to be applied to the degree at Loma Linda University. Such transfer credits will not be u sed to offset work at this University that is less than a B average. This transfer is limited to credits that have not already been applied to a degree and for which a grade of B (3.0) or better has been recorded. A maximum of 9 quarter units that have been previousl y applied to another degree may be accepted as transfer credits upon petition. Nondegree student credit A maximum of 12 units may be taken by permission of the instructors prior to acceptance into the program. If these courses are part of the curricular plan for the selected concentration area, and if the grade earned is B or higher, the credits may be app lied toward that degree. Academic standing The expected earned grade for graduate studies is B or higher, and a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 or higher. Students must have at least a B (85 percent) in all the clinical focus courses, including Advanced Physical Assessment. If less than a B is the earned grade, the course must be repeated. Any core or concentration course in which the earned grade is C-or lower must be repeated. Students whose overall grade-point average falls below a 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. Should the G.P.A. continue to be less than 3.0, the student will be dismissed from the program. Students who have a grade-point average of less than 3.0 (cumulative or in the nursing major) may not take the clinical focus courses or the comprehensive examination. Clinical probation Clinical work must be evaluated as satisfactory. Faculty may recommend that the student be placed on clinical probation. While on probation, the student must demonstrate satisfactory clinical work as stipulated by the faculty; or s/he will be dismissed f rom the school. Application for candidacy A student in the master's degree program will apply for candidacy on Form A after completing at least 25 units of required graduate course work. A doctoral student will be advanced to candidacy after successful defense of the dissertation proposal. ACADEMIC POLICIES AND PRACTICES 397 Time limits The time lapse from first enrollment in a graduate curriculum to the conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five year s. For the doctoral degree, seven years are allowed after the date of admission; however, students enrolled in an approved combined-degrees program may be permitted nine years. A student desiring reinstatement must reapply to the dean. This procedure implies a re-evaluation of the student's total academic plan. Any credit transferred to the school or taken in residence and submitted toward a master's degree is nullified seven years from the date when the course was completed. Similarly, credit submitted toward a doctoral degree is nullified eight years from the date when the course was completed. Statistics and research prerequisites Introduction to statistics and research courses are a prerequisite to entry. The courses STAT 414, 415, 509\u2014as well as NRSG 429, described in the University CATALOG\u2014fulfill the prerequisite requirement. SCHOLASTIC STANDING Grade Scale The graduate department in nursing uses the following percentages for determining grades: 95-100% A F PRACTICUM EXPERIENCES Practicum experiences shall be individually structured to meet students' needs and program requirements. Practicum experiences are arranged by practicum faculty after consultation with advisers and appropriate agency personnel. Off-campus placement is formalized through written contract or letter of agreement. This process may take as long as six months. Students requesting practicum experiences at sites that will require additional costs\u2014such as faculty travel, phone calls, or legal advice\u2014are responsible for this expense. COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION A written comprehensive examination is required of all students. The student is expected to integrate, evaluate, and apply theories and concepts covered in graduate study. The examination must be taken after a substantial portion of the clinical work is completed and before enrolling for the last 8 units of the program. THESIS AND DISSERTATION The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approval mus t be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Thesis is optional for the M.S. degree. Handbook Instructions for the preparation and format of the thesis or dissertation are in the \"Thesis and Dissertation Format Guide,\" available at the Faculty of Graduate Studies Office. Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies office can help the stu dent avoid formatting errors that would require him/her to edit large sections of manuscript. The last day for submitting the final approved copy is determined by the Faculty of Graduate Studies office. (See FGS policies.) Binding A fee will be assessed to cover the cost of binding copies of the thesis or dissertation to be deposited in the University libr ary and in the appropriate department or school collection. This same fee will also apply to personal copies bound at the student's req uest. 398 UNIVERSITY CATALOG GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS A candidate for a degree shall have: 1.

Zumwalt NURSING\u2014SN 403 UNDERGRADUATE DEPARTMENT Undergraduate curricula The sections that follow describe the undergraduate curricula offered by the School of Nursing (Bachelor of Science degree and the Associate in Science degree option) and list the courses each student must complete. Students are expected to operate under the general policies of the University and school and the specific policies of the degree program in which they are enrolled. T he school reserves the right to update and modify the curriculum to keep current with trends in health care. B.S. degree / A.S. degree option The primary aim of the School of Nursing baccalaureate nursing program is to prepare competent practitioners who are committed to excellence in practice and to Christian principles. The faculty believe that baccalaureate education in nursing is the basis for professional practice. However, in response to both societal and students' needs, an Associate in Science (A.S.) degr ee option is provided for students after they have completed all nursing and general education content necessary to prepare for licensure as registered nurses in California. The basic professional curriculum leading to a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in nursing is consistent with the faculty belief that students should be broadly educated. The focus is on the synthesis of nursing knowledge and skills with knowledge and skills from the humanities and sciences. Preparation for practice includes experiences in primary, secondary, and tertiary heal th care with clients from various age and cultural groups and socioeconomic strata. The curriculum is based on the Neuman Systems Model, which addresses stressors to the client system. Undergraduate curriculum sequence The undergraduate curriculum begins with four quarters of preclinical work, which forms the general education and science base for nursing. These quarters may be completed at any accredited college or university. Following six quarters of clinical instruction, additional general education, and cognate courses at Loma Linda University School of Nursing, the student is eligi ble to receive the A.S. degree and is prepared to write the state board examination. After completion of another two quarters, the student is eligible to receive the B.S. degree and is prepared for professional nursing practice at the baccalaureate level. Th e clinical experience develops the student's technical and theoretical capabilities in a progressive manner and within the contex t of the nursing process: assessment, analysis, planning, implementing, evaluating. Most of the baccalaureate nursing major is in th e upper division, where clinical experience is gained in a broad variety of settings. Integral components of upper-division cours es are leadership concepts and skills, research, health promotion, and activities that foster collaboration in planning health car e with the family and all members of the health care team. UNDERGRADUATE COURSES Nursing course credits are offered in quarter units under the following formula: 1. One hour of instruction in theory each week throughout a quarter equals one quarter unit. 2. Three hours of clinical practice each week throughout a quarter equals one quarter unit. PRECOURSE PREPARATION FOR NURSING (OPTIONAL) These courses\u2014required for students in the PRN Program\u2014prepare disadvantaged students to be successful in regular baccalaureate nursing classes. These courses do not count toward the nursing major.

Fundamental core values of compassion, integrity, freedom, excellence, justice, purity, and humility are expected of each student attending the School of Pharmacy. Integrity is important in upholding the standards of professional and personal conduct and is consistent with the oat h that is taken upon graduation. It includes being accountable for one's own conduct as well as assuming responsibility for the professional behavior of one's colleagues within the profession. Professionalism involves treating others with courtesy and respect. It is expected that all School of Pharmacy students will exhibit conduct in which respect is shown to others at all ti mes. CODE OF CONDUCT In harmony with the goals of Loma Linda University, students are expected to demonstrate a pattern of personal discipline with lifestyle expectations that are consistent with those of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Joining the Loma Linda University family is an honor and requires each individual to uphold the policies, regulations, and guidelines established for all members of the University team. The following are expected of each member of the Loma Linda University family: To respect themselves. To respect the dignity, feelings, worth, and values of others. To respect the rights and property of others and to discourage vandalism and theft. To prohibit discrimination, while striving to learn from differences in people, ideas, and opinions. To practice personal, professional, and academic integrity, and to discourage all forms of dishonesty, plagiarism, deceit, and disloyalty to the code of conduct. To foster a personal, professional work ethic within the Loma Linda University family. To foster an open, fair, and caring environment. To be fully responsible for upholding the Loma Linda University code. Specific policies are outlined in greater detail in the University Student Handbook . CPR AND FIRST AID CERTIFICATION All students must be currently certified in Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and First Aid during their enrollment in the School of Pharmacy. School policy requires that students must successfully complete the CPR and First Aid Provider training at the LLU Life Support Education Center. This certification ensures consistency in the education and training which is necessary to fulfill School obligations to our preceptors and sites per affiliation agreements. All PY1 students are scheduled for CPR and F irst Aid certification courses during orientation. PY3 students must renew their CPR and First Aid at the start of the PY3 Fall Quar ter and all PY3 students must participate in the recertification class scheduled at the Life Support Education Center by the Office of Student Affairs. Attendance is mandatory for all students even if they have had prior CPR and First Aid Training Classes at oth er facilities. The School of Pharmacy will pay for both initial and renewal courses for all students. CLASS ATTENDANCE Student attendance in classes is considered to be the cornerstone of professional behavior and is expected in all classes. Instructors may require attendance in class as a condition of passing a course or as part of the grade a student earns. CHAPEL In keeping with the commitment of the mission of the University, all School of Pharmacy students are required to attend a weekl y chapel service. The chapel service is a core component of the wholeness curriculum at Loma Linda University. By setting aside time each week for a chapel program, the University seeks to emphasize the value it places on spiritual development, corporate worship, and community. This also reaffirms the University's commitment to the ideals upon which it was founded. Chapel services provide opportunities for members of the University community to benefit from programming that integrates faith and learning. Regular attendance is required at the weekly chapel services, as well as the daily services during the quarterly Week of Devotion. Students are expected to fulfill this requirement as they would any other component of the curriculum. PHARMACY FORUM Pharmacy forum is a scheduled time where professors and students come together to discuss pertinent issues and address professional topics that enhance the student's academic and professional experience. This is considered part of the pharmacy GENERAL EXPECTATIONS AND ACADEMIC POLICIES 439 curriculum, and each quarter students receive a Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory grade for forum. Attendance is required and is a component of the forum grade. STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS Professional Development Participation in the Professional Development sequence each academic quarter is part of the curriculum for the School of Pharmacy. The purpose of Professional Development is to encourage student participation that develops leadership skills in student organizations, the School of Pharmacy, and University activities. Students are expected to actively participate in a minimum of one student organization or leadership position each term. Professional organizations Involvement in professional organizations is an integral part of the educational and professional process within the School of Pharmacy. Active involvement and networking with local and state leaders within the professional organizations enhances the overall educational experience and provides opportunities for career development. Active participation in a variety of professional societies is expected of all students. Recognized student organizations/Student pharmacists association American Pharmacists Association (APhA-ASP) California Pharmacists Association (CPhA) California Society of Health Systems Pharmacists (CSHP) American Society of Health System Pharmacists (ASHP) Student National Pharmacists Association (SNPhA) Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) National Community Pharmacist Association (NCPA) Christian Pharmacist Fellowship International (CPFI) Tri Health Fellowship Organization membership by invitation The School of Pharmacy endorses three organizations in which student membership is by invitation only. Membership in these organizations is seen as prestigious and indicative of superior academic achievement and leadership. California Pharmacy Student Leadership (CAPSLEAD) Rho Chi Pharmaceutical Honor Society (RX) Phi Lambda Sigma National Pharmacy Leadership Society (PLS) Class leadership Each class elects leaders to serve as student representatives to administration and to guide the class in addressing student-re lated issues. The Office of Student Affairs works closely with class leaders\u2014assisting with class issues, helping to plan events, and facilitating a strong communication link to and from students. Each class also elects a full-time faculty member to serve as cl ass adviser. The adviser's function is to serve as mentor, keep abreast of class issues, and maintain an open communication link wi th the director of the Office of Student Affairs. ACADEMIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Curriculum Outcome Objectives The Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy student learning outcomes are to: Perform the functions necessary to provide patient-centered care. Perform the functions necessary to provide population-based care. Perform safe medication distribution and handling. Provide public health services. Apply the LLU philosophy of wholeness in their personal and professional lives. Apply core biomedical knowledge to patient-centered care. Student progression The curriculum is designed to be followed in a stepwise, block manner. All prerequisites must be completed before a student can enroll in a course. Students must pass all of the professional courses in each year before enrolling in courses in the next yea r. In addition, each student must pass the end-of-year comprehensive assessment examination. The academic standing of each student 440 UNIVERSITY CATALOG is reviewed quarterly by the Office of Academic Affairs. Students who fail to meet the minimum standards will be notified, in writing, by the Office of Academic Affairs. A minimum grade of C- is required to pass all pharmacy courses and electives. A student's progression will stop following a course failure, and s/he will be placed on leave-of-absence status for two academic quarters (not including summer). The studen t is responsible for completing and filing with the Office of University Records the appropriate paperwork. Failure to do so may result in administrative dismissal. A student will have a maximum of six (6) calendar years from the initial date of matriculation to complete the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. End-of-year assessment examinations One of the requirements for progressing from one professional year to the next is passing a comprehensive, year-end, qualifying examination. These examinations are prepared by curricular year-specific teams of faculty members. The results of the end-of- year assessment examination will be communicated by the PY1, PY2, PY3 curricular year team chair to the Office of Academic Affairs for communication to individual students. Failure to pass these examinations will delay progression and enrollment in t he subsequent year. Students who fail the end-of-year-assessment examination on the first attempt will retake a different, but similar in difficulty, examination as scheduled by the Assessment Committee. Students who fail the second attempt (first retake) must complete an oral examination (second re-take) administered per the Assessment Committee's requirements. The oral examination will be conducted by the curricular year specific team of faculty members. The oral examination will focus on establishing a student's competency in the subject matter for the PY1, PY2, PY3 curricular year as appropriate to the specific students. The results will be communicated in writing to the Assistant Dean for Academic Affairs. Students who fail the third attempt (the oral exam) will not progress to the next professional year. GRADING SYSTEM Grade and Grade Points The following grades and grade points are used in the School of Pharmacy. All courses taught are approved for letter grades onl y. The exceptions are forum and professional development, which will be graded on a \"satisfactory/unsatisfactory\" basis. The grades and corresponding grade-point scales are: 93-100 A 4.0 Outstanding performance 90-92 A- 87-89 B+ 3.3 83-86 B 3.0 Satisfactory performance 80-82 B- 2.7 77-79 C+ 2.3 73-76 C 2.0 70-72 1.7 Marginal 67-69 D+ 1.3 Unsatisfactory performance 60-66 D 1.0 <60 F 0.0 S 0.0 Satisfactory performance in Pharmacy Forum or Professional Development. U 0.0 Unsatisfactory performance in Pharmacy Forum or Professional Development. Incomplete grade The notation \"I\" (incomplete) in a course is given only for circumstances beyond a student's control. It will not be granted as a remedy for course overload, failure on a final examination, absence from a final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. In order to receive an incomplete, the student must initiate a request to receive a grade of \"I\" by completing a \"Petition to Receive Incomplete Grade\" form, and state the reason for the request. If this request is approved, the instructor will report a n \"I\" as well as the grade the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the prescribed time limit. An \"I\" notation must be changed to an earned letter grade before the end of the following term (excluding a summer sessions). Failure to complete course requirements will cause the incomplete work to be counted as a zero and factored in with the existin g grade to calculate the final grade for the course. GENERAL EXPECTATIONS AND ACADEMIC POLICIES 441 Grade changes A grade may not be changed except when an error has been made in computing or recording a grade. Such changes may be processed only up to the end of the following term. In order to satisfactorily complete a course for which a grade of less than C- has been earned, the student must repeat the cou rse. This includes attending lecture and/or laboratory sessions as required, completing the assigned work, and taking any required examinations. Both the original and repeat course grades are entered on the permanent transcript record, but only the second (repeat) course grade is used to compute the grade-point average (G.P.A.). A course may be repeated only once. Grade appeals Every student has a right to receive a grade assigned upon a fair and unprejudiced evaluation based on a method that is neither arbitrary nor capricious. Furthermore instructors have the right to assign a grade based on any method that is professionally acceptable, submitted to all students in the course syllabus, and applied equally. Instructors have the responsibi lity to provide careful evaluation and timely assignment of appropriate grades. Course and project grading methods should be explained to students at the beginning of the term. Academic integrity assumes that the judgment of the instructor of record is authoritative, and the final grades assigned are correct. A grade appeal is confined to charges of unfair action toward an individual student and may not involve a challenge of an instructor's grading standard. A student has a right to expect thoughtful and clearly defined approaches to grading, but it mus t be recognized that varied standards and individual approaches to grading are valid. The grade appeal considers whether a grade was determined in a fair and appropriate manner; it does not attempt to grade or re-grade individual assignments or projects. It is incumbent on the student to substantiate the claim that his or her final grade represents unfair treatment. Only the final grad e in a course may be appealed. In the absence of compelling reasons, such as clerical error, prejudice, or arbitrariness, the grade assigned by the instructor of record is to be considered final. In a grade appeal, only arbitrariness, prejudice, and/or error will be considered as legitimate grounds for an appeal. Arbitrariness: The grade awarded represents such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the instructor did not actually exercise professional judgment. Prejudice: The grade awarded was motivated by ill will, and is not indicative of the student's academic performance. Error: The instructor made a mistake in fact. The grade appeal procedure applies only when a student initiates a grade appeal and not when the instructor decides to change a grade on his or her own initiative. This procedure does not cover instances where students have been assigned grades based on academic dishonesty or academic misconduct. Also excluded from this procedure are grade appeals alleging discrimination, harassment or retaliation in violation of Loma Linda University's Sexual Harassment Policy. The Grade Appeal Procedure strives to resolve a disagreement between student and instructor concerning the assignment of a grade in a collegial manner. The intent is to provide a mechanism for the informal discussion of differences of opinion, and fo r the formal adjudication by a Grade Appeal Panel only when necessary. In all instances, students who believe that an appropriate grade has not been assigned must first seek to resolve the matter informally with the instructor of record. If the matter canno t be resolved informally, the student must proceed with a grade appeal in the procedure outlined below. The grade appeal process must be started within 10 working days after the end of the academic quarter in which the disputed grade is received. STUDENT GRADE APPEAL PROCESS Step 1. A student who wishes to question a grade must discuss the matter first with the instructor within 10 working days after the end of the academic quarter in which the disputed grade is received. In most cases, the discussion between the student and the instructor should suffice and the matter will not need to be carried further. The student should be aware that the only valid b asis for grade appeal beyond Step 1 is to establish that an instructor assigned a grade that was arbitrary, prejudiced, or in error. Step 2. If the student's concerns remain unresolved Step 1, the student may submit a written request to meet with the appropria te Department Chair, within 5 working days of speaking with the instructor. In situations where the instructor of record is a Department Chair or Associate Dean, then the Dean will serve as the appropriate Department Head in this step. The appropriate Department Chair will meet within 5 working days with the student, and, if the Department Chair believes that the complaint may have merit, s/he will meet with the instructor. After consultation with the Department Chair, the instructor may choose to let the grade remain, or to change a course grade. The Department Head will communicate the result to the student and instructor. Step 3. If the matter remains unresolved after Step 2, the student should submit a written request that includes all supporting documents within 5 working days to the Dean. The Dean will appoint a Grade Appeal Panel to review the request. The Panel may require any or all individuals associated with the appeal to appear. The Panel is charged to determine whether the grade was assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, or whether clear and convincing evidence of unfair treatment such as arbitrariness, prejudice, and/or error might justify changing the grade. The Panel will make its decisions based on a majority vote. If the Pa nel 442 UNIVERSITY CATALOG concludes that the grade was assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, it will report its conclusion in writing to the student and instructor, and the matter will be considered closed. If the Panel determines that compelling reasons exist for changing the gr ade, it would request that the instructor make the change, providing the instructor with a written explanation of its reasons. Shoul d the instructor decline, s/he must provide a written explanation for refusing. If the Panel after considering the instructor's expla nation and upon again concluding that it would be unjust to allow the original grade to stand, will then determine what grade is to be assigned. The new grade may be higher than, the same as, or lower than the original grade. Having made this determination, each Panel member will sign the grade change form and transmit it to the Office of University Records. The instructor and student wi ll be advised of the new grade. Under no circumstances may persons other than the original faculty member or Panel change a grade. Should the Panel conclude that the instructor's written explanation justifies the original grade, the Panel will report this in writing to the student and instructor and the matter will be closed. DEAN'S LIST AND HONOR ROLL The Office of Academic Affairs compiles a list of students who have demonstrated their academic excellence by achieving an outstanding grade point average each quarter. A student who earns a 3.30-3.69 grade point average, with no incomplete grades, during a term is given Honor Roll standing. A student who earns a 3.70 or better grade point average, with no incomplete grades, is given Dean's List standing. HONORS AND AWARDS The School of Pharmacy awards excellence in scholastic attainment and leadership abilities. Awards are available to students whose performance and attitudes reflect the mission and goals of Loma Linda University and the School of Pharmacy. Selection of award recipients is a function of the Honors and Awards Committee. The annual honors and awards event is scheduled during the Spring Quarter. PERFORMANCE LEVELS Good academic standing To remain in good academic standing, pharmacy students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade-point average of 2.30. Failure to maintain good academic standing will result in action by the Office of Academic Affairs. In add ition to the cumulative G.P.A., a grade of at least a C- must be earned in any course for which credit is to be applied towards completion of the requirements of the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Academic warning Please refer to the Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy Student Policies and Procedures Manual . ACADEMIC PROBATION Each student's academic status will be reviewed at the end of every academic quarter, including cumulative G.P.A. as reported by the Office of University Records. A student with a cumulative G.P.A. of less than 2.30 will be placed on academic probation and will receive a letter from the Office of Academic Affairs. This written notice of academic probation will also include a no tice that failure to reach the required G.P.A. by the end of the next two successive academic terms will result in the student being dismissed from the school. Academic probation will also result when a student receives less than a C- in any advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) during the PY4 year. Each student on academic probation is required to meet with her/faculty adviser by the end of the second week of the probationary term to develop and agree to, in writing, an academic improvement plan (AIP). The AIP may include mandatory study/advising sessions, mandatory class attendance, and/or other stipulations aimed at encouraging and supporting student academic success. A copy of a student's AIP will be maintained in his/her advising folder, and a copy of the AIP will also be forwarded to the Office of Academic Affairs. The faculty adviser is expected to inform the Office of Academic Affairs of the student's compliance with this policy and his/her academic progress. Failure by the student to seek appropriate assistance from his/her faculty adviser will not be accepted as a valid reason to stop the imposition of the appropriate academic probationary or other status. Academic probation status will remain in effect for the two consecutive academic quarters. Upon completion of each academic quarter, a student on academic probation will receive in writing, from the Office of Academic Affairs, a notice of his/her curr ent standing. It is expected that students on probation make progress toward good academic standing at the conclusion of each academic quarter. At the conclusion of the second consecutive academic quarter, the student must have achieved good academic standing. Failure to do so will result in dismissal. Academic probation will be lifted when the student's cumulative G.P.A. rises above 2.30, or when the student successfully completes the type of APPE course previously failed. There is no appeal process associated with academic probation. GENERAL EXPECTATIONS AND ACADEMIC POLICIES 443 ACADEMIC DISMISSAL Since courses may not be attempted more than twice (i.e., a course may be repeated only once)\u2014including APPEs\u2014grades of D+, D, D-, F, and W are considered to be attempts to complete degree program courses. Failure to complete any course in the program within these limits will result in dismissal from the program. A dismissed student will receive written notification from the dean of the School of Pharmacy. The notice will include procedures for appeal; and notice of loss of registration, financial aid, housing, etc. It is the student's responsibility to arrange with the Office of University Records for formal withdrawal within one week of receiving the written notification. Dismissed students are required to turn in any school or University ID badges and vacate University residence halls. The school will also notify the California State Board of Pharmacy for termination of the student's intern pharmacist license. READMISSION OF DISMISSED STUDENTS A dismissed student may reapply and be considered for readmission. To be considered for readmission, the student must petition (in writing) the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee. Petitions are due in the dean's office by the designated date (following each term), as published and sent to each dismissed student. After review of the written appeal, the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee may uphold the dismissal or may recommend the student for re-admission with or without conditions/stipulations. The Admissions Committee reviews each case separately and reserves the right to determine the provisions/conditions for each individual situation. A student who has been dismissed twice is not eligible for readmission to the same degree program for a period of twelve months, or until s/he demonstrates the ability to succeed through course work taken at another institution. Following this twel ve- month period, a student may apply for readmission by following the above procedures. The dismissal decisions made by the Academic Standing and Professionalism Committee may be appealed. All appeals must be in writing and submitted to the dean of the School of Pharmacy by the established/stated deadline. A student who questions whether the School of Pharmacy has followed prescribed process with regard to his/her grievance may request the Office of the Chancellor to conduct a review. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM It is the student's responsibility to begin the withdrawal process from a course or the curriculum in a timely manner. It is important for the student to seek counseling or guidance from his/her faculty adviser or other administrative persons regarding a situation that may negatively impact upon academic performance. Failure to seek appropriate assistance will not be accepted as a valid reason to stop the imposition of the appropriate academic penalties. If a student finds it necessary to withdraw during the course of a quarter, the Office of Student Affairs must be notified in w riting. Arrangements for formal withdrawal must then be made in the Office of University Records by completing and submitting a \"Withdrawal from the Program\" form. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term are not included in the student's permanent record and tuition is refunded. Refer to the University's refund policy in the Financial Information section of the Student Handbook for information that applies after the first two weeks of the quarter. An exit interview with the School of Pharmacy administration is required. EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION The School of Pharmacy participates in the California Board of Pharmacy's approved supervised experiential program. The School will certify 600 of the required 1,500 hours of supervised experience required to sit for the licensing examination. Successful completion of the School of Pharmacy's didactic and experiential programs, and passing scores on the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) and a law examination or equivalent, are required in order to become a registered pharmacist (RPh) in the state(s) of choice. The experiential program consists of a variety of introductory and advanced experiences designed to provide the student with professional experience through the use of a structured and supervised program of study. Students participating in the experien tial program will receive a Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy Experiential Program Manual . Guidelines and policies are listed in this manual and must be adhered to for successful completion of the program. Didactic education is a systematic approach intended to convey instruction and information (classroom, laboratory, recitation, etc.). Experiential education is related to or derived from providing experiences in real-life professional settings. In pharma cy education, the experiential component is designed to provide in-depth exposure to and active participation in selected pharmacy - practice settings. Pharmacy students are e xposed to prescription processing, compounding, documenting services, obtaining drug histories, drug-therapy monitoring, counseling, evaluating drug usage, drug-distribution systems, and other relevant pharmacy-practice activities. Under the philosophy of pharmaceutical care, the School of Pharmacy offers introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) in the PY 1-3 years that support students' growth, strengthen their self-confidence, and prepare them to function as self-direc ted learners. The advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) in the PY4 are designed to help students integrate and refine the skills learned in the first three years of pharmacy (didactic) course work. 444 UNIVERSITY CATALOG The ultimate goal of the experiential program is to produce well-rounded, competent, caring, and responsible professionals who can deliver exemplary pharmaceutical care; as well as effectively communicate with diverse patients and colleagues. Experiential Education requirements The majority of the student's time during experiential courses is out-of-the-classroom activity under the direct supervision of a School of Pharmacy preceptor. When a student is off campus during an IPPE or APPE rotation, Loma Linda University's code of conduct and the guidelines found in the School of Pharmacy Student Policies and Procedures Manual are still in effect throughout the completion of this experience. If experiential site regulations and policies differ from University policies, th e site policies supersede. In addition to the above-mentioned guidelines, the following items are to be followed by all professional pharmacy students assigned to experiential sites or rotations. Attendance is mandatory. Punctuality is expected, and excessive tardiness will not be tolerated. Students must maintain their University email account and are required to check the account at least daily to keep apprised of important information or announcements. All experiential educational assignments are made through the Division of Experiential Education and are the responsibi lity of the director of experiential education. No student is allowed to change rotation sites. Students are not to function as an agent or employee of the site. They must identify themselves as pharmacy students from Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. While participating in this graded experience, students shall not, under any circumstances, receive financial remuneration from the experiential site. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in suspension and removal from the rotation and receipt of a failing grade in the course. All financial obligations associated with the student's pharmacy education are the responsibility of the student. These responsibilities include transportation, food, lodging, and any other incidental costs related to off-site assignments. Concurr ent employment during the experiential experience does not exclude or excuse students from any responsibilities associated with course requirements. The student must possess a valid driver's license and is responsible for transportation to and from sites . Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy students are required to dress and act professionally at all times. This expectation extends to experiential educational activities where the student is not physically on the campus but receives instruction and guidance through a School of Pharmacy preceptor. The Division of Experiential Education requires all students to adhere to the School of Pharmacy dress code and to wear their Loma Linda University identification card and short white laboratory coat at all times while at the experiential site. The laboratory coat must be white, clean, and freshly pressed/ironed. Students who attend out of dress code will be considered abse nt by the preceptor and sent home to fulfill dress code requirements prior to returning to the practice site. In addition to the general school requirements, other rules may apply for students who are off site. If the experiential site h as special attire or dress-code requirements, the more stringent of the dress-code requirements prevails\u2014whether that of Loma Linda University or of the off-site institution. Pharmacy-practice experience In order to complete the curriculum successfully, graduate from the School of Pharmacy, and become a licensed pharmacist, the student is required to complete a minimum of 1,500 hours of practice experiences. The director of experiential education coordinates the two school-based levels of experiential education. Introductory pharmacy-practice experience (IPPE) The goal of the introductory experiential education is to expose students to pract itioners who provide pharmaceutical care. Under the tutelage of a School of Pharmacy preceptor, who is also a licensed pharmacist, the student may have some exposure to direct patient care. This early exposure helps the student become familiar with the health care environment, learn the \"unwritten\" rul es of how to navigate in a busy practice setting, and begin to develop the confidence that will be required in future clinical experiences. Advanced pharmacy-practice experience (APPE) Students are also required to complete a total of six (6), six-week advanced pharmacy practice experiences in specific clinical areas. Four experiences will be in required fields: hospital practice, ambulatory care, internal medicine, and clinical communi ty practice. Two experiences will be in elective fields (see curriculum section). Prerequisites for advanced-pharmacy practice experiences In order to progress to the advanced pharmacy practice experiences, a student must meet the following requirements: Assessment examination : Students must pass the PY3 end-of-year comprehensive assessment examination. PY4 standing: Students must achieve PY4 standing as defined by the School of Pharmacy. The Office of Student and Professional Affairs will notify the director of experiential education when students successfully complete all PY3 work. GENERAL EXPECTATIONS AND ACADEMIC POLICIES 445 Immunizations: Students must safeguard themselves and be sure that all University-required immunizations are up to date. Students are responsible for keeping the records of their own immunizations accessible. For the protection of patients and the students themselves, it is highly recommended that students receive the influenza vaccine in October during their PY4 year. Some sites may require this immunization. Tuberculosis screening: Students must be screened and cleared for tuberculosis (complete a two-step PPD test or chest x-ray) during summer of PY4. Students shall follow specific instructions provided by the Division of Experiential Education. A record of this clearance must be on file in the office of the director of experiential education. Background check: Facilities require a background check of all personnel, including students who are placed on site for APPE. Some institutions may require the student to sign a confidentiality agreement or disclosure statement. Background checks are required for entry to the School of Pharmacy; periodic review and update may be required during the program. An updated background check is required prior to starting APPE. Intern license: Students must hold a valid California pharmacists intern license throughout the advanced pharmacy practice experiences. CPR/First aid: Students must hold valid certification in both CPR and first aid. Effective dates must be current through the PY4. Student health card: Students must carry the Loma Linda University student health insurance card with them at all times. CV: Students must present a copy of their professional CV to the site preceptor at each APPE location. LICENSING Intern pharmacist license All School of Pharmacy students must have a current California intern pharmacist license. Students begin the application proces s prior to the start of PY1. During the first-year orientation, applications for this license are completed, including a $75 paym ent by check to the California Board of Pharmacy. The Office of Student Affairs submits these applications to the California Board of Pharmacy. All students involved in introductory pharmacy practice experiences (IPPE) and advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) must hold a current pharmacy intern license. Information about the pharmacy intern license can be found on the web page\u2014 <http://www.pharmacy.ca. gov/pdfs2/intern_application_pkt.pdf>. It is the student's responsibility to keep his/her pharmacist intern license current and valid. The Board of Pharmacy must be notified of any address, student status, or name change. A photocopy of the student's valid intern pharmacist license must be o n file in the school's Office of Experiential Education. Intern pharmacist hours The California State Board of Pharmacy requires each student to accrue 1,500 hours of acceptable intern experience. The School of Pharmacy's advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) will fulfill 600 of these hours. The remaining 900 hours must be completed outside the School of Pharmacy curriculum and must consist of employment in a pharmacy under the immediate, direct, and personal supervision of a pharmacist. This experience must be predominately related to selling drugs, compounding prescriptions, preparing pharmaceutical preparations, keeping records, and making reports required by California and federal regulations.

Encourage an educational environment supportive of diverse population groups. OUR VALUES The School of Public Health believes that the values held by the school and its faculty and staff\u2014and which it seeks to develop in its students\u2014are a consequence of a loving relationship between God and His created beings. This relationship is reflected in t he following values: Compassion \u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and suffering of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which this University has taken as a central symbol for our work. Integrity \u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are well-considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. Excellence \u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standards and expectations. Freedom \u2014The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery, but to freedom. Justice \u2014The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renouncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could only be genuine when it led the believers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans, [and] plead for the widow.\" Purity/Self-Control \u2014Morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. Humility \u2014The willingness to serve others in a sacrificial manner; the self-respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance. SCHOOL FOUNDATIONS 457 School Foundations HISTORY The school's foundation was laid in 1948 with the organization of the School of Tropical and Preventive Medicine, the purpose of which was to provide a base for research and teaching. In 1964, plans were made for faculty and facilities to meet the requirements of the Committee on Professional Education of the American Public Health Association (APHA). Three years later, the School of Nutrition and Dietetics (established in 1922) and the Division of Public Health and Tropical Medicine were accredited by AOHA and organized under the name Loma Linda University School of Public Health. This name was changed to School of Health in October 1970 to reflect more clearly the School's emphasis on lifestyle. In response to changing societal perceptions and definitions of \"public health,\" the original name, School of Public Health, was readopted in August 1987. The Center for Health Promotion, the Department of Preventive Medicine, and the Preventive Medicine Group were merged into the School of Public Health in 1990. The expanded resources realized by this merger stimulated further growth and development of the school to provide a dynamic learning and research environment for its students and faculty. Accreditation The school has maintained continuous accreditation since it was accredited at its inception in 1967 by the American Public Health Association. It is currently accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health, 800 Eye Street NW, Suite 202, Washington, D.C. 20001-1397. The school is also a member of the Association of Schools of Public Health. 458 UNIVERSITY CATALOG General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school and ou tlines the subject and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirements in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. University email accounts The University accepts its moral, ethical, and legal responsibility for informing and reminding students of deadlines, regulati ons, and processes by issuing an email account to every student and communicating with students by email. It is the students' responsibi lity to read and res pond to their email messages from the University. LEARNING ENVIRONMENT 459 Learning Environment Technology facilities The school is excited by the addition of technology-blended and fully online courses. Students should be prepared to use email, electronic library resources, online survey tools, course management tools, and other internet communication tools while engage d in the School of Public Health learning environment. With mu ltiple online M.P.H. degree programs and certificates, the Sc hool of Public Health is demonstrating its commitment to moving forward with a technology-supported and technology-facilitated learning environment. Note: Tutorials are available to assist members of this learning community in using the school's various tools. Campus facilities Facilities for the School of Public Health\u2014offices, lecture and seminar rooms, teaching and research laboratories, work and storage areas\u2014are located mainly in and adjacent to Francis Nichol Hall. Additional offices and research facilities are located in Evans Hall and the Parkland Building. DEPARTMENTS AND CENTERS The instructional, research, and service programs within the school are organized and administered by six academic departments and three centers. THE DEPARTMENTS Department of Environmental and Occupational Health The protection of the human environment from natural and man-made hazardous cond itions is a major issue of growing concern that affects the health and welfare of people throughout the world. Environmental and occupational health professionals strive to promote health and quality of life by preventing and reducing illness, disability, and death from interactions between people a nd their environment over the entire life-span. The science and practice of environmental health currently covers many new responsibilities such as responding to emergencies, educating and training various audiences, and developing new standards and guidelines, or helping formulate public policy. The emergence of new issues and threats\u2014such as food security or natural, technological, humanitarian, and terrorism-related environmental emergencies\u2014establishes the need for an educated and well- prepared environmental and occupational health workforce. As environmental health professionals must be able to anticipate, recognize, and respond to traditional as well as emerging challenges, they also need to stay current on all of the latest infor mation and technology tools available. Environmental health practitioners are diverse in backgr ound, education, and function. Therefore, the department stresses an interdisciplinary approach to instruction and continually seeks to train individuals with a broad range of backgrounds, value systems, and perceptions of the world. The Environmental and Occupational Health Program provides a California state-approved professional program that leads to the Master of Public Health (M.P.H) degree in environmental and occupational health. In addition, select individuals are offered the opportunity to obtain an M.P.H degree that is not designed to meet the eligibility certification requirements. The Department of Environmental and Occupational Health also makes available to students interdisciplinary options that integrate epidemiologic research skills or modern geospatial information technology too ls into the standard M.P.H program. The department also partners with the U.S. Peace Corps to offer a dual degree, the M.P.H/Master's International Program (M.P.H/M.I.P). The department builds upon students' existing foundation in the sciences to prepare them to meet the growing employment market for environmental health specialists, industrial hygienists, environmental epidemiologists, geo-informatics specialists, and other professions that examine human environment interactions. In varying degrees of depth, courses and laboratories provide training in the anticipation, recognition, evaluation, and control of health hazards in places of employment and communities. O ur graduates secure rewarding careers in government, industry, and the private sector. Mission The mission of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health is to prepare distinguished environmental health professionals to serve local, national and international communities. The Department of Environmental and Occupational Health has established the following goals for faculty: 1. Practice excellence in teaching through continual review and improvement of methods and materials. 2. Actively participate in scholarly activities and attain our full professional potential. 3. Provide sound academic, professional, and personal advisement to our student body. 460 UNIVERSITY CATALOG 4. Contribute public health service to the local, national, and international community. 5. Provide professional leadership in our respective technical fields. 6. Create an atmosphere in the department that promotes and encourages the environmental and occupational health profession as a career option. Standards The Environmental and Occupational Health Department endeavors to train graduates who will: 1. Conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner. 2. Serve as qualified, successful environmental health practitioners. 3. Be prepared to enter into advanced or doctoral degree programs Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics Although the science of epidemiology began with the investigation of the infectious disease outbreaks, epidemiologists today consider the modern plagues of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and injuries to be a part of this relatively young discipline. Contemporary epidemiology builds upon the premise that disease or health is not randomly distributed within populations. Epidemiologists, therefore, apply a collection of investigative research methods that permeate all fields of public health in o rder to identify and isolate the underlying causes of disease and injury as well as health. The emphasis placed upon the investigati ve process has inspired some to describe the epidemiologist as a medical detective. The diversity of this investigative science is illustrated by a number of research accomplishments ranging from identification of control and preventive measures for AIDS and diabetes mellitus; to etiologic processes important in the development of malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases. Other accomplishments of epidemiology include discovery of social and biological mechanisms involved in the spread of measles, AIDS, and pertussis through human populations; and preventive measures for surgical wound and other hospital-acquired infections. Contemporary epidemiologic inquiry ranges from investigation of the roles of prescription medications, nutrition, electromagnetic fields, and pesticides in human cancer; to identification of health benefits of cholesterol reduction, smoking cessation, and use of safety bindings on skis. The efficacy and confirmed success of epidemiology guarantee an exciting future for those who meet the challenges of this advancing science. The mission of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics is to prepare professionals to serve local, national and international communities as researchers and consultants qualified to provide an understanding of environmental, genetic, and social characteristics important in disease development and spread; and professionals qualified to select and apply appropriate statistical theories, strategies, and techniques to the solution of research problems. The Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics: 1. Trains students to become professionals in epidemiology and biostatistics. 2. Fosters a spirit of collaboration among students and faculty by including students in research projects and as teaching assistants. 3. Provides practical research experience, including presentation of data, through field practice in a public health department or other agency, or on one of the research projects within the University. 4. Conducts high-quality research, collaborates on research projects within the school and the University, and develops research collaboration with other academic and research communities. 5. Provides consultation services regarding research design; and analyzes and interprets results to other groups within the University, the community, and outside agencies. Department of Global Health Department goal The department's goal is founded on Christian values of love for and service to humanity and stewardship for the resources of t he earth.

Over the years as the needs of host countries have evolved, the Peace Corps has continued striving to attract individuals whose education, experience, and cross-cultural sensitivity can address global needs as they arise; and who can facilitate sustainable, community-centered development. After identifying a number of areas in which there was a shortage of personnel with specialized expertise\u2014including the area of public health\u2014the Peace Corps established the Master's International Program in 1987. This program is designed not only to meet the increasing demand from Peace Corps host countries for volunteers with higher levels of education and technical expertise, but also to provide volunteers the opportunity to incorporate Peace Corps service into graduate-education pursuits. Loma Linda University is one of eighty-two universities currently participating in the Master's International Program. It is on e of only eleven universities that offer this prestigious program in conjunction with the Master of Public Health degree, which includes one of the following emphases: environmental health, health promotion and education, global health, maternal-child health, health policy and management, and nutrition. Prospective students must be accepted both by Loma Linda University School of Public Health into the Master of Public Health degree program, and by the Peace Corps into the Master's International Program. To join the Peace Corps, the applicant must be a U.S. citizen, at least 18 years of age, and in good physical health. For information regarding additional eligibility criteria and the excellent benefits package (including language and cultural training, living and housing expenses in the field, medical and dental coverage, deferment of student-loan repayment, transportation allowance to and from one's service assignment, vacation time and allowances, financial readjustment and allowance, and employment assistance post-service), contact the Peace Corps at 800/424-8580, ext. 1843; or Office of University Programs at <www.peacecorps.gov>. After acceptance into the program, the student completes the course work on the Loma Linda campus. The student also completes three months of intensive language, technical, and cross-cultural training. When the academic course work and training have been completed, the student enters a three month intensive language, technical, and cross-cultural training period in the assigned host country with Peace Corps. Upon completion of the training period the student is then a full fledged volunteer and begins the twenty-four month service period. While on assignment, MIP/MPH degree program students receive an internship or a field-practicum tuition scholarship. Upon satisfactory completion of the Peace Corps assignment and the culminating activity report, the student is awarded the MPH degree.

May God enrich your studies, Jon Paulien, Ph.D. Dean, School of Religion SCHOOL FOUNDATIONS 589 School Foundations HISTORY In the configuration of Loma Linda University as a health-scien ces university, the role of religion as integrative in each of t he programs of the University is mandated and continuously affirmed by the University administration and the Board of Trustees. In July of 1990, the Faculty of Religion (now the School of Religion) was established to assist in this integration. PHILOSOPHY As implied by its motto, \"TO MAKE MAN WHOLE,\" the University affirms these tenets as central to its view of education: God is the creator and sustainer of the universe. Mankind's fullest development entails a growing understanding of the individual in relation to both God and society. The quest for truth and professional expertise, in an environment permeated by religious values, benefits the individual and society and advances the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. MISSION STATEMENT The School of Religion is committed to the following four tasks, as informed by the teachings and practice of the Seventh-day Adventist heritage and mission: 1. To promote Christian wholeness for faculty and students in their personal and professional lives and witness. 2. To provide a religion curriculum with the following emphases: o Theological studies (biblical, historical, doctrinal, mission, and philosophical). o Ethical studies. o Relational studies (applied theology, clinical ministry, and psychology of religion). 3. To foster and support research in theological, ethical, and relational disciplines. 4. To serve the University, the church, and the larger world community by personal involvement in fostering deeper spirituality, theological integrity, and social justice. 590 UNIVERSITY CATALOG General Regulations Students of the University are responsible for informing themselves of and satisfactorily meeting all regulations pertinent to registration, matriculation, and graduation. Section III gives the general setting for the programs of each school and the subj ect and unit requirements for admission to individual professional programs. It is important to review specific program requirement s in the context of the general requirements applicable to all programs. APPLICATION AND ADMISSIONS 591 Application and Admissions The program admissions committees of the University intend that an applicant to any of the schools is qualified for the proposed curriculum and is capable of profiting from the educational experience offered by this University. The admissions committees of the schools accomplish this by examining evidence of scholastic competence, moral and ethical standards, and significant qualities of character and personality. Applicants are considered for admission only on the recommendation of the program in which study is desired. APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE Where to write Inquiries regarding application and admission should be addressed to: Office of Admissions School of Religion Loma Linda University Loma Linda, CA 92350 Application procedure 1. The online application is found online at <www.llu.edu/a pply>. Applications and all supporting information, transcripts, test results, and references should be submitted at least two months before the beginning of the term for which admission is sought. Some programs require applications to be completed by a much earlier date. 2. Complete official transcripts of all academic records from all colleges, universities, and professional or technical schools should be provided. It is the applicant's responsibility to arrange to have the transcripts, including official English translations and evaluations, if applicable, sent directly by the registrar - or understood institutional representative - of each school attended to the University Admissions Office. Transcripts that come via an intermediary are unacceptable. 3. A personal interview is often desirable and should be arranged with the coordinator of the program in which the student wishes to study. ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission t o the School of Religion. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content , for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the student should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficiencies may be removed while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to acceptance into the program. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade-point average of B (3.00) or better in the overall program and in the field of the major. Some students with an overall grade-point average between 2.50 and 3.00 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades during the junior and senior years are superior, or there is other evid ence of capability. Academic probation Degree students whose cumulative G.P.A. at the end of any quarter is less than 3.0 will be placed on academic probation. The number of units for subsequent registrations is restricted to a maximum of 12 per quarter. Students who are on academic probation and fail to make a 3.0 for the next quarter, or who fail to have a 3.0 G.P.A. overall after two quarters, jeopardize their standing in a degree or certificate program and may be dismissed from school. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Religion program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exception to this is the combined-degrees programs, discussed at the end of Section III of this CATALOG under Combined- Degrees Programs. 592 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Financial Information The Office of the Dean is the final authority in all financial matters and is charged with the interpretation of all financial policies. Any exceptions to published policy in regard to reduction or reimbursement of tuition must be approved by the Dean. Any statement by individual faculty members, program directors, or department chairs in regard to these matters is not binding on the school or the University unless approved by the Dean. Registration is not complete until tuition and fees on the required installment are paid; therefore, the student should be prep ared to make these payments during scheduled registration for each academic year. There may be adjustments in tuition and fees as economic cond itions warrant. ON- AND OFF-CAMPUS STUDENT HOUSING Students may go to <www.llu.edu/llu/housing> for housing information and a housing application form.

RELIGION AND THE SCIENCES\u2014SR 599 Religion and the Sciences\u2014SR (M.A.) RICHARD RICE, Program Coordinator As the academic study of religion has developed over the past fifty years, the exploration of religion and science has emerged a s a discipline of its own. Scholars in the natural sciences, the human sciences, and numerous applied sciences recognize the importance of examining religion from their particular perspectives. And religion scholars appreciate the importance of the questions that the methods and conclusions of the sciences raise for religious belief and practice. As a Seventh-day Adventist health-sciences university, Loma Linda University rests on the conviction that there is a pos itive relation between religion and the sciences. Its commitment to a variety of health professional programs reflects the belief tha t the natural world is God's good creation and that human beings are inherently part of the physical order of things. Its commitment to higher education, including various avenues of graduate study, expresses the belief that all truth is God's truth, and that the acquisition of truth calls for the diligent application of all our powers. These convictions support the attempt to bring scien tific knowledge within the overarching perspective of Christian faith. This Master of Arts degree is designed for several types of students: those who want a degree in religion and science before pursuing further graduate work in one or the other of these areas; graduate students in the natural and social sciences who wou ld like to combine their other academic interests with a serious study of religion; students in professional programs who also hav e an interest in the area of religion and science; and individuals who wish to explore the interface of religion and the sciences within the context of serious academic work. The Religion and the Sciences Program is administered by the School of Religion. It draws on resources from various sectors of the campus, including the Department of Earth and Biological Sciences faculty of the School of Science and Technology; the Department of Psychology faculty of the School of Science and Technology; and the members of other faculties in the University, as well as other scholars and professors with expertise in the area. Upon completion of the Religion and the Sciences program, students will demonstrate: 1. A knowledge of the research methods of religious studies and at least one branch of the natural and human sciences. 2. An understanding of the contrasting and complementary aspects of scientific inquiry and religion experience. 3. The ability to bring into critical conversation the theoretical foundations of science and philosophical perspectives on religion. 4. Critical thinking in the areas of religious and scientific inquiry. 5. The ability to contribute to the field of religion and the sciences in the areas of research and writing. 6. An understanding of the relation of wholeness and values to one's scholarship in the area of religion and the sciences. Admission In addition to meeting admission requirements for the School of Religion, the applicant to the Religion and the Sciences Progra m must: 1. Propose clear personal and professional goals and ways in which the Religion and the Sciences Program may facilitate the realization of those goals. 2. Persuade the Admissions Committee, by previous accomplishments, that s/he is able and willing to reach these goals and to make a significant contribution to the field. Course requirements In order to receive the Master of Arts degree in religion and the sciences from Loma Linda University, the student will complet e a minimum of 48 units of course work covering an appropriate range of courses and seminars as herein specified, with an overall grade point average of B or better, with no grade lower than a C and with no grade in a required course lower than a B-.

Research The student will prepare an acceptable thesis or material suitable for publication in relevant scholarly journals. DIVISION OF HUMANITIES 601 Division of Humanities For more than fifty years Loma Linda University has officially prized \"wholeness.\" Because of the specialized nature of Loma Linda University's curricula, a humanities component of the health-related professional programs is important to realize the university's motto, \"To Make Man Whole.\" Health care and research are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary, and only a breadth of integrated knowledge adequately prepares tomorrow's leaders. Loma Linda University alumni will both influence and be influenced by a complex society; disciplined study of the humanities is no luxury. In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Board of Trustees voted in December 2006 to establish the Division of Humanities in the newly named School of Religion. The goal is to establish a small core of humanities scholars, beginning with one professor each in literature and in history, who not only will teach humanities courses, but also will develop innovative means to enhance the humanities ethos on campus. Loma Linda University's humanities program has two emphases\u2014undergraduate and professional education. Undergraduate. The humanities program for undergraduates builds on the humanities coursework that students bring from prior college enrollment. The focus is a new capstone, academic course in which students examine their personal and professional values and devise a grid through which to evaluate a variety of extra-classroom University events and experiences. The humanities integration course has limited classroom time and emphasizes students' ability to critically integrate insights from diverse films, lectures, concerts, etc., into a coherent perspective. The final product is an exemplary 3,000-word essay that furthers several of Loma Linda University's educational objectives: Values-based education Critical-thinking skills Effective communication Contribution of the humanities to society Life-long learning Human wholeness Professional. The Division of Humanities' impact on professional education is largely outside the classroom\u2014live theater, workshops, film discussions, and brown-bag sessions. These experiences are important in themselves, and the humanities faculty will greatly strengthen this aspect of campus life. However, the Division envisions honors programs that will require instructo r- led integrative discussions\u2014often supplemented with assigned reading. Discussion has begun with various schools of the University regarding the development of honors programs that focus on demonstrated excellence in one's specialized field of study, as well as integration of that knowledge with at least one humanities discipline (e.g., history, literature, religion). 602 UNIVERSITY CATALOG The School of Science and Technology Dean's Welcome School Foundations Philosophy Objectives Application and Admissions Application and acceptance Admission requirements Scholarship Graduate Record Examination Re-entrance English competence From master's to Ph.D. degree Bypassing master's degree Second master's degree Concurrent admission Combined degrees Certificate programs MASTER OF ARTS / MASTER OF SCIENCE / MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK Adviser and guidance committee Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Study plan Time limit Residence Minimum required grade-point average Research competence Comprehensive and final examinations Thesis Candidacy Specific program requirements Religion requirement Combined-degrees programs THESIS AND DISSERTATION Format guide Binding DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Adviser and guidance committee Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Study plan Time limit Residence Minimum required grade-point average Clinical probation Scholarly competence Comprehensive examinations The final oral examination Project Dissertation Candidacy Specific program requirements Religion requirement COMBINED-DEGREES PROGRAMS THE SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 603 Student Life Academic Information Conditions of registration, residence, attendance Academic residence Transfer credits Academic probation Financial information Schedule of charges (2007-2008) Programs, Degrees, and Certificates Offered CERTIFICATE\u2014UNDERGRADUATE Spanish Studies for Health Care Professionals CERTIFICATE\u2014POSTBACCALAUREATE Case Management Child Life Specialist Clinical Mediation Drug and Alcohol Counseling Family Counseling Family Life Education (Family Studies) Forensic Science Health Professions Education Program Evaluation School Counseling (PPS Credential) CERTIFICATE\u2014POST- (OR CONCURRENT WITH) MASTER'S OR DOCTORAL DEGREE Clinical Mediation Drug and Alcohol Counseling Family Counseling Family Life Education School Counseling (PPS Credential) BACHELOR OF SCIENCE (B.S.)

This catalog describes who we are and what we have to offer. It will familiarize you with the philosophy and structure of our programs, along with a listing of the participating faculty. Loma Linda is a religious, nonprofit institution that welcomes students and staff from a broad spectrum of religious persuasions while reserving the right to give preference to qualified members of its sponsoring denomination. As stated in its nondiscrimination policy, the institution \"affirms that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and they should so be regarded by all people.\" Since several of the professions-for which programs within the School of Science and Technology (SST) prepare students-have a tradition of advocacy for oppressed peoples, it is important that the institution, faculty and staff demonstrate their acceptance of, and willingness to assist those of our society who are less privileged. The University actively sponsors several programs that move the institutional health-care personnel resources and expertise into the local, national and international communities to work with otherwise under-served populations. This component of service is an integral part of the Statement of Mission and a message intended to be captured in the Good Samaritan sculpture that occupies a central position on the campus. The School of Science and Technology, as part of the University, has expectations of students, faculty and staff in the areas o f conduct and behavior while they are on campus or involved in School or University activities. The School does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, age, ethnic or national origin or handicap. Enrollment of students in SST programs is not conditioned on their political or sexual orientation; in these areas the School's policy is directed towards conduct or disrupt ive behavior, not orientation. In support of this pos ition we expect our students, faculty, and staff to demonstrate unwavering respect for the diversity of others and interact with integrity, never forgetting the standards that guide professional actions. Furthe r, we expect our programs through their faculty to develop competent, compassionate, ethical professionals who possess the knowledge, skills and values to equip them for a life dedicated to service to all those in need regardless of their lifestyles. You will find vigorous academic programs that will stretch your mind as you take time to make new discoveries, get to understand our world, and apply Christ-centered values to your life and profession. Our administrators, faculty and staff are here to work with you and help you prepare for your future as a caring, Christian professional in the world of service to mankind. If you would like to know more about us, you can call us toll free at 1-800-42 2- 4LLU. Beverly J. Buckles, DSW Dean, School of Science and Technology 606 UNIVERSITY CATALOG School Foundations The School of Science and Technology (SST)\u2014one of Loma Linda University's newest schools\u2014includes the Departments of Earth and Biological Sciences, Counseling and Family Sciences, Psychology, and Social Work and Social Ecology. Many of the programs offered have matured on campus for a decade or more; one program was established half a century ago. The school offers degree programs through the doctoral level, postdegree certificates, and a certificate programs in Spanish; as well as courses that meet the University's general education requirements. Technology programs, such as e-Health Technology, are currently being developed by the school. PHILOSOPHY The School of Science and Technology is mission driven and academically incorporates the University's commitment to the teaching and healing ministry of Jesus Christ, which produces wholeness within transformed lives. Transformation is a lifelong faith-and-learning process\u2014a process committed to pursuit of the highest levels of scholarship, professionalism, and spiritual well-being. This pursuit seeks to understand and promote healthy minds, communities, social systems, families, and the environment. SCHOOL FOUNDATIONS 607 Wholeness for self and for others is central to a balance between mind, body, and spirit. Such wholeness manifests itself in a life of service to humanity, to the environment, and to God. The School of Science and Technology values the time-honored and separate traditions in higher education for \"academic\" and \"professional\" programs and advocates the integration of knowledge and research, blending the \"pure\" with the \"applied\" sciences. In the School of Science and Technology of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest for meaning. Because this quest is served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is created and transformed into wisdom. OBJECTIVES The School of Science and Technology attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the service of humankind. 608 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Application and Admissions APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE Application procedure 1.

Minor field A minor is an area outside of the student's major field, in which the student takes enough courses to acquire a basic introduct ion to the subject. Each program defines the requirements of subject minors. Minimum required grades The minimum required grade is C for courses that apply to the undergraduate degree. GRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Admission Requirements A four-year baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) from an accredited college or university is a prerequisite for admission t o the School of Science and Technology's graduate programs. Transcripts of the applicant's scholastic record should show appropriate preparation, in grades and content, for the curriculum chosen. Since there is some variation in the pattern of undergraduate courses prescribed by different programs, the applicant should note the specific requirements of the chosen program. Deficienci es may be fulfilled while enrolled; prerequisites must be completed prior to matriculation. Scholarship Applicants are expected to present an undergraduate record with a grade-point average of B (3.0) or better in the overall program and in the field of the major. Depending on program-specific criteria, some students with an overall grade-point average betwe en 2.5 and 3.0 may be admitted provisionally to graduate standing, provided the grades of the junior and senior years are superior or there is other evidence of capability. Graduate record examination Scores on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are required with applications for admission to many degree programs. New test scores are needed if it has been more than five years since the last test was taken. Applicants are advised to request information specific to their proposed program of study. For complete information about the GRE, please visit their Website at <http://www.gre.org>; or write to Educational Testing Service, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, CA 94701 (for the West); and P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, NJ 08541 (for the East). For GRE publications (including study materials), call 800/537-3160. When pressure of time makes it impossible to secure the results of the GRE or its alternatives, students seeking admission who have otherwise above-average achievement may be admitted provisionally, subject to review when the required test results are received. In such cases, test results are to be submitted within the first quarter of attendance. Certain programs with limited admissions may require the GRE results prior to acceptance, while some programs require the subject test. Please check student guides from individual programs for further information. 610 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Programs that do not require the GRE must submit one additional measure of a candidate's preparation for graduate study. This may be either an evaluation of critical essay writing skills, the Miller analogy test, the results of a structured interview, o r other specified program criteria. Re-entrance Students who are currently enrolled in the School of Science and Technology may request transfer to a different program or a more advanced degree level by contacting the School of Science and Technology Admissions Office for information on an abbreviated application and instructions for submitting the appropriate supporting documents. Transcripts on file with the University are acceptable. English competence All international students are encouraged (particularly those w ho do not have an adequate score on TOEFL or MTELP or other evidence of English proficiency) to attend an intensive American Language Ins titute prior to entering their program because further study of English may be required to assure academic progress. FROM MASTER'S TO PH.D. DEGREE Bypassing master's degree A graduate student at this University may proceed first to a master's degree. If at the time of application the student wishes to qualify for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, this intention should be declared even if the first objective is a master's degree . If after admission to the master's degree program a student wishes to go on to the doctoral degree, an abbreviated application should be completed and submitted, along with appropriate supporting documents, to the School of Science and Technology Admissions Office. If the award of the master's degree is sought, the student will be expected to complete that degree before embarking on doctoral activity for credit. A student who bypasses the master's degree may be permitted, on the recommendation of the guidance committee and with the consent of the dean, to transfer courses and research that have been completed in the appropriate field and are of equivalent quality and scope to his/her doctoral program. Second master's degree A student who wishes to qualify for an additional master's degree in a different discipline may apply. The dean of the School o f Science and Technology and the faculty of the program the student wishes to enter will consider such a request on its individua l merits. Concurrent admission Students may not be admitted to a School of Science and Technology program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined-degrees programs, discussed in the following paragraph. Combined degrees Students may not be admitted to a School of Science and Technology program while admitted to another program at this University or elsewhere. The exceptions to this are the combined-degrees programs, discussed in the following paragraph. Certificate programs The School of Science and Technology offers several postbaccalaureate certificate programs. Students accepted into such programs will be assigned to an adviser who will work with them as they fulfill the program requirements. Students will be required to maintain a B- (2.7) grade-point average, with no course grade below C (2.0). All certificate students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course (numbered between 500 and 600). MASTER OF ARTS/MASTER OF SCIENCE/MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK Adviser and guidance committee Each student accepted into a degree program is assigned an adviser who helps to arrange the program of study to meet University requirements; subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. This committee is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arranging courses, screening thesis topics (where applicable), guiding research, administering final written and/or oral examinations, evaluating the thesis and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and ultimately recommending the student for graduat ion. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subject and classified either as prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking certain subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the master's degree program un til the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) and acceptable grades are reported. However, subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but these must be removed as specified by the adviser or dean, usually during the first full quarter of study at this University. APPLICATION AND ADMISSIONS 611 Study plan The student's adviser should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This will serve as a guide to both the student and the adviser as well as to members o f the guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of all required courses. Time limit The time allowed from admission to the School of Science and Technology to conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years. Some consideration may be given to a short extension of time if, in the dean's opinion, such is merited. Course credit allowed toward the master's degree is nullified seven years from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may be revalidated, upon successful petition, through reading, conferences, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. Residence Students must meet the residence requirements indicated for their particular program (never less than one academic quarter). Th e master's degree candidate must complete one quarter of full-time study at the University or perform the thesis research at the University. Although the number of units students take varies by program, students are expected to work closely with their program to assure that their course loads are consistent with program requirements, as well as degree completion options and timelines. Minimum required grade-point average The required minimum grade is B (3.0) on all work for the master's degree. This average must be maintained in formal courses and in research, computed separately. A student submitting transfer credits must earn a B grade on all work accepted for transf er and on all work taken at this University, computed separately. In some cases, programs have specified higher or additional requirements. Students should consult with their particular program of study. Professional performance probation Applied professional programs may recommend that the student be placed on professional performance probation. Details are contained in program guides for the programs concerned. Comprehensive and final examinations The student must take the written, oral, and final examinations prescribed by the program on or before the published dates. If a candidate fails to pass the oral or written examination for a graduate degree, the committee files with the dean a written anal ysis of the candidate's status, with recommendations regarding the student's future relation to the school. The student receives a c opy of the committee's recommendation. Research competence Student skills required in research, language, investigation, and computation are specified in each program description in this CATALOG. Thesis Students writing a thesis must register for at least 1 unit of thesis credit. The research and thesis preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and researc h design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for candidacy. The student must register and pay tuition for thesis credit, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the stude nt has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and thesis, continuous registration is to be maintained until the manuscript has been accepted. This involves a quarterly enrollmen t fee paid at the beginning of each quarter. Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and Technology or designation of regular graduate standing does not cons titute admission of the student to candidacy for a graduate degree. After achieving regular status, admission to candidacy is initiated by a writte n petition (School of Science and Technology Form A) from the student to the dean, on recommendation of the student's adviser and the program coordinator or department chair. Students petitioning the School of Science and Technology for candidacy for the master's degree must present a satisfactory grade record, include a statement of the proposed thesis or dissertation topic (where applicable) that has been approved by the student's guidance committee, and note any other qualification prescribed by the program. Students are usually advanced to candidacy during the third quarter after entering their course of study toward a degree in the School of Science and Technology . 612 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Specific program requirements In addition to the foregoing, the student is subject to the requirements stated in the section of the CATALOG governing the specific program chosen. Religion requirement All master's degree students are required to take at least one 3-unit religion course. Courses (numbered between 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specific guidelines. Combined-degrees programs A number of combined-degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide more comprehensive preparation in clinical applications and the biomedical sciences. Both require concurrent admission to two programs in the School of Science and Technology and/or a professional school in the University. These curricula are described in greater detail under the heading \"Combined-Degrees Programs\" in this section of the CATALOG. THESIS AND DISSERTATION The student's research and thesis or dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as is feasible. Such approval mus t be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Format guide Instructions for the preparation and format of the publishable paper, thesis, or dissertation are in the \"Thesis and Dissertati on Format Guide,\" available through the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor. Consultation with the dissertation editor can help the student avoid formatting errors that would require him/her to retype large sections of manuscript. The last day fo r submitting copies to the school office in final approved form is published in the events calendar (available from the academic dean's office). Binding The cost of binding copies of the thesis or dissertation to be deposited in the University library and appropriate department o r school collection will be paid for by the student's department. The student will be responsible for paying the cost of binding additional personal copies. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY The Doctor of Philosophy degree is awarded for evidence of mature scholarship; productive promise; and active awareness of the history, resources, and demands of a specialized field. Adviser and guidance committee Each student, upon acceptance into a degree program, is assigned an adviser who helps arrange the study program. Subsequently (no later than when applying for candidacy), the student is put under the supervision of a guidance committee. The School of Science and Technology requires advisers for Doctor of Philosophy degree candidates to have demonstrated scholarship productivity in their chosen disciplines. Each program maintains a list of qualified doctoral degree mentors. The guidance committee, usually chaired by the adviser, is responsible to and works with the coordinator of the student's program in arrangi ng course sequences, screening dissertation topics, recommending candidacy, guiding research, administering written and oral examinations, evaluating the dissertation/project and other evidence of the candidate's fitness to receive the degree, and recommending the student for graduation. Subject prerequisites and deficiencies Gaps in an applicant's academic achievement will be identified by subjects and classified as either prerequisites or as subject deficiencies. Applicants lacking subject or program prerequisites may not be admitted to the Ph.D. degree program until the prerequisites are completed (at Loma Linda University or elsewhere) with acceptable grades. Subject deficiencies do not exclude an applicant from admission or enrollment; but they must be removed as specified by the adviser or dean, usually at the beginning of the graduate experience at this University. Study plan The student's adviser should develop with the student a written outline of the complete graduate experience, with time and activity specified as fully as possible. This serves as a guide to both the student and the adviser, as well as to members of t he guidance committee when it is selected. The study plan is changed only after careful consultation. The student is ultimately responsible for ensuring both timely registration and completion of required courses. Time limit Completion of the graduate experience signals currency and competence in the discipline. The dynamic nature of the biological sciences makes dilatory or even leisurely pursuit of the degree unacceptable. Seven years are allowed for completion after APPLICATION AND ADMISSIONS 613 admission to the Ph.D. degree program. Extension of time may be granted on petition if recommended by the guidance committee to the dean of the School of Science and Technology. Course credit allowed toward the doctorate is nullified eight years from the date of course completion. Nullified courses may b e revalidated, upon successful petition, through reading, conference, written reports, or examination to assure currency in the content. Residence The School of Science and Technology requires two years of residency for the doctoral degrees\u2014D.M.F.T, Psy.D., Ph.D.\u2014spent on the campus of the University after enrollment in a doctoral degree program. During residence, students devote full time to graduate activity in courses, research, or a combination of these. A full load of courses is 8 or more units each quarter; 36 or more clock hours per week is full time in research. Students may be advised to pursue studies for limited periods at special facilities not available at Loma Linda University. Suc h time may be considered residence if the arrangement is approved in advance by the dean of the School of Science and Technology. The spirit and demands of doctoral degree study require full-time devotion to courses, research, reading, and reflection. But neither the passage of time nor preoccupation with study assures success. Evidence of high scholarship and original contributio n to the field or professional competence form the basis for determining the awarding of the degree. Minimum required grade-point average Students must maintain a grade-point average of at least a B (3.0) to continue in regular standing toward the doctorate. This average is to be computed separately for courses and research. Courses in which a student earns a grade between C (2.0) and B (3.0) may or may not apply toward the degree, at the discretion of the guidance committee. A student submitting transfer credit s must earn a B average on all work accepted for transfer credit and on all work taken at this University, computed separately. Professional performance probation Applied professional programs may recommend that the student be placed on professional performance probation. Details are contained in the program guides for the programs concerned. Scholarly competence Doctoral degree students demonstrate competency in scholarship along with research and professional development. Expectations and standards of achievement with the tools of investigation, natural and synthetic languages, and computers are specified in t his section of the CATALOG for each program. Comprehensive examinations The doctoral degree candidate is required to take comprehensive written and oral examinations over the principal areas of study to ascertain capacity for independent, productive, scientific work; and to determine whether further courses are required befor e the final year of preparation for the doctorate is undertaken. The program coordinator is responsible for arranging preparation and administration of the examination, as well as its evaluation and subsequent reports of results. Success in the comprehensive examination is a prerequisite to candidacy (see below). Students cannot be admitted to the examination until the following requirements have been met: demonstrated reading knowledge of one foreign language, if applicable; completed the majority of units required beyond the master's degree or its equivalent. The final oral examination After completion of the dissertation and not later than a month before the date of graduation, the doctoral degree candidate is required to appear before an examining committee for the final oral examination. If a candidate fails to pass this final examination for a graduate degree, the examining committee files with the dean a writte n analysis of the candidate's status, with recommendations about the student's future relation to the school. The student receive s a copy of the committee's recommendation. Project (required for the Doctor of Psychology and Doctor of Marital and Family Therapy degrees) All Doctor of Psychology degree students must register for at least 1 unit of project credit. This should be done in the last q uarter of registration prior to completion. The research and project preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secur e the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition i s made for advancement to candidacy. 614 UNIVERSITY CATALOG If the student has been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and project, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee of $75 (2008-2009) to be paid during registration each quarter. A similar continuing-registration fee is assessed for each quarter the student fails to register for new units. Dissertation (required for the Doctor of Philosophy degree) All doctoral students must register for at least 1 unit of research credit. This should be done in the last quarter of registration prior to completion. The research and dissertation preparation are under the direction of the student's guidance committee. The student is urged to secure the committee's approval of the topic and research design as early as possible. Such approval must be secured before petition is made for advancement to candidacy. Consultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies dissertation editor can prevent the student from committing formatting errors that would require retyping large sections of the manuscript. Students register and pay tuition for the dissertation, whether the work is done in residence or in absentia. If the student ha s been advanced to candidacy, has completed all course requirements, and has registered for but not completed the research and dissertation, continuous registration is maintained until the manuscript is accepted. This involves a quarterly fee of $75 (200 8- 2009), to be paid during registration each quarter. A similar continuing-registration fee is assessed for each quarter the stud ent fails to register for new units. Doctoral dissertations are reported to University Microfilms International and to the National Opinion Research Center. The Faculty of Graduate Studies office provides appropriate information and forms. Candidacy Admission to the School of Science and Technology does not constitute candidacy for a graduate degree. Admission to candidacy is initiated by a written petition (School of Science and Technology Form A) from the student to the dean, with support from th e student's adviser and the program chair. The student's petition for candidacy for the Doctor of Philosophy degree will include, in addition, confirmation that comprehensive written and oral examinations have been passed. Students expecting the award of the doctorate at a June graduation should have achieved candidacy no later than the previous November 15. One full quarter must be allowed between the achievement of candidacy and the quarter of completion. Specific program requirements Doctoral programs differ from each other. The unique program requirements appear in the programs section of this CATALOG (Section III) and in the program guides available from specific departments. Religion requirement All doctoral students should take at least three 3-unit religion courses (numbered between 500 and 600). Students should check with their programs for specific guidelines. COMBINED-DEGREES PROGRAMS A number of combined-degrees programs are offered, each intended to provide additional preparation in clinical, professional, o r basic areas related to the student's field of interest. All require concurrent admission to the School of Science and Technolog y and a professional school in the University. The combined-degrees programs provide opportunity for especially well-qualified and motivated students to pursue professional and graduate education; and to prepare for careers in clinical specialization, teaching, or investigation of problems of health and disease in man. For admission to a combined-degrees program, the student must have a baccalaureate degree; must qualify for admission to the School of Science and Technology; and must already be admitted to the School of Medicine, the School of Dentistry, the School of Religion, or the School of Public Health. Application may be made at any point in the student's progress in the professional school, though it is usually made during the sophomore year. Students in this curriculum study toward the M.A., M.S., M.S.W., Psy.D., or Ph.D. degree. Students may be required to interrupt their professional study for two or more years (as needed) for courses and research for t he graduate degree sought. Elective time in the professional school may be spent in meeting School of Science and Technology requirements. The student's concurrent status is regarded as continuous until the program is completed or until discontinuance is recommended by the School of Science and Technology or the professional school. The usual degree requirements apply. APPLICATION AND ADMISSIONS 615 The following combined-degrees programs are offered in conjunction with the School of Science and Technology.

FROYLANA HEREDIA-MILLER, Program Director FACULTY (See department website for listing of all part-time and voluntary faculty) Crime disrupts personal and community relationships, endangers public health and safety, and threatens the moral contours of everyday social life. Loma Linda University's mission \"to make man whole\" provides a powerful and much-needed context in which criminal justice can be addressed on the basis of healing and restoration. The principles of restorative justice elevate the dimensions of justice that promote the acceptance of responsibility, promote the fulfillment of obligations, embrace reconciliation, and culmination in the restoration of personal and social relationships. This multidisciplinary approach to deviance and the administration of justice takes into consideration the social, physical, an d spiritual well-being of victims, offenders, and communities provides a deeper understanding of crime and the struggle of the modern criminal justice system. CRIMINAL JUSTICE\u2014M.S. Mission The mission of the Master in Criminal Justice program is to prepare students to think critically and analytically about the problems of crime and social control in contemporary society. Program objectives Students will demonstrate the ability to integrate and utilize knowledge of social science and criminological theory in the application to problems of criminal justice; Students will demonstrate an understanding of the dimensions and causes of crime and delinquency; Students will demonstrate an understanding of the structure of the American criminal justice system; Students will demonstrate an understanding of the ethical principles that guide the concepts of justice and fairness within professional criminal justice practice; Students will demonstrate the ability to use empirically based research to analyze and critically evaluate practice and criminal justice policy in order to effect system change; Students will demonstrate an understanding of diverse people and cultures as these interact with the criminal justice; Students will have an understanding of the differences between retributive and restorative justice approaches in addressing the effects of crime. Program description All students must complete 48 quarter units of course work. There are 26 units of foundation content required for all students, followed by 12 units in one of two concentrations: Policy and administration\u2014Students opting for the policy, planning, and administration concentration gain knowledge and skills in the public administration, planning and coordination of governmentally operated criminal and/or juvenile justice systems. Students acquire an appreciation for working with community entities to develop, coordinate and evaluate these systems in response to community needs. In add ition, students develop an understanding of the policy planning process and the role that criminal or juvenile justice planning councils perform in consensually revising or creating policies aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of criminal and juvenile justice systems. Forensic mental health\u2014 Forensic Mental Health is a specialized branch of professional practice where the clinical and criminal justice worlds overlap. Students choosing this area focus on the needs of individuals in the criminal or juvenile justice syste ms who have serious emotional disorders and/or severe mental illness, and may also present with co-occurring substance abuse. Students gain knowledge and skills in treatment programming within a forensic mental health framework. In addition, this context prepares students to assess and provide expert testimony regarding continued institutionalization versus readiness for outpatient psychosocial rehabilitation, including the development and implementation of assertive community treatment plans. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection about issues in criminal justice that will provide students with a deeper understanding of the logic influencing policy, administration, and practice issues affecting the field. 642 UNIVERSITY CATALOG PREREQUISITE This degree program builds on a broad liberal arts (general education) foundation.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES\u2014ST 651 Environmental Sciences\u2014ST (B.S.) RICARDO A. ESCOBAR, III, Program Director FACULTY Leonard R. Brand Doug Br itton H. Paul Buchheim Ronald L. Carter Benjamin L. Clausen Stephen G. Dunbar Ricardo A. Escobar, III Raul Esperante Robert Ford William K. Hayes W. William Hughes V. Leroy Leggitt Kevin E. Nick Samuel Soret Seth Wiafe The growing understanding of the relationship between human activities and Earth's degrading environment has made it essential to train students in becoming capable problem solvers on issues such as climate change, conservation, biodiversity, groundwater and soil contamination, use of natural resources, waste management, sustainable development, air pollution and noise pollution. The Department of Earth and Biological Sciences in the School of Science and Technology offers a program leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Sciences (ENVS). This program builds upon a strong interdisciplinary breadth in natural, physical and earth system (atmosphere, biosphere, geosphere and hydrosphere) sciences to understand and resolve current environmental problems. In addition, since understanding the environment has become highly dependant on advanced technology, graduates will learn to use marketable geospatial applications such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), Computer Systems Modeling (CSM), and Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Students have a choice of advanced expertise in one of the following concentration areas: conservation biology and biodiversity, environmental geology, o r health geographics. Also, students will be able to put knowledge and skills acquired in our program to use in local or global environmental internship programs. Lastly, this program will encourage students to develop critical thinking skills, healthy lifestyles, and service-oriented attitudes which are necessary to develop effective and ethical solutions to environmental problems on a local and global scale. Objectives Identify, measure, and predict local-to-global natural and human activities that degrade the environment and the consequences of these activities on biodiversity and sustainability of health c onditions for living beings Build environmental problem solvers by training them to use modern modeling and visualization tools, and show how they have been used to work out \"real-world\" environmental management problems Guide students to sharpen their oral and written communication skills to effectively present scientific findings to their peers, policy-makers, and public at large in ways that contribute to \"attainable solutions\" Allow students to participate in competitive paid internship programs that will integrate environmental concepts, skill-sets, and the career pathways preferred by students Prepare qualified students that will lead ethical, successful and rewarding careers in a wide variety of environmental fields, or to pursue higher education in pr ofessional programs and/or graduate school Learning Outcomes Develop the ability to critically evaluate the relation of science and faith within an environmental context. Demonstrate breadth and depth of knowledge of earth's environment by understanding the dynamic and interdependent nature of each of earth's component systems (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere). Obtain an understanding of the human and natural causes to some of earth's environmental problems and learn how environmental scientists combat these problems. 652 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Develop written, oral, technical, and problem solving skills necessary to collect, analyze, and share environmental data with the scientific and public communities. Develop awareness of the professional and academic opportunities in the environmental science field, as well as knowledge of current environmental science research. Admission Requirements A student in the B.S. degree in ENVS will take the first two years of general education and science courses at any accredited community college, or university, and the last two years of the ENVS curriculum at LLU. There are two options for entering the B.S. ENVS degree program at LLU. Students may elect to complete all the pre-requisite course work (95-99 quarter units) at an accredited college setting of their choice, and finish their junior and senior years at LLU's School of Science and Technology (SST). Or, Students desiring to obtain early entrance to the B.S. ENVS degree program may due so if they complete a minimum of 75 quarter units (50 semester units) at a community college of their choice and then begin coursework at LLU while concurrently taking coursework at a nearby community college in order to complete their outstanding prerequisite requirements. Admission requirements for the B.S. ENVS program are a 2.5 G.P.A. during the first two years of course work and letters of recommendation from two faculty members at the institutions previously attended. Employment opportunities Career options in the field of environmental sciences are diverse and abundant. The ENVS program prepares students for entry- level jobs in environmental sciences or GIS fields. Graduates may pursue jobs in the public sector through local, state, and federal agencies such as U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and Departments of Fish and Game. In the private sector, graduates may seek jobs in environmental consulting firms, foundations, and organizations. Some examples of career paths that environmental science graduates pursue include environmental engineering, science and social policy, and a wide variety of natural resources management fields such as soil science, forestry, agriculture, watershed science, range management, wildlife conservation, recreation resources, land management, ecology, as well as landscape architecture, conservation science, geographic information science (GIS), climatology, diverse health sciences, as well as public policy, law or planning careers. Environmental scientists may also become involved through employment or volunteering with non-profit organizations such as ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency International) and help world populations learn how to use the Earth's resources to their advantage in a sustainable manner. Because of the strong foundation in the natural and physical sciences acquired in the ENVS program, students have the option of applying into a variety of graduate programs, as well as into medical, dental, and engineering programs. Preparation for teaching Environmental internship The ENVS program offers student the opportunity to engage in \"hands-on\" application of fundamentals learned in courses by enrolling into ENVS 487.

GEOLOGY\u2014M.S. The Department of Earth and Biological Sciences in the School of Science and Technology offers the Geology Program leading to the Master of Science degree. Research and course work emphasize field and laboratory studies in sedimentology, paleontology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, paleoecology, and taphonomy. Areas of curriculum strengths include sedimentary geology, paleontology, and environmental geology. Research in paleontology may also be pursued through the M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs in biology, and the Ph.D. degree program in earth science. Program objectives The Geology Program focuses on field-oriented geology, particularly sedimentology, stratigraphy, and paleontology. The integrated core-course sequence provides students with the tools to conduct research in the subdisciplines of sedimentology, paleontology, or environmental geology. Fieldwork is emphasized because it provides a first-hand experience with geological phenomena that cannot be satisfactorily grasped or understood solely from classroom or laboratory study. Throughout the geology curriculum, students are encouraged to develop an open-minded and investigative approach in the application of the scientific method to the resolution of geologic problems. Consideration of multiple working hypotheses is encouraged. The Geology Program aims to instill in students the values of honesty, scientific integrity, careful research, and independent critical thinking, provide the tools and intellectual environment in which geologists can attain their highest potential in scholarship and research, and challenge graduate students to consider the relationships among science, faith, and societal responsibi lity Learning outcomes Able to plan and carry out independent research. Able to write and submit proposals for research grants. Obtain advanced breadth and depth of knowledge in earth science. Develop professional attitude. Develop critical evaluation skills in relating faith and science and public interest issues.

FROYLANA HEREDIA-MILLER, Program Director FACULTY (See department website for a listing of all part-time and voluntary faculty) The population explosion of older adults has generated increasing interest in the field of gerontology. Gerontology is the multidisciplinary-multidimensional st udy of aging and aging processes. It combines the study of physical, mental, social, and spiritual changes that affect individuals as they age. Emphasis is placed on the knowledge and skills required for competent practice with considerable attention given to understanding the social, cultural, and economic factors that affect services for this population. Mission The mission of the Master in Gerontology program is to provide graduate level education for future and current professionals in gerontology who are dedicated to enhancing the lives of older adults through advanced interventions at the micro, macro, and mezzo levels of practice. Program Objectives Students will demonstrate the ability to integrate human behavior and developmental theories of aging taking into consideration of a biopsychosocial-spiritual orientation to geriatric practice; Students will demonstrate the ability to use research in evaluating the effectiveness of practice and programs in achieving intended outcomes for older adults; Students will demonstrate the ability to integrate into practice an understanding of the life experiences and unique needs of older adults belonging to specific racial, ethnic, socioeconomic groups; of men and women; and of those with different sexual orientations; Students will demonstrate knowledge of professional ethics to assist older adults who have diverse cultural, spiritual, and ethnic values and beliefs; Students will demonstrate the ability to complete a comprehensive assessment of biopsychosocial-spiritual factors that affect older adults' well-being; Students will demonstrate knowledge of the policies that shape and regulate the continuum of care and services available to older adults; Students will demonstrate knowledge of the importance of the current issues in gerontology and the importance of the relationship of gerontology to other disciplines and professions, such as social work, psychology, medicine, nursing, and public health. Program description All students must complete 48 quarter units of course work. The 24 units of foundation content required for all students are followed by 12 units in one of the two concentrations: Policy, Planning, and Administration: Students opting for the policy, planning, and administration concentration gain knowledge and skills in the public administration, planning and coordination of older adult services. Students acquire an appreciation fo r the unique policy and systems structure influencing the delivery of older adult services. Within this framework students develop an understanding of the issues and challenges in creating and sustaining responsive systems of care for older adults and their families. Clinical Services: Students opting for the clinical services develop knowledge and skills in locating and providing resources, services, and opportunities for the older adults and their families; as well as acquiring knowledge that supports enhancing the problem-solving and coping skills of older adults and their caregivers. Students gain an appreciation for the social support fa ctors and community systems that create opportunities or exacerbate problems in daily living. Students develop an understanding of the issues that impact the creation of effective systems of care and responsive social policies. Both concentrations emphasize a thoughtful reflection about the mu ltidimensional issues in gerontol ogy that will provide students with a deeper understanding of policy, administration, and practice issues affecting the field. GERONTOLOGY\u2014ST 679 PREREQUISTE This degree program builds on a broad liberal arts (general education) foundation.

CANADIAN CAMPUS PROGRAM (This program is not accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Marriage and Family Therapy Education (COAMFTE), the accrediting body for the AAMFT). The Canadian campus program facilitates Canadian residents in obtaining a LLU graduate degree in Marital and Family Therapy while completing their academic work and clinical training in Canada. This program is unique in Western Canada, and functions as the only Marital & Family Therapy training available in Alberta or British Columbia. The program has graduated over 200 therapists since its first graduating class in l991. The Canadian campus program prepares graduates to function as Marital and Family Therapists in Canada, and specifically in Alberta. Graduates have also established their competence as therapists in provinces across Canada, as well as the United States. Depending on undergraduate preparation and the coursework selected, graduates of the program go on to obtain registration as psychologists in Alberta (with the College of Alberta Psychologists), or as registered social workers (with the Alberta College of Social Workers). In addition students from other n on- psychology, or non-social work academic backgrounds can be registered as counselors with the Canadian Counseling Association. Loma Linda University is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) in the United States, and the Canadian campus program is recognized by Alberta Advanced Educ ation (Private Institutions) as an approved graduate degree granting program. The Canadian campus program is officially operated by Loma Linda University, and meets WASC accreditation requirements. Applications for admission are directed thru the LLU Registrar's Office, and official acceptance, candidacy status and graduation monitored thru the University and specifically the Chair of the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences, Dr. M. Moline, and the Dean of the School of Science and Technology, Dr. B. Buckles. The Canadian campus program is an innovative venture that combines the teaching expertise of the Loma Linda University faculty, the Canadian campus program faculty and adjunct instructors from the local professional community. Specific attention is paid to the importance of Canadian content in courses such as Cross-Cultural Counseling, Child Abuse and Family Violence, and Law & Ethics to make the theoretical and practice aspects of the degree fit the Canadian context. The program emphasizes an integration of theory, practice and pe rson of the therapist. There is a Clinical Training placement f or two consecutive years while the student is also taking academic courses and a requirement for some personal therapy while a student in the program. The Clinical Training component is fulfilled two to three days per week at the student's city of residence\u2014typically, Edmonton, Calgary & Red Deer. The program has approximately twenty-five clinical sites throughout the province where students can obtain supervised clinical practice in individual, couple and family therapy. The Canadian campus is centrally located in Lacombe, Alberta (on the campus of Canadian University College) to facilitate the commuter cohort of students that travel to campus one day per week, and one week per month for classes. The Library on the campus of Canadian University College boasts one of the largest collections of Marital and Family Therapy journals and texts in the province, as well as being part of the NEOS system which connects students to all the major university libraries in Alberta . In addition students have access to the LLU California Campus Library system thru EBSCO HOST.

Our mission is to bring health, healing, wholeness, and hope to individuals, families, and communities through education, research, clinical training, and community service. The D.M.F.T. program accomplishes this by focusing on developing, evaluating, and administering intervention programs that benefit individuals, couples, families, and communities. The marriage and family therapy profession Marriage and family therapy (MFT) is a distinct mental health profession based on the premise that relationships are fundamenta l to the health and well-being of individuals, families, and communities. Marriage and Family Therapists evaluate and treat menta l and emotional disorders and other health and behavioral problems, and address a wide array of relationship issues within the context of the family and larger systems. The Federal government has designated MFT a core mental health profession along with psychiatry, psychology, social work and psychiatric nursing. Currently, 48 states support and regulate the profession by licensing or certifying marriage and family therapists. DEGREE: DOCTOR OF MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY The D.M.F.T. adopts the practitioner-administrator-evaluator approach and focuses on applied-skill development for use in clinical practice and administrative positions. The D.M.F.T. degree is a 102-unit program requiring a minimum of three to four years full time study for completion\u2014including two to three years of course work, 1000 hours direct client contact, a doctoral project, and supervised professional development experience.

This program focuses both on the structured relational patterns of communication and interaction and on the systems of meaning that define and shape these patterns. Wholeness : The program encourages wholeness by attending to the physical, mental, social, and spiritual dimensions of human experience. These dimensions reciprocally interact at every level. MARITAL AND FAMILY THERAPY\u2014ST 691 Social Forces : The program is guided by a belief that social contexts and processes influence meanings, values, and people's understandings of self, family, and others. Particular emphasis is placed on\u2014 research focusing on social forces relevant to the distinctive multicultural mix of families in the southern California region, the interrelationship between faith and family relationships throughout the world, and the effects of the changing health care system and of medical technology; as well as collaboration among education, family, work, and legal systems.

Students are encouraged to develop their therapeutic relationship and community involvement skills such that they can co-create an environment of safety, respect, compassion, openness, and community participation. Diversity : Congruent with an appreciation of the importance of social forces is an interest in and respect for the diverse experiences and perceptions of human beings.

The program seeks to create a diverse mix of students and faculty, and to challenge all who are involved to lear n from the richness of multiple perspectives. Empirical Process : The program encourages clinical work and theory development grounded in an empirical understanding of human experience. Students are offered the opportunity to develop their capacities to utilize inductive and deductive reasoning as well as objectivity, subjectivity, and intersubjectivity in therapy, program development, and evaluation. Education and Prevention : Connections at family, school, and community levels are important components of resilience. The program emphasizes helping individuals and families access their relational competencies as an important part of prevention, as well as the resolution of their current difficulties. Spirituality : This program sees spirituality as central to wholeness and healing. Students are encouraged to integrate their practices of faith with their professional work. The program places strong emphasis on active demonstration of moral and ethica l principles as exemplified by, but not limited to, Judeo-Christian teachings. Worldwide focus : The mission of the program reaches beyond the local and national community to the international community. This includes our collaboration with people from other nations and cultures to promote mutual understanding, resolve problems, and strengthen families.

Hoffman Faith McClure Frederick Newton Edward Teyber MISSION STATEMENT The mission of Loma Linda University is \"to make man whole.\" The mission, in concert with the University values of compassion, integrity, excellence, freedom, justice, purity, and humility, provide the context within which the psychology programs are conducted. The School of Science and Technology's Department of Psychology offers a combination of innovative training opportunities in clinical and experimental psychology. The Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees are offered in the area of clinical psychology and are APA accredited. The Ph.D. and M.A. degrees also are offered with emphases in a number of experimental areas. Combined-degrees Psy.D./Dr.P.H.\u2014are offered. Other combined-degrees programs\u2014Ph.D./M.A. or Psy.D./M.A. degrees in biomedical and clinical ethics\u2014are offered in coordination with the School of Religion. The Ph.D. degree in clinical psychology has been informed by the traditional scientist-practitioner model, which emphasizes training in research and clinical practice. The Psy.D. degree, influenced by the practitioner-scholar model, emphasizes trainin g in clinical practice based on the understanding and application of scientific psychological principles and research. The 710 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Psy.D./Dr.P.H. combined-degrees program combines training in psychology and health sciences to prepare individuals who will be qualified in the application of psychology to health promotion, preventive medicine, and health care; as well as for clinica l practice and research. The M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in experimental psychology are designed to train a select number of individuals for research and academic careers in basic as well as applied psychology. Applications for the Ph.D. degree in experimental psychology are accepted with concentrations in health psychology, neuroscience and neurocognition, and social/cultural psychology. See the current roster of faculty research interests for areas of specific research focus and training. The specific objectives of the APA-accredited Ph.D. degree program in clinical psychology are to train its students to be scientist-practitioners\u2014which according to the Loma Linda University Ph.D. clinical model, means that they will be given: a solid academic foundation, high-level training in the empirical methods of science so that they are capable of conducting independent and original research, and the skills to be highly competent clinicians from whom research and practice constantly inform each other. Among the outcome measures used to determine the clinical Ph.D. program's success in achieving the above-mentioned objectives are the following: 1. Academic foundations course evaluations and successful completion of the comprehensive examination. 2. Training in empirical methods of science: second-year project or master's degree thesis; a doctoral degree dissertation; presentations, publications, and grants; research and teaching assistantships; teaching positions in area colleges; and membership in scientific/professional organizations. 3. Clinical skills: ongoing clinical evaluations, the quality and type of internships obtained, and successful passing of the clinical proficiency examination. The specific objectives of the APA-accredited Psy.D. degree program are to train students to be practitioner-scholars which, according to the Loma Linda University model, means training them with: a solid academic foundation, the highest level of clinical skills, and the ability to apply research relevant to clinical issues and cases. Among the outcomes measures used to determine the Psy.D. degree program's success in achieving the above-mentioned objectives are the following: 1. Academic foundations course evaluations and the comprehensive examination. 2. Clinical skills, ongoing clinical evaluations, the quality and type of internships obtained, and the clinical proficiency examination. 3. Application of research design and methods appropriate to the doctoral project; involvement in community-based program development, evaluation, and consultation; and membership in professional organizations. The Psychology Program emphasizes research and practice based on the scientific principles and methods of psychology and related disciplines. This emphasis takes place within the context of an approach to human health and welfare that is consistent with the institutional motto, \"To Make Man Whole.\" A systematic attempt is made, through the wholeness component of the curriculum, to promote an understanding of human behavior in relation to the psychological, physical, spiritual, and social/cultural aspects of being human. In this way the Psychology Program provides, in add ition to the traditional training, a positive environment for the st udy of cultural, social, and spiritual issues relevant to psychological research and practice in contemporary American society and around the world.

Buckles Terrence J. Forrester Kimberly Freeman G. Victoria Jackson Sigrid James Viola Lindsey Froylana Miller Dianna Simon Ignatius I. Yacoub Sandy Suarez (See department Web site for a listing of all part-time and voluntary faculty.) The profession of social work centers on the improvement of the quality of life for people and the enhancement of human potential for full productive participation in society. With this philosophy at its core, the master's degree offered by the So cial Work Program in the School of Science and Technology emphasizes an ecological perspective that focuses on the interaction of a person or system in relation to his/her environment. Reflecting this stance is Loma Linda University's motto, \"To Make Man Whole\"; and its heritage as an international leader in the delivery of services in health care and related facilities. It is th e combination of these influences that has guided the development of the foundation curriculum, professional concentrations, and selection of practicum sites for the Social Work Program. Mission The mission of the Social Work Program (M.S.W. degree) at Loma Linda University is to provide graduate-level education that prepares competent, ethical, and compassionate social work professionals who possess the knowledge, values, attitudes, and skills necessary for a life dedicated to whole- person care in advanced practice and to leadership in behavioral health institu tions and agencies. Goals The goals of the Social Work Program (M.S.W. degree) are to: Provide a graduate curriculum that infuses the knowledge, ethics, values, and skills expected of professional social work practitioners.

The department assesses the liberal arts preparation of each of its applicants in two areas: o the balance of course work, in three liberal arts areas, and o specific course work considered preparatory to the program's foundation (first year) courses (see also Liberal Arts Requirements in the M.S.W. Student Handbook ). Applicants must submit a completed application--including a personal statement, application fee, all college and/or university transcripts, and at least three letters of recommendation (one from an academic source and one from a work supervisor). Applicants must meet the minimum academic and professional compatibility criteria established by the program. Applicants must have a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 or above (on a 4.0 scale) (special consideration may be given to applicants with grade-point averages as low as 2.85 if the last part of their college work shows significant SOCIAL WORK\u2014ST 733 improvement). Applicants whose cumulative grade-point average does not meet the minimum requirements stated above may receive further consideration for admission to the Social Work Program (M.S.W. degree) by providing a satisfactory GRE score, or two years of related employment and/or volunteer experiences. Work and volunteer experiences must be verified by employer/supervisor statements on official agency stationery. Further consideration will also be given to individuals who provide evidence of additional certifications and/or training that illustrate commitment to a career in social work. Anyone who is admitted to the Social Work Program with a cumulative G.P.A. below 3.0 will be admitted provisionally and will be required to participate in individualized academic assessment and a targeted learning-assistance program. Applicants must show evidence of professional compatibility, personal qualifications, and motivation to complete a graduate program by obtaining a passing score on the admissions interview with the department's Admissions Committee. Evaluation criteria for the interview include: o verbal communication skills, o critical thinking ability, o values congruent with the social word profession, o appreciation of human diversity, o evidence of reflective learning, o comportment. No academic credit is given for life experience or previous work experience for any part for the Social Work Program. Curriculum The 78-unit curriculum of the Social Work Program (M.S.W. degree) provides the mix of academic, experiential, and research experiences essential for M.S.W. degree students. Students must maintain a program grade-point average of 3.0 (or a letter grad e of B on a 4.0 scale) and meet the knowledge, skills, and professional performance competencies outlined by the program. The minimum acceptable grade for required (core) courses is a B- (2.7). Grades in selective courses must be a minimum of a C (2.0). Courses with grades falling below the standards set for required and selective courses must be repeated. Students are financial ly responsible for the cost of repeating courses in which grades obtained do not meet the minimum standards. General overview The program begins with the professional foundation content (first-year courses) common to all graduate social work education. Courses during the first year of study are divided into five professional areas: human behavior in a cross-cultural environment , social welfare policy and services, practice theory and skills, social research, and field practicum. These five areas are strengthened by the integration of social work values and ethics, as well as knowledge of special populations (i.e., issues of gender, race, class, disability, and oppression). The advanced curriculum of the program is divided into four subdivisions: 1. Conjoining curriculum and processes\u2014further integrating the foundational first year with the program's advanced curriculum; 2. Advanced curriculum nucleus\u2014includes course work common to all second-year students; 3. Core courses of the two concentrations-clinical practice and policy, planning, and administration; and 4. Culminating curriculum and processes--a capstone academic experience that facilitates the final stage of reflection and review in the development of the scholar practitioner. Each of these four curricular subdivisions articulates through the progressive presentation and integration of knowledge, pract ice roles, and intervention modes to develop the depth and breadth of proficiency expected in advanced practice within health and mental health. Program options Alternate program options have been designed to address the varying needs of students. As such, the program offers a full-time two-year option, a three-year part-time option, and a four-year part-time option. APPROVAL OF COURSE TRANSFERS AND PRACTICUM ADVANCED STANDING FOR BSW STUDENTS Students who have received a BSW degree from a CSWE accredited program within the last five years are supported in eliminating possible areas of redundancy in their education through (a) eligibility to transfer foundation course work and (b) consideration for Practicum Advanced Standing. These additional options for BSW students recognize the accomplishments in knowledge and skills that individuals receiving a baccalaureate degree from an accredited social work program possess. As such, students are not admitted into the MSW Program with pre-approval of course transfers or Practicum Advanced Standing. Instead, once students are accepted into either the full-time or one of the part-time options, those students meeting th e designated degree requirements may apply for course transfers 734 UNIVERSITY CATALOG and evaluation of their Practicum Advanced Standing. Receipt of course transfers and evaluation of practice maturity are treate d as separate processes as described below. Students should contact the department for more information. Transfer students Individuals transferring from other accredited M.S.W. degree programs may transfer units for didactic course work in accordance with University policy and program guidelines. Field practicum experiences are nontransferable. PROFESSIONAL CONCENTRATIONS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH The Social Work Program (M.S.W. degree) offers two concentrations for professional practice, which are the focus of the second-year study: clinical practice; and policy, planning, and administration. Clinical practice concentration The clinical practice concentration requires mastery of advanced practice roles, modalities of intervention, and methods used i n clinical social work. Study is required regarding the integration of advanced practice theories, diagnostic assessment, problem - solving skills and techniques; as well as the impact of policy upon the availability of treatment, treatment modalities, and expectation of outcomes. Students' experiences and knowledge are expanded through the selection of practicum sites and selectives. Policy, planning, and administration concentration The policy, planning, and administration concentration represents a specialized study designed to prepare students for administrative roles in behavioral health organizations and institutions. As such, this concentration focuses on giving student s understanding and skills in establishing and maintaining systems of care to assist individuals, families, and groups managing health and illness in context of the life cycle, promoting social change in public systems of care, policy analysis, program planning and implementation, program evaluation, and human resources management. Students' experiences and knowledge are expanded through the selection of practicum sites and selectives. CENTRAL ACADEMIC PROCESSES AND COGNATES Professional practica Professional practica experiences (field practica) are regarded as an integral part of the Social work Program (M.S.W. degree) because these offer students opportunities to integrate and apply theoretical and research knowledge with social work practice and intervention skills in institutional or agency settings. Practica are designed (and selected) to provide maximum learning opportunities under the supervision of a qualified field instructor. As such, experiences are patterned to build upon one another, presenting the increasing challenges present in the continuum of generalist to advanced social work practice. Students complete 1,080 hours of field work in a qualified setting and 120 hours of concurrent integrated seminar for a total of 1,200 hours. The emphasis of SOWK 757A,B,C Professional Foundation Prac ticum and Seminar (480 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar) is placed on achieving generalist social work knowledge, values, and skills\u2014including developing rapport with agency personnel and clients, acquiring interviewing skills, and obtaining beginning-level psychosocial assessment and intervention capabilities. The content of the concurrent seminar further supports this perspective as it provides students with opportunitie s to integrate their practicum experiences with their developing professional identity. The emphasis of SOWK 787A,B,C Advanced Professional Pr acticum and Seminar (600 hours of practicum and 60 hours of seminar) reflects students' choice of concentration and provides the depth and breadth of learning opportunities that underpin the acquisition of advanced practice capabilities. More specifically, advanced professional practica experiences are expected to promote increased insight and understanding of agency and/or client systems as these build on the professional foundation skill s achieved during the first year of study. Research The program includes completion of course work in applied research. An individually authored thesis option is available for students meeting program criteria. These study options aim to develop knowledge for the advancement of social work practice and provide guided experiences in the conduct of research applicable to a variety of professional and academic settings. Guidelines for these options are provided by the program. SOCIAL WORK\u2014ST 735 Professional processes and cognates Three academic review processes take place during the first year of the Social Work Program (M.S.W. degree). These are: 1. M.S.W. degree advancement G.P.A. The M.S.W. degree advancement G.P.A. provides an initial predictor used for gatekeeping. The first 12 units completed towards the M.S.W. degree, including units acquired during nonmatriculation, must be completed with a G.P.A. of 3.0. Students who fail to achieve at this level may be dismissed from school. Students receive orientation to the process and requirements of the M.S.W. degree advancement G.P.A. during the student orientation conducted prior to the Fall Quarter. 2. Qualifying review When all foundation course work is completed, students are required to pass the program's qualifying review. The intent of this process is to: o assist faculty and students in assessment of strengths and areas for improvement, o provide feedback, o foster an environment of self-evaluation, and o encourage heightened participation in individualized academic development. Ultimately, the results of this review help both the student and faculty to develop learning objectives for the concentration year. A specific orientation is held to explain the expectations, format, and scheduling of the qualifying review process. 3. Wholeness portfolio All students complete a wholeness portfolio during the professional practicum and seminar experience. This review of the student's individualized objectives and professional development begins during the first year of study and culminates during the second year of study as the student completes the final quarter of SOWK 787A,B,C. This experience emphasizes the student's plans for employment, life-long learning, and integration of the core values of Loma Linda University; and is seen as a capstone academic experience that facilitates closure and the final stage of reflection and review in the development of the transitioning professional.

SOCIAL WORK, CLINICAL\u2014ST 739 Social Work, Clinical\u2014ST (Ph.D.) Scheduled to begin Fall 2009 DIANNA SIMON, Program Director FACULTY See Social Work M.S.W. The School of Science and Technology's Department of Social Work and Social Ecology is an interdisciplinary academic unit committed to the University's mission of human wholeness and to the belief that one's fullest development is achieved when all aspects of an individual's life are in balance. Both conceptually and pragmatically the programs in the Department of Social Work and Social Ecology are guided by an overarching ecological (bio-psycho-social-spiritual) perspective that employs scientific methods of problem analysis and program design. A key component in this framework is the importance of considering the relationships among behavioral, sociopolitical, economic, and environmental problems. The result is an interdisciplinary teaching, learning, and practice environment designed to create interventions that will improve the functions of individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. As such, priority has been given to creating an academic milieu favorable to educating competent, ethical, and compassionate professionals and scholars who are capable of respecting and addressing the needs of diverse populations. Mission and objectives This doctoral program aims to provide social workers with advanced knowledge to become researchers, educators, and clinicians capable of applying this knowledge to every practice context in professional clinical social work. It purposefully instills a h igh appreciation for knowledge development and dissemination; and demonstrates respect and appreciation for the needs and issues inherent in human diversity, promotion of social and economic justice, and clinical populations-at-risk. Student learning objectives 1. Students will be able to apply multiple theoretical frameworks to explain intrapersonal and interpersonal factors underpinning the diagnosis and treatment of persons with severe mental illness and/or serious emotional disorders. 2. Students will demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the assessment process and diagnostic schemata involving intrapersonal and interpersonal factors, cultural diversity, and environmental influences on client systems and treatment. 3. Students will be able to demonstrate the use theory to develop research questions and hypotheses for empirical testing and will possess an understanding of the conceptual nature of theory and the ways theory can be applied to the development of knowledge in clinical social work. 4. Students will be able to articulate the implications of empirical research findings within a theoretical framework, as well as the ability to discuss the implications of empirical research findings on theoretical relationships. 5. Students will demonstrate the ability to design and conduct a systematic, empirical, objective, public, and critical investigation of a clinical practice issue or problem. 6. Students will demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of how people learn and be able to translate this understanding into constructing and delivering appropriate didactic, interactive and experiential teaching strategies used to teach advanced clinical practice and human behavior concepts. 7. Students will demonstrate current knowledge of the context of social work education (knowledge, values, and skills), and be able to articulate this information into an educational program design, curriculum development, and the delineation and assessment of student educational objectives for both undergraduate and graduate social work programs. Admission requirements The Clinical Social Work Program is open to students who demonstrate leadership and scholarly potential. Admission to the program is governed by the policies and procedures established by the School of Science and Technology.

SPANISH STUDIES FOR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS\u2014ST 743 Spanish Studies for Health Care Professionals\u2014 ST (Certificate) CLARA RAMIREZ, Program Director Graduates of Loma Linda University have a long history of service, domestically and around the world. The purpose of this certificate program is to provide general education that articulates with community service, mission electives, or short missio n trips in the United States and international settings. The certificate is consistent with WASC recommendations that baccalaurea te programs actively foster an understanding of diversity and ensure breadth for all students in the areas of cultural, aesthetic, social, political, scientific, and technical knowledge expected of educated persons in this society. Course work in the cultural studies certificate enables the student to engage the population served at a deeper level than possible without skills in language and knowledge of Hispanic history, literature, and society. The theoretical, structured course in service learning provides a philosophical and theological basis for service, as well as an opportunity to reflect on and integrate the various components. The 27-unit certificate is available only to students who are concurrently enrolled in a degree program of the University or to those who complete a minimum of 17 of the required 27-quarter units at Loma Linda University. For undergraduate students, the courses also contribute to meeting GE requirements. Courses include language (12 units); literature, history and social science s (4 units); diversity (4 units); and a service-learning course. For the certificate in Spanish studies, an immersion language and c ulture program is required, as well as an international or national service project with a Spanish-speaking population. The Christian-service course units are the two bookends of the certificate. The first units include a theoretical, theological, and philosoph ical basis for service and provides the outline for the portfolio. In the second unit, the student completes the portfolio that inte grates and summarizes the entire experience. Spanish-language proficiency at the high-elementary or low-intermediate level is required and will be assessed by examination. All courses except the capstone portfolio course are currently available on campus. For students concurrently enrolled in a Lom a Linda University program, all courses may be transferred in except for RELR 404 Christian Service and RELE 429 Cultural Issues in Religion. Spanish language, Spanish literature and history, and diversity courses must be taken for a letter grade, w ith a minimum G.P.A. of 2.0 for the certificate. The certificate integrates the three core values of Loma Linda University to promote spiritual life and wholeness, diversity, a nd community service and global outreach. These three values are essential to the Loma Linda University experience.

Anthony J. Zuccarelli Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies 748 UNIVERSITY CATALOG Foundations of Graduate Study Recognizing the need to provide advanced education, the College of Medical Evangelists (CME) organized its School of Graduate Studies in 1954. The new school conferred a Ph.D. degree in 1958, the first Ph.D. to be awarded by a Seventh-day institution of higher education. In 1961 when CME became Loma Linda University, the University assumed oversight of the graduate education conducted by La Sierra College in Riverside, California. By 1963 the School of Graduate Studies had been renamed the Graduate School, with a home in a new building, named Frederick Griggs Hall, in honor of a former department chair. The two campuses comprising Loma Linda University\u2014La Sierra and Loma Linda\u2014were separated in 1990. In 2005 the Graduate School was restructured as the Faculty of Graduate Studies. It continues to provide oversight of graduate programs, supported by other schools of the University; promotes and encourages independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication; and relates intellectual achievements to the service of mankind. Philosophy In the Faculty of Graduate Studies of Loma Linda University, the essential concern of both faculty and students is the quest fo r meaning. Because this quest is served by knowledge, graduate students are obliged to achieve both broad and detailed mastery of their field of study. They also participate with the faculty in the process by which knowledge is augmented. Objectives The Faculty of Graduate Studies attempts to create an environment favorable to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning by: 1. Making available to graduate students who wish to study in a Seventh-day Adventist Christian setting the education necessary for scholarly careers in the sciences and the health professions. 2. Encouraging development of independent judgment, mastery of research techniques, and contribution to scholarly communication. 3. Relating intellectual achievement to the service of mankind.

MARY E. MOLINE, Ph.D., Dr.P.H., Program Director NAOMI MODESTE, Dr.P.H., Program Director DEPARTMENTS The M.S. in Marital and Family Therapy is housed in the Department of Counseling and Family Sciences along with masters degree programs in child life, counseling, family studies and doctoral programs in family studies and marital and family therapy. The public health masters is housed in the school of public health. THE COMBINED-DEGREES PROGRAMS OF THE UNIVERSITY 765 DUAL DEGREE The Master in Public Health Education Degree Program and the Marital and Family Therapy M.S. Degree Program have many subject areas in common, specifically, the emphasis on the systems' approach to solving health and family problems. The area of prevention is also strongly emphasized in both degrees with substance abuse, eating disorders, sexuality, mental and physical health being emphasized by both programs. The motto of the health science university \"To Make Man Whole\" can be greatly facilitated by the goals contained in the motto of the Counseling and Family Sciences Department's MFAM program \"To Make Family Whole.\" It is proposed that the joining of the two degree programs in a Family Health Track will provide the student with the Christian counseling and health education skills needed to solve many of the world's physical and mental health problems. The MFAM major will also provide the option of a clinical license that will allow the student with the MS/MPH degree Family Health Track to open up a private practice to increase their ability to provide services to the community. The MPH in Health Promotion and Education is a 60-unit degree pr ogram for health professionals. The M.S. degree in MFAM is a 78-unit degree. Jointly there is a 16-unit crossover between the two degree programs plus a sharing of field or clinical trai ning. Therefore, the total units needed to complete the joint MPH/MS degree programs would be units or approximately nine quarters of full time study. The joint degree program contains sufficient HPRO courses to qualify the graduate to sit for the examinatio n for credentialing in health education. It also contains 66 units of MFAM courses which prepares the student didactically for th e State License as a Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT). Admission Applicants must be admitted to both degrees separately but stating their goal is the dual degree. If an applicants begins their program with an emphasis in public health please see advisement from the director. If an applican t begins their program with marital and family coursework please see the director of that program. See the bulletin for admission requirements to both programs. The requirements are specific to each program. Objectives The joint program in public health education and marital and family therapy is intended: 1. to produce skilled professionals in public health education and marital and family therapy in Family Health Track. 2. to expose the student to the currently available content material in the fields of public health education and marital and family therapy. 3. to provide for supervised field and clinical training that will give the student the opportunity to apply and integrate theoretical knowledge toward the development of health education, clinical skills and competencies. 4. to provide activities for the student to develop personal maturity as a professional who identifies with the preventive and curative aspects of health education and marital and family therapy. This dual degree (M.P.H./M.S.) will provide a basis for doctoral work in mental and public health and superior students will be encouraged to explore possibilities for further graduate studies.

Maternal and Child Health\u2014PH with Social Work\u2014ST M.P.H./M.S.W. This program is closed to new admissions for 2007-2008. The combined-degrees program in social work and public health reaffirms the heritage of these two professions working together. Simultaneously it addresses the requisite knowledge and skills increasingly needed by professionals working in maternal and child health in low-income communities. As such, the curricula of the M.P.H. degree and M.S.W. degree in maternal and child health have been merged to offer a combined-degrees program with both depth and breadth to address the myriad of intervention and community issues affecting this population. Combined-degrees students must meet all the requirements of each of the participating programs. If completed separately, the M.P.H. degree is 58 units and the M.S.W. degree is 78 units\u2014for a total of 130 units. In this combined-degrees option, 24 units of the 130 units are counted by both the M.S.W. and M.P.H. degrees programs; this reciprocity reduces the total number of units required. Interested students should obtain from the department a curriculum plan showing the integration of the M.P.H. degree and M.S.W. degree programs. Medical Scientist\u2014SM (M.D. with Ph.D.) The program is designed to attract students who are energized by doing research and want to contribute substantially to this enterprise. Students enter this combined-degrees program through the graduate program. In the first year, students participate in a new and revised scientifically integrated program that includes biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, pharmacology, and anatomy. While in the first year, students also rotate through the laboratories of selected faculty members. In the second year, students increase their involvement with individual laboratory projects while continuing to complete gradua te course requirements. Students in selected areas may also be asked to serve as teaching assistants for graduate or medical class es. Students pursuing the combined degrees will also be involved with joint basic science and clinical meetings and conferences wit h the aim of understanding the interrelationships between laboratory-based and clinical research. Upon demonstration of laboratory success, as indicated by completion of a first-author manuscript, the student will continue on to the traditional first two years of the medical school curriculum. It is anticipated that the amount of time required to demonst rate 774 UNIVERSITY CATALOG laboratory success will be two-to-three years. Successful students who have acquired essential laboratory skills should continu e their affiliation with the host laboratory and continue research progress as time permits while in the medical school curriculu m. Upon successful completion of the first two years of the medical curriculum and Step 1 of the USMLE examination, students will begin a series of rotations between the clinical sciences and the research laboratory. During these later years, students will complete all the standard clinical rotations and continue progress on laboratory projects. It is the intent of this program tha t students will acquire the requisite skills needed for a successful career at the interface of laboratory-based and clinical res earch. Program admission Admission into the Medical Scientist Program is competitive and requires evidence that the student is likely to develop into a successful medical scientist. The student must submit separate applications to the School of Medicine for both the M.D. and the Ph.D. degree programs, and meet the stated admissions requirements for each of these programs. The application package for the Ph.D. degree program requires scores for the general test of the Graduate Record Examination. Both programs must accept the scores before the student is admitted to the Medical Scientist Program. Students entering the M.D./Ph.D. combined-degrees program who determine that a research career is inappropriate may elect to complete the M.D. degree program independently. Students entering the Ph.D. degree program who desire a career in academic medicine may choose to apply for admission to the M.D./Ph.D. combined-degrees program at a point after their entry into the Ph.D. degree program; however, the standard medical school-application process will be required at that point.
