Physicians practice in diverse settings including small private practice, group practice, managed care systems, clinic, hospital, laboratory, industry, military, academic medicine, or government. Medicine offers diverse career options and physicians often practice in two or more settings. MD and DO programs require four years of medical education followed by residency training of three to eight years. Residency programs (graduate medical education) in family practice, general internal medicine, and pediatrics take three years to complete; general surgery requires five years and subspecialty training in fields like plastic or neurological surgery may require an additional two to three years. Medical Doctor (MD or DO) Physicians diagnose and treat injuries or illnesses. They examine patients, take medical histories, prescribe medications, and order, perform, and interpret diagnostic tests. They counsel patients on diet, hygiene, and preventative healthcare. Physicians may work as general practitioners or choose to specialize in any number of over 120 specialties and sub-specialties. There are two types of medical degrees. Allopathic medical schools grant the M.D. degree and Osteopathic medical schools grant the D.O. degree. The basic training at allopathic and osteopathic schools is essentially identical. The primary difference is that osteopathic medical schools and physicians take a more \"holistic\" approach to the practice of medicine. In addition to using all forms of standard medical treatment, D.O.'s are trained to use osteopathic manipulative treatment to help diagnose injury and illness, alleviate pain, and promote a person's well-being. They work in partnership with each person to promote health on physical, emotional, and spiritual levels. 1 in 5 medical students in the United States attends an osteopathic medical school. Upon full implementation in July 2020, graduates of all osteopathic and allopathic medical schools will be allowed to complete their residency and/or fellowship education in programs accredited by the same agency. MD-PhD The Doctorate of Medicine and of Philosophy (MD-PhD) is a dual doctoral degree for physician-scientists. MD-PhD candidates pursue this education to gain in-depth training in modern biomedical research and clinical medicine. The PhD may be awarded in a variety of disciplines within the biomedical sciences, as well as social and behavioral sciences, epidemiology, and public health to name a few. This dual career offers opportunities to work directly with patients, but also to impact large groups of people by advancing medical knowledge and developing new treatments. Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) Podiatrists are Doctors of Podiatric Medicine (DPM), also known as podiatric physicians or surgeons. Podiatrists diagnose and treat conditions of the foot, ankle, and related structures of the leg. They complete four years of training in a podiatric medical school and three years of hospital residency training. Podiatrists can specialize in many fields, including surgery, sports medicine, wound care, biomechanics, geriatrics, orthopedics, pediatrics, and diabetic care. Podiatric physicians are licensed in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to treat the foot and its related or governing structures. State licensing requirements generally include graduation from one of the nine accredited schools and colleges of podiatric medicine, passage of the National Board exams, postgraduate training and written and oral examinations. Doctor of Chiropratic (DC) Chiropractors care for patients with health problems of the neuromusculoskeletal system, which includes nerves, bones, muscles, ligaments, and tendons. They use spinal adjustments and manipulation, as well as other clinical interventions, to manage patients' health concerns, such as back and neck pain. In addition to operating a general chiropractic practice, some chiropractors specialize in areas such as sports, neurology, orthopedics, pediatrics, or nutrition, among others. Chiropractors in private practice are responsible for marketing their businesses, hiring staff, and keeping records. Chiropractors must earn a Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree and a state license. Doctor of Chiropractic programs typically take 4 years to complete and require at least 3 years of undergraduate college education for admission. Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine (ND) Naturopathic physicians are clinically trained primary care physicians who have graduated from a four-year naturopathic medical school. They work with patients in all aspects of family health to identify the underlying causes of disease and provide evidence informed therapies to help facilitate the body's ability to restore and maintain optimal health. Naturopathic medicine is a distinct system of primary health care that concentrates on whole-patient wellness while emphasizing prevention and the process of self-healing through the use of natural therapies. Naturopathic medicine attempts to find the underlying cause of the patient's condition rather than focusing solely on symptomatic treatment. "}
