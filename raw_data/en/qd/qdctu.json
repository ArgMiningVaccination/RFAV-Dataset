A study in 2004 showed that 55.6% of the population in Malaysia used traditional medicine within a 12 month period of the study1. However, the knowledge and skills possessed by practitioners differ from each other as it is mostly passed down from one generation to the next. As a result, the services provided to the public are non-standardised and this has affected the confidence of the public regarding T&CM. As such, there is a need for formal education in T&CM to ensure the quality and safety of T&CM delivered to the public. The T&CM Division, as a regulatory agency in the Ministry of Health, plays a role in providing technical support in the development of T&CM academic and skills programmes. With reference to the Malaysian Qualifications Framework (MQF) [Figure1], two pathways have been identified in developing T&CM programmes, namely skills training and higher education (academic pathway). Development of T&CM Higher Education in Malaysia As shown in Figure 2 for the development of programmes through the academic pathway, 12 standards for diploma (5) and degree (7) level programmes in T&CM have been developed in collaboration with the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA). A number of these programmes have been offered by local private higher education institutions (PHEIs) [Figure 3]. Development of Skills Training in Malaysia For development of T&CM programmes through the skills pathway, the T&CM Division has collaborated with the Department of Skills Development (DSD) in developing related National Occupational Skills Standards (NOSS). NOSS is a document that outlines the skills needed by skilled workers who are working in Malaysia for a particular sector, (the level of employment) and the path to achieve these skills. Up to 2014, 16 NOSS for 10 T&CM modalities have been developed. The Malaysian Skills Certificate (MSC), will be awarded to those who are qualified. MSC may be awarded via three routes, namely: - Training in accredited centres Accredited centres refer to the skills training providers which have been approved by the DSD to manage skills training and offer Malaysian Skills Certification for certain sectors and skill levels according to NOSS. - Industry oriented training Through apprenticeship training in the National Dual Training System (SLDN) conducted in industrial and skills training institutes. - Accreditation of prior achievement A candidate qualifies for MSC based on past experience (work or training) without the need for examination. However, candidates are required to submit evidence of the skills that have been acquired to be reviewed by officers appointed by the DSD. Recognition of foreign higher education institutions Up to May 2015, traditional Chinese medicine undergraduate programmes offered by the following five (5) universities from the People's Republic of China are recognised by the Public Service Department (PSD) of Malaysia: - Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (BUCM) - Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (NUCM) - Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SHUTCM) - Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TUTCM) - Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (GUCM) Malaysian Qualifications Framework: Qualifications and Levels | | MQF Levels | | Sectors | | Lifelong Learning | | Skills | | Vocational and Technical | | Higher Education | | 8 | | | | Doctoral Degree | | Accreditation of Prior Experiential Learning (APEL) | | 7 | | Masters Degree | | Postgraduate Certificate & Diploma | | 6 | | Bachelors Degree | | Graduate Certificate & Diploma | | 5 | | Advanced Diploma | | Advanced Diploma | | Advanced Diploma | | 4 | | Diploma | | Diploma | | Diploma | | 3 | | Skills Certificate 3 | | Vocational and Technical Certificate | | Certificate | | 2 | | Skills Certificate 2 | | | | 1 | | Skills Certificate 1 Figure 1: There are 8 levels of qualifications and 3 sectors (pathways) identified in the Malaysian Qualification Framework (MQF), supported by lifelong learning, in the development of education programmes in Malaysia. |Bachelor Degree Programmes||Diploma Programmes| | || | Figure 2: Programme standards: traditional and complementary medicine was published by MQA and consists of programme standard of 7 degree programmes and 5 diploma programmes. |No.|| | Institutions | | Name of Programmes |1.||Southern University College||Bachelor Degree of Traditional Chinese Medicine 3+2| |University Foundation for Degree Program (Traditional Chinese Medicine)| |2.||Tunku Abdul Rahman University||Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Hons)| |3.||INTI International University||Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Hons)| |4.||Cyberjaya University College of Medical Sciences||Bachelor of Homeopathic Medical Science (Hons)| |Diploma in Islamic Medical Practice| |5.||Management and Science University||Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Hons)| |Diploma in Traditional Chinese |6.||International Medical (Hons) Management||Diploma in Natural Medicine| |8.||Lincoln University College||Diploma in Traditional Chinese Medicine| Figure 3: T&CM Programmes offered by 8 local PHEIs.
