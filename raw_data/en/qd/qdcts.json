Describe how pl ants are used to improve human health and nutrition 2. Describe the regulatory environment under which medicinal and dietary s upplements are marketed , sold and/or prescribed in the USA 3. Recognize the bioactive compounds in plants that are responsible for the medicinal activity and/or provid e nutritional benefits to human 4. Recognize that plants , which contain bioactive medicinal compounds, ma y also have associated toxicity 11:776:438 Course Syllabus 5. Describe the process by which plants and their natural plant products need to be assessed for efficacy and safety Each Plant Biology Undergraduate Program Goal is satisfied by each course learning goal. ASSIGNMENTS/RESPONSIBILITIES AND ASSESSMENT Grading : In general , students will lead class discussions . Grading is based on th e accumulated grades of each homework assignment, research report and presentation, class presentation s, attendance, and participation. Weekly assignments and presentations are worth 7 0% of grade; f inal research paper and presentation are 30% of grade. Attendance is required. Grades will are calculated on the following scale: A = 90 -100%; B+ = 60 -69%; F = <60%. Homework : At the beginning of the semester, students will read and critique both popular articles and movies/films and share a critical analyses both in class and via a written report(s). Research reports : Each week students will be assigned to read, review , and critique scientific and/or popular article s relating to plants and human health. Research project : The class will be divided into two groups and assigned two topical research areas. Each student will be required to participate in the larger group project in a specific role. Learning goals as sessment : Assessment of each of the five goals will be accomplished by reviewing the student's presentations, papers/research report and project, which incorporates an understanding of each goal. As grading is based upon the accumulated grades of each ho mework assignment, research report and presentation, class presentations, attendance and participation, our ability to assess whether the students reached the goals of the class is reflected in their performance of the class assignments. The assignments s pecifically call for students to address the way plants are used to improve health and nutrition, what is the regulatory environment in the USA under DHEA regulations, to identify selected array of bioactive compounds in the plants they review, to identify any toxic compounds in the plants that they review and in the class projects they are tasked to describe the process by which plant and their natural products are assessed for efficacy and safety. Comments from the instructor on assignments handed in by the students will also address the students understanding of these goals over the course of the semester. The percentage score on these assessments will determine the level of mastery: >90% unsatisfact ory. PARTICIPATION GRADE AND ABSENCE POLICY Attendance is mandatory. Lack of attendance will lower your grade. Active class participation and contribution to class discussion may, in special circumstances, increase your grade. Laptops are welcome for note taking, but Internet surfing is not permitted.

ACCOMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES Please follow the procedures outlined at https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/registration -form . Full policies and procedures are at https://ods.rutgers.edu/ ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The university's policy on Academic Integrity is available at http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu The principles of academic integrity require that a student: Properly acknowledge and cite all use of t he ideas, results, or words of others. Properly acknowledge all contributors to a given piece of work. Make sure that all work submitted as his or her own in a course or other academic activity is produced without the aid of impermissible materials or impe rmissible collaboration. Obtain all data or results by ethical means and report them accurately without suppressing any results inconsistent with his or her interpretation or conclusions. Treat all other students in an ethical manner, respecting their inte grity and right to pursue their educational goals without interference. This requires that a student neither facilitate academic dishonesty by others nor obstruct their academic progress. Uphold the canons of the ethical or professional code of the profes sion for which he or she is preparing. Adherence to these principles is necessary in order to ensure that : Everyone is given proper credit for his or her ideas, words, results, and other scholarly accomplishments. All student work is fairly evaluated and no student has an inappropriate advantage over others. The academic and ethical development of all students is fostered. The reputation of the University for integrity in its teaching, research, and scholarship is maintained and enhanced. Failure to uphol d these principles of academic integrity threatens both the reputation of the University and the value of the degrees awarded to its students. Every member of the University community therefore bears a responsibility for ensuring that the highest standards of academic integrity are upheld.
