The Army Medical Home is designed around one core principle: putting patients first. The Army Medical Home is Army Medicine's gateway to influence the \"life space\" where patients make decisions on the key determinants of health and wellness-sleep, activity, and nutrition (that is, the Performance Triad). Each patient will partner with a team of healthcare providers - physicians, nurses, behavioral health, clinical pharmacists, physical therapy, and case management professionals to develop a comprehensive, personal healthcare plan. This team will form a partnership with you to provide improved access, coordinate needed services, answer your questions, and ensure that you get the care you need. Your Medical Home team will remain the same as long as they continue to work within your medical home. This will improve your continuity of care and allow you to develop a closer partnership with your team. The Army Medical Home model has been shown to improve patients' overall health, resulting in fewer emergency and urgent care visits decreased hospital admissions, shorter inpatient stays, and fewer inpatient readmissions among other positive results. To transition from a \"healthcare system\" to a System for Health, moving away from episodic care to a standardized, long-term model that achieves optimal health outcomes. The Army Medical Home model will facilitate the transformation to a System for Health and be the primary care means for providing patient-centered comprehensive care to patients. The desired end state is for all patients to receive coordinated, comprehensive care guided by the Army Medical Home. The key to this coordination is improved communication using face-to-face and technological methods such as [MHS GENESIS Patient Portal](https://patientportal.mhsgenesis.health.mil/) and the [Nurse Advice Line](https://tricare.mil/ContactUs/CallUs/NAL.aspx), strengthened by a firm patient-provider relationship.

[62nd Med](/Clinics/Winder-Family-Medicine-Clinic/Winder-Clinic-Unit-Specific-Instructions-for-care-and-medical-readiness) 42nd MP 16 CAB 1st SFG History The Winder Family Medical Clinic is named after Sgt. 1st Class Nathan L. Winder, a Special Forces medic assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne), Fort Lewis, Washington, who died from wounds sustained while conducting combat operations in Iraq, assisting another U.S. Army element as a member of a U.S. Special Forces Quick Reaction Force. On June 26, 2007, his unit responded to a call for help by a military police unit under heavy attack in the city of Diwaniyah. As his Quick Reaction Force linked up with the military police unit under fire, it was discovered the insurgents were producing effective fire from a window in a two-story house hundreds of yards from their position. Sgt. 1st Class Winder remained in the gunner's box of his vehicle as members of the Quick Reaction Force maneuvered towards the objective. Small arms fire took the life of Sgt. 1st Class Winder as he continued his fire support. Sgt. 1st Class Winder was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Meritorious Service Medal, Iraqi Campaign Medal, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge. On July 27, 2011, a formal ribbon-cutting ceremony was held opening the brand new multi-million dollar, a state-of-the-art family medical clinic with Winder's widow, Mechelle in attendance. As part of the dedication of the new clinic honoring Sgt. 1st Class Winder, the ceremony also included the rededication of the Col. Kenneth P. Fulton Dental Clinic that is part of the new facility. Dr. Fulton was a pioneer in military dentistry. He died in 1977. The Winder Family Medical & Fulton Dental Clinics encompasses 45,000 square feet of space comprising of 39 primary care exam and 28 dental treatment rooms. The new clinics' building has been certified by the Leadership Energy and Environmental Design as a \"Gold\" standard building and is the first Army Medicine facility to achieve that rating. "}
