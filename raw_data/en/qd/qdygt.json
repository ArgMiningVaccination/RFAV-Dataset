By removing impurities from the blood in the liver, where toxins are processed for elimination as well as through the kidneys, intestines, lungs, lymph and skin. There are various detox programs that help the body's natural cleaning process, such as resting the organs through fasting; stimulating the liver to drive toxins from the body; promoting elimination through the intestines, kidneys and skin; improving circulation of the blood; and refueling the body with healthy nutrients. Homeopathy offers excellent support in the detoxing process, as the remedies used stimulate the body's own natural elimination. The Homeopathic approach believes that the vital force can be disturbed by stress, chronic illness, environmental toxins, poor diet or consumption of chemicals in food or drugs. Homeopathic remedies reinforce the body's natural ability to remove toxins and waste by-products, without harmful side effects. Homeopathy differs from other herbal treatments because of the nature of the Homeopathic methodology. All ingredients are used in minuscule amounts, because the fundamental value of the remedies in Homeopathy is based on the low dosage and the individual symptoms or systems to be treated. The great thing about Homeopathic support in a detox program is that it not only aids in releasing the toxins into the blood stream thus removing blockage, but also enables the vital force to prepare the body for a return to health. On top of this it allows for the rebuilding and strengthening of the immune system and can be incorporated with other regimens without any conflict. The remedies are also capable of promoting healing of damaged systems and restoration of proper functioning to sluggish or overactive systems, enabling the body to a state of balance and health. How the remedies are selected for detoxing can be broadly divided into constitutional and organ specific. In constitutional prescribing the whole body is considered, and a tailor made remedy is selected after extensive case taking. This constitutional remedy alone may be all that is required to bring about the body's innate ability to heal, repair, cleanse and restore. Other times there may be cause to further prescribe specific remedies to target individual organs or supporting systems. Here are a couple of examples of organ specific remedies that are commonly prescribed in a detox program. Berberis Vulgaris- an excellent remedy to achieve combined kidney and liver drainage and detoxification. Chelidonium- for gall bladder and liver drainage or inflammation of the liver, especially as a result of rich foods, alcohol and drug/artificial medicines abuse. Phytolacca- for drainage of the lymphatic system especially in the case of glandular swelling during and after illness; benign breast lumps; Calendula- for skin drainage; to enhance the healing of many chronic skin disorders including spots and pimples, acne, eczema, psoriasis and dermatitis. Phosphorus- to encourage drainage of the pancreas and improve sugar regulation disorders. Spongia or Lobelia Inflata- for lung drainage especially whilst using an asthma inhaler; beneficial for smokers or ex-smokers; helpful during and after any lung disorder. Thlaspi Bursa- for drainage of the uterus and urinary/bladder disorders including fibroids, endometriosis, menstrual disorders and infertility, and incontinence. Nux Vomica- general detox remedy especially after over-indulgence in stimulants, rich foods, coffee, cigarettes and alcohol. An excellent hangover remedy!
