The oldest tradition in ritual bathing uses special herbs to impart certain essences conducive to love-getting, money-drawing, protection from evil, or the removal of curses. This method of preparation is generally to steep the herbs in boiling water, strain the mixture & let the liquid cool. Then simply add the cooled liquid to your bath water. Immerse yourself in the water, taking deep breaths and focusing on your intention to release negative energy and purify your aura. You may also choose to meditate or perform a visualization exercise to reinforce the power of the bath. After your bath, rinse yourself with cool water and allow yourself to air dry. You may also choose to anoint yourself with a protective oil to help seal in the positive energy and protect yourself from future negative influences. "}
