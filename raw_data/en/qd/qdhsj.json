The utilization of traditional Chinese medicine among breast cancer patients at various stages has not been examined. This study aims to compare the intention of utilization and experience toward traditional Chinese medicine among early- and late-stage breast cancer patients. Method This qualitative research collected data from breast cancer patients through focus groups interview by convenience sampling. Conducted in 2 branches of Taipei City Hospital, a public hospital managed by the Taipei City government. Breast cancer patients>20 years old and had used TCM for breast cancer therapy for at least three months were included in the interview. A semi-structured interview guide was adopted in each focus group interview. In the following data analysis, stages I and II were considered early-stage, and stages III and IV were late-stage. For analyzing the data and reporting the results, we used qualitative content analysis as the approach for data analysis, assisted by NVivo 12. Categories and subcategories were identi\u0000ed through content analysis. Results 12 and 7 early- and late-stage breast cancer patients were included in this study, respectively. The side effects were the main intention of utilizing traditional Chinese medicine. Improving side effects and constitution was the main bene\u0000t for patients in both stages. Early-stage breast cancer patients used traditional Chinese medicine to prevent recurrence or metastasis. Late-stage breast cancer patients responded more frequently to using traditional Chinese medicine due to the side effects of western medicine. However, some of their symptoms were not fully relieved. Conclusions Breast cancer staging may in\u0000uence the intention and utilization of traditional Chinese medicine. Health policymakers should consider the results of this research and the evidence-based illustrations to establish guidelines for integrating traditional Chinese medicine among various stages of breast cancer to improve the outcome and quality of care for cancer patients. Introduction Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020.[1] In Taiwan, cancer has been the main cause of death for over 40 years.[2] In 2019, the incidence rate ofPage 3/20colorectal and breast cancer were the highest among males and females, respectively, in Taiwan.[3] In 2021, lung cancer was the leading cause of death among the various types of cancer, followed by liver, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer.[4] After diagnosis, cancer patients might use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to improve their quality of life, anxiety, and chronic pain because of psychosocial stress.[5] Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is the type of CAM mostly used in Taiwan.[6] TCM is widely used because of the ancient Chinese culture and because it is an important medical approach in Taiwan.[7] All Taiwanese citizens are mandated to join the National Health Insurance, a single-payer system for healthcare implemented in 1995.[7, 8] Its coverage rate in recent years is more than 99%.[8, 9] Under the National Health Insurance, Western medicine (WM) and TCM were included in the program.[7, 8, 10] People can choose WM, TCM, or both because of the accessibility and affordability of the healthcare system.[7-10] Cancer patients in Taiwan usually combine conventional medicine with TCM.[11] Studies have shown that TCM is most commonly used by patients with breast cancer (BCP);[12] 81.5% of BCP will use TCM at least once after diagnosis, and 95.8% of TCM users used WM simultaneously.[13] However, according to research about the mental health of cancer patients, early- and late-stage patients have different degrees of depressive symptoms[14]. Patients with more advanced cancer stages were more likely to use Chinese medicine after diagnosis.[15] Besides, the effects of TCM care for cancer patients at different stages, including prognosis and survival time, vary.[16-19] Therefore, because of the various stages of cancer, the intention of TCM utilization and experience may differ. There is a lack of studies exploring the intention of utilization and experience toward TCM among early- and late-stage cancer patients. Breast cancer has a high incidence rate, and BCPs tend to use TCM.[3, 4, 12, 20] This study compares the intention of TCM utilization and the experience of early- and late-stage BCPs. Method Design To explore the intention and experience of early- and late-stage BCPs toward TCM, we adopted a qualitative research method. We collected and analyzed interview data regarding the participants' perspectives from March to June 2021 by audio recording and analyzed the data after transcribing them verbatim. This study conducted focus group interviews for BCPs to understand the comparison between early- and late-stage breast cancer. In this study, stages I and II were considered early-stage, and stages III and IV were late-stage, based on the de\u0000nition of the National Breast Cancer Foundation[21] and several studies.[22, 23] Participants And Setting Nineteen BCPs participated in this study. In the focus group interviews, there were 3 to 5 participants in \u0000ve focus groups, regarded as mini focus groups. With the interviewer's guidance, the participants can provide more in-depth perspectives in a mini focus group.[24] Patients>20 years old, diagnosed withPage 4/20breast cancer, and had used TCM for breast cancer therapy for at least three months were included in the interview. Before the interview, the investigator informed the participants of their rights and that they could withdraw from the study anytime for any reason. The code numbers were applied instead of their names to maintain anonymity. The participants who agreed to the study signed an informed consent form. Data Collection For breast cancer, the participants were recruited by convenience sampling to collect the data. After recruiting, BCPs were interviewed through several focus groups. We used a semi-structured guide with open-ended questions to collect data. The interview guide included six open-ended questions developed from the literature (See the Appendix). The participants were recruited and interviewed in the Ren-ai Branch and Linsen Chinese Medicine and Kunming Branch of Taipei City Hospital, a public hospital with 4,700 beds in seven branches managed by the Taipei city government.[25] The data were collected until saturation was reached. The interviews were recorded by the audio recorder and transcribed into texts in traditional Chinese. Data analysis After the interviews, the meaning unit of this study was found by listening to the audio record repeatedly and browsing the transcript verbatim followed by coding in accordance with the study's objective after carefully understanding the texts.[26] The data were analyzed through a conventional content analysis approach, which included driving the original codes after repeatedly reading the texts and inducting or deducting them into subcategories, categories, and themes.[27-29] We applied computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software\u2014Nvivo 12\u2014 to assist the organization and classi\u0000cation of data analysis and improve its e\u0000ciency.[30] To elevate the rigor of the qualitative study, triangulation, and peer review were conducted in the research. We also collected adequate data and increased the credibility, dependability, con\u0000rmability, and transferability through the thick description and maximum variation. [30-32] Results Participants' characteristics Twenty-one BCPs were recruited for focus group interviews, but two were absent. Therefore, 12 and 7 BCPs in the early and late stages completed the interviews. The age of the participants ranged from 43 to 71 (mean=55.42\u00b17.11) years. The mean time since cancer diagnosis was 3.92\u00b12.53 years (Table 1). In the following text, the codes starting with 'E' or 'A' refer to BCPs with early or late stages, respectively.Page 5/20Table 1 Statistics on the information of breast cancer patients participants Characteristic No. (SD) Mean age 55.42(\u00b17.11) Time since diagnosed(year) 3.92(\u00b12.53) Stage Early stage I 7 II 5 Late stage III 1 IV 6 The class of hospital for TCM consulted Regional 2 District 17 The Intention Of Tcm Utilization For Bcp BCPs were in\u0000uenced by their feelings about diagnosis and multiple reasons for attempting TCM. According to data analysis, this theme contains two categories, including the mental state of BCPs after cancer diagnosis and the factors in\u0000uencing BCPs to use TCM (Table 2). Mental state of BCPs after cancer diagnosis BCPs were shocked after diagnosis. Whether early or late-stage, most BCPs faced negative mental stress after a cancer diagnosis. Some BCPs could not accept the diagnosis and might be depressed, shocked, or upset. \"At that time, it was really very upsetting, I couldn't accept it, why did I get cancer?\" (E1) Some BCPs faced the diagnosis head-on without nervousness or fear. They accepted it and lived peacefully because they believe cancer is not an illness. They also believe their soul has sustenance and hope to continue surviving. \"My thought was that I could persist in (survive) or something like that, I can persist in till the end.\" (A1)Page 6/20Table 2 Key codes of the intention of TCM utilization for BCP categories subcategories codes Frequency of early-stage BCPFrequency of late-stage mental feelings of BCP after cancer diagnosisnegative mental impactCannot accept the diagnosis8 4 Shocked 9 6 Sad or tearful 6 3 Scared or upset 3 3 Thought she was healthy3 1 Thought about the follow-up arrangements1 3 Facing it positivelyDo not be nervous or worried7 3 Do not think it was an illness2 0 Soul had sustenance 1 1 Peaceful coexistence 2 1 Accept it and face it 3 4 Hope to live on 1 4 The in\u0000uence factors of BCP starting to use TCMPush force of using TCMsuffering from side effects4 10 Worried about the treatment of WM1 1 Pull force of using TCMRecommendations from family members or friends11 7 Hope to adjust her constitution7 7 Trust in TCM 2 2 Based on personal experience2 1 *Among the BCP participants, there are 12 in the early stage and 7 in the late stagePage 7/20categories subcategories codes Frequency of early-stage BCPFrequency Prevention of recurrence or metastasis4 0 WM recommendation 1 0 last resort 1 0 *Among the BCP participants, there are 12 in the early stage and 7 in the late stage Factors in\u0000uencing BCPs to use TCM BCPs started using TCMs for various reasons. Under conventional treatment, BCPs usually suffer physical and psychological side effects, including skin symptoms, hot \u0000ashes, constipation, depression, insomnia, and restlessness. Some were also worried about the treatment with WM. While nearly all BCP were plagued by conventional medical side effects that drove the force of pushing to TCM utilizing. Especially mentioned more frequently in late-stage patients. \"Because of the side effects of the drugs at that time, I would have itching and hives on my body\" (E11) \"I used that TCM for conditioning, and then I adjusted my mentality, ... Because of the side effects of chemotherapy, there would be hot \u0000ushes and insomnia... that was emotional anxiety\" (A1) However, BCPs used TCM might also be affected by the force of pulling. In other words, BCPs in any stage used TCM based on the recommendations of family members or friends, individual trust, and personal experience, and believed TCM could help to adjust the patients' constitution. \"At the beginning of chemotherapy, many friends introduced me to visit the TCM physician and suggested I see him.\" (A6) \"I am quite con\u0000dent in Chinese medicine. ..., I was diagnosed in May 2010, ..., I have been taking traditional Chinese medicine for conditioning since then.\" (E2) Furthermore, early-stage BCPs believed that tumor recurrence or metastasis could be prevented through TCM utilization. \"I had been worrying about whether the tumor will recur, transfer, or I will die,... then I went to see the TCM physicians.\" (E1) The TCM care, BCPs experienced some changes. According to data analysis, this comprises two categories: the perceived effects and feelings of TCM and the expectations for TCM care (Table 3). Perceived effects and feelings of TCM Early- and late-stage BCPs experienced the physical or psychological perceived effects of TCM. Early- and late-stage BCPs frequently mentioned that TCM improved the side effects of their conventional medical treatment. They also mentioned the enhancements to their body constitution. \"The biggest improvement for me from TCM is that I used to have diarrhea, ... but after taking this Chinese medicine, it became normal\" (E12) \"In addition to fatigue, it was rash, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome. I think the acupuncture from daycare of TCM is very helpful for me\" (A2)Page 9/20Table 3 Key codes of the experience of BCP in TCM care categories subcategories Codes Frequency of early- stage BCPFrequency of late- stage BCP Perceive effects and feelings of BCP from TCM experiencechanges in physiologyRelieving side effects 15 10 Constitution enhancement12 3 Tumor Control and Prevention4 1 Improve physiological function6 2 Improve the quality of life1 0 Reduce the dose of WM1 0 Catastrophic illness has been canceled2 0 changes in psychologicalfeel peace of mind 9 3 mood was better 1 0 changes to social well-beingimproved family relationships1 0 unmet care needsSide effects were not fully been improve1 3 Communica-tion between TCM and WMWM agreed with the use of TCM4 2 WM rejected TCM use 5 3 Did not inform WM physicians3 3 The expectation of BCP to TCM care.Clinical of TCMMedication Safety and Convenience5 2 Establish TCM consultation5 0 long waiting time 3 4 Policies of TCM Suggestions for scienti\u0000c TCM2 0 *Among the BCP participants, there are 12 in the early stage and 7 in the late stagePage 10/20categories subcategories Codes Frequency of early- stage BCPFrequency of late- stage BCP Cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine1 0 Suggestions for daycare for cancer3 8 *Among the BCP participants, there are 12 in the early stage and 7 in the late stage Furthermore, after TCM care, BCPs felt more spiritually stable and had improved moods. Early- and late- stage BCPs had similar perspectives. \"After taking the Chinese medicine, it let me sleep better, and then I felt calmer.\" (A1) \"I feel that Chinese medicine decoction gives me a very stable strength. .... I believe that if my mental status is healed, then my body should also be \u0000ne.\" (E4) However, some BCPs mentioned that their needs for using TCM were not being met. Especially late-stage BCPs frequently mentioned that their side effects were not relieved. \"I think insomnia is actually very di\u0000cult to relieve ...every time I told the physician: 'I can't sleep', he would change the medicine and strengthen it.\" (A7) For the use of TCM, regardless of early- or late-stage breast cancer, patients communicated with WM practitioners and either got approval or were rejected. Moreover, some BCPs did not inform WM physicians of TCM usage due to fear or feeling that it was meaningless. \"The western physician said, 'okay, if it helps you, just go to see TCM.\" (E11) \"I already trust TCM very much, I don't need WM to give me a\u0000rmation, so I don't need to ask them.\" (E2) The expectations for TCM care Most BCPs were satis\u0000ed with the current TCM care but had some expectations about TCM. In clinical practice, many BCPs mentioned that the safety and convenience of TCM still need to be strictly veri\u0000ed. The long waiting time and the lack of available TCM consultations should be improved. \"The ingredients of concentrated scienti\u0000c Chinese medicine is the toxicity of lead. Many people will worry about this problem.\" (A1) \"There are really too many patients in the TCM physician...the time to answer my question may be a bit rushed.\" (A6)Page 11/20In terms of policy, BCPs thought TCM should be more scienti\u0000c and incorporated with WM. The enhanced daycare of TCM for cancer can be implemented more extensively. \"I feel that Chinese medicine is going to develop this kind of instrument that can be digitized...that can help them make a more accurate diagnosis.\" (E9) \"I think this enhanced daycare of TCM is only available in our hospital. I think it is too lack, and it really needs to be everywhere.\" (E10) Discussion To our knowledge, this is the \u0000rst study to explore the intention and experience of BCPs in the early and late stages toward TCM utilization using content analysis to compare the frequency of speci\u0000c codes. Through this study, we can further understand the factors that affect BCPs' demand for TCM care. Bcps Were Driven By Push And Pull By Cancer Diagnosis And Treatment To Use Tcm The intention of BCPs to use TCM in this study may be a disturbance to the disease, which becomes a push for the use of TCM; BCPs believed that TCM could bene\u0000t cancer referred to as a pull for using TCM. Previous studies have indicated that patients will generate push factors for TCM use due to dissatisfaction with WM care or generate pull factors based on their background and attraction to the bene\u0000ts of TCM care, forming a \"push-pull model\".[33, 34] This study found that suffering from the side effects of WM treatment is an important push force driving early- and late-stage BCPs to use TCM. Late-stage BCPs especially mentioned this disturbance more frequently and hoped TCM would strengthen their constitution. It is similar to the results of previous studies[13, 35, 36] in that BCPs used TCM to improve the side effects, provide tonic effects, and treat the tumor since late-stage BCPs might experience more side effects after WM treatment, including physical and psychological discomfort. Hamer et al. demonstrated that advanced BCPs had greater symptom burden and lower quality of life than early-stage BCPs.[37] Therefore, late-stage BCPs had more motivation to In addition, early- and late-stage BCPs use TCM because of the trust and hope that TCM can adjust their body constitution, which is common between both groups. Hence, cancer patients usually trust TCM because of their cultural background and personal experience.[38] However, the factor \"hoping to prevent metastasis and recurrence\" was only mentioned by early-stage BCPs. It may relate to the results of this study. Late-stage BCPs do not aim to cure or eliminate cancer but hope that TCM can improve their physical strength and reduce side effects so they can coexist peacefully with cancer cells. One literature pointed out that early-stage BCPs experience crucial psychological distress regarding recurrence compared with late-stage BCPs.[39]Page 12/20An early-stage BCP responded that she thought TCM was the last option except for WM, so she tried to receive TCM care. TCM can be regarded as a BCP's last resort to stay alive, according to Smithson et al. and Yu et al.; seeking CAM or TCM is the last resort for cancer patients to control cancer and get better outcomes.[40, 41] TCM is bene\u0000cial for breast cancer care, and BCPs in various stages had different care needs for TCM The most frequent response was that TCM could improve the side effects of the BCPs, whether early- or late-stage, and enhance physical strength so they can continue WM treatment. TCM has been demonstrated in many studies to alleviate the adverse effects of conventional medicine [35, 42-46], inhibit cancer cells[47, 48], and improve the quality of life or prolong survival time.[16, 43, 47-49] 'Tumor control and prevention' is one of the positive changes brought about by TCM care, and early-stage patients mentioned it frequently. Compared with late-stage breast cancer, early-stage breast cancer cells are more stable and can be protected from tumor progression through TCM. Some previous studies have reported that one of the reasons why cancer patients use TCM is to prevent tumor recurrence or metastasis.[34] TCM has proven to be effective in preventing cancer recurrence and metastasis.[48, 50] A study showed that the rates of psychosocial distress are high and similar among early- and late-stage BCPs,[51] and TCM can improve psychological stability in both groups. The effects on early- and late- stage BCP during various WM treatment periods had shown in Fig. 1. In particular, one participant mentioned that after TCM care, she could take care of herself, and her family relationship improved. This is like the World Health Organization's de\u0000nition of health: 'health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or in\u0000rmity.'[52] However, after TCM care, some participants felt that their care needs regarding side effects had not been met, and most were late- stage patients. It is estimated that the treatment methods and doses for late-stage BCP are more complicated when treated with WM, making the side effects more pronounced, so the need for TCM would also be affected. TCM is bene\u0000cial to BCPs, and some WM practitioners agreed for the use of TCM, especially for early- stage breast cancer. However, many BCPs responded that WM practitioners were less accepting of TCM due to worries about the mutual in\u0000uence of Chinese and Western medicine. WM consultants of late- stage BCPs were more reluctant to accept TCM, probably because they were more worried about its possible interaction with e\u0000cacy. Not all BCPs discussed the use of TCM with WM, probably because of fear of telling or the feeling that reporting it is meaningless. Studies have also shown that many BCPs do not inform WM physicians of the use of CAM or TCM, and most of their WM physicians were unaware that the patients were using other therapies.[53, 54] Therefore, the risk of potential interaction between Chinese and Western medicines may be increased, causing unexpected adverse reactions.[13, 55] Some participants believe that WM and TCM should be integrated to establish communication and cooperation. Many studies have shown that proper integration of Chinese and Western medicine in cancer care can improve the survival rate, quality of life, and overall health of cancer patients.[13, 16, 56- 58] BCPs also expected that TCM could be more scienti\u0000c, that the quality of TCM could be safer, andPage 13/20that the enhanced daycare could be optimized so that TCM could have a better quality of care in cancer. As stated in the literature, scienti\u0000c evidence-based research on TCM should be strengthened,[36, 45, 49] and the heterogeneity of Chinese medicine quality should improve,[45] since the enhanced daycare of TCM for cancer is also bene\u0000cial to the alleviation of adverse reactions for cancer patients.[59] Limitations The BCP focus group interviews in this study included 19 participants, 12 early-stage and 7 late-stage patients. Although great efforts were made for recruitment, the numbers of early- and late-stage BCPs were unequal. The late-stage BCPs were fewer, and this study tried to encourage participants to express their opinions during the interviews fully. This study recruited BCP participants by convenience sampling, which may introduce a selection bias. While the viewpoints were completely collected in the research until it was saturated, future research should extend the sampling source to avoid possible bias. According to the study's purpose, we only included those who had experience using TCM; we did not explore the views of non-users. Therefore, the reasons why BCPs did not use TCM care are unknown. Future research might be needed to explore this further. Conclusion Relieving the side effects of conventional treatment and trust in TCM are the main factors for using TCM. Many BCPs experienced relief from side effects, improved constitution, and emotional stability with TCM. Early-stage BCPs additionally expected that TCMs could prevent cancer from recurrence and metastasis. Late-stage BCPs frequently indicated that the need for care was not ful\u0000lled. Early- and late-stage BCPs' intentions and experiences in TCM utilization were inconsistent. Scienti\u0000c evidence-based research on TCM and integration with WM to improve the quality of cancer care should be strengthened. Based on the results of the studies, health policymakers can appropriately revise cancer TCM care programs or care guides with WM to meet the treatment needs of various stages to improve the quality of care and outcome in cancer care.
