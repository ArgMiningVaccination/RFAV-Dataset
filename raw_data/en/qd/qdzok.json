Can be used with Lyme herbs to help flush the system. Take 1 dropper full morning and night for 4-6 weeks. Can repeat every 3 months. Made with organic gluten free alcohol, and organic herb blend of burdock root, milk thistle, horsetail, ginger and dandelion root. This is a dietary supplement. For herbal tinctures that are alcohol based you can place a small amount in a cup and put a small amount of boiling water over it, the alcohol with then evaporate leaving you with the healing properties of the tincture still just minus the alcohol. I recommend that with all the herbal tinctures you start of small in dosing and work your way up to recommended dosage. Some people only need a small amount to notice a difference.
