Active substance Tisagenlecleucel: Autologous T -cells genetically modified ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding an anti -CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Quantitative description of active substance: 2 X 106 - 6 X 108 CAR positive viable T -cells Excipients Excipient Concentration of excipients in stock solution Plasma -lyte A Injection pH 7.4 (Multiple Electrolytes Injection, Type 1) immunocellular therapy indicated for the treatment of: Paediatric and young adult patients 2 to and including 25 years of age with B -cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse post -transplant or in second or later relapse. Adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. 4 DOSAGE REGIMEN AND A DMINISTRATION Manufacture and release of Kymriah usually takes about 3 to 4 weeks. Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 2 of 40 Kymriah must be administered in a treatment center that has been qualified by the Mark eting Authorization Holder (MAH). Therapy should be initiated under the direction of and supervised by a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of hematological malignancies and trained for Kymriah administration and management of patients tr eated with Kymriah. A minimum of two doses of tocilizumab per patient for use in the event of cytokine release syndrome and emergency equipment must be available on site prior to infusion. Treatment center should have timely access to additional doses of t ocilizumab (see Table 6 -1). For autologous use only For intravenous use only. A leukocyte depleting filter should not be used For single treatment Dosage regimen Kymriah is provided as a single, one -time treatment. Dosage in pediatric and young adult B -cell patients: For patients 50 kg and below: 0.2 to 5.0 x 106 CAR -positive viable T -cells /kg body weight. For patients above 50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5 x 108 CAR -positive viable T -cells (non -weight based) . Dosage in DLBCL patients: 0.6 to 6.0 x 108 CAR -positive viable T -cells (non -weight based). Pre-treatment conditioning (Lymphodepleting chemotherapy) Lymphodepleting chemotherapy is recommended to be administered before Kymriah infusion unless the white blood cell (WBC) count within one week prior to infusion is 1,000 cells/microliter. Kymriah is recommended to be infused 2 to 14 days after completion of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The availability of Kymriah must be confirmed prior to starting the lymphodepleting regimen. If there is a delay of more than 4 weeks between completing lymphodepleting chemotherapy and the Kymriah infus ion and the WBC count is >1,000 cells/microliter, then the patient should be re -treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to receiving Kymriah. B-cell ALL : The recommended lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen is: Fludarabine (30 mg/m2 intravenous daily for 4 days) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 intravenous daily for 2 days starting with the first dose of fludarabine). If the patient experienced a previous Grade 4 hemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide, or demonstrated a chemorefractory state to a cyclophosphamide -containing regimen administered shortly before lymphodepleting chemotherapy, then the following should be used: Cytarabine (500 mg/m2 intravenous dail y for 2 days) and etoposide (150 mg/m2 intravenous daily for 3 days starting with the first dose of cytarabine) DLBCL : The recommended lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen is: Fludarabine (25 mg/m2 intravenous daily for 3 days) and cyclophosphami de (250 mg /m2 intravenous daily for 3 days starting with the first dose of fludarabine). Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 3 of 40 If the patient experienced a previous Grade 4 hemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide, or demonstrated a chemorefractory state to a cyclophosphamide -containing regimen administered shortly before lymphodepleting chemotherapy, then the following should be used: Bendamustine (90 mg/m2 intravenous daily for 2 days). Special populations Renal and hepatic impairment As a cell based therapy, Kymriah is not expected to undergo renal elimination or hepatic metabolism. No studies have been performed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Pediatric patients B-cell ALL : No formal studies have been performed in pediatric patients below 3 years of age. DLBCL : No formal studies have been performed in pediatric patients below 18 years of age. Geriatric patients (65 years of age or older) B-cell ALL : Limited experience in adult relapsed or refractory B -cell ALL patient population 65 years of age or older is available. The safety a nd efficacy of Kymriah in this population has not been established. DLBCL : No dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years of age or older (see section 11 Clinical pharmacology). Patients seropositive for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV ), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) There is no experience with manufacturing Kymriah for patients with a positive test for HIV or with active HBV or active HCV. Leukapheresis material from these patients will not be accepted for Kymriah manufacturing . Screening for HBV, HCV, and HIV must be performed in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. Active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia or lymphoma There is limited experience of use of Kymriah in patients with active CNS leukemia and active CNS lymphoma. Therefore the risk/benefit of Kymriah has not been established in these populations. Concomitant diseases Patients with active CNS disorder or inadequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary or cardiac function were excluded from the studies. These patients are likely to be more vulnerable to the consequences of the adverse reactions described after Kymriah infusion and require special attention. Safety monitoring prior to infusion Due to the risks associated with Kymr iah treatment, infusion should be withheld until resolution of any of the following conditions (see section 6 Warnings and precautions). Unresolved serious adverse reactions (especially pulmonary reactions, cardiac reactions or hypotension) from preceding chemotherapies. Active uncontrolled infection. Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 4 of 40 Active Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD). Significant clinical worsening of leukemia burden or rapid progression of lymphoma following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Method of administration Premedication: To minimize potential acute infusion reactions, it is recommended to premedicate patients with acetaminophen/paracetamol and diphenhydramine or another H1 antihistamine within approximately 30 to 60 minutes prior to Kymriah infusion. The prophylactic use of s ystemic corticosteroids should be avoided as it may interfere with the activity of Kymriah (see section 6 Warnings and precautions). Clinical assessment prior to infusion Kymriah treatment should be delayed in certain patients with safety risk factors as detailed in section 6 Warning and precautions. Monitoring after infusion Following infusion with Kymriah , patients should be monitored daily for the first 10 days following infusion for signs and symptoms of potential CRS, neurological events and other toxicities . Physicians should consider hospitalisation for the first 10 days post -infusion or at the first signs/symptoms of CRS and/or neurological events . After the first 10 days following the infusion, the patient should be monitored at the physician's discretion Patients should be instructed to remain within proximity (2 hours of travel) of a qualified clinical facility for at least 4 weeks following infusion. Precautions to be taken before handling or administering Kymriah Kymriah contains genetically -modified human blood cells. Healthcare professionals handling Kymriah should therefore take appropriate precautions (wearing gloves and glasses) to avoid potential transmission of infectious diseases as for any human- derived materials. Preparat ion for infusion Patient identity confirmation: Prior to Kymriah infusion, the patient's identity must be matched with the patient identifiers on the Kymriah infusion bag(s). Inspection and thawing of the infusion bag(s): The timing of thaw of Kymriah and infusion should be coordinated. The infusion start time should be confirmed in advance, and adjusted for thaw so that Kymriah is available for infusion when the recipient is ready. The infusion bag should be placed inside a second , sterile bag, to avoid spills in case of a leak and to protect ports from contamination during thawing. The infusion bag(s) should be examined for any breaks or cracks prior to thawing. Kymriah should be thawed at 37\u00b0 C using either water bath or dry thaw method until there is no visible ice in the infusion bag. The infusion bag should be Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 5 of 40 removed immediately from the thawing device and should not be stored at 37\u00b0 C after thawing is completed. Once Kymriah has been thawed and is at room temperature (20\u00b0 C to 25\u00b0 C) , it should be inf used within 30 minutes to maintain maximum product viability, including any interruption during the infusion. If more than one infusion bag has been received for the treatment dose (refer to the Certificate of Conformance for number of bags constituting one dose) , the second bag should not be thawed until after the content of the first bag have been safely infused. Inspect the contents of the thawed infusion bag for any visible cell clumps. If visible cell clumps remain, gently mix the contents of the bag. Small clumps of cellular material should disperse with gentle manual mixing. Do not infuse Kymriah if clumps are not dispersed. If the Kymriah bag appears to have been damaged or to be leaking, it should not be infused, and should be disposed of according to local biosafety procedures. Administration Kymriah should not be manipulated. For example, Kymriah should not be washed (spun down and resuspended in new media) prior to infusion. All contents of the infusion bag should be infused. Kymriah should be administered as an intravenous infusion through latex free tubing without a leukocyte depleting filter, approximately at 10 to 20 mL per minute by gravity flow. Sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection should be used to prime the tubing prior to infusion as well as rinse it afterwards. When the full volume of Kymriah has been infused, Kymriah infusion bag should be rinsed with 10 to 30 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection by back priming to assure as many cells as possible are infused into the patient . In clinical trials intravenous push was an alternate method for the administration of low volumes of Kymriah. For special precautions for disposal see section 14 Pharmaceutical information. 5 CONTRAINDICATIONS Kymriah is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tisagenlecleucel or to any component of the product formulation, including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or dextran 40. 6 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Patient information Prior to infusion, the patient should read the information from 'Patient educational leaflet: Important i nformation for the patient , guardians or care givers '. In particular, the patient should be carefully educated to inform their doctor immediately if cytokine release syndrome (CRS), neurological symptoms or other toxicities occur after infusion with Kymriah, and informed that they should stay within 2 hours distance of where they are given Kymriah treatment for at least 4 weeks. Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 6 of 40 Blood, organ, tissue and cell donation Patients treated with Kymriah should not donate blood, organs, tissues, sperms, oocytes and other cells. Cytokine release syndrome Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), including life threatening or fatal events, occurred frequently after Kymriah infusion. In almost all cases, development of CRS occurred between 1 to 10 days (median onset 3 days) after Kymriah infusion in pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL patients and between 1 and 9 days (median onset 3 days) after Kymriah infusion in adult DLBCL patients. The median time to resolution of CRS was 8 days in B -cell ALL and 7 days in DLBCL patients. Signs and symptoms of CRS may include high fever, rigors, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, rash, anorexia, fatigue, headache, hypotension, dyspnea, tach ypnea, and Organ dysfunction, including cardiac insufficiency and arrhythmia, renal insufficiency and liver injury with accompanying elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or elevated total bilirubin may also be observed. In addition, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with low fibrinogen levels, capillary leak activation syndrome (MAS) and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) may occcur in the setting of CRS. Pati ents should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of these events including fever . Management of Cytokine Release Syndrome associated with Kymriah CRS should be managed solely based on the patient's clinical presentation and according to the CRS manag ement algorithm provided in Table 6- 1. Anti -interleukin -6 based therapy such as tocilizumab has been administered for moderate or severe CRS associated with Kymriah. A minimum of two doses of tocilizumab per patient must be available on site prior to Kymriah infusion. Treatment center should have timely access to additional doses of tocilizumab. Corticosteroids may be administered in cases of life -threatening emergencies. Tisagenlecleucel continues to expand and persist following administration of tocilizum ab and corticosteroids. Patients with medically significant cardiac dysfunction should be managed by standards of critical care; measures such as echocardiography should be considered. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) antagonists are not recommended for managem ent of Kymriah associated CRS . Risk factors for severe CRS in pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL patients are high tumor burden prior to Kymriah infusion, uncontrolled or accelerating tumor burden following lymphodepleting chemotherapy, active infection and early onset of fever or CRS following Kymriah infusion. High tumor burden prior to Kymriah infusion was identified as a risk factor for developing severe CRS in adult DLBCL patients. Prior to administration of Kymriah in pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL patients , efforts should be made to lower and control the patient's tumor burden. In all indications, appropriate prophylactic and therapeutic treatment for infections should be provided, and complete resolution of any existing infections should be ensured. Infections may also occur during CRS and may increase the risk of a fatal event . Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 7 of 40 Table 6-1 CRS management algorithm Cytokine release syndrome severity Management Prodromal syndrome : Low-grade fever, fatigue, anorexia Observe in person; exclude infection; administer antibiotics per local guidelines if neutropenic; provide symptomatic support. Cytokine release syndrome requiring mild intervention - one or more of the following : High fever Hypoxia Mild hypotension Administer antipyretics, oxygen, intravenous fluids and/or low-dose vasopressors as needed. Cytokine release syndrome requiring moderate to aggressive intervention - one or more of the following : Hemodynamic instability despite intravenous fluids and vasopressor support Worsening respiratory distress, including pulmonary infiltrates, increasing oxygen requirement including high- flow oxygen and/or need for mechanical v entilation Rapid clinical deterioration Administer high- dose or multiple vasopressors, oxygen, mechanical ventilation and/or other supportive care as needed. Administer tocilizumab. - Patient weight less than 30 kg: 12 mg/kg intravenously over 1 hour. - Patient weight 30 kg: 8 mg/kg intravenously over 1 hour (maximum dose 800 mg). Repeat tocilizumab as needed at a minimum interval of 8 hours if there is no clinical improvement. If no response to second dose of tocilizumab, consider a third dose of tocili zumab or pursue alternative measures for treatment of cytokine release syndrome. Limit to a maximum total of 4 tocilizumab doses. If no clinical improvement within 12 to 18 hours of the first tocilizumab dose, or worsening at any time, administer methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg as an initial dose, then 2 mg/kg per day until vasopressors and high-flow oxygen are no longer needed, then taper. Neurological toxicities Neurological toxicities, in particular signs and symptoms of encephalopathy, confusional state and/or delirium can occur with Kymriah and can be severe or life -threatening. Other manifestations include depressed level of consciousness, seizures, decreased aphasia and speech disorder. The majority of neurological toxicities occurred within 8 weeks following Kymriah infusion and were transient. The median time to onset of the first neurological events was 8 days in B-cell ALL and 6 days in DLBCL. The median time to resolution was 7 days for B -cell ALL and 13 days for DLBCL. Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 8 of 40 Neurological events can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS or in the absence of CRS. Patients should be monitored for neurological events. In case of neurological events , patients should be diagnostically worked up and managed depending on the underlying pathophysiol ogy and in accordance with local standard of care. Infections and febrile neutropenia Patients with active, uncontrolled infection should not start Kymriah treatment until the infection is resolved. Prior to Kymriah infusion, infection prophylaxis should follow standard guidelines based on the degree of preceding immunosuppression. Serious infections, including life threatening or fatal infections, occurred in patients after Kymriah infusion. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection and treated appropriately. As appropriate, prophylactic antibiotics should be administered and surveillance testing should be employed prior to and during treatment with Kymriah. Infections are known to complicate the course and management of concurrent C RS. Febrile neutropenia was observed in patients after Kymriah infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, infection should be evaluated and managed appropriately with broad spectrum antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care, as medically indicated . In patients achieving complete remission following Kymriah, resulting low immunoglobulin levels can increase the risk for infections. In patients with low immunoglobulin levels pre -emptive measures such as immunoglobulin replacement and rapid attention to signs and symptoms of infection should be implemented according to age and standard specific guidelines . Prolonged cytopenias Patients may continue to exhibit cytopenias for several weeks following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Kymriah and should be managed per standard guidelines. The majority of patients who had cytopenias at day 28 following Kymriah treatment resolved to Grade 2 or below within three months after treatment. Prolonged neutropenia has been associated with increased risk of infection. Myeloid growth factors, particularly granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM CSF), have the potential to worsen CRS symptoms and are not recommended during the first 3 weeks after Kymriah infusion and until CRS ha s resolved . Secondary malignancies Patients treated with Kymriah may develop secondary malignancies or recurrence of their cancer. They should be monitored life -long for secondary malignancies . In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, Novartis should be contacted to obtain instructions to collect patient samples for testing (add local contact and phone number). Hypogammaglobulinemia Hypogammaglobulinemia and agammaglobulinemia can occur in patients after Kymriah infusion. Immunoglobulin levels should be monitored after treatment with Kymriah. In patients with low immunoglobulin levels pre -emptive measures such as infection precautions, antibiotic prophylaxis and immunoglobulin replacement should be taken according to age and standard guidelines . Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 9 of 40 Live vaccines The safety of immunization with live vaccines during or following Kymriah treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during Kymriah treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with Kymriah. Tumor lysis syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which may be severe, has occasionally been observed. To minimize risk of TLS, patients with elevated uric acid o r high tumor burden should receive allopurinol, or an alternative prophylaxis, prior to Kymriah infusion. Signs and symptoms of TLS should be monitored and events managed according to standard guidelines . Prior stem cell transplantation It is not recommend ed that patients undergo allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT) within 4 months prior to Kymriah because of the potential risk of Kymriah worsening graft versus host disease (GVHD) . Leukapheresis for Kymriah manufacturing should be performed at least 12 week s after allogenic SCT. Viral reactivation Viral reactivation, e.g. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, can occur in patients treated with medicinal products directed against B -cells and could result in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death. Prior treatment with anti CD19 therapy There is limited experience with Kymriah in patients exposed to prior CD19 directed therapy. Interference with serological testing Due to limited and short spans of identical genetic information between the lentivira l vector used to create Kymriah and HIV, some commercial HIV nucleic acid tests (NAT) may give a false positive result. Content of dextran 40 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) This medicinal product contains 11 mg dextran 40 and 82.5 mg dimethyl sulfoxide (DM SO) per mL. Each of these excipients are known to possibly cause anaphylactic reaction following parenteral administration. Patients not previously exposed to dextran and DMSO should be observed closely during the first minutes of the infusion period. Cont ent of sodium and potassium This medicinal product contains 2.43 mg sodium per mL and 0.082 mg potassium per mL. Fetal risk There is no preclinical or clinical data to assess whether Kymriah constitutes a risk to a pregnant woman or the fetus (see section 9 Pregnancy, lactation, females and males of reproductive potential). Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 10 of 40 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Due to the potential for neurological toxicities, patients receiving Kymriah are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness, coordination or seizures in the 8 weeks following infusion. Patients are advised to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery during this initial period. 7 ADVERSE DRUG REACTIO NS Summary of the safety profile Safety assessment was based on a total of 194 patients (with pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL and DLBCL) receiving Kymriah in two multi- center pivotal clinical studies. Pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL The adverse reactions described in this section were characterized in 79 patients infused with Kymriah in the multi- center, pivotal clinical study CCTL019B2202. The most common non- hematological adverse reactions . The most common haematological adverse reactions were decreased white blood cells (100%), decreased haemoglobin (100%), decreased neutrophils (100%), decreased lymphocytes (100%) and decreased platelets (97%). Grade 3 and Grade 4 adverse reactions were reported in 89% of patients . The most common (>40%) Grade 3 and Grade 4 non- haematological adverse reactions were CRS (48%). The most common (>40%) Grade 3 and Grade 4 haematological laboratory abnormalitie s were decreased white blood cells (97%), decreased lymphocytes (96%), decreased neutrophils (95%), decreased platelets (77%), and decreased haemoglobin (48%) . Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were more often observed within the initial 8 weeks post - infusion (82% of patients) compared to after 8 weeks post -infusion (51% of patients). DLBCL The adverse reactions described in this section were characterized in 115 patients infused with Kymriah in one global multicenter international study, i.e. the ongoing pivotal clinical study CCTL019C2201. The most common non- haematological adverse reactions common haematological adverse reactions were decreased lymphocytes (100%), decreased white blood cells (99%), decreased haemoglobin (99%), decreased neutrophils (97%), and decreased platelets (95%). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions were reported in 88% of patients. The most comm on Grade 3 and 4 non- haematological adverse reactions were infections (34%) and c ytokine release syndrome (23%). Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 11 of 40 The most common (>25%) Grade 3 and 4 haematological laboratory abnormalities were lymphocyte count decreased (95%), neutrophil count decreased (82%), white blood cell count decreased (78%), haemoglobin decreased (59%) and platelet count decreased (56%). The most common (>25%) Grade 3 and 4 haematological laboratory abnormalities were lymphocyte count decreased (95%), neutrophil count decreased (82%), white blood cell count decreased (78%), haemoglobin decreased (59%) and platelet count decreased (56%). Grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions were more often observed within the initial 8 weeks post-infusion (82%) compared to after 8 weeks post -infusion (48%). The corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention (CIOMS III): very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000).

Patients are counted only for the worst grade observed post baseline. Adverse drug reactions from spontaneous reports and literature cases (frequency not known) The following adverse drug reactions have been derived from post -marketing experience with Kymriah via spontaneous case reports, literature cases, expanded access programs, and clinical studies other than the global registration trials. Because these reactions are repo rted voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to tisagenlecleucel exposure. Frequency not known: anaphylactic reaction/infusion related reaction. Desc ription of selected adverse drug reactions Cytokine release syndrome In the ongoing clinical study in pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL (N=79), serious CRS reactions classified based on the PENN Grading system for CRS (Porter et al 2015) were reported in 77% of patients (48% with Grade 3 or 4). Two deaths occurred within 30 days of Kymriah infusion, including one patient, who died from progressive leukemia in the setting of possible CRS and one patient, who experienced fatal intracranial hemorrhage that developed during the course of resolved CRS, abdominal compartment syndrome, coagulopathy and renal failure. In the ongoing clinical study in DLBCL (N=115), CRS was reported in 57% of patients, (23% with Grade 3 or 4) . Cytokine release syndrome was graded with the Penn scale as follows: Grade 1: mild reactions, requiring supportive care; Grade 2: moderate reactions, requiring intravenous therapies; Grade 3: severe reactions, requiring low -dose vasopressors or supplemental oxygen; Grade 4: life-threatening reactions, requiring high- dose vasopressors or intubation; Grade 5: death. For clinical management of CRS, see section 6 Warnings and precautions and Table 6- 1. Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 25 of 40 Infections and febrile neutropenia In B-cell ALL patients severe infections (Grade 3 or 4), which can be life -threatening or fatal, occurred in 48% of patients after Kymriah infusion. The overall incidence was 72% (unspecified 57%, bacterial 27%, viral 38%, and fungal 15%) (see section 6 Warnings and precautions). Forty - three % of the patients experienced an infection of any type within 8 weeks after Kymriah infusion. In DLBCL patients severe infections (Grade 3 or 4), which can be life -threatening or fatal, occurred in 34% of patients. The overall incidence (all grades) was 58% (unspecif ied 48%, bacterial 15%, fungal 11% and viral 11%) (see section 6 Warnings and precautions). Thirty -seven % of the patients experienced an infection of any type within 8 weeks . Severe febrile neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4) was observed in 34% of pediatric and y oung adult B - cell ALL patients and 17% of DLBCL patients . See section 6 Warnings and precautions for the management of febrile neutropenia before and after Kymriah infusion. Hematopoietic cytopenias not resolved by day 28 Cytopenias are very common based on prior chemotherapies and Kymriah therapy. All pediatric and young B -cell ALL patients had a Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia at any time post Kymriah infusion. Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias not resolved by day 28 after Kymriah infusion were based on laboratory findings included a decreased of leukocytes (57%), neutrophils (13%). All adult patients with DLBCL had Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias at any time post Kymriah infusion. Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias not resolved by day 28 after Kymriah infusion based on laboratory findings included a decreased thrombocytes (39%), events The majority of neuro toxic events occurred within 8 weeks following infusion and were transient. In pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL patients, manifestations of encephalopathy and/or delirium occurred in 39% of patients (10% Grade 3 or 4) within 8 weeks after Kymriah infus ion. In DLBCL patients, these occurred in 2 0% of patients (1 1% were Grade 3 or 4) within 8 weeks after Kymriah infusion . The other most common neurological event was headache ( 35% in pediatric and young adult B - cell ALL patients and 21% in DLBCL patients). Hypogammaglobulinaemia Hypogammaglobulinaemia was reported in 53% of patients treated with Kymriah for r/r ALL and 17% of patients with r/r DLBCL. Pregnant women who have received Kymriah may have hypogammaglobulinaemia. Immunoglobulin levels should be as sessed in newborns of mothers treate d with Kymriah. Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 26 of 40 8 INTERACTIONS No pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with tisagenlecleucel have been performed. The co -administration of agents known to inhibit T -cell function has not been formally studied. Adminis tration of tocilizumab and steroids as per the cytokine release syndrome treatment algorithm does not impact the expansion and persistence of CAR -T cells. The co -administration of agents known to stimulate T -cell function has not been investigated and the effects are unknown . 9 PREGNANCY, LACTATION , FEMALES AND MALES OF REPRODUCTIVE POTENTI AL 9.1 Pregnancy Risk summary There are no available data with Kymriah use in pregnant women. No animal studies have been conducted with Kymriah to assess whether it can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. It is not known if Kymriah has the potential to be transferred to the fetus via the placenta and could cause fetal toxicity, including B -cell lymphocytopenia. Kymriah is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of child- bearing potential not using contraception. Pregnant woman should be advised on the potential risks to the fetus. Pregnancy after Kymriah therapy should be discussed with the treating physician. Pregnant women who have received Kymriah may have hypogammaglobulinemia. Assessment of immunoglobulin levels is indicated in newborns of mothers treated with Kymriah. 9.2 Lactation It is unknown whether Kymriah cells are tranferred into human milk. A risk to the breast -fed infant cannot be excluded. Women who are breast -feeding should be advised of the potential risk to breast -fed infant. Following administration of Kymriah, breast -feeding should be discussed with the treating physician . 9.3 Females and males of reproductiv e potential There is a potential for Kymriah to cause fetal toxicity. Pregnancy testing The pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential should be verified prior to starting treatment with Kymriah. Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 27 of 40 See the prescribing information for lymphodepleti ng chemotherapy for information on the need for effective contraception in patients who receive the lymphodepleting chemotherapy . Contraception Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception (i.e., methods that result in less than 1% pregnancy rates) after Kymriah administration. Sexually active males, who have received Kymriah, should use a condom during intercourse with a female of reproductive potential or a pregnant woman. There are insufficient exposure data to provide a recommend ation concerning the duration of contraception following treatment with Kymriah Pregnancy or fathering a child after Kymriah therapy should be discussed with the treating physician. Infertility There is no data on the effect of Kymriah on male and female fertility . Effects of Kymriah on fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies. 10 OVERDOSAGE Not applicable. 11 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG Y Following infusion of Kymriah into pediatric and young adult r/r B -cell ALL and r/r DLBCL patients, the CAR -T positive cells typically exhibited an initial rapid expansion followed by a slower bi -exponential decline. Cellular kinetics in pediatric B -cell ALL patients A summary of cellular kinetic parameters of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL patien ts is provided in Table 11- 1 below. The maximal expansion (Cmax) was approximately 61.2% higher in CR/CRi patients (n=103) compared with non- responding (NR) patients (n=10) as measured by qPCR. Transgene persistence has been detected up 916 days in responding patients in pooled studies B2202 and B2205J). These data, signify the potential role of expansion and persistence for eliciting a clinical response. Delayed and lower expansion was observed in non- responding patients (N=12) compared to responding patie nts (N=105). Table 11-1 Cellular kinetic parameters of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric and young adult r/r B-cell ALL 103 21,900 (80.7), 10 Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 28 of 40 Tmax (day) T\u00bd n 25.2 (307.8), 71 3.80 (182.4), 4 Tlast 742], 9 Cellular kinetics in DLBCL patients A summary of cellular kinetic parameters of tisagenlecleucel in DLBCL patients is provided in Table 11 -2 below. AUC0 -28d and Cmax were were similar between responder (CR and PR) and non- responder patients (SD, PD, and patients with unknown response status) based on cli nical response at month 3. Table 11-2 Cellular kinetic parameters of tisagenlecleucel in r/r DLBCL patients Parameter Summary Statistics Responding Non-Responding T\u00bd n 129 (199.2), 33 14.7 (147.1), 44 Tlast [17.1; 685], 56 Concomitant therapy with tocilizumab and corticosteroids In patients treated with tocilizumab or low dose steroids for the management of CRS, tisagenlecleucel transgene continues to expand and persist following administration of tocilizumab and low dose steroids. Pharmacotherapeutic group, ATC ATC code: not yet available . Mechanism of action (MOA) Tisagenlecleucel is an autologous, immunocellular cancer therapy which involves reprogramming a patient's own T -cells with a transgene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to identify and eliminate CD19 expressing cells. The CAR is comprised of a murine single chain antibody fragment which recognizes CD19 and is fused to intracellular signaling domains from 4- 1BB (CD137) and CD3 zeta. The CD3 zeta component is critical for initiating T -cell activation and antitumor activity w hile 4 -1BB enhances the expansion and persistence of tisagenlecleucel. Upon Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 29 of 40 binding to CD19 expressing cells, the CAR transmits a signal to promote T -cell expansion, activation, target cell elimination and persistence of tisagenlecleucel . Cellular kinetics Distribution In pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL patients, tisagenlecleucel has been shown to be present in the blood as well as bone marrow beyond 2 years. The blood to bone marrow partitioning of Kymriah in bone marrow was 47.2% of that present in blood at Day 28 while at Months 3 and 6 it distributes at 68.3% and 69%, respectively. Tisagenlecleucel also traffics and persists in cerebrospinal fluid in pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL patients (Study B 2101J) for up to 1 year. In DLBCL patients (Study C2201), Kymriah has been detected for up to 3 years in peripheral blood and up to Month 9 in bone marrow for complete responder patients. The blood to bone marrow partitioning in bone marrow was nearly 70% of that present in blood at Day 28 and 50% at Month 3 in responder and non- responder patients . Metabolism Not applicable, Kymriah is an immunocellular therapy . Elimination The elimination profile of Kymriah includes a decline in peripheral blood in a bi -exponential manner and bone marrow. Linearity/non- linearity There is no apparent relationship between dose and AUC0- 28d or Cmax. Special populations Geriatric population (65 years of age or older) The impact of age on cellular kinetics was evaluated across the age range of 22 to 76 years in DLBCL patients (Study C2201). The AUC0- 28d in patients with 65 years of age was observed to be 49.1% and 64.0% lower than patients 40 to <65 years and <40 years, respectively. These differences are not considered clinically relevant due to high variability associated with the exposure parameters. Gender Gender is not a significant characteristic influencing tisagenlecleucel expansion in B -cell ALL and DLBCL patients. In Study B2202, there were 43% female and 57% male pat ients and in Study C2201 there were 38% female and 62% male patients. Race/ethnicity There is limited evidence that race/ethnicity impact the expansion of Kymriah in pediatric and young adult ALL and DLBCL. In Study B2202 there were 73.4% of Caucasian, 12.7% of Asian and 13.9% of other ethnic patients. Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 30 of 40 In Study C2201, there were 85% of Caucasian, 9% of Asian, 4% of Black or African American patients, and three patients (3%) with unknown race. Body weight In DLBCL and ALL patients, across the weight ranges ( (DLBCL: 38.4 to 186.7 kg; ALL: 14.4 to 137 kg) ,), the scatter plots of qPCR cellular kinetic parameters versus weight revealed no apparent relationship between cellular kinetic parameters with weight . Renal and hepatic impairment Kymriah was not studied in patients with hepatic and renal impairment. Prior stem cell transplantation Prior stem cell transplantation did not impact the expansion/persistence of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL patients or adult DLBCL patients. Immunogenici ty In clinical studies, humoral immunogenicity of tisagenlecleucel was measured by determination of anti -murine CAR19 antibodies (anti -mCAR19) in serum pre - and post -administration. The majority of patients tested positive for pre -dose anti -mCAR19 antibodies in pediatric and young adult ALL (B2202, 91.1%) and adult DLBCL (C2201, 93.9%) patients. Treatment -induced anti -mCAR19 antibodies were found in 40.5% of pediatric and young adult ALL and 8.7% of adult DLBCL patients. Pre -existing and treatment- induced antibodies were not associated with an impact on clinical response nor did they have an impact on the expansion and persistence of tisagenlecleucel. There is no evidence that the presence of pre- existing and treatment -induced anti -mCAR19 antibodies impacts the safety or effectiveness of Kymriah. T-cell immunogenicity responses were not observed in pediatric and young adult B -cell ALL and adult r/r DLBCL patients . 12 CLINICAL STUDIES Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) The safety and efficacy of Kymriah treatment in patients with relapsed and refractory (r/r) pediatric and young adults B -cell ALL, were evaluated in one pivotal study (B2202) and two supportive studies (B2205J and B2101J) with a total of 160 patients treated. All patients had leukapheresis products collected and cryopreserved prior to or during study entry . CCTL019B2202 (Study 1) The pivotal study (B2202) is a multicenter, single -arm, open -label phase II study in pediatric and young adult patients with r/r B -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Ninty -seven patients were enrolled, 79 were infused; 18 patients discontinued prior to Kymriah infusion (7 patients due to death; 8 patients due to Kymriah manufacturing related issues; 3 patients due to adverse events) . Key baseline information for inf used patients is presented in Table 12- 1. The majority of patients (69/79, 87%) received bridging therapy while waiting for Kymriah. A total of 76 out of 79 patients Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 31 of 40 who received Kymriah infusion also received lymphodepleting chemotherapy after enrollment and prior to the Kymriah infusion.

The ORR within 3 months was 82.3% (65/79). The median time from Kymriah infusion to the data cut -off date was 24.2 months (range: 4.5 to 35.1). See Table 12- 2 and Figures 12 -1 and 12- 2 for efficacy results from this study. Fifty - nine of 65 responders achie ved CR/CRi by the Day 28 assessment . ORR was consistent across all subgroups . Eight patients who received Kymriah infusion went to transplant while in remission. Kymriah was administered in a qualified Kymriah treatment center in an inpatient and outpatien t setting. Health related quality of life (HRQoL) were evaluated by PedsQL and EQ -5D questionnaires completed by patients aged 8 and above. Among patients responding, the mean change from Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 32 of 40 baseline in the PedsQL total score was 13.1 at Month 3 and 15.4 at Month 6 and 25.0 at Month 12, and the mean change from baseline in the EQ VAS score was 16.0 at Month 3 and 15.3 at Month 6 and 21.7 at Month 12, indicating overall clinically meaningful improvement in HRQoL following Kymriah infusion. Special populations No differences in efficacy or safety were observed between different age subgroups. Patients with active CNS leukaemia There was no patients with active CNS leukemia in study B2202. Of four patients with active CNS leukemia (i.e. CNS -3) included in study B2101J, three experienced cytokine release syndrome (Grade 2-4) and transient neurological abnormalities (Grade 1-3) that resolved within 1 to 3 months of infusion. One patient died due to disease progression and the remaining three patients achieved a CR or CRi and remain alive 1.5 to 2 years after infusion. The risk/benefit of Kymriah has not been established in this population.

CCTL019C2201 The pivota l study (C2201) is a multicenter, single -arm phase II study in adult patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Of 167 patients enrolled, 115 patients received infusion with Kymriah. Approximately 31% of patients discontinued the study prior to Kymriah infusion. For 13 patients Kymriah could not be manufactured. Reasons for discontinuation prior to Kymriah infusion included death (n=16), physician decision/ primary disease progression (n=16), adverse event (n=4), patient decision (n=2) and protocol deviation (n=1) or adverse events (n=4 ) while awaiting Kymriah manufacturing in the clinical study . Key baseline information for infused patients is presented in Table 12- 3. The majority of patients (103/115, 86%) received brid ging therapy while waiting for Kymriah and 107/115 patients (93%) received lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Kymriah was given as a single dose intravenous infusion in a qualified Kymriah treatment center in an inpatient and outpatient setting.

The primary endpoint was assessed in 99 patients who received Kymriah manufactured at the Novartis U.S. facility and who have been followed for at least 3 months or discontinued earlier after Kymriah administration. Among the 99 patients (Table 12- 4) in cluded in the primary analysis, the best ORR was 53.5% (53/99) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of ( 43.2%, 63.6% ). Forty patients (40.4%) achieved CR and 13 (13.1%) achieved PR. Among these 40 patients, 15 patients initially had an overall disease respo nse of PR which improved to CR over time; most patients (13/15) achieved PR to CR conversion within 6 months post -tisagenlecleucel infusion. No patient who received Kymriah infusion went to transplant after achieving CR or PR. Subgroup analyses demonstrate d a homogeneous and consistent treatment effect across major demographic and prognostic subgroups regardless of prior lines of therapy (ORR 51.9% and 55.3% in patients with 2 lines of therapies and >2 lines of therapies, respectively), prior SCT (ORR of Kymriah July2019.SIN Page 36 of 40 49.1% and 59.1% in patients without or with previous SCT, respectively), relapsed or refractory disease (ORR 64.6% and 43.1 %, repectively) or biological factors such as cell of origin (ORR 55.6% in non- GCB and 49.0% lymphoma with Bcl- 2 and c -myc expression (ORR of 41.2% in patients with double -hit/triple hit lymphoma).

No such risks were identified based on these studies. In the absence of validated non- clinical in vivo models, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) could not be assessed in animal studies. Safety pharmacology and repeated dose toxicity Safety pharmacology studies were not conducted due to the limited tissue distribution of the target (i.e. CD19 is exclusively expressed on B -cells in blood and lymphatic tissues) and because the pharmacological principle, (i.e. target specific T -cell mediated cytotoxicity) does not warrant such safety studies. No repeated dose toxicity studies were conducted .

No alternative adequate animal models are available . In vitro expansion studies wit h CAR -positive T -cells (Kymriah) from healthy donors and patients (Kymriah) showed no evidence for transformation and/or immortalization of T -cells. In vivo studies in immunocompromised mice did not show signs of abnormal cell growth or signs of clonal cell expansion for up to 7 months, which represents the longest meaningful observation period for immunocompromised mouse models. A genomic insertion site analysis of the lentiviral vector was performed on Kymriah product s from 14 individual donors (12 patien ts and 2 healthy volunteers). There was no evidence for preferential integration near genes of concern or preferential outgrowth of cells harboring integration sites of concern. Reproductive toxicity No non- clinical reproductive safety studies were conduct ed as no adequate animal model is available. Juvenile animal studies Juvenile toxicity studies were not conducted. 14 PHARMACEUTICAL INFO RMATION Incompatibilities In the absence of compatibility studies, this product must not be mixed with other medicinal products.
