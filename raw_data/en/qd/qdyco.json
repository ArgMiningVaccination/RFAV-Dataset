When matured, its cry could be [fatal](/wiki/Death) to any person who heard it. [[1]](#cite_note-CS6-1) Description and traits[ ] - \"A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in colour, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn't have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the 'cry' of the Mandrake.\" - \u2014 [Harry Potter](/wiki/Harry_Potter)'s perception of Mandrakes in a Herbology lesson [[src]](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets) Whenever unearthed, the root screamed. The scream of a mature Mandrake when it was unearthed was powerful enough to break glass and would kill any person who hears it, but a young Mandrake's screams would usually only knock a person out for several hours. They stopped screaming once they were replanted in the soil. When [Hogwarts](/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry) students studied Mandrakes in [Herbology](/wiki/Herbology) class, [Professor](/wiki/Professor) [Pomona Sprout](/wiki/Pomona_Sprout) had her students wear [earmuffs](/wiki/Earmuffs) to protect their ears from the Mandrake's cries. [[1]](#cite_note-CS6-1) Professor [Mirabel Garlick](/wiki/Mirabel_Garlick) had her students put cotton in their ears in the late [19th century](/wiki/19th_century). [[6]](#cite_note-HL-6) Mandrakes not only resembled [humans](/wiki/Human), but also had similar behaviours to them. In the [1992-1993 school year](/wiki/1992%E2%80%931993_school_year) at Hogwarts, the school's Mandrakes, at one point of time, became moody and secretive, which indicated that they were reaching adolescence. [[7]](#cite_note-COS13-7) Later on, they threw a loud and raucous party, which was comparable to humans when they are teenagers, which made Professor Sprout very happy indeed. [[8]](#cite_note-COS14-8) [Madam Pomfrey](/wiki/Poppy_Pomfrey) also mentioned the Mandrakes having [acne](/wiki/Acne). [[7]](#cite_note-COS13-7) Mandrakes were fully matured when they started moving into each others' pots. When matured, Mandrake roots could be cut up to serve as a prime ingredient for the [Mandrake Restorative Draught](/wiki/Mandrake_Restorative_Draught), which was used to return those who have been [transfigured](/wiki/Transfiguration), [cursed](/wiki/Curse) or [Petrified](/wiki/Petrification) Mandrake](/wiki/Stewed_Mandrake) was essential part of most [antidotes](/wiki/Antidote). [[1]](#cite_note-CS6-1) Their [leaves](/wiki/Mandrake_leaf) were also used in potions as well, including the potion used in the process of becoming an [Animagus](/wiki/Animagus). [[10]](#cite_note-GOF26-10) The [Dugbog](/wiki/Dugbog)'s favourite food was Mandrake, which led to Mandrake-growers finding nothing but a bloody mess when pulling their plants out of the ground. [[11]](#cite_note-FBR-11) [Flesh-Eating Slugs](/wiki/Flesh-Eating_Slug) were known to favour eating Mandrakes as well. [[12]](#cite_note-COSG-12) History[ ] - \"We will be able to cure her, Argus. Professor Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive [Mrs Norris](/wiki/Mrs_Norris).\" exposure to Mandrakes. Before [1890](/wiki/1890), [someone](/wiki/Individual_who_died_in_Dogweed_and_Deathcap) died in [Dogweed and Deathcap](/wiki/Dogweed_and_Deathcap) after knocking over a Mandrake. [[13]](#cite_note-13) Just over a century later, [Minister for Magic](/wiki/Minister_for_Magic) [Venusia Crickerly](/wiki/Venusia_Crickerly) died in [1912](/wiki/1912), following accident. [[14]](#cite_note-PMministers-14) Furthermore, the [Sunday edition](/wiki/The_New_York_Ghost_articles#28_November_1926_edition) on Mandrake attack [Herbology](/wiki/Herbology) curriculum at by [Professor](/wiki/Professor) [Pomona [[1]](#cite_note-CS6-1) Professor Sprout taught third year students in Herbology how to handle Mandrakes. [[2]](#cite_note-HM36h-2) Also during the 1986-1987 school year, [Jacob's [Penny Haywood](/wiki/Penny_Haywood) found a hidden [Chocolate Frog Card](/wiki/Chocolate_Frog_Card) buried in the soil of a potted baby Mandrake in the [Herbology Classroom](/wiki/Herbology_Classroom), which Penny uprooted after borrowing some [earmuffs](/wiki/Earmuffs) from Professor Sprout, with Jacob's sibling collecting the to prevent [slugs](/wiki/Flesh-Eating_Slug) from eating them. [[18]](#cite_note-MBOAF-18) Later in the school year, [first-year](/wiki/First_year) students learnt about Mandrakes presumably in Herbology class, but some of them neglected to use their earmuffs, making it necessary for them to be treated by [Madam Pomfrey](/wiki/Poppy_Pomfrey) in the [Hospital Wing](/wiki/Hospital_Wing). Jacob's sibling helped her take care of them. [[19]](#cite_note-HM5PS-19) At the start of the [1992-1993 school year](/wiki/1992%E2%80%931993_school_year), Professor Sprout taught second-year [Gryffindor](/wiki/Gryffindor) and [Hufflepuff](/wiki/Hufflepuff) how properly repot baby Mandrakes. [Hermione Granger](/wiki/Hermione_Granger) impressed Professor Sprout with her knowledge of the Mandrake's properties, earning her [house points](/wiki/House_points) for her house Gryffindor. [[1]](#cite_note-CS6-1) During this school year, the school's growth of Mandrakes served the additional purpose of making the [Mandrake Restorative Draught](/wiki/Mandrake_Restorative_Draught), in order to revive all those who had been [petrified](/wiki/Petrification) during the [Chamber of Secrets](/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets) to attack the [Death [[5]](#cite_note-DH31-5) During the which affected the [wizarding in the [2010s](/wiki/2010s), Mandrakes were amongst the various [magical](/wiki/Magic) items caught up as [Foundables](/wiki/Foundable) which had to be dealt with by members of the [Statute of Secrecy Task Force](/wiki/Statute_of_Secrecy_Task_Force). [[20]](#cite_note-WU-20) Etymology[ ] Mandrake is from late Old English mandragora, that had the [dragon](/wiki/Dragon)-related description replaced with native drake. [[21]](#cite_note-21) Mandragora, other than referring to the plant, could also mean \"a kind of tiny dragon immune to [fire](/wiki/Fire)\". It is from the [Latin](/wiki/Latin) mandragors, [[22]](#cite_note-22) which is from Ancient Greek (translit. with the \"plant of [humans](/wiki/Human)\". [[24]](#cite_note-24) Behind the scenes[ ] - A Mandrake's scream was very similar to (if not the same as) a [banshee](/wiki/Banshee)'s scream, which was also fatal. [Mandrake Mufflers](/wiki/Mandrake_Mufflers), a shop located in [Diagon Alley North Side](/wiki/Diagon_Alley_North_Side), is presumably one of the places for individuals to purchase earmuffs for the occasion. - In [LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4](/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter:_Years_1-4), Mandrakes can be found throughout the castle and grounds and their cries can be used to break glass objects, but can be only be handled when wearing [earmuffs](/wiki/Earmuffs). Also the player can make it sing as an extra (cheat code or unlocked extra). [[25]](#cite_note-LEGOY1-25) - In the [Game Boy Color version](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(GBC))of [Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(video_game)), the \"Mandrake Root\" item does not resemble the babies seen in other versions, and in fact looks more like a leaf than a root, suggesting the item is merely misnamed. - In the [film adaptation](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film))of [Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets), Mandrakes were also capable of biting people if they put fingers close to their mouths, as [Draco Malfoy](/wiki/Draco_Malfoy)learned the hard way (it is also worth noting that [Slytherins](/wiki/Slytherin)did not have Herbology lessons with Gryffindors in the [1992-1993 school year](/wiki/1992%E2%80%931993_school_year)). - When working on [Harry Potter and Chamber Secrets: Kay](/wiki/Jim_Kay)wondered, a of the Mandrake, and what would it look like?\", and used that as an inspiration when he approached the illustration. [[26]](#cite_note-JimKayComment-26)The Mandrake study may have been inspired by [Studies of the Foetus in the Womb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_of_the_Foetus_in_the_Womb)in particular. [[27]](#cite_note-27) - In the real world: - The ( [European](/wiki/Europe)) Mandrake plant has been used since [ancient times](/wiki/Middle_Ages)as a medicinal plant and has a tradition associated with [magical](/wiki/Magic)activities and witchcraft. It is a member of the nightshade family. It contains hyoscyamine, scopolamine, and mandragorin. Medically, it has been used as a pain killer and a sedative. It was used in ancient times for surgery. An overdose, though, can be fatal. [[28]](#cite_note-28)Because of its roots' shapes resembling [humans](/wiki/Human), it has been used in magical operations, and as a supposed aphrodisiac. - There are variations on the plant, Mandragora Offininarum being the most usual form, with the smaller Mandragora autumnalis having the same properties. - Some folk traditions call the M. autumnalis variety as \"Womandrake\" in distinction to M. Officinarum as \"Mandrake\". - A third variant, Mandragora turcomanica, is a nearly extinct and very rare variety, found mostly in [Turkey](/wiki/Turkey)and a few areas of [Iran](/wiki/Iran). M. turcomanica is distinguished from M. autumnalis by having larger fruit. - In the Western Hemisphere, another plant, Podophyllum petaltum, is called the American Mandrake. The American Mandrake is unrelated to the European variety, and has fewer medical applications. It, too, is poisonous. - The ( Appearances[ ] [Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(video_game))(Voice only) (Mentioned only) [Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets)(First appearance) [Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)) [Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(video_game)) [Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(video_game)) [Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire)(Mentioned only) [Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(video_game)) [Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(video_game)) [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows) [Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)](/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_(film))(Mentioned in a newspaper) [Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them](/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_(companion_book))(Mentioned only) [Harry Vault](/wiki/Harry_Potter:_The_Creature_Vault) [The Art of Harry Mini Book of Graphic Design](/wiki/The_Art_of_Harry_Potter_Mini_Book_of_Graphic_Design) [LEGO Harry Potter](/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter) [LEGO Potter for Where to Chapter (The Letter from No One) - Herbology Lesson \"Mandrakes\" - [3.0](#cite_ref-COS9_3-0) [3.1](#cite_ref-COS9_3-1) [3.2](#cite_ref-COS9_3-2) [Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets), Chapter 9 (The Writing on the Wall) - [4.0](#cite_ref-HM752p_4-0) [4.1](#cite_ref-HM752p_4-1) [Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery](/wiki/Harry_Potter:_Hogwarts_Mystery), Year 7, Chapter 52 Things Come In Threes) Potions Lesson \"Mandrake Restorative Draught\" - [5.0](#cite_ref-DH31_5-0) [5.1](#cite_ref-DH31_5-1) [Harry Potter the Chamber of Secrets](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets), Chapter 13 (The Very Secret Diary) [](#cite_ref-COS14_8-0) [Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets), Chapter 14 (Cornelius Fudge) [](#cite_ref-COS17_9-0) [Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets), Chapter 17 (The Heir of Slytherin) [](#cite_ref-GOF26_10-0) [Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire), Chapter 26 (The Second Task) [](#cite_ref-FBR_11-0) [Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them](/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_(companion_book)) [](#cite_ref-COSG_12-0) [Harry Potter and the [this image](/wiki/File:The_New_York_Ghost_Nov_28.jpg)) [](#cite_ref-OOTPG_16-0) [Harry Potter and game)](/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(video_game)) [](#cite_ref-HM3FC_17-0) [Harry "}
