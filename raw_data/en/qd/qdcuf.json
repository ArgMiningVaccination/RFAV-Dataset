St. Baldrick's Foundation, Micah Batchelor Foundation, National Pediatric Cancer Foundation, Sebastian Strong Foundation, and others). Dr. Andreansky Lab Dr. Samita Andreansky's lab centers on the development of cancer vaccines. Joining the Miller School of Medicine from the University of Arizona, Dr. Andreansky has extensive experience with viral oncology and tumor immunology. Her work is currently funded by the American Cancer Society. Dr. Barredo Lab Dr. Barredo's work focuses on investigating how tumor metabolism leads to drug resistance in acute leukemia and development of new therapies for childhood leukemia. Dr. Barredo's work has led to the discovery of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a target for acute leukemia and has resulted in the translation into three IIS for patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia, including pediatric and AYA patients. His lab uncovered that acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells are exquisitely vulnerable to ER stress secondary to metabolic and proteotoxic stress. He has also uncovered novel a role for AMPK, which differs from its canonical role, in which responses to metabolic/energy stress are mediated via binding of AMPK to chromatin leading to changes in gene expression as an adaptive/survival mechanism. [Dr. Pillai Lab](https://umiamihealth.org/en/sylvester-comprehensive-cancer-center/research/labs/pillai-lab) Dr. of Treg across major barriers and recently published novel reduced-toxicity HSCT preparative regimens harnessing these immune mechanisms in a preclinical mouse model of beta-thalassemia and in clinical series for pediatric patients with SAA. These findings have now been extended to a clinical trial using haploidentical donors to cure sickle cell disease (SCD) and other non-malignant conditions (in preparation). Additionally, her group developed a robust and reproducible protocol for ex vivo expansion of human invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and defined mechanisms to augment their cytolytic and regulatory capacity for peri-transplant and non-transplant cancer immunotherapy. - Clinical/Translational Research The Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology participates in clinical trials for children, adolescents and young adult (AYA) cancers and blood disorders.
