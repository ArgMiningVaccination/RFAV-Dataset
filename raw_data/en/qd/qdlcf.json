There were over 100 responses to the consultation from organisations and individuals. Many responses received highlighted specific points which were helpful and have been incorporated into the final version of the code. Most of those who responded felt that the code was useful and easy to understand. Several respondents made the same suggestions or comments. These are addressed below. It isn't clear what sort of data sharing, or which sort of organisations, the code is aimed at. ICO response: The scope of the code is necessarily quite broad. We have now included further clarificatio n about the types of sharing it applies to. These include the shar ing of data between different organisations, between different parts of the same organisation or sharing with a data processor. We have also clarified that the code is aimed at all organisations that share personal data, whilst acknowledgi ng that not all of the advice it contains will be relevant to all organisations. The code should contain more detailed sector or industry specific guidance. ICO response: The code needs to apply to a wide range of organisations in the public, private and third se ctor, because data protection law applies to all those organisations. This means that it was not possible or appropriate for the code to include detailed guidance to cover every orga nisation and every possible sharing scenario. As the Commissioner's foreword says, we hope that organisations with th eir own specific requirements will use the code to produce their own bespoke guidance. The code is too long. ICO response: We tried to keep the code as co ncise as we could, but had to be careful not to oversimplify or misrepresent the law. We are confident that we managed to strike the right balance between comprehensive, detaile d coverage and brevity. We felt that if we had shortened the code any further we would have had to omit coverage of some of the important data sharing issues that organisati ons often ask us to provide advice about. The code focuses too much on data sharing in the public sector. ICO response: We have considered the emphas is of the code carefully and made several changes in response to suggestions. We certainly accept that sharing within the private sector, and across the sectors, needed better coverage. In particular, we added several private sector case studies and clarified the difference between public and private sector legal frameworks. The code would benefit from the inclusion of diagrams or checklists. ICO response: The code now includes checklists which illustrate the decision making processes involved in systematic data sharing and 'ad hoc' or 'one off' data sharing. We felt these would be of more practical use than diagrams, which tended to either over- simplify or confuse matters. The code would benefit from explaining the key terms used. ICO response: We have now included a glossary of key terms. The code should contain a list of all the legislation that is relevant to data sharing. ICO response: It would be very difficult to produce and maintain an up to date list of all the legislation which is relevant to data sharing across all sectors and types of organisation. We believe the bodies involved in data sharing are in the best position to be aware of any legislation that is of specific relevance to their activities. However, we did clarify the section of the code that explains how data protection interacts with other elements of the law. The code should address international data sharing. ICO response: We believe existing ICO guidan ce on international transfers already addresses this issue in detail, and we didn't want to repeat that guidance in this code. However, we have now included references and a link to this guidance in the code. The code should provide more detail on the 'conditions' for processing personal data. ICO response: We have included a specific section that draws together the references to conditions for processing. Hopefully this will clarify how the 'conditions for proc essing' affect data sharing.
