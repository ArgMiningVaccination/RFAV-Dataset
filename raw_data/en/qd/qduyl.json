Malnutrition is a majorcause of illness and death in cancer patients who find themselves with-out the energy to prepare meals, the appetite to eat, and with an entire-ly new set of side effects and health problems to manage. Conversely,diet is also the element of treatment that patients have the most controlover; when cancer is diagnosed, proper nutrition is an important ele-ment of treatment. Patients must realize that there is no standard reaction to cancer treatment and that every patient will have a unique set of side effects. Therefore, there are no standard rules to follow with regard to diet as each individual is challenged in their o wn personal way. \"Our goal is to intervene with a patient at the beginning of treatment to work to maintain nutritional status inorder to protect the immune system and reduce the chances of developing malnutrition,\" Lisa T artamella, MS, RD, AmbulatoryNutrition Coordinator at YNNH said. T artamella and her colleagues at Yale-New Haven Hospital Nutrition Clinic regularlycounsel with cancer patients and their caregivers in both the Medical Oncology Outpatient Clinic and the Radiation TherapyClinic to create an individualized patient care plan. Common side effects of cancer treatment include: loss of appetite, sore mouth, dry throat, changes in sense of smell or taste, nausea, lactose intolerance, vomiting, and weight loss or weight gain. Not all patients will experience these side effects and many will develop their own unique set, for that reason individual nutrition plans are essential to cancer treatment. \"We aim to mo d- ify the diet to help alleviate the symptoms of cancer treatment and to help manage common side effects,\" T artamella explained. Nutritional needs increase as the body works to battle disease internally. During treatment a patient's body requires more cal ci- um, magnesium, iron, and potassium to give the body enough energy to fight disease. These nutrients are essential to building and replacing healthy cells that are often destroyed by cancerous cells. \"My recommendation is to eat a balanced diet obtaining th e nutri- ents necessary through food versus relying on supplements. Very often nutritional supplements are highly concentrated and caninterfere with the patient's treatment plan, it is important to check with the physician before taking sup plements,\" T artamella said.AS CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT CONTINUES to evolve to create more customized treatment options, Dr. Edward Chu, Director of the VACT Cancer Center and Associate Director of YaleCancer Center, is working to improve the quality of lifeand outlook for colorectal cancer patients. Dr. Chu isworking along with Dr. Yung-Chi Cheng, Professor ofPharmacology in the Yale University School ofMedicine, to determine the impact of Chinese herbaltherapies on colorectal cancer patients. Although advances in colorectal cancer have been made in recent years, the five-year survival rate forpatients with stage IV colorectal cancer remains lessthan five percent. The standard treatment for stage IV patients includes surgery, chemotherapy, and clinical tri-als for new drugs, all of which are invasive and potential-ly toxic to the patient. Drs. Chu and Cheng are workingto diminish the toxic side effects of chemotherapy byusing herbal therapies in conjunction with the currenttreatments. \"The entire field of cancer research is heading toward more individualized approaches to treatment inorder to create more effective therapies, which are lessAncient Chinese Herbs Helping to Alleviate Symptoms in Colorectal Cancer PatientsYale CANCER CENTERspring/summmer 2002 continued on page 5 Yale Cancer Center is proud that 20 of ourmembers were includedin New York Magazine's The Best Doctors in NewYork issue on June 10,2002.

Jerry Domian Jerry Domian Jerry Domian Jerry Domian Jerry Domian research AS PATIENT CARE BECOMES MORE COMPLEX with an increas- ing number of treatment options available to cancer patients,Oncology Nurse Practitioners (ONP) have evolved into importantpartners in patient care. The outpatient clinic at Yale Cancer Centerhas two resident Oncology Nurse Practitioners to aid the physiciansand nurses in the development of patient care, research, and education. \"As patient needs have multiplied, increasingly complex symp- toms have created a need for additional support and services. TheOncology Nurse Practitioners help to provide continuity of care with-in the clinic,\" Marianne Davies, APRN said. The ONP assumes the responsibility for ongoing assessment and management of patient care needs while the physician monitors thedisease response and treatment options. ONPs obtain medical histo-ries, perform physical examinations, diagnose and treat many healthproblems, and help to manage symptoms associated with cancer treat-ment. \"It is important to maintain stability for the patients whileundergoing treatment during frequent clinic visits and hospitaliza-tions, the availability of ONPs for visits and telephone consultationshelps to relieve patient anxiety,\" Davies explained. The Yale School of Nursing offers a Masters Degree specializing in Oncology Nursing to prepare advanced practice nurses to provide com-prehensive care and support to cancer patients and families. M. TishKnobf, Associate Professor of Nursing and director of the programexplained necessity of the program, \"The ONP utilizes in-depthknowledge and advance practice skills to assess, prevent, diagnose, andmanage common health problems of adults and the physical and psy-chological symptoms associated with the disease and treatment.\"Spotlight on Nursing: Oncology Nurse Practitioners \"The holistic philosophy of the advanced practice nurse goes beyond the disease model of care and incorporates the emotional, social,and spiritual aspects of the patient into the plan of care. As cancer ther-apies grow increasingly complex and move into ambulatory settings,patients, families and caregivers can benefit from a provider who can notonly assess and manage the disease but also coordinate care, demystifythe process with ongoing information, and provide supportive interven-tions throughout the trajectory of the cancer experience.\" Marianne Davies, APRN and Rebecca Edwards, APRN work with approximately 65% of the patients in the clinic in conjunctionwith the primary physicians and oncology fellows. They see 20-30patients per day and are working hard to increase the personal atten-tion offered by forming bonds with patients and families during regu-lar clinic visits. Jennifer Alcantara, a patient of Dr. John Murren and Marianne Davies, APRN, was both impressed with and thankful for her care atYale with Ms. Davies' help. \"She was very helpful and made me feelextremely comfortable during my visits to the clinic. My treatmentwas much easier with Marianne to rely on,\" Alcantara said. 5Although nutritional plans vary by patient, the YNHH Nutrition Clinic focuses on the following general nutritional guidelines for allcancer patients: Go Back to Basics. Concentrate on the USDA recommenda- tion of 5 A Day, five servings of fruits and vegetables daily. Drink adequate fluids. At least eight glasses of water or juices a day, particularly during the hot summer months. Be aware of food safety. Properly wash and cook foods before consuming. Eat a variety of foods, especially whole grains. Modify fat intake by decreasing the amount of saturated fat con- sumed. Focus on healthy fats, like those in olive oil, nuts, and fish. Use added sugar and salt in moderation. Maintain a healthy weight. \"The combination of proper nutrition, exercise, and stress manage- ment creates a well-rounded care plan. Our goal is to focus on theentire individual, ultimately aiding in their treatment of cancer,\"T artamella said.

There are two major areas in col- orectal cancer, which follow this trend: individual molecular profilingof a tumor to allow targeted treatment decisions to be made and theprediction of patient response to chemotherapy in order to determinethe potential toxicity profile of an individual patient. One of the major side effects of current chemotherapy treat- ments for colorectal cancer patients is diarrhea. In some cases, thediarrhea is so severe that it has resulted in fatal outcomes. Dr.Cheng has discovered a combination of four herbs, which havebeen used to cure stomach ailments in China and T aiwan for thepast 2,000 years, and in particular, diarrhea. Working withPhytoceutica, a newly developed herbal medicine company here inNew Haven, he has combined and formulated these herbs into atablet form called PHY-906 and is currently collaborating with Dr.Chu and Dr. Shivaani Kummar of the VA CT Cancer Center andthe Developmental Therapeutics Program of Yale Cancer Centerto test PHY-906 in the clinical setting. T o date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been extremely cautious in allowing herbal medicine trials to be devel-oped, mainly because of possible chemical inconsistencies in thebatches of herbs used. T o overcome this problem, Dr. Cheng hasdeveloped a novel method to fingerprint the herbs using both achemical fingerprint and a chemical test using acid to mimic theenvironment of the PHY-906 herb while passing through the diges-tive system. \"The hope is that this fingerprint profiling, which testsboth the biological and chemical composition of the herbs, will act asa paradigm to ensure the quality control of any herb being tested infuture clinical studies,\" Chu said. T esting done in Dr. Cheng's laboratory on mice revealed that PHY-906 significantly lowered the toxicity levels of those beingtreated with chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. Evidence of anti-tumor activity was also seen, giving additional encouragement forthe clinical trial. Dr. Shivaani Kummar is currently accruing patients with stage IV colorectal cancer for the clinical trial, which was approved inDecember 2001, to test the effects of PHY-906 on the toxicity ofchemotherapy with specific focus on diarrhea. It is estimated that theclinical results from this trial will be available within the next year.
