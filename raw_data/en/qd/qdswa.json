In a first of its kind pharmacodynamic study ( \"Despite our collective effort to stem opioid abuse in America, addiction can happen to anyone, and millions of people are at risk for not only opioid overdose, but also poisoning from illicit synthetic opioids such as fentanyl,\" said Jerome Adams, MD, MPH, Executive Director of Health Equity Initiatives, Purdue University. \"With OPVEE, first responders will have a fast and long-acting rescue medication option to combat the current opioid epidemic and save lives.\" The speed of action, long duration, and high potency of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are driving unprecedented overdose deaths across a broader range of ages, and they are now a leading cause of death for people ages 18 to 45.5 For each opioid-induced fatality, it has been estimated that there are an additional 6.4-8.4 non-fatal overdoses that can lead to long-term physical and mental disability.6 \"I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of the opioid crisis on college campuses and in emergency rooms,\" said Madeline Hilliard, Founder, Team Awareness Combating Overdose (TACO) and DopaGE. \"The FDA approval of OPVEE is good news for everyone impacted by the overdose crisis. In fact, it uses the same device as currently available nasal overdose reversal agents on the market.\" A federally funded contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the US Department of Health and Human Services, for up to $10.8 million, combined with a $7.4 million U01 \"grand opportunities in medications development\" grant received from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), supported the development of OPVEE. The contract (number HHSO100201800029C) with BARDA was intended to develop OPVEE for reversal of opioid overdoses in the community and as a medical countermeasure and reversal agent in the event of a chemical attack using synthetic opioids. OPVEE is expected to be in the market in Q4 of 2023. Indivior added OPVEE to its portfolio with the acquisition of Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which closed March 2, 2023. As previously indicated, Indivior believes the clinical profile of OPVEE supports the potential for this treatment to deliver annual net revenue of $150 million to $250 million, with expected earnings accretion from the Opiant acquisition after the second full year of launch of OPVEE. About OPVEE\u00ae (nalmefene) Nasal Spray OPVEE contains the opioid receptor antagonist nalmefene, which works quickly by blocking the brain opioid receptors. In a clinical model of opioid-induced respiratory depression in opioid-experienced, non-dependent subjects, OPVEE had an onset of action of 2.5 to 5 minutes and fully reversed respiratory depression as early as 5 minutes after OPVEE administration.2 Other clinical data include a terminal plasma half-life of approximately 11 hours.2 While the duration of action of nalmefene is as long as most opioids, a recurrence of respiratory depression is possible.2 Most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 2%) are nasal discomfort, headache, nausea, dizziness, hot flush, vomiting, anxiety, fatigue, nasal congestion, throat irritation, rhinalgia, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, erythema, and hyperhidrosis. HIGHLIGHTED SAFETY INFORMATION INDICATION OPVEE nasal spray is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected overdose induced by natural or synthetic opioids in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. OPVEE nasal spray is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present. OPVEE nasal spray is not a substitute for emergency medical care. HIGHLIGHTED SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to nalmefene or to any of the other ingredients. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Risk of Recurrent Respiratory and Central Nervous System Depression: While the duration of action of nalmefene is as long as most opioids, a recurrence of respiratory depression is possible, therefore, keep patient under continued surveillance and administer repeat doses of OPVEE using a new nasal spray with each dose, as necessary, while awaiting emergency medical assistance. Limited Efficacy with Partial Agonists or Mixed Agonist/Antagonists: Reversal of respiratory depression caused by partial agonists or mixed agonists/antagonists, such as buprenorphine and pentazocine, may be incomplete. Larger or repeat doses may be required. Precipitation of Severe Opioid Withdrawal: Use in patients who are opioid dependent may precipitate opioid withdrawal. In neonates, opioid withdrawal may be life-threatening if not recognized and properly treated. Monitor for the development of opioid withdrawal. Risk of Cardiovascular (CV) Effects: Abrupt postoperative reversal of opioid depression may result in adverse CV effects. These events have primarily occurred in patients who had preexisting CV disorders or received other drugs that may have similar adverse CV effects. Monitor these patients closely in an appropriate healthcare setting after use of nalmefene hydrochloride. Risk of Opioid Overdose from Attempts to Overcome the Blockade: Attempts to overcome opioid withdrawal symptoms caused by opioid antagonists with high or repeated doses of exogenous opioids may lead to opioid intoxication and death. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 2%) are nasal discomfort, headache, nausea, dizziness, hot flush, vomiting, anxiety, fatigue, nasal congestion, throat irritation, rhinalgia, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, erythema, and hyperhidrosis.
