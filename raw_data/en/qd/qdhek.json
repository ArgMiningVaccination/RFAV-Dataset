The immune system carries out three important functions: - It helps fight disease-causing germs or pathogens like viruses, bacteria and eliminates them from your body. - It recognises and neutralises the harmful substances from your surroundings - It fights the diseases-causing changes in the body, like the cancer cells In the purview of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a healthy immune system's importance has become even more prominent. Several health experts from around the world have corroborated that among those who have tested positive for Coronavirus, ones with a weak immune system are the most vulnerable to meet with fatal consequences. As the countries are grappling with the imminent dangers that the deadly Coronavirus pose, the healthcare experts suggest that people must focus on building their immune system to counter the virus attack. One of the best ways to build your immune system and make it stronger is through dietary control. The food you eat plays a vital role in determining your immunity strength and overall health. Some of the best foods that you can consume in your daily diet to boost your immune system are listed below: 1. Citrus FruitsThere are millions of studies and research reports that stress the importance of eating fruits every day to keep your body fit and strong. Many doctors recommend vitamin C-based supplements and capsules to beat common infections that cause cold, flu because it makes your immune system stronger. But, instead of taking supplements, it is best advised to include any citrus fruit of your choice in your daily diet to get your dose of Vitamin-C and keep the infections at bay. Vitamin-C is known to increase WBC production (white blood cells), which are vital to fighting infections. Some of the popular citrus fruits are - organs, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins. 2. BroccoliBroccoli is one of the most nutrition-rich foods; it is packed with essential vitamins like Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and several antioxidants. Research has shown that it is one of the healthiest vegetables that boost the immune system and promotes overall well-being. Dieticians and food experts suggest that the best way to get the maximum nutritional benefits out of broccoli is to cook it to the minimal, or it is better to consume it raw. You can include a few florets of broccoli in your daily salad, or steam it and have it as a snack. 3. SpinachThis leafy vegetable is replete with numerous antioxidants and is one of the richest Vitamin C sources, a vital nutrient that increases the immune system's infection-fighting abilities. Like broccoli, the best way to consume spinach is to cook it as little as possible to assimilate maximum nutrients. 4. GarlicIt is one of the most common ingredients in the Indian kitchen. Known for its pungent smell and taste, garlic not only adds a bit of zing to your food, but it also promotes your well-being. Several studies have linked garlic to fighting infections. Its immunity booster properties stem from the heavy concentration of sulfur compounds like allicin, alliin, and allyl propyl disulfide. 5. is well-known for its anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory properties as much as it is known for its bright yellow colour. The spice is used almost all the cuisines globally, and research shows that daily inclusion of the spice in the food boosts the immune system. The high concentration of curcumin in turmeric is also known to reduce muscle damage. 6. AlmondsIt is common to believe that fat is bad for the body, but not all fat is detrimental; the human body needs good fat, and almonds are among the richest sources of healthy fats. Additionally, almonds contain high amounts of Vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant vital for the healthy functioning of the immune system. 7. GingerGinger is one of the most versatile ingredients used extensively globally in savoury and sweet dishes and even in beverages. Not only does the zingy taste of the ginger add more flavour to the food, but its rich antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties promote the overall well-being of your health. Many studies have linked ginger to alleviating chronic pain and lowering cholesterol. 8. KiwisThe humble-looking Kiwis is one of the most underrated fruits, but it is packed with several nutrients that promote overall well-being. It is a rich source of potassium, vitamin C, and vitamin K. Vitamin C boosts the white blood cells to ward off infection, whereas the other nutrients ensure the body's sound functioning. 9. Green TeaTea is an inherent part of several cultures around the world. Today, several health experts, fitness coaches, and dieticians recommend having green tea for weight loss. But, green tea is also a powerful food item that works as an immunity booster and makes your body resistant to illnesses and infections. 10. Sweet PotatoesWhen you think of the immune system, you may probably not think of skin as part of it. But, the skin is the single largest organ in your body, and it acts as the first line of defence against viruses and other harmful substances. To stay healthy and strong, the skin needs vitamin A, which plays a pivotal role in the production of connective tissue, and one of the best ways to get this vital nutrient is to include sweet potato in your daily diet. Other alternative foods that have Vitamin A are carrots and pumpkin. 11. MushroomsFor several centuries, people from around the world have turned to mushrooms for a healthy immune system. Many modern students have proved that mushrooms increase the white blood cells' production and activity, which is vital for fighting infection. 12. BlueberriesAll kinds of berries are known to be wonder foods, be it acai berry, gooseberry, or cranberries. But, when it comes to boosting the immune system, Blueberries are the best. A study in 2016 stated that these delicious-tasting berries contain high amounts of flavonoids that play an important role in boosting the respiratory tract's immune system. 13. YogurtA staple food in almost every Indian home, yogurt has active cultures that stimulate the immune system to fight the diseases. Experts recommend consuming a bowl full of plain yogurt rather than the flavoured ones loaded with sugar. You can sweeten the yogurt with fruits, berries or even add a spoonful of honey. Yogurts are also an excellent vitamin D source, which helps regulate the immune system and increase your body's natural defence system against diseases. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many clinical studies are underway to study the possible effects of yogurt in controlling the Coronavirus. 14. PoultryMost people who eat chicken invariably crave a bowl of chicken soup when they are sick. Apart from satiating your taste buds, chicken soups help lower inflammation, which in turn improves your defences against common cold and flu symptoms. Poultry such as chicken and turkey are rich in Vitamin B-6, an important compound that helps in the formation of new and healthy red blood cells. 15. FishFishes like tuna, salmon are known to contain omega-3 fatty acids in abundance. According to a medical report published in 2014, long-term intake of omega-3 fatty acids reduces rheumatoid arthritis risk. These nutrients are also known to lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke. While it is important to maintain a healthy diet and indulge in a regular workout to boost your immune system, you must also be prepared for the worst. And one of the best ways to keep yourself protected from any medical conditions is to have a health insurance policy. It plays a vital role in helping you get the best medical treatment facility while keeping your hard-earned savings intact. Today, many insurers in India offer [various health insurance policies](https://www.adityabirlacapital.com/abc-of-money/4-types-of-health-insurance-plans)to suit people's varying needs. You must be prudent in your choice of health policy. Ensure that you choose a policy with sufficient sum assured so that it helps you get ample coverage for all family members and ensure that you get the right add-ons to give your family the best safety net they deserve.
