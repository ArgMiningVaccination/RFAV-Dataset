From amethyst to zincite, there is a whole alphabet of crystals available on the market today. This guide to 10 powerful types of healing stones and their properties can help you find the perfect one for your intention. Advertisement How to find the right crystal for you. According to [Ashley Leavy](https://loveandlightschool.com/about/), founder and educational director of the [Love and Light School of Crystal Therapy](https://loveandlightschool.com/), there are a couple of ways to go about finding a crystal: Advertisement Follow your intuition. First, you can go the intuitive route. Check out a local crystal shop and really immerse yourself in the space. \"Take a step back and look at the different crystals,\" she says. You may find one is undoubtedly calling out to you. \"Hold your hands over them and see if you feel anything that draws you in,\" she suggests, or close your eyes, then open them, \"and see which one really stands out,\" she adds. Research the best stone for your needs. Alternatively, you can choose a stone based on what you want to call into your life. Beginners can research the qualities of different crystals, knowing that everyone will have a slightly different experience with them. Before you go the research route, it's important to take some time to consider what you really need. Leavy notes that she's had people come into her store looking for a crystal for love, for example, when it turns out what they really needed in the love department was more confidence or better communication. Finding ethically & sustainably sourced crystals. As far as purchasing ethically and sustainably sourced crystals, Leavy says the four main questions you want to consider include: - Are the working conditions for the people mining those crystals safe? - Are they given fair pay? - Was there child labor involved? - Is there minimal environmental impact? Advertisement \"A lot of times people use 'ethical' as kind of a blanket term,\" she adds, so it's worthwhile to ask a supplier these questions. Leavy also advises getting familiar with specific areas of the world where there are big environmental impacts from mining, where workers are not paid fairly, where there are unsafe mining conditions, and where there are child labor issues, and intentionally being more cautious when purchasing crystals from those areas. 10 powerful crystals & how to use them: For happiness: Citrine Advertisement Citrine is a [crystal of happiness](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/crystals-for-mood-boost) and presence. \"Holding one serves as a friendly reminder to be really mindful and appreciate the world as it is right now,\" crystal expert [Heather Askinosie](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/heather-askinosie) previously wrote for mbg. It's a great manifestation stone and encourages us to follow our dreams, stay positive, and walk through life with gratitude. It's associated with the [solar plexus chakra](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/shadow-qualities-of-solar-plexus-and-how-to-find-its-gift) and is a powerful crystal to use during [breathwork](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/breathwork-for-anxiety). How to use it: Yulia Van Doren of [goldirocks](https://www.instagram.com/goldirocks.co/) recommends this visualization for citrine: - Find a quiet spot and kick off your shoes so your feet can make a connection with the ground. - Hold a piece of citrine in your hands, or lay one on your navel, and imagine a specific goal you have. Visualize that goal in a clear balloon, and let it hang a few feet in front of you. - Imagine energizing flames beginning to emerge from your citrine crystal, flickering upward and outward, slowly changing the color of the balloon from clear to a golden, fiery orange. - With a puff, blow the shimmering balloon up and away, to the land where dreams always come true and to-do lists are always finished on time. - Don't forget to thank your crystal when finished; your gratitude unplugs your personal energy from the crystal, a very important final step.

It's long been revered for helping to balance the body and clear the mind, and its clear color makes it a versatile stone for a variety of scenarios and situations. \"For that reason, this is a great stone to start with if you're a total beginner to the world of crystal healing,\" she adds.

For grounding: Black Obsidian [Black obsidian](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/obsidian-crystal) is an excellent choice if you're in need of grounding. It offers a calming and positive energy that can help you find perspective and stay hopeful. It can also help with getting centered, feeling present, clearing energy, and connecting to the earth and our own bodies. How to use it: On any given day that you know might be emotionally turbulent or otherwise ungrounded, keep your black obsidian on you, somewhere it's easy to grab, like in your pocket or a purse.

Where it's from: Leavy notes black obsidian usually comes from countries in Central America, like Mexico or Guatemala, where there's a lot of volcanic activity. It's also scattered throughout countries in South America, including Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, and Guatemala, and even up north in Canada and the United States.

And as Leavy adds, it can also help you better integrate cosmic wisdom and karmic lessons, as \"its high vibration helps to bring your spiritual body down into the physical plane.\" How to use it: Leavy recommends simply wearing a piece of shungite jewelry to stay centered. \"Any time you're feeling overwhelmed, bring your attention to the place where the stone is making contact with your physical body, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and then exhale for a count of four. This deep, rhythmic breathing will bring you back to your center and will help create stillness in your mind.\" Where it's from: Northwest Russia is where the largest and oldest source of shungite lies, but there are also other deposits in Austria, India, Kazakhstan, and the Congo.

It can be used to remove blocks that leave us feeling burned out, uninspired, and stuck. And because [creative energy](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/these-are-the-best-crystals-for-love-creativity-and-protection) and sexual energy are both associated with the sacral chakra, you guessed it, carnelian is also great for amping up sexual energy.

You can also place it by [your vision board](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-make-a-vision-board), to give your manifestations a little extra oomph. Where it's from: Most of the commercial carnelian you can purchase today is mined in India, though it's been found all over the world.

Whether you just bought a new crystal, or you've had one for a while that needs an energetic refresh, it's always a good idea to keep your crystals clean, clear, and activated. There are many ways to do so, so be sure to check out our [full guide on crystal cleaning](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-clean-store-program-your-crystals) and [charging](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-charge-crystals). Some crystals can be cleaned with water, but some can't, depending on porosity, so it's always best to check specific guidelines, stone by stone. It's also important to store them in a safe place where they won't be damaged, especially if they have any sharp edges that can easily break off. Wrap them up in a soft pouch or piece of fabric when you're not using them, and if you display them on your altar or anywhere else in your home, be sure to clean them once in a while. The bottom line. Once you know the basics of the crystals in your collection, you'll find it's really quite simple to [incorporate them into your everyday life](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/how-to-use-crystals-everyday). One day you may need confidence, and you can grab your carnelian. The next, maybe you want to feel more grounded, so you reach for your obsidian. There's one thing you can be sure of: No matter what you need, there's definitely a crystal out there to help support you as you go after it.
