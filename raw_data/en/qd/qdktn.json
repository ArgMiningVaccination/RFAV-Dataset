V-safe is a new smart phone -based system that uses text messaging to initiate web -based survey monitoring in the form of periodic health check- ins to assess for potential adverse events following vaccination . CDC will use the follow -up capability of the existing Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) call center to conduct active telephone follow -up on recipients reporting a significant , medically attended health impacts during v- safe health check -ins. The purpose of v- safe surveillance is to rapidly characterize the safety profile of COVID -19 vaccines when given outside a clinical trial setting and to detect and evaluate clinically important adverse events and safety issues that might impact policy or r egulatory decisions . Background and significance Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2). Following the emergence of COVID -19 in China in late 2019, the first confirmed U.S. cases were detected in January 2020. With rapid human- to-human transmission occurring, the United States declared a public health emergency in February 2020, followed by a national emergency in March 2020 (1). As of November 18, 2020, there have been 11,300,635 cases of COVID -19 disease in the United States and 247,834 deaths ( 2). A key U.S. pandemic response initiative is Operation Warp Speed, a public -private partnership established in May 2020, with a goal to develop and deliver safe and effective COVID -19 vaccine(s) to the U.S. population by early 2021 (3). Post-authorization/ post-approval vaccine safety monitoring is a federal government responsibility, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA sharing most of the responsibility along with other federal agencies involved in healthcare delivery (e.g., Veterans Affairs , Department of Defense, Indian Health Service ). Initial safety assessment begins in early vaccine de velopment and expands during phased clinical trials in humans. Clinical trials are effective at identifying and characterizing common adverse events, such as local and systemic reactions . However , even large clinical trials, like the COVID -19 vaccine v-safe protocol : May 20, 2021, version 3 Page 4 of 55 clinical trials that are enrolling tens of thousands of volunteers, might not be large enough to detect rare adverse events ( for example, those occurring at rates of <1 per 100,000 people vaccinated ). Furthermore, for some clinical trials of COVID -19 vaccines, the follow -up period to monitor for possible adverse events with delayed onset may not be completed for all subjects prior to issuance of an EUA or licensure. Additionally, exclusion criteria for clinical trials may limit generalizability of safety and eff icacy findings to special populations, such as those with certain chronic illnesses or pregnant women (4). For these reasons, robust post - authorization/approval safety monitoring of COVID -19 vaccines is a public health priority. To meet the safety data needs for COVID -19 vaccine pharmacovigilance during the post - authorization/approval period, CDC will implement v -safe, a smart phone -based system that uses text messaging to initiate web -based surveys to monitor for adverse events following vaccination . The s urveillance process triggers active telephone follow -up on vaccinated individuals reporting a significant , medically attended health impact during v- safe health check - ins. Goals and objectives Goals Characterize the safety profile of COVID -19 vaccines . Rapidly monitor and identify potential safety problems associated with COVID -19 vaccines that would impact policy or regulatory decisions . Objectives Characterize the local and systemic reactogenicity of COVID -19 vaccines during the first week post -vaccination (days 0 -7). Identify and characterize clinically important adverse events following COVID -19 vaccin ation during a 6 -week post -vaccination follow -up period. v-safe protocol : May 20, 2021, version 3 Page 5 of 55 Monitor the long(er)- term ( 3, 6, and 12 months post -vaccination ) safety of COVID -19 vaccines . Methods Surveillance p opulation All people in the United States who receive a COVID -19 vaccination will be eligible to enroll in v-safe for the duration of the v- safe program . Surveys will be available in English, Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean languages. Enrollment criteria: - Participants must have received a COVID -19 vaccination. - Participants or their parent/guardian must possess a smartphone with a valid US telephone number. More than one individual may use the same smartphone/telephone number (i.e., shared smartphone) . Enrollment The v -safe program will commence when COVID -19 vaccines are authorized or approved for use and become available to the U.S. population. Vaccination may occur at a mass vaccination clinic, an occupational health clinic, a public health clinic, a healthcare provider's office, a pharmacy, or other setting. At the time of vaccination, the healthcare provider will briefly describe the v -safe program using a prescribed script . In addition, the healthcare provider will provide the vaccinated patient with an information sheet that includes a brief description of the program, a URL and a scannable QR code, and enrollment instructions. Vaccinated individuals can enroll in v- safe immediately following vaccination or at a later date; surveys will be timed appropriately based on vaccination date(s) . For vaccine recipients whose vaccination information is captured in CDC's Vaccine Administration Management System (VAMS), VAMS will send recipients a reminder text message about v -safe 24 hours after vaccination (5). For vaccine recipients receiving a 2 -dose vaccine, v- safe will send a text reminder to participants that they should schedule the ir second dose. Participation in v -safe is v-safe protocol : May 20, 2021, version 3 Page 6 of 55 voluntary and people can opt out at any time by texting \"STOP\" when v- safe sends a reminder text message; people can also start v -safe again by texting \"UNSTOP .\" Once a vaccinated individual decides to enroll in v- safe, the individual will either scan his/her mobile phone camera over the QR code on the information sheet or type in the v- safe URL to access the v -safe registration website. Registration information includ es: First name Last name Mobile phone number Date of birth Sex Zip code If registering in v -safe on behalf of a dependent , the original registra nt will also be asked to supply the following: First name of dependent Last name of dependent Date of birth of dependent Sex of dependent Zip code of dependent Relationship to dependent (child or adolescent, adult friend or relative, other) The registration system will ask the participant to verify their phone number by sending a text message with a verification co de. The participant will enter the texted code to verify their identity. After that, the participant will be asked to record information on their first COVID -19 vaccin ation (or that of their dependent) , including the vaccine manufacturer and the vaccination date. If the v -safe participant does not know this information, they are encouraged to refer to the vaccination record card they received or to contact their health care provider. Once a participant has registered and provided information on the ir COVID -19 vaccination , they will be prompted to take an initial v -safe health check -in survey for themselves or their dependent . The survey will be dependent on the vaccination date and dose number (if applicable) v-safe protocol : May 20, 2021, version 3 Page 7 of 55 entered during registration. Subsequently, text messages will be sent to their smartphone with a link to a web -based survey at 2 :00 pm (local time based on zip code entered at registration) on the schedule listed below . Surveys for all timepoints are included in A ttachment 1. Electronic health check -in schedule The schedule for electronic health check -ins is as follows: 1. Day 0 (day of vaccination) 2. Daily on days 1-7 (the 1st week post -vaccination) 3. Weekly starting day 14 (2nd week post -vaccination) to up to day 42 (6th week post - vaccination) if no 2nd dose of COVID -19 vaccine is received a. If participant receive a 2nd COVID- 19 vaccine dose during the post -vaccination follow -up period, the process will reset to day 0 for the 2nd dose and continue through steps 1- 3 above based on time since the 2nd dose . 4. At 3, 6, and 12 months post -vaccination following 2nd dose vaccination or following first dose if no 2nd dose is received Daily surveys expire at midnight on the day of the surv ey and weekly surveys expire at midnight on the last day of the week before the next weekly survey period. The day 42 survey will expire on day 48 at midnight . Monthly surveys will be available for 6 full days following receipt of the survey, expiring at m idnight. A participant cannot go back and complete surveys for timepoints prior to their registration (i.e., surveys will be prospective from the time of enrollment) . In addition, a participant cannot revise their survey once it has been submitted. After submission, the participant is told that depending on his/her answers, someone from CDC might call to follow up. Active telephone follow -up v-safe protocol : May 20, 2021, version 3 Page 8 of 55 If, during any v- safe health check -in, a participant reports a significant , medically -attended health impact event for themselves or their dependent , including but not exclusive to requiring care in a hospital or emergency room setting, VAERS call center staff will be informed and active telephone follow -up will be initiated to check on the patient and take a VAERS report if appropriate . VAERS is an existing national spontaneous reporting system that is co- managed b y FDA and CDC. It serves as an early warning system for adverse events following vaccination (6). VAERS call center staff will be notified of participants who have reported a significant health impact event via a data set that will be created from the v -safe survey system . The data set will include the following variables: Unique v- safe id First name Last name Phone number Sex Age Zip code First name of guardian , if applicable Last name of guardian, if applicable Relationship to guardian, if a pplicable Flagged h ealth i mpact number (dose/survey [ i.e., Dose2D0 ]) Using this information, the VAERS call center staff will call participants identified in the data set and complete a VAERS report (located at https://vaers.hhs.gov) by phone if appropriate . Data collection, quality, and management V-safe data will be collected , managed , and housed on a secure server by Oracle. Through Health and Human S ervices (HHS) , Oracle has donated IT services to any agency conducting COVID- 19 related activities. Oracle is providing IT support for v- safe. All data will be stored, processed , and transmitted in accordance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and based on NIST st andards. Data will be housed in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) U .S. Government Cloud tenancy ; the OCI U .S. government tenancy is Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program ( FEDRAMP ) approved (7). v-safe protocol : May 20, 2021, version 3 Page 9 of 55 Per Oracle's internal policies, Oracle staff will not be able to view any individualized survey data (including variables with personal ly identifiable information [ PII]) but, rather , will have access to aggregate deidentified data for reporting. CDC will have \" read\" access to the individualized surve y data , including PII, provided by Oracle. On a continuous basis (either daily or weekly), these survey data will be accessible to CDC through downloads from the secure server . The v - safe system employ s strict security measures appropriate for the level of sensitivity of the data. Data received by CDC will be stored on an internal secure CDC/ISO server and access will be limited to authorized personnel. Oracle will create a data set for the VAERS call center that includes those participants who reported h aving a heath impact event that requires call follow -up. CDC -badged contractors will access these data in order to provide call center representatives with information needed to follow up with participants (see \"Active telephone follow -up\" above) . The VAERS call center staff is employed specifically for v- safe follow -up and is associated with the overall VAERS contractor. VAERS reports will be obtained during active telephone follow -up with v-safe participants and will be processed, handled, stored, and accessed in accordance with existing approved VAERS procedures and policies. Data from all components of v- safe, as well as VAERS reports obtained through the call center , may be combined into a master data set behind the CDC firewall using unique identification numbers assigned at registration. Preapproved CDC investigators and data managers , including CDC contractors, will be the only individuals with access to the full data (v -safe, linked VAERS reports ). All electronic documents, data set s, and files relevant to the project will be stored on network folders with restricted access on CDC computers. The v- safe team at CDC will be primarily responsible for data management activities, including data extraction, documentation, and archival of a final data set for data sharing purposes. The archive will include the protocol, statistical programs, human v-safe protocol : May 20, 2021, version 3 Page 10 of 55 subjects review documents, statistical output, analytical data sets, and manuscripts. It will clearly identify the permanent storage location for these files . A final data set at the end of the v -safe program with deidentifi ed aggregate data will be made available for external data requests or through Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests. Analysis p lan Descriptive analyses will be conducted using the data collected through surveys on a weekly basis during the surveillance period. Participation rates over time will also be calculated. For v -safe participants who have a VAERS report submitted through the VAERS call center, addit ional analyses will be conducted. Rates of serious events as well as adverse events of special interest (AESI) following COVID -19 vaccination will be generated using VAERS reports solicited via v -safe to define the numerator and v-safe participants as the denominator (Attachment 2) . VAERS reports that are considered serious or AESI will be reviewed by medical staff at CDC. Case definitions (Brighton Collaboration or other standard definitions as appropriate) will be applied to the AESI s. Reporting rates for each AESI will be calculated and compared to established background rates. If at any time rates observed in v -safe exceed what is expected from background rat es, further investigation will occur within other vaccine safety monitoring systems, including VAERS and Vaccine Safety Datalink (7). VAERS monitoring for all COVID -19 reports will include VAERS reports solicited from v -safe participants . Reports obtained from v -safe participants during call center outreach will be coded so that they can be distinguished from other VAERS reports and analyzed separately from other VAERS reports if needed. Human s ubjects c onsiderations and c onfidentiality This protocol will require human subjects determination at CDC since CDC is the lead site and surveillance data will include collection of PII . No PII will be included in any v- safe analyses , manuscripts, or data sets shared through external data requests . Participation is completely voluntary and individuals self -enroll. Participants can elect to stop text notifications at any time v-safe protocol : May 20, 2021, version 3 Page 11 of 55 and their data will be used for those surveys completed prior to opting out . Participants who request to be removed entirely f rom the system will be inactivated in v -safe so that their registration record is deleted , and their health survey data w ill not be included in future analyses. As an analysis of data collected for non -research purposes , this activity presents minimal risk to subjects, and use of patient data for this purpose will not adversely affect subjects' rights or welfare. Duration The anticipated duration of the v- safe program is at least one year of active enrollment , based on anticipated length of emergency use authorizations for COVID -19 vaccines . The decision to discontinue v- safe or to modify v- safe procedures to scale back active telephone follow -up will be made in consultation with the CDC COVID -19 Vaccine Task Force leadership and FDA. Limitations a nd challenges Limitations and challenges for v- safe surveillance include: Enrollment and registration will initially be a manual process and will be dependent on healthcare provider s sharing information about the system with vaccine recipients . Enrollment might be limited . While VAMS will help promote v -safe enrollment though automated text message reminders, not all jurisdictions will use VAMS , and VAMS text messaging capabilities may not be rolled out until several weeks/months afte r vaccine becomes available. Accurate capture of vaccine manufacturer information will depend on accurate self - report, at least initially . Vaccine recipients are expected to receive vaccination record cards specifying the vaccine they received, which might help to improve accuracy of these data. v-safe protocol : May 20, 2021, version 3 Page 12 of 55 Vaccinated people who choose to participate in v- safe might be different from those who decline; therefore, rates of side effects and adverse events generated from v -safe might not be generalizable to the full population of vaccine recipients . V-safe allows people to enter late in the post -vaccination monitoring period. The group of individuals who enroll in v- safe late might be heterogenous -those who simply neglected to enroll early, those who chose to enroll only after experiencing a clinically important adverse event, and others. Data collected from these individuals may need to be analyzed separately from data from those who enrolled early. The information provided by v- safe participants at 3, 6, and 12 months after vaccination might be impacted by recall bias. Participa nts will likely be lost to follow -up at later time points , reducing participant numbers and likely creating biases in v- safe analyses of safety out to 12 months. Because v -safe relies on vaccine recipients report ing their own experience s after vaccination, v- safe is not conducive to capturing the adverse event of death following vaccination. Dissemination Data from v -safe will be important in the beginning phases of the COVID -19 vaccination program. Regular updates will be provided to advisory committees and data review groups. It is anticipated that v -safe data will be shared with the scientific community and with the public through manuscripts and public reports. v-safe protocol : May 20, 2021, version 3 Page 13 of 55 References 1.
