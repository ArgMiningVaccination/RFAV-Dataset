It's a surprisingly controversial topic. While many conventional candles are still made with questionable ingredients, including [paraffin wax](/health/paraffin-wax), synthetic fragrances, and inferior oils, evidence of their negative health effects remains [largely inconclusive](/health/are-candles-bad-for-you). Still, if the idea of a nontoxic, clean-burning candle appeals to you, we've done the research and rounded up the contenders for your consideration. But first, here's a quick look at the ongoing discussion of candle toxicity. Some of this discussion started back in 2001, when the Environmental Protection Agency released a [report](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P1009BZL.txt) about candles and incense as potential sources of indoor air pollution. The report identified issues like: - lead wicks, which were [banned](https://www.cpsc.gov/content/cpsc-bans-candles-with-lead-cored-wicks)in 2003 - a range of synthetic and problematic volatile organic compounds \u2014 including formaldehyde, which can be released into the air while a candle burns However, to date, research hasn't linked scented candles with a health risk. When it comes to candles, we're still dealing with a largely unregulated industry and inconclusive data. But for some, a little digging around in the ingredients of an average candle might give reason for pause. Is paraffin really a problem? Is soy always a better choice? What about your favorite wax blends, or those complex aromas that can't really be captured in an [essential oil](/nutrition/what-are-essential-oils). (Sea salt, we're looking at you). And why do some candles give you a raging headache, while others just smell great? When possible, it's probably best to opt for candles from companies committed to transparency, quality, and sustainability. But it's not enough just to follow your nose. Instead, check the label, scour the website, or ask a company directly to learn more about three key elements. 1. Fragrance source In the United States, skin care products, [perfumes](/health/perfume-poisoning), and candles can legally use the catchall term \"fragrance\" on an ingredient list. But when you're swooning over scents like seaside or pumpkin spice, what are you actually inhaling? Well, it depends. \"What many people don't know is that the word 'fragrance' can refer to thousands of chemicals used to make up a complex aroma,\" says Daniel Swimm, founder and CEO of [Grow Fragrance](https://www.growfragrance.com/?correlationId=null). \"The reality is that many of the chemicals used to create fragrances today are synthetic petrochemicals derived from crude oil that carry carcinogens and have reproductive toxicity warnings.\" That sounds terrible, but it doesn't necessarily mean all synthetic ingredients are bad for us \u2014 or that every \"natural\" ingredient is automatically safe. Actually, there are a number of synthetic molecules that are [chemically identical](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3899854/) \"Many of the chemical names in disclosed 'fragrances' will be long and scary-looking \u2014 think ' [methyl dihydrojasmonate](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredients/702795-HEDIONE-HEDIONE-HEDIONE-HEDIONE-METHYLDIHYDROJASMONATE-METHYLDIHYDROJASMONATE/),'\" says Mia Davis, director of environmental and social responsibility at [Credo Beauty](https://credobeauty.com/?correlationId=null). \"But their chemical-y sounding names don't equal 'toxic.'\" There's another benefit to synthetic ingredients. As Stephan Tracy, Harry Doull, and Christophe Laudamiel of [Keap](https://www.keapbk.com), a Brooklyn-based candle company, explain: \"Man-made materials allow us to innovate beyond the limitations posed by nature.\" That can mean far more nuanced scent profiles. Nontoxic tip To be on the safe side, look for phthalate-free candles that are derived from 100 percent essential oil. Any synthetic ingredients should be certified nontoxic. Also, transparency is key, so prioritize candlemakers that are willing to list ingredients in full. 2. Wax type Paraffin wax, which is petroleum-based, has long been painted as a villain in the toxic candle debate. While the health risk hasn't been confirmed, there are other options if you just feel better avoiding paraffin. Plant-based waxes, including coconut, soy, and beeswax, can offer a more natural, sustainable approach \u2014 but shop wisely. Because the fragrance industry is largely unregulated, \"a candle can have 1 percent soy and still be labeled as 'soy-based,'\" says Swimm. This is when it becomes important to know the brand. Nontoxic tip Look for a candle that says it's made of 100 percent natural wax so you're not inadvertently getting a paraffin blend. 3. Wick type This was far more of an issue before lead wicks were banned, but it's still a good idea to shop for wicks made of cotton or wood. Some wicks have a metal core for support, which may not be readily visible. Nontoxic tip To play it safe, look for 100 percent cotton, hemp, or wood wicks. In theory, a clean-burning candle emits no harmful chemicals when it's burned. But this is an area of some controversy, too. While some claim that plant-based waxes burn clean without releasing soot, the [National Candle Association](https://candles.org/faqs/) describes candle soot as primarily related to wick length and flame disturbance. Still, they note that oils found in some fragrances can lead to more soot. To make our recommendations for nontoxic candles, we searched for brands that prioritize transparency in their process. We looked for plant-based waxes and fragrance sources, as well as cotton, hemp, or wood wicks. In most cases, we also spoke directly to the owners or representatives of these companies to learn more about their commitment to nontoxic candle making.

All formulations are independently lab-tested and certified for safety. CandaScent Labs candles are inspired by scents of nature, and the company says it's committed to deriving them right from the source. That means no catch-all \"fragrance,\" but rather certified organic essential oils and botanical ingredients. The fragrance line is limited, but we burned the Focus scent during our research and were very pleased. What makes a candle nontoxic? There's no single definition, but a nontoxic candle should be free of questionable ingredients and additives, like phthalates or lead. It can be helpful to look for candles made with 100 percent plant-based waxes, essential oil-based or certified nontoxic synthetic fragrance, and wicks made of cotton, hemp, or wood. Are soy candles nontoxic? Keep in mind that the fragrance industry is mostly unregulated, which means a candle with just a small amount of soy can still be labeled as \"soy-based.\" Double-check the label to ensure the wax is entirely plant-based. While 100 percent plant-based waxes, like soy, coconut, and beeswax can be considered nontoxic, you also need to factor for both the wick material and the fragrance source. What are the risks associated with toxic candles? Evidence of negative health effects associated with conventional candles is still inconclusive. Still, there is some concern that volatile organic compounds can be released into the air when a candle burns. To avoid even potential health risks, it's a good idea to burn candles that are made with plant-based waxes, fragrance, and wicks. There's a lot of contradictory information about candle toxicity, and it's hard to know what to believe. That's why a little digging about a candle manufacturer and its philosophy is the best way to separate transparency, quality, and sustainability from marketing hype. Remember to check ingredient lists, check out websites, or ask directly about the fragrance, the wax, and the wick. And keep in mind that like most things, candles are probably best enjoyed in moderation \u2014 and always in well-ventilated spaces.
