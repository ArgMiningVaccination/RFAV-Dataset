Individuals can find course descriptions, the postsecondary courses at Ivy Tech and Vincennes that each NLPS course has been aligned to, and the key competencies for each postsecon dary course. Postsecondary courses followed by an * are not available for dual credit. Vincennes University postsecondary courses followed by a ^ are only available for dual credit through an approved VU Early College program. CTE funding information, assignment codes, dual credit availability and certification alignment has now been added where possible. It may still be necessary to use some of the additional resources provided by the CTE team , but we have attempted to consolidate much of the pertinent course information into this resource. Recent Updates (Summer 2023) : Assignment Codes have been updated for several courses and added for new pathways. You can also find a breakout list of assignment codes for all courses here . Dual Credit Crosswalk alignment s have been updated. Addition of promoted certifications to some pathway courses. Next Level Programs of Study (NLPS) Overview Indiana has fully launched Next Level Programs of Study (NLPS ) as of the 2022 -2023 school year . This initiative aims to improve the consistency, quality, and intentionality of CTE instruction across Indiana. The NLPS course structure serves as the key framework for schools and career centers to deliver the benefits available through the CTE redesign. The course structure was designed in collaboration with a working group of high school principals and CTE direc tors that offer CTE programs through a variety of scheduling options. A simplified explanation of the course structure is that the 6 credits of content included in the current Level I course have been divided out into three 2 -credit courses: Principles , Concentrator A, and Concentrator B . This structure was modeled after other popular CTE programs, such as Engineering and Biomedical Sciences. These programs begin with a foundational course and gradually increase depth of content and occupational specifi city. The design provides the flexibility needed to offer the programs of study at a comprehensive high school or a career center by allowing schools to offer up to six credits in a pathway per school year. This is made possible by allowing any require d pre -requisites to be implemented as co -requisites. Other benefits of the new NLPS course structure include the following: Next Level Programs of Study Page | 2 Ability to earn CTE Concentrator Status in one year if participating in a multi -period training program that allows the student to complete the Principles, Concentrator A, and Concentrator B courses. All NLPS follow the same 4 -course structure. This creates greater consistency and expectations across all CTE pathways. NLPS more clearly define the courses and credit needed f or the Technical Honors Diploma. Most advance courses (Concentrator A and Concentrator B courses) are each aligned to 6 college credit hours. Increasing the number of dual credit opportunities is a point of emphasis in NLPS, but students do not have to ear n dual credits to be a CTE Concentrator. The Capstone course includes time for embedded work -based learning experiences. The other primary resources that will assist with NLPS implementation are the following: The Master Pathways Document outlines the courses that will are in the Perkins V pathways and along with the courses that are included in the NLPS. The Master Pathway List provides a side -by-side comparison of Perkins V pathways with current courses vs. Perkins V pathways with NLPS c ourses. The document includes all NLPS pathways available during the 2022 -2023 school year. The Next Level Programs of Study Planning Guide is designed to help schools and career centers take full advantage of the benefits available with the newly redesigned CTE structure. Included in the planning guide are the following sections: Comparison chart of current CTE system vs. NLPS on several key factors Overview of the course structure utilized for NLPS and its benefits Rubric to assist schools/career centers with determining what pathways to offer Scheduling options for NLPS Additional scheduling options and considerations NLPS FAQ : The CTE team continues to update the FAQ document to ensure that it is accurate and relevant. New or updated questions are highlighted in red. In particular , the FAQ adds some clarification around the definition of CTE concentrator for Perkins purposes and the C average requirement for Graduation Pathways. The FAQ remains the best central resource to find information that has been shared in bi -week ly updates or other places regarding common NLPS questions.

Students apply the skills and knowledge of using modern manufacturing processes to obtain resources and change them into industrial materials, industrial products and consumer products. Students investigate the properties of engineered materials. Students study six major types of material processes: casting and molding; forming; separating; conditioning; fin ishing; and assembling. After gaining a working knowledge of these materials, students are introduced to advanced manufacturing, logistics, and business principles that are utilized in today's advanced manufacturing industry. Students gain a basic understa nding of tooling, electrical skills, operation skills, inventory principles, MSDS's, chart and graph reading and MSSC concepts. There is also an emphasis placed on the flow process principles, material movement, safety, and related business operations. Stu dents have the opportunity to develop the characteristics employers seek as well as skills that will help them in future endeavors.
