This means once you have completed the full dosage amount necessary to be considered fully vaccinated, and you reach the two-week mark after the final dosage, your immunity has been built up to handle COVID-19 when it comes into contact with it, to the point you will notice minor symptoms. Many are still hesitant about getting the COVID-19 vaccine; let's debunk many of the myths and rumors that have been circulating, that may also be making you hesitant about getting vaccinated. While the COVID-19 vaccines were created quickly (thank you science!), they were all carefully tested for their safety with a focus on the public. There were no corners cut when it came to the COVID-19 vaccine. While not only being independently tested, over 100 million people have been safely vaccinated against COVID-19. You may have heard about the side effects that often are associated with the COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccines are not live vaccines, so while some receive side effects, it does not mean you are sick. The symptoms include a mild fever, a sore arm, and/or body aches is the body's natural response to the vaccine, as the immune system learns to recognize the agents involved with the COVID-19 vaccine so it can fight COVID-19 if it ever comes into contact with it. The best part about getting the COVID-19 vaccine is it can protect you from getting severely sick to death. Even if you have previously had COVID-19, you can still get the vaccine, and it is highly recommended you do so. Several studies have shown if you have had COVID-19 previously, and you have not been vaccinated, you are at a higher risk of re-infection than others who ended up getting vaccinated. Finally, do your research when it comes to the COVID-19 vaccines available, and ask your healthcare provider questions to provide you with all the information necessary to add more peace of mind before getting the vaccine. To help build immunity, and fight off COVID-19, you will need your body to get as much sleep each night that is possible. As a healthy immune system is able to fight off infections easier than one that is deprived of sleep. Adults need around six to eight hours of sleep per night, and it needs to be a regular routine. While sleep is necessary, lowering your stress levels should also be practiced all of the time, as stress levels have a major impact directly on your immune system, to lower them include exercising, controlled breathing exercises, and meditating. Make sure to eat a balanced diet, if you are eating unhealthily, you are more susceptible to viruses and bacteria, which is why it is important to eat nutritional foods and continue to maintain a healthy immune system. Get vaccinated when possible, and get your booster vaccinations, the vaccinations provide the opportunity for your body's immune system to learn the genetics of COVID-19 and work to fight them. Vaccinations are one of the best options available to help your body develop immunity against COVID-19. As well, if you have been previously exposed to COVID-19, your body has already developed immunity to it. Due to these, your body is able to recognize the genetic diagram of the COVID-19 infection and fight off the virus. While individuals who have had COVID-19 previously or have had the vaccinations and booster vaccinations are able to get sick, as well as infect others, getting re-infected with COVID-19 is relatively low.
