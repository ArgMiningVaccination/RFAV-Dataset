This year is a particularly noteworthy one for the GII, as it marks the release of the 10th edition of the report. The first edition was produced in 2007 by Soumitra Dutta at INSEAD with the goal of producing a comprehensive broad-based model of innovation that captured its com - plex nature in both developed and emerging economies. Over the last decade, the GII has gained international recognition, establishing itself as both a leading reference on innovation and a 'tool for action' for decision makers. Numerous countries have incorporated the GII into their innovation agendas and metrics. Remarkably, in view of the GII, a large number of countries have increased their collection of innovation metrics that con - form to international standards; these countries also use the metrics more. These changes are taking place with the cooperation of WIPO and other responsible international organizations\u2014most notably the UNESCO Institute for Statistics\u2014which assist the country in question to resolve issues and increase its data coverage. Innovation is not limited to the most advanced economies. Innovation is also not limited to the high-technology sectors. Innovation has today become a global phenomenon, affecting all sectors of the economy, including food and agriculture\u2014which are among the most ancient and basic sectors of activity. Feeding the world, while contributing to protecting the environment and providing quality and balanced nutrition to growing populations with different lifestyles and consumption pat - terns, remains a complex challenge. Innovation has a key role to play in addressing this challenge. The 2017 edition of the GII is dedicated to the theme of innovation in agriculture and food systems. Agricultural and food-processing sectors continue to face an enor - mous rise in global demand and increased competition for limited natural resources. Innovation can be key to maintaining the productivity growth required to meet this rising demand in a sustainable fashion, and it can help enhance the networks that integrate food systems. This year's report analyses these demands and the opportuni - ties they present from different angles, including those of data-driven strategies, the impact of biotechnological and digital technologies, effective policies, and strength - ened networks, while at the same time suggesting new approaches for both developed and developing countries. Finally, the GII 2017 includes another innovation this year. The GII has long recognized that innovative activity tends to be concentrated in geographic clusters. However, no metrics have existed to measure innova - tion performance at the cluster level on an internationally comparable basis. This year's GII seeks to take a first step in remedying this measurement gap. It presents a novel approach towards identifying and ranking the world's largest clusters of inventive activity, drawing on interna - tional patent filings. We hope that the cluster perspective offers a useful complement to the long-standing country-based rankings that will continue to form the core of the GII. We thank our Knowledge Partners, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Strategy&, and the National Confederation of Industry de Apoio \u00e0s Micro e Pequenas Empresas (Sebrae) for their support of this year's report. Likewise, we thank our prominent Advisory Board, which has been enriched by a new member this year: Chuan Poh Lim, Chairman, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) of Singapore. We hope that the collective efforts of innovation actors and decision makers who use the GII will continue to pave the way for better innovation policies around the world. SOUMITRA DUTTA Dean, Cornell SC Johnson College of Business, Cornell University FRANCI S GURRY Director General, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) BRUNO LANVIN Executive Director for Global Indices, INSEAD\u00a9WIPO, 2017. by Emmanuel Berrod. vvTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 PrefacePREFACEThe primary obligation of a nation is to protect its citizens from hunger and malnutrition by enabling sustainable and equitable food production and distri - bution channels. The developing world, characterized by gross economic and social inequalities coupled with inequitable access to safe, nutritional food and quality healthcare, requires innovation to meet the ever-rising demand for food and to sustain its agricultural growth. Despite the fact that India is one of the world's largest producers of food grain, the largest producer of milk, and its second largest producer of sugar, low-quality inputs such as low-grade seed, saline soil, inadequate irrigation, traditional farming methods (combined with small, scattered landholdings), restrictive access to for - mal credit, dependence on private moneylenders, and weak market linkages have long plagued its agriculture sector. To counter these challenges, a gradual infusion of tech-based tools such as digital remote sensing, geo - graphic and price information systems, crop and soil health monitoring, and farm management platforms has taken place. These tools promise to rationalize processes and enhance efficiency, productivity, distribution, and access along the entire continuum of the food system from farm to fork and beyond. Public policy plays a pivotal role in making an envi - ronment conducive to this transition. The adoption of innovation-led farm technologies has spurred public and private investments in R&D, helped technology transfer and uptake, as well as inter-sectoral cooperation. Over the last two decades, this has enabled sustainable agriculture to gradually gain momentum. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has been a strong proponent of this paradigm shift. The theme of this year's Global Innovation Index (GII), 'Innovation Feeding the World', thus resonates well with the agenda and focus of CII in this sector, and like previous years may prove beneficial for stimulating effective policy dialogue within the government.For last two years, in collaboration with the GII, CII has been engaged with the Indian government to boost India's ranking. I am delighted to report that this effort has improved India's 2016 GII results. Another outcome of this sustained effort was the launch of the GII 2016 in India at a special event, jointly organized by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), and CII, in the presence of the Director-General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). During the event, India's Minister of State for Commerce and Industry instituted a high-level Task Force on Innovation to suggest ways India can improve its innovation eco-system. As a follow up to this launch, the first international consultative exercise was organized in January 2017 in New Delhi to address existing data gaps in the GII. International agencies such as UNESCO, among oth - ers, participated in the exercise where the first India Innovation Index Portal was launched. These develop - ments have created the desired momentum for states to work on building their innovation ecosystems and improving their innovation indicators. In line with this year's theme, Chapter 5 covers the current ecosystem of digital technologies in Indian agriculture\u2014the rise of agro-tech start-up ventures and the advocacy initiatives that are the backbone needed to modernize Indian agriculture. CII has been a longstanding partner of GII. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the GII team once again for coming out with this important edition, and for taking up a theme that resonates very well in today's challenging times. CHAN DRAJIT BANERJEE Director General Confederation of Indian IndustryInnovation as the Key Driver of Sustainable Agriculture and Future Food Security in the Developing World viivii THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 ForewordFOREWORDInnovating to Feed the World We live in a world of finite resources but infinite passion and creativity. At PwC, we are committed to building trust in society and solving important problems. But as problems become more global and complex, the solu - tions require a greater focus on innovation. The Global Innovation Index (GII) does just that by creating metrics to evaluate innovation and by identifying new ways to address the challenges that affect business and society. At Strategy&, PwC's strategy consulting business, we are proud to be part of the 2017 GII. This year's theme of innovation in food systems highlights one of the most complex challenges humanity faces: managing the global food supply. We know that without significantly expand - ing agricultural production over the next three decades, the world's population will increasingly face hunger, malnutrition, and famine. Resource scarcity is one of the key megatrends shap - ing our world today and in the years to come, so meeting the needs of the world's people in a sustainable way will require renewed focus on innovation in a variety of fields and from a variety of stakeholders. In this case, addressing global food insecurity involves technological innova - tion, including leading-edge advances in data analytics; global distribution and supply chain management; risk assessment; economic flexibility; a deeper understand - ing of climate and weather conditions; and sustainability practices. It's clear that no company, government, or any other institution can solve the food crisis on its own. To find a lasting solution, we have to work together. In our research for the GII, we have identified promising agricultural innovations being developed by the private sector. Many of these are a result of more corporate R&D investment in software and services, and new technologies that are improving efficiency and productivity. However, the public sector\u2014which has traditionally represented the majority of agricultural R&D expenditures\u2014continues to play an important role in spurring agricultural innovation. There's a real oppor - tunity for governments and businesses to collaborate to support corporate ventures and to ensure that invest - ments have a greater impact. In PwC's most recent CEO survey, we asked CEOs how the corporate community can help spread the benefits of globalization more widely. The majority of them said the best way is to collaborate, particularly with government. As a GII Knowledge Partner, we hope to do our part in helping to close the gap between innovation and finding tangible solutions to important problems that affect communities around the world. TIM RYAN US Chairman and Senior Partner PwC ixixTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 ForewordFOREWORDThe National Confederation of Industry (CNI), the Social Service of Industry (SESI), the National Service of Industrial Training (SENAI), and the Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Service (Sebrae) are more and more concerned with innovation. We are convinced that the only way to achieve sustainable development is through innovation. Since 2008, CNI business leaders have maintained the Entrepreneurial Mobilization for Innovation (MEI), putting innovation at the centre of corporate strategy and enhancing the effectiveness of innovation policies in Brazil. 'Innovation Feeding the World', this year's theme for the Global Innovation Index, is a central issue for environmental sustainability and for the world's social and economic well-being. Innovations are spread across different economic sectors, sustaining one another with new ideas and state-of-the-art technologies. Innovation in agribusiness and food production now requires the knowledge and technologies produced by other sectors. Brazil's role in grain production is not just a result of abundant natural resources and good climate conditions. Historically, the country has developed a consistent and comprehensive system of research and development to support innovation and new agriculture technologies. This system benefits from the leadership of Embrapa (Brazilian Agriculture Research Corporation), one of the country's most important public research enterprises, which has provided Brazilian farmers with crucial tools needed for a modern and dynamic agroindustry. Inspired by Embrapa, in 2013 the government launched the Brazilian Agency for Industrial Research and Innovation (Embrapii), which manages non-refund - able grants invested in projects carried out by compa - nies and research institutions and is acknowledged for its excellence, technological focus, and ability to meet companies' needs. The technology challenges for agro-industry are now more complex than ever. In the past, soil fertilization, mechanization, plant breeding, genetic engineering, and improvements in cultivation techniques were the main drivers for the increase in agriculture productivity; today other challenges demand a new set of technologies and policies. Agriculture and food production greatly impact the environment. With the growing demand for agriculture products, sustainable productivity growth in agriculture is a vital issue. This includes not only increasing crop productivity but also reducing inefficiencies in trans - portation and food industrialization. Another significant issue relates to how best to adapt to climate change and the expected increased frequency of extreme weather events. New technologies could contribute a great deal in this domain too. Fortunately, a vast array of new technologies prom - ises to increase efficiency in food production. New equipment and devices are at the centre of such tech - nologies. Precision agriculture raises the possibility of using knowledge and information technologies to adapt cultivation techniques to each specific location, with its own soil and climate characteristics. Crop sensors could use agriculture inputs much more precisely by using the exact amount needed by a specific site. Drones and robots have already automated several tasks in agricul - ture production. All these innovations are blurring the boundaries between industry, services, and agriculture. More and more, industrial and service technologies are offering new possibilities in agriculture. These new possibilities are also becoming more accessible to small innovative businesses in all sectors. To seize the resulting oppor - tunities, a new framework of policies and institutions is needed to take advantage of lessons learned from suc - cessful past experiences and envision new possibilities for agriculture and food production. The theme of the Global Innovation Index this year could not be timelier.

Many of these messages are con - cerned with innovation as a driver of growth generally. One is concerned specifically with the role of innova - tion as a way to address the growing need for advances in agriculture and food value chains. Finding 1: Crafting the foundations for innovation-driven growth while the global economy is at an important turning pointIn a turn of events, growth is reaching a novel and more sustained momen - tum as the GII goes to print this year. Laying the foundation for innovation-driven economic development is ever more paramount. Related policies that will sustain innovation invest - ments can help transform the cyclical economic upswing into longer-term growth. Such proactive innovation policies are also a powerful antidote to uncertainty because they boost the confidence and thus also the invest - ments of economic actors into the future. In spite of this new growth momentum, investment and produc - tivity growth are still at historic lows. China aside, investment growth in middle-income countries has now fallen to levels similar to that of rich countries (Figure A). Furthermore, the productivity crisis is more topi - cal today than ever. The downturn has amplified the phenomenon of lacklustre productivity gains in rich countries, in conjunction with weak - ened technological innovation and diffusion. Emerging economies are affected as well, with their catch-up to advanced-country productivity slowing. Research and development (R&D) investments need to be intensified. Although permanently subdued R&D growth was avoided thanks to countercyclical innova - tion policies and private innova - tion expenditures, R&D growth is still lower today than it was in 2011-13, and much lower than in 2005-08 (Figure/uni00A0A). Tighter gov - ernment R&D budgets in selected high-income countries and slower spending growth in emerging coun - tries explain part of this slowdown. Disconcertingly, and in addition to flattening public R&D, business research expenditures seem to be losing momentum. Finding 2: Smart, digital agricultural innovation and a better uptake of innovation in developing countries can help overcome serious food challengesToday a fresh innovation drive is required to confront slow growth in agricultural productivity and the bot - tlenecks in today's agricultural inno - vation systems. First and foremost, lagging agricultural productivity growth in low- and middle-income economies and lagging agricultural R&D spending across all economies both need to be reversed. Second, innovations need to disperse more effectively throughout the agricul - tural and food sector, especially in developing countries. Helping to meet this need for innovation in agricultural systems, a wave of new agricultural technolo - gies and innovations is taking place that could help overcome lagging productivity. The pace of agricultural innovation has increased over the last few years, with innovations from other sectors spilling over to agricul - tural and food systems. Advances in areas such as genetics and nano- and biotechnologies have proven their ability to be a source of higher yields and better nutrient content, even though their full environmental and health impacts have yet to be fully understood. Big data are reshap - ing the world of agriculture: digital agriculture has started to spread worldwide, helped by the develop - ment of innovations in information technology (IT)\u2014for example, sen - sors, drones and robotics, and virtual and augmented reality\u2014as well as data generation and analytics enabled by remote sensing, and geographic information systems. Unfortunately, the new wave of technological advances is rolling out rather slowly in many parts of the world, including in rich coun - tries. And developing countries, THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Key Findings of the GII 2017xxiv particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, have yet to benefit from earlier waves of agricultural innovations. New technologies aside, the brunt of agricultural innovation is found in improved processes and services that occur along the agricultural value chain, be it in high-income or low-income economies, not only in novel technologies. In the case of develop - ing countries, there are many sig - nificant bottlenecks along the value chain. These are mostly obstacles concerned with liquidity constraints, agricultural inputs of imperfect quality, insufficient information and awareness, and a lack of post-harvest and distribution infrastructure. Public authorities have critical roles to play in helping stimulate innovation in food and agricultural value chains. For a start, the agricul - ture and food sector should be part and parcel of any national innova - tion strategy. To this day, this is very rarely the case. To overcome market failures, policy makers have a responsibility to provide funding mechanisms to stimulate innovation in agriculture and food production. Instruments such as agricultural funds and focused research institutes need to work more efficiently. Developing countries also need to engage more in domestic R&D, for example, while setting priorities in research fields appropriate to their spe - cific resources and contexts. Local (sub-national) initiatives are also important: grassroots innovations are happening in farming that can often be scaled up. In such contexts, robust links between public research institutions, firms, and the grassroots level are key. Efforts to enhance the efficiency of the food and agriculture innova - tion system should focus on reducing lags between R&D efforts and the widespread adoption of agricultural innovations. Accelerating technol - ogy transfers by establishing clear rules of engagement in university-industry interactions, including the commercialization of intellectual property derived from these, is a valuable option. Supporting the demand for innovation from farmers and commercial farming operations is equally important. Five recom - mendations are:Figure A: Global investment and business R&D falling short -20-15-10-505101520 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005Percent World Middle income High income China Source: See Figure 1 from Chapter 1. 0246810 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005Percent GDP growth Business R&D Total R&DR&D expenditures growth, 2005-15Investment growth, 2005-15xxv THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Key Findings of the GII 2017 First, provide adequate informa - tion to farmers, ensure that key workers along the value chain have sufficient relevant skills, and encourage the adoption of new products and processes. Second, empower farmers by providing access to digital tech - nologies and the new service platforms that have immense potential to positively impact agriculture. Third, recognize and help boost entrepreneurship and venture capital approaches within the agricultural sector. Fourth, both the private sec - tor and government can help infuse excellence and innova - tive attitudes that are evident in other vital sectors\u2014such as the information and communication technologies, or ICT, sector\u2014into the agricultural sector. Finally, improve national legal and regulatory frameworks in agriculture, and more gener - ally streamline regulations and reduce bureaucracy around farmers, in particular when striking a balance between tra - ditional and advanced farming technologies. Finding 3: More innovation convergence is needed globally, with developing countries perfecting their innovation systemsInnovation is becoming more global but divides remain; innovation lead - ers are uncontested at the top but new players are emerging. Switzerland leads the rankings for the seventh consecutive year. In the top 25, some economies\u2014such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Japan, France, Israel, and China\u2014move up. Yet rich countries take most of the top 25 spots, with middle-income countries growing more distant to the top 25 this year, rather than closing the gap. The exception is still China. It moves up by three spots in this edi - tion, becoming the 22nd most inno - vative economy in the world after having entered the top 25 in 2016 as the first middle-income economy. With the exceptions of Bulgaria and Malaysia, the gap between the 11-25 ranked economies and middle-income economies remains large, especially in Institutions, Human capital and research, Infrastructure, and Creative outputs. Outside these countries, only a few upper-middle-income economies\u2014such as Turkey, the Russian Federation, and Viet Nam\u2014are among the top 50 this year. Similarly, the innovation qual - ity ranking is led by the United States of America (USA), Japan, the United Kingdom, and other high-income countries, with China being the only middle-income country closing the gap. In terms of regions, the same patterns of innovation divides per - sist: Northern America; Europe; and South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania lead, followed at a great distance by Northern Africa and Western Asia; Latin America and the Caribbean; Central and Southern Asia; and, finally, Sub-Saharan Africa. Yet there are many positive devel - opments too. For a start, in 2017 we continue to see a number of countries that perform significantly better on innovation than their current level of development would predict; it is hoped that this will trigger a virtu - ous cycle of development in the years to come. A total of 17 economies compose the cluster of 'innovation achievers' this year. This group has grown this year relative to 2016.Table A: Innovation achievers: Income group and years as an innovation achiever Economy Income group Years as an innovation achiever (total) Viet Nam Lower-middle income 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011 (7) Kenya Lower-middle income 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011 (7) Moldova, Rep.

Low income 2017 (1) Source: See Table 5 from Chapter 1.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Key Findings of the GII 2017xxvi Most of these economies\u2014nine in total\u2014come from the Sub- Saharan Africa region, followed by three economies in the Eastern region of Europe. Table A shows the list of innovation achievers; particularly notable is the consis - tent progress in Sub-Sahara Africa, with some new economies, such as Tanzania and Burundi, joining this group. Importantly, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, Mozambique, and Malawi stand out for being innova - tion achievers at least five times in the previous six years. Particular results-oriented activities in Viet Nam and India leading to achievements on particular innovation components are also especially notable. Continuing with the trend iden - tified in earlier editions of the GII, the average performance of the group of low-income economies is getting closer to the average performance of the middle-income cluster. Both in GII scores and also in their catch-up on particular innovation variables, the innovation achievers mentioned in Table/uni00A0A help close the gap. Finding 4: Opportunities have emerged to leverage the rise of new East Asia Innovation Tigers, fostering deeper regional innovation networks and benefitting from the rise of IndiaIn terms of innovation and economic development more broadly, Asia is definitely a more and more impor - tant engine of innovation in the 21st century, complementing existing innovation efforts in high-income economies, mostly in Northern America and Europe. The different elements of a poten - tially strong networked innovation powerhouse are coming together in Asia. For a start, and despite enduring economic setbacks, Japan has contin - ued to be a driving force of global innovation since the late 1970s. Later, in the 1980s, the so-called Asian Tigers emerged, with Hong Kong (China), Singapore, the Republic of Korea, and to some extent Malaysia developing their innovation agendas quite rapidly. In conjunction with Japan, these economies are the top Asian countries in innovation in the region. In the 1990s, the rise of other South East Asian countries such as Thailand was also forecast by economic and innovation experts\u2014complementing the large established players. The economic spurt of these countries was temporarily stopped short by the Asian financial crisis, but has since continued unabated. In addition, thanks to its steadily perse - vering innovation agenda, China also vigorously entered the picture while making strides in terms of innovation activities and results. Moving forward, a novel dynamic of innovation development is in place today, potentially producing a new line-up of up-and-coming Asian countries. New Asian Tigers\u2014such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam\u2014are emerging too, and they increasingly join not only Asian high-tech value chains but also other activ - ities such as ICT offshoring. These and other countries in Asia are also active in improving their innovation performance. Although Singapore is still uncontested as number 1 among the smaller or emerging Asian econo - mies, countries such as Viet Nam, the Philippines, and Thailand are rapidly catching up. Among them, Viet Nam tops education expenditure in the region and does very well in ICT use, gross capital formation, and FDI net inflows. Malaysia has the best cluster development and ICT use, the Philippines leads ICT services exports, Thailand tops the quality of publications and trademarks, and Cambodia only recently engaged on innovation activities but its FDI inflows are already high.A potentially stronger pan-Asian innovation network is seeing the light of day as China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea increasingly conduct some of their manufactur - ing activities\u2014including those in technology-intensive sectors\u2014in neighbouring Asian countries, lead - ing to regional production and inno - vation networks. However, these intra-regional production activities still mostly concern low-skill and low-wage assembly operations with Chinese, Japanese, or Korean firms choosing to manufacture in, for example, Viet Nam, to benefit from excellent framework conditions and lower wages. Few collaborative R&D projects exist between the Asian leading nations, their top innovation clusters, or these smaller newcom - ers today, at either the firm or the country level. The newly emerging Asian economies, such as Malaysia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam, still experience low R&D and low resi - dent patenting levels. As a result, the potential of intra-regional innovation networks in Asia is far from fully utilized. There is development in Central and Southern Asia too, with inter - esting developments in countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran, Kazakhstan, and Bangladesh. But, first and foremost, India's current and imminent development, and its contribution to the region and the global innovation landscape, is vital these days. As demonstrated in the GII for some years, India has con - sistently outperformed on innova - tion relative to its GDP per capita. Recently it made important strides in innovation input and output perfor - mance. India is now in the top half of the GII rankings. The continual improvement of India in terms of investment, tertiary education, the quality of its publications and uni - versities, its ICT services exports, xxvii THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Key Findings of the GII 2017 and its innovation clusters deserves mention (Figure B). It is to be hoped that India will continue on this tra - jectory, with innovation investments leading to more and more dynamic R&D-intensive firms that are active in patenting, high-technology pro - duction, and exports. If India then increasingly connects its innovation system to the innovative countries in the East mentioned above, as well as to standing innovation powerhouses in the West, it will make a true differ - ence in Asia's regional role in innova - tion, and to global innovation more generally. This is a promising prospect. The emergence of innovative new Asian Tigers, an innovative India, and better innovation networks in the region are likely to be among the most encouraging developments for worldwide innovation in the next few decades.Finding 5: Preserving the innovation momentum in Sub-Saharan Africa and tapping the innovation potential in Latin America are prioritiesA recurrent finding of the last edi - tions of the GII has been that the innovation momentum in Sub-Saharan Africa must be preserved, while countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are working to meet their innovation potential. For several editions, the GII has noted that\u2014relative to its level of economic development\u2014the Sub-Saharan Africa region performs comparatively well on innovation. Since 2012, Sub-Saharan Africa has had more countries among the group of innovation achievers than any other region. Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, Mozambique, and Malawi stand out for being innova - tion achievers at least five times in the past six years. Kenya is the chief innovation achiever in the region, outperforming every year since 2011\u2014including in the 2017 edition. Noted improvements in Insti - tutions and Business sophistication have allowed the region as a whole to catch up with Central and South - ern Asia in these factors. Boosted by economies such as South Africa, Mauritius, Botswana, Namibia, Rwanda, and Burkina Faso, Sub-Saharan Africa this year has its highest scores in Institutions and Market sophistication. Larger econ - omies such as South Africa, Kenya, Botswana, and Namibia help foster the expansion in Infrastructure; others such as Mauritius, Rwanda, Senegal, and Zimbabwe are helping to do so in Human capital. This year, however, the drivers of growth that have been active in the region have seen a slowdown. Clearly, in absolute terms the gap between these Sub-Saharan Africa economies and some South East Asian innovation 020406080100 Patent families in 2+ ocesIntellectual property receiptsGERD R&D formationState of cluster developmentGraduates in science & engineeringResearch talent in business enterpriseHigh- & medium-high tech manufacturesQuality of scientic publicationsIndia ahead of lower-middle and Upper-middle income l Lower-middle incomeGII 2017 score Source: See Figure 6 in Chapter B: India ahead of average lower-middle- and upper-middle-income economiesTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Key Findings of the GII 2017xxviii leaders is also still large, in particular when one considers that integration of global value chains and innovation exports, participation in high-tech production and exports, and patent - ing by Sub-Saharan economies are still low. Turning to Latin America and the Caribbean, more must be done to reach the region's full innovation potential. Chile, Mexico, and Brazil and some other countries in the region are undoubtedly important innova - tion actors. Mexico is also an active contributor to global value chains, including in high-tech sectors. It is notable, however, that there is more potential for broad regional improve - ment on innovation, both in terms of overall innovation performance and also in terms of key innovation vari - ables such as scientific publications, R&D, and patenting. For example, in recent years and also in 2017, no economies from this region are iden - tified as innovation achievers\u2014none outperform in innovation relative to their level of development. The region as such has faced important economic challenges in the last year, with Brazil only slowly emerging from an economic recession accord - ing to current forecasts, although the country is still facing a high degree of uncertainty. To further support this economic upswing and help the region prog - ress in terms of innovation, sustained efforts in improved innovation investments and more coordinated innovation systems are required. Also needed is broader regional R&D and innovation cooperation, which is still largely absent when compared with other regions identified by the GII as being successful in innovation. Finding 6: The largest sub-national clusters of inventive activity, as measured by patenting, include Tokyo-Yokohama, Shenzhen-Hong Kong (China), and San Jose-San Francisco, CAThis year the GII makes a first attempt at assessing sub-national innovation clusters. The importance of innova - tion hubs at the sub-national and international levels has been at the forefront of GII discussions for the last 10 years for two main reasons. First, successful innovation clusters are essential for national innovation performance. Second, one of the most frequent questions from coun - tries has been whether the GII model can be applied at the sub-national level to assess innovation clusters more broadly. However, measuring the ter - ritorial dimension of innovation remains challenging. Only a few GII indicators are readily available at the regional or city level for a large set of countries. Besides, clusters often do not stop at national borders. By definition, the search for official and timely innovation data is challenging. In an effort to contribute prelimi - nary solutions, a novel approach is presented in the GII 2017 that iden - tifies the largest inventive clusters as measured by Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patenting. Drawing on advanced mapping techniques and WIPO patenting data, Table/uni00A0B shows some of the leading innovation clusters that result from this analysis. Tokyo-Yokohama, Shenzhen-Hong Kong (China), and San Jose-San Francisco (the Silicon Valley area in California) lead in terms of being the largest inventive clusters, based on this methodology. In the coming years, attempts to foster data on local innovation clusters should receive increased attention, and may possibly become a more important component of the GII.Table B: Top cluster of countries or cross-border regions, within the top 25 Rank Cluster name Territory(ies) 1 Tokyo-Yokohama Japan 2 Shenzhen-Hong Kong (China) China/Hong Kong (China) 3 San Jose-San Francisco, CA United States 4 Seoul Korea, Rep. 10 Paris France 12 Frankfurt-Mannheim Germany 18 Eindhoven Netherlands/Belgium 21 London United Kingdom 22 Tel Aviv Israel 24 Stockholm Sweden Source: Derived from Table 1 in Annex 2 in the Special Section on Clusters.ChaptersThe Global Innovation Index 2017: Innovation Feeding the World SOUMITRA , SO, and JORDAN LITNER , Cornell SC Johnson of Business, Cornell University BRUNO LANVIN , INSEAD SACHA W UNSCH-VINCENT and FRANCE SCA GUADAGNO, WIPOCHAPTER 1 Since the release of the Global Innovation Index (GII) last year, the world has seen reason to expect recovery and indeed renewed eco - nomic growth. Although uncertainty remains high, the holding pattern of the global economy might well give way to a more sustained upswing. It is still questionable, however, whether the foundations for continued growth are in place; the probability of a 'low-growth' scenario is still high. In this context, firms, institutions, and policy makers can help sustain the recovery and shape the future by creating novel sources of innovation-driven growth. Nourishing the welcome economic upswing while tackling low investment and productivityThe global economy has been in a holding pattern for several years; it has never fully recovered from the 2007-08 crisis and has never returned to a momentum of sustained growth. In recent years, initial optimism and hopes of recovery were rather quickly replaced with downward revisions to economic growth. The growth rates experienced before the economic crisis remain elusive. As the new edition of the Global Innovation Index 2017 goes to print, however, a new, if modest, growth momentum is in place. The world's leading economic institutions pre - dict a pick-up of global economic activity in 2017 and 2018, following a strong fourth quarter in 2016. /one.superior Compared with previous years, these growth forecasts for the world economy have not been revised downwards but upwards in recent months. /two.superior Business and consumer confidence are high. /three.superior Projections also indicate that growth across low-, middle- and high-income economies will be broad-based and positive. Growth in emerging economies continues to be the main driver of the eco - nomic upswing. Economic growth is predicted to be relatively strong in middle- and certain low-income economies such as China, India, Indonesia, and Thailand; a few Key findings in brief The six key findings of the GII 2017 are: 1. Creating new sources of innovation- driven growth is now vital to transforming the current economic upswing into the possibility of longer-term growth. 2. Smart and digital agricultural innovation and better diffusion to developing countries are required to help overcome serious food challenges. 3. More innovation convergence is needed globally, as low- and middle-income countries put more emphasis on their innovation systems.4. The prospect of regional Asian innovation networks will also benefit from the rise of new Asian Innovation Tigers and India's high potential. 5. Preserving the momentum of innovation in Sub-Saharan Africa and tapping the innovation potential in Latin America and the Caribbean must be priorities. 6. Regional clusters of inventive activity are essential to national innovation performance; improved innovation metrics on this topic are required. African economies (Kenya, Senegal, and Uganda); and also in a handful of large advanced economies\u2014the Republic of Korea (Korea), the United States of America (USA), and Canada. Brazil and the Russian Federation (Russia) are expected to experience growth again, with the former emerging from a deep recession. As a region, Latin America and the Caribbean face more positive prospects, following the stabilization of commodity prices benefitting low- and middle-income economies worldwide. Africa will experience a modest pick-up, boosted also by new infrastructure projects. 3THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 2017Figure 1: Global investment and business R&D falling short -20-15-10-505101520 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005Percent World Middle income High income China Source: 1a.

Some large emerging econo - mies, such as China, are seeing their high growth rates reduced, and other advanced economies, such as Japan, see persistently low growth rates.Furthermore, a number of factors might derail the scenario of a durable upswing. Many monetary, fiscal, and other factors are at stake, as well as unprec - edented levels of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. The leading economic institutions are wary of a more perpetual low-growth scenario, in which growth cannot be sustained and increased over time. This report is concerned with two related bottle - necks in particular. First, investment and productiv - ity increases are still at historic lows. And these low levels are at the ori - gin of the lower growth than was enjoyed in pre-crisis years. Despite more positive recent developments, investment\u2014especially in emerging and developing countries\u2014has not yet recovered. In fact, investment growth in middle-income countries has fallen to levels similar to that of rich countries. China aside, the growth of investment in middle-income countries is even lower than it is in high-income ones (see Figure/uni00A01a). Furthermore, the produc - tivity crisis is more topical today than ever. Potential measurement issues aside, global labour productivity in 2016 is as low as it was in 2015. The downturn, in conjunction with forces that weakened technological innova - tion and diffusion, has amplified the phenomenon of lower productivity in rich countries. /one.superior In the meantime, emerging economies are affected as well, with catch-up to advanced-country productivity levels slowing. Second, concerns around falter - ing global economic integration are mounting. Trade growth has been historically weak since 2010\u2014hov - ering around 2.5% between 2013 and 2015\u2014and was even weaker in 2016, when it fell to 1.3%. /one.superior/one.superior Cross- border foreign direct investments (FDI) also fell further in 2016. /one.superior/two.superior Trade in particular is traditionally seen as both an important cause and an effect of global growth. A more neglected aspect of economic inte - gration, however, is that both trade and FDI are key channels of the dif - fusion of technology, know-how, and innovation more broadly. /one.superior/three.superior A reversal of globalized economic activity, and THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 20174the associated networks of produc - tion and innovation, could have adverse consequences for economic catch-up and technological leapfrog - ging, which have been historically so critical for successful development cases such as China, Korea, and more recently Viet Nam. /one.superior Fortunately, trade, FDI, and pro - ductivity growth are also forecast to be recovering in 2017 and further increasing in 2018, in conjunc - tion with output growth and the cyclical recovery currently being experienced. /one.superior Policy initiatives to sustain invest - ment, human capital, innovation, and productivity growth could send a strong signal and be an important antidote to uncertainty. Crafting the foundations for innovation- driven growth as an antidote to uncertaintyLaying the foundations for innova - tion-driven growth is paramount. Although not at levels seen after the crisis, some government spend - ing initiatives are underway again in major economies; an uptick in investment will be felt in 2016 and 2017. /one.superior Still, there is room for even more initiatives aimed at satisfying economists' omnipresent calls for more infrastructure investment in economies across the board. To lay the foundation for future growth, policy actions that foster human capital, research and develop - ment (R&D), and other innovation inputs and outputs, as captured by the GII, are now required. Indeed, avail - able economic evidence shows that an increase in R&D can effectively translate into an increase of GDP in the medium and longer term. /one.superior Our study of global R&D data yields the following insights. Global R&D growth fell in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2009 (see Figure/uni00A01b and Box/uni00A01). /one.superior Governments stepped in to stimulate R&D effec - tively. Business R&D investments returned to faster growth in 2010. Encouragingly, by 2013 the share of business in total R&D had returned to its pre-crisis levels. Broadly speak - ing, our analysis indeed indicates that for the last four years, up until 2015 (when the most recent data are available), global R&D intensity\u2014measured as global R&D expendi - tures relative to global GDP\u2014was at 1.7%, and thus at levels similar to 2000-08. /one.superior GERD growth has also consistently been higher than GDP growth, also a reflection of low gen - eral GDP growth in that period. Still, about eight years after the crisis, the worst-case scenario of permanently reduced R&D growth has to date been avoided, thanks to these anticy - clical innovation policies and the role of R&D champions such as China, Germany, and Korea, which have consistently spent large and growing sums on R&D. Yet, although permanently sub - dued R&D growth has been avoided, R&D growth is still inferior today than it was in 2011-13 immediately following the crisis, and much lower than in 2005-08 when it averaged around 6%. As governments have phased out some of their stimulus programmes, and as spending cuts are applied, tighter government R&D budgets in selected high-income countries and slower spending growth in key emerging countries explain part of this slowdown. /two.superior Disconcertingly, and in addition to flattening public R&D, based on our estimates, business R&D growth seems to be losing momentum, with growth rates decreasing from about 6% in 2013 to 5% in 2014 and about 4.5% in 2015 (see Figure/uni00A01b). /two.superior/one.superior In Box 1: Benchmarking R&D expenditures across countries Global expenditures on R&D (GERD) follow - ing the 2008-09 financial crisis have varied considerably (see Tables 1.1 and 1.2 on the following page). Some countries\u2014such as China, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation, and Poland\u2014did not decrease their R&D efforts during the crisis and have intensified them further after the crisis, with business expenditures on R&D (BERD) also following the same trend. Other countries saw declining GERD and BERD during the crisis, but above pre-crisis levels in 2015 (the latest year for which data are available). These include tradi - tionally high R&D spending economies, such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands, as well as relatively newer actors such as Chile and Slovakia. In yet other countries (e.g., Colombia and Norway), GERD did not fall during the crisis, but BERD did. Governments pushed R&D investments to compensate for lower busi - ness R&D during the crisis; their efforts were rewarded with higher GERD and BERD after the crisis. Finally, in a number of countries\u2014such as Spain, Portugal, and Finland\u2014R&D expenditures (both total and business) have not recovered yet, with GERD and BERD still below pre-crisis levels in 2015.

The use of intellectual property (IP)\u2014a sign of continued innova - tion\u2014has intensified, albeit only in selected middle- and high-income economies. The latest figures point to a 7.8% patent filing growth in 2015, much higher than it was in the previous five years, yet that growth is mainly driven by China. /two.superior/two.superior Turning to the future, as govern - ments prepare policies to sustain the current growth momentum, a focus on R&D and innovation should be a priority. Novel business practices or new technologies could be potential triggers of much-needed productiv - ity increases and engines of future economic growth. Historically, and to the present day, governments have played an important role in building human capital and driving research\u2014as sponsors of basic or less applied R&D, as facilitators of private R&D with tax reductions, or by exercising strong demand on innovation via government procurement or strate - gic initiatives. /two.superior/three.superior Governments might need to boost their involvement to inspire business with the confidence to invest and innovate. /two.superior As demonstrated by this year's GII theme, these R&D and innova - tion efforts are not and should not be limited to sectors conventionally considered to be high-tech. For this reason, the 2017 GII edition on the theme of 'Innovation Feeding the World' focuses on innovation in agriculture and food systems and the many scientific, technological, and other innovative advances made in this field.Innovation feeding the worldIt is commonplace to equate innova - tion with high-technology sectors. Yet the agriculture and food sec - tor\u2014traditionally considered low-technology\u2014is an important source of technological change, innovation, and development. Today, more than ever before, failure to perceive agri-food systems as a source of innovation and to analyse their innovation input, outputs, linkages, and diffusion paths accordingly would be a mistake. Agri-food systems face an unprec - edented rise in global food demand while, at the same time, competition for limited natural resources is at an all-time high. Feeding the world while simultaneously protecting the environment and providing balanced nutrition to growing populations remains a complex challenge. Addressing the global food challenge The stakes of innovation in agricul - ture and food are at least as high, if not higher, than in other fields. As evidenced by the GII chapters this year, progress in reducing malnutri - tion is still too slow: Global food demand in 2050 is expected to increase by at least 60% above 2006 levels. /two.superior Around 795 million people in the world, or about one in nine, suffer from hunger. /two.superior About one in four people liv - ing in Sub-Saharan Africa suf - fers from chronic hunger, yet the region with the largest num - ber of undernourished people is Southern Asia (281 million). /two.superior One in three people in the world is malnourished in one form or another. /two.superiorThe situation is not improv - ing. Challenges such as rapidly growing food demand, stagnating farm incomes, diminishing natural resources, and climate change all aggravate the factors that contribute to issues of malnutrition worldwide. Food security is more and more affected because droughts, floods, heat waves, and other extreme weather events destroy agricultural output. Risks of natural resource depletion and degradation call for intensified efforts towards greener, more sustainable agricultural prac - tices (see Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 9). Estimates indicate that global agricultural productivity and inno - vation is not growing fast enough to meet future food demand, mostly because of the lagging total factor productivity growth\u2014a proxy for innovation\u2014in low-income coun - tries (see Chapter 3). Innovation can help avert a global food crisis if policy makers and other actors change course on a global scale (see Box/uni00A02). Innovation in food and agriculture: From moldboard plow to smart, digital agricultureThe good news is that, historically, agricultural innovation has proven not only feasible but spectacularly successful, and has triggered key structural and socioeconomic development. Innovations in agriculture and food production have been the start - ing point of humanity's progress towards organized social life. One can think in particular of the moldboard plow and the cotton gin in the 18th century; refrigeration in the 1850s; pasteurization in 1863; Mendel's sci - entific plant breeding and the com - bined harvester (early 20th century); and the green revolution in the 1950s, which took millions out of hunger. /two.superior 7THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 2017As a result, agricultural pro - ductivity has enjoyed periods of extraordinary growth. From the 1960s until the 1990s, the expansion of land under cultivation and higher input use\u2014especially in the form of fertilizers and high-yield varieties\u2014accounted for the bulk of agricultural output growth (Chapter 3). Advances in genetic engineering gave rise to a wave of technological innovations and led the transition towards com - mercial agriculture in many regions. The green revolution enabled devel - oping economies to import cheaper grains and grow crops with high-yield seed varieties, with tremendous benefits for the economy and society (see Chapters 5 and 10). /three.superior Stimulating investment in innovative agriculture and food productionIn the same spirit, today a new inno - vation drive is needed to confront declining agricultural productiv - ity and the bottlenecks of today's agricultural innovation systems (see Chapters 7, 9, 10, and 11). First and foremost, lagging agri - cultural productivity growth in low- and middle-income countries and lagging agricultural R&D spending (public and/or private) across all economies (Chapter 3) need to be reversed. To reach that goal, both the public and private sectors will need to keep the R&D pipeline flowing; investments to ensure that innova - tive technologies and techniques are brought to fruition are required. Second, innovations need to be better diffused throughout the agricultural and food sector, in particular in developing countries. Unfortunately, waves of technologi - cal advances roll out rather slowly in many parts of the world. As a conse - quence, a number of developing coun - tries, most notably in Sub-Saharan Africa, have yet to benefit from ear - lier waves of agricultural innovations, such as high-yield varieties and drip irrigation systems, slowing down their structural transformation and development processes. /three.superior/one.superior Indeed, in several developing countries, productivity growth is still the result of expansions of cul - tivated land and more intensive use of inputs; technological change is having a much smaller impact in these countries (Chapter 3). Arable land, however, cannot be expanded further because of growing urbaniza - tion and environmental requirements (Chapter 3). Concerns in these areas are already materializing (see the cases of Russia and Uganda in Chapters 9 and 11, respectively). A wave of smart agricultural innovations on the horizonHelping to meet this need for innova - tion in agricultural systems, a wave of new agricultural technologies and innovations is taking place that could help overcome lagging productivity. The pace of agricultural innovation Box 2: Innovation, agriculture, and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development In September 2015, the Member States of the United Nations (UN) adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, incorporating 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets that are being implemented at the national level by the UN Member States to shape global development in the period 2015-30. The Agenda applies to all countries uni- versally and aims at fostering social, environ - mental, and economic development. All the SDGs rely to a greater or lesser extent upon innovation for their means of implementation: Goal 9 ('Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation') makes explicit reference to innovation and refers to several innovation factors referenced in the GII, such as infrastruc-ture, access to credit, access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) and environmentally friendly technologies, sci - entific research, and technology capabilities.As this report shows, the achievement of Goal 2 ('End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustain - able agriculture') will greatly benefit from innovation. The goal recognizes the role of new technologies in boosting agricultural productivity and the need for public and private investments in spurring technological change in this field. The SDGs and their associated targets provide the basis for monitoring and review - ing countries' progress in implementing sus-tainable development at the global, regional, and national levels. This process of review depends on a framework of statistical indica - tors being developed through an interna-tional consultative process led by the UN Statistical Commission. Disaggregated data are important for monitoring and reviewing countries' prog - ress in implementing the SDGs as well as for assessing strengths and weaknesses and identifying resource needs and priorities. On the basis of the GII, numerous workshops are taking place in different countries to bring innovation actors together with the aim of improving data availability, boosting the coun - try's innovation performance, and design - ing strategic policy actions. Partnerships are ongoing between the GII publishers and many UN partner organizations\u2014such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)\u2014as well as private data providers to improve the required innovation metrics. In the process of implementing the 2030 Agenda, the GII can provide countries with a data-based tool for policy making and con - tribute to this shared endeavour of working towards sustainable development globally.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 20178has increased over the last 10 years, with innovations from other sectors spilling over to agricultural and food systems (see Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 8). In the next decades, advances in biotechnology, autonomous vehicles, and a broader shift of agricultural innovation to data, services, and software could enable vital progress. Rapid progress is underway in radically new technologies and new processes as applied to agricultural and food production. Advances in areas such as genetics and nano- and biotechnologies have proven their ability to be a source of higher yields and better nutrient content, even though their full environmental and health impacts have yet to be fully understood. Chapter 9 mentions exciting examples of new-generation sequencing, bioreactor-based syn - thetic food production, total recy - cling, bio-controlled and artificial agroecosystems, and vertical farm - ing, to name a few such innovations (see Table/uni00A01 in Chapter 9 and also Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 8). An unprecedented convergence of biology, agronomy, plant and ani - mal science, digitization, and robotics is transforming the agri-food value chain. Big data are reshaping the world of agriculture: digital agriculture has started to spread worldwide, helped by the development of innovations in information technology (IT)\u2014for example, sensors, drones and robot - ics, and virtual and augmented real - ity\u2014as well as data generation and analytics enabled by remote sensing, and geographic information systems. Fostering innovation along the agricultural value chain, including in services and processesNew technologies aside, the brunt of agricultural innovation is found in improved processes and services that occur along the agricultural value chain, be it in high-income or low-income economies (see Table/uni00A01 in Chapter 10 and Figure/uni00A02 in Chapter 11), and not only in novel technologies. Activities along the agri-food value chain range from supplying inputs such as seeds, wholesalers, and retailer agro-dealers to farming activities such as planting, farming, and harvesting and to post-harvest activities such as bulking and processing of raw output, branding and marketing of value-added agri-food products. Effective linkages and improved service delivery along this chain are just as critical, if not more, than new technologies that can maximize the innovation potential in agriculture. In the case of developing coun - tries, there are many significant bot - tlenecks along the value chain. These are mostly obstacles concerned with liquidity constraints, agricultural inputs of imperfect quality, insuffi - cient information and awareness, and a lack of post-harvest and distribution infrastructure (see Chapter 11). For example, most developing countries suffer from important weaknesses when it comes to benefit - ting from inputs appropriate to their particular circumstances, such as suit - able seeds and services geared towards the country's context, such as finance and distribution (see, for example, the case of Uganda in Chapter 11). The financial sector provides an example: small rural farmers often face signifi - cant barriers in accessing credits and insurance. This reduces investment while increasing households' vulner - ability (see also Chapter 3). Organizational innovations are also as important as product or pro - cess innovations. Digitization of retail and logistics, equipment-sharing, and life-long learning are examples of ways organizational innovations can increase agricultural productivity (Chapter 9). Complex organizational changes\u2014such as changes intended to spur the consolidation of small farms into large commercial farms\u2014also require innovation that makes farm management more efficient, for example (see Chapter 8). Hence a mix of technological and non-technological innovation is required in agri-food value chains. Some technologies will need to diffuse and be adapted from rich countries to developing economies, while the latter are still adopting the technologies of the previous agricul - tural innovation wave (genetically modified crops, drip irrigation, and so on). At the same time, developing countries increasingly need to fur - ther engage in their own domestic R&D\u2014for example, they need to pursue domestic seed varieties and set research priorities fitting for their specific contexts, such as R&D in aquaculture (see Chapter 9). Incentivizing agricultural innovation with good institutions, stronger linkages, and out-of-the-box thinkingPublic authorities have critical roles to play in helping stimulate innova - tion in food and agriculture. For a start, the agricultural and food sec - tor should be part and parcel of any national innovation strategy (see Chapter 8 for Japan's approach to creating the project Technologies for Creating Next-Generation Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries). To this day, this is very rarely the case because innovation policies often focus on new sectors while neglecting strengths in traditional or resource-based industries. /three.superior/two.superior On this basis, the promotion of specific activities that have the power to convince local players that prog - ress is feasible and desirable should be undertaken. More traditionally, policy mak - ers have a responsibility to provide funding mechanisms to stimulate innovation in agriculture and food 9THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 2017production. The mechanisms can be in several forms: For example, as seen in Brazil (see Chapter 7), policy makers can create sectoral agricultural funds to foster technologies in areas such as agronomy, veteri - nary medicine, biotechnology, economics, and agricultural sociology; and to promote tech - nological updates in the agri - culture industry and stimulate the expansion of investments in tropical agricultural biotechnol - ogy and in the diffusion of new technologies. The creation of focused research institutes (e.g., the Institute of Innovation in Biotechnology in Sao Paolo) is also a possibility (see Chapter 7 on Brazil). Providing tax relief to enhance farmers' incomes and offer - ing preferential access to land and market support for promis - ing agricultural techniques and technologies is also a good way forward. Crafting balanced legal frameworksImproving national legal and regu - latory frameworks in and around agriculture\u2014for example, by pro - moting the uptake of patents and plant varieties; promoting the use of trademarks, which can support innovation; adopting public safety laws on biodiversity and genetically modified varieties; and more gen - erally streamlining regulations and reducing bureaucracy around farm - ers\u2014all contribute to a more condu - cive environment (see Chapter 10). Governments and policy makers also have the delicate task of providing a proper balance between inefficient agriculture in need of more technol - ogy, better fertilizers, and so on and advanced bio-farming, as well as between feeding the poor with mod - ern intensive agriculture and creating ground-breaking new crop varieties (see Chapter 8), while also looking at environmental issues and health. Cooperation and consultation remain a key ingredients needed to get popular support for the resulting policies and to leave room for out-of-the-box thinking. Fostering skills and inspiring agricultural entrepreneurshipOne of the key obstacles to the rapid adoption of innovative approaches in agriculture and food production still is to be found in inadequate infor - mation, a lack of skills, and, some - times, the lack of acceptance of new products or ways to produce them. Experiences from various parts of the world in this year's GII chapters indicate how priorities need to be pursued in this area. First, agricultural extension efforts to disseminate knowledge about new technologies and tech - niques, and to demonstrate their busi - ness case, are required. These services include training in technology and managerial skills and in the diffusion of information such as metrological data. This would provide adequate information to farmers, ensure that key workers along the value chain have sufficient relevant skills, and encourage the adoption of new prod - ucts and processes. Second, farmers need to be empowered by providing access to digital technology and the new ser - vice platforms that have immense potential to positively impact agri - culture (see Chapters 3 and 5). Third, entrepreneurship within the agriculture sector needs to be recognized and inspired to a much more significant extent. In India, for example, venture capital has started flowing to agricultural projects through programmes such as Startup India (see Chapter 5). A flurry of new start-ups is on the rise, on par with other high-technology sectors, and with ideas that can have an immedi - ate impact on societal well-being. Fourth, both the private sector and government can also help infuse excellence and innovative attitudes in other vital sectors into the agriculture sector. In India, such an approach has helped enhance the impact of infor - mation technology (IT) in unlocking value for the grassroots level in areas such as mobile payments or health (see Chapter 5). Over the last five years, the Indian agriculture sector has also attracted leading IT companies and investors; available technology and digital solutions are expanding at an impressive pace. Scaling up local initiatives and ensuring technology diffusionLocal (sub-national) initiatives are also important: grassroots innova - tions that can often be scaled up are happening in low- and middle-income economies' farming. In such contexts, links between public research institutions, firms, and the grassroots level are key. Efforts to enhance the efficiency of the innovation system should focus on reducing lags between successful R&D efforts and the widespread adoption of agricultural innovations. In a number of countries (see Chapters 9, 10, and 11), several factors\u2014including the lack of complementary investments and capacity\u2014hamper spillovers from public research to enterprises. Accelerating technol - ogy transfers through the establish - ment of clear rules of engagement in university-industry interactions, including the commercialization of IP derived from these, is a good option. /three.superior/three.superior Supporting the demand for innovation with farmers and com - mercial farming operations is equally important.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 201710More accurately measuring agricultural innovation to simulate progressAgriculture today is radically dif - ferent from agriculture a couple of decades ago: more digital, smarter, and more integrated. A better under - standing of agricultural innovation in general, but these new forms of innovation in particular, is now cru - cial (Chapter 2 and Annex 4). Data are needed to better inform decision makers about gaps and opportuni - ties in agricultural capacity, and to monitor and evaluate require - ments and progress, recognizing the broader agricultural innovation system\u2014including informal actors, households, extension services, rural advisory services and farmer organizations, and the quantitative and qualitative dimension of their interactions. /three.superior Annex 4 describes available and missing data sources, and which countries lead and lag in agricultural innovation. A transition towards sustainable growth is paramount if the world is to cope successfully with the global challenges it is facing today. Agriculture and food systems can play a tremendous role in this, but a concerted effort towards more granular agriculture-specific data collection is needed to understand what works and what does not, and how governments and public poli - cies can help promote innovation in agriculture and food. The GII 2017 conceptual framework The GII helps to create an environ - ment in which innovation factors are continually evaluated. It provides a key tool of detailed metrics for 127 economies this year, representing 92.5% of the world's population and 97.6% of the world's GDP (in current US dollars). Four measures are calculated: the overall GII, the Input and Output Sub-Indices, and the Innovation Efficiency Ratio (Figure/uni00A02). The overall GII score is the simple average of the Input and Output Sub-Index scores. The Innovation Input Sub-Index is comprised of five input pillars that capture elements of the national economy that enable innovative activities: (1) Insti - tutions, (2) Human capital and research, (3) Infrastructure, (4) Market sophistication, and (5) Business sophistication.Figure 2: Framework of the Global Innovation Index 2017 InstitutionsHuman capital and research InfrastructureMarket sophisticationBusiness sophisticationCreative ICTs CreditKnowledge workersIntangible assetsGlobal Innovation Index (average) Innovation Efficiency Ratio (ratio) Innovation Input Sub-Index Knowledge impact Knowledge diffusionInnovation Output Sub-Index Regulatory environment Business environmentTertiary education Research & developmentGeneral infrastructure Ecological sustainabilityInvestment Trade, competition, & market scaleInnovation linkages Knowledge absorptionCreative goods and services Online creativity11 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 2017 The Innovation Output Sub- Index provides information about outputs that are the results of innovative activities within the economy. There are two output pillars: (6) Knowledge and technology outputs and (7) Creative outputs. The Innovation Efficiency Ratio is the ratio of the Output Sub-Index score over the Input Sub-Index score. It shows how much innovation output a given country is getting for its inputs. Each pillar is divided into three sub-pillars and each sub-pillar is composed of individual indicators, for a total of 81 indicators this year. Further details on the GII frame - work and the indicators used are provided in Annex 1. It is important to note that each year the variables included in the GII computation are reviewed and updated to provide the best and most current assessment of global innovation. Other meth - odological issues\u2014such as missing data, revised scaling factors, and new countries added to the sample\u2014also impact year-on-year comparability of the rankings (details of these changes to the framework and factors impact - ing year-on-year comparability are provided in Annex 2). Most notably, a more stringent criterion for the inclusion of coun - tries in the GII was adopted in 2016, following the Joint Research Centre (JRC) recommendation of past GII audits (see Annex 3 in this report and in previous years). Economies and countries were included in the GII 2017 only if 66% of data were available within each of the two sub-indices and if at least two of sub-pillars in each pillar could be com - puted. This more stringent criterion for inclusion in the GII ensures that country scores for the GII and for the two Input and Output Sub-Indices are not particularly sensitive to the missing values. As noted by the audit, this more stringent threshold has notably improved the confidence in the country ranks for the GII and the two sub-indices, and thus the reliabil - ity of the GII rankings (see Annex 3). The rules on missing data and mini - mum coverage per sub-pillar will be progressively tightened, leading to the exclusion of countries that fail to meet the desired minimum coverage in any sub-pillar (see Annex 2 for more details). The Global Innovation Index 2017 results The GII 2017 results have shown consistency in areas such as top rankings and the innovation divide. However, there also have been some new high-level developments as described below. Stability at the top, led by Switzerland, Sweden, and the NetherlandsIn 2017, the GII remains relatively stable at the top. Switzerland leads the rankings for the seventh consecutive year, while Sweden maintains its 2nd place. The Netherlands ranks 3rd, although most of this improvement is the result of methodological changes and improved data availability. The USA remains stable at the 4th spot, while the UK moves down two positions to take 5th place. Denmark improves another two positions this year, ranking 6th. Singapore, Finland, and Ireland move down, occupying the 7th, 8th, and 10th spots, respectively. Germany, which entered the top 10 in 2016, contin - ues its advancement, moving up one position from last year and occupy - ing the 9th spot. Hence, despite some movement, the top 10 does not see any new entrant this year. Figure/uni00A03 shows movement in the top 10 ranked economies over the last four years:1. Switzerland 2. Sweden 3. Netherlands 4. United States of America 5. United Kingdom 6. Denmark 7. Singapore 8. Finland 9. Germany 10. Ireland Furthermore, stability remains across the top 25 economies with only a few exceptions. China moves up by three places, becoming the 22nd most innovative economy in the world after entering the top 25 in the GII 2016. Israel gains four positions this year, ranking 17th and swap - ping spots with New Zealand (21st). Other economies move up by two or more places: Japan (14th), France (15th), and Norway (19th). Australia moves down four spots, ranking 23rd this year. Hong Kong (China) and Canada each lose two or more posi - tions, ranking 16th and 18th respec - tively. The Czech Republic regains its place in the top 25, gaining three positions from last year and moving to 24th. Belgium leaves the top 25 this year, ranking 27th. Box/uni00A03 discusses the measure of innovation quality among GII 2017 economies. Box/uni00A04 delves into the innovation divide between the top 25 ranked economies (24 of which are high-income) and the group of middle- and low-income economies. 2017 results: The world's top innovators The following section describes and analyses the prominent features of the GII 2017 results for the global lead - ers in each component of the GII and the best performers in light of their income level. /three.superior A short discussion of the rankings at the regional level follows. /three.superiorTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 201712Tables/uni00A0 1 through 3 on pages 14-19 present the rankings of all economies included in the GII 2017 for the GII and the Input and Output Sub-Indices. The top 10 in the Global Innovation Index Switzerland has earned the num - ber 1 position in the GII for the seventh consecutive year. It has maintained this top spot since 2011, as well as its number 1 position in the Innovation Output Sub-Index and in the Knowledge and technol - ogy outputs pillar since 2012. Its lead seems largely uncontested. For the first time it ranks among the top 10 in all pillars and is the 3rd economy in the world in innovation quality (see Box/uni00A03). Thanks to its improvements in Institutions (8th), Infrastructure (6th), and Creative outputs (3rd), its Innovation Efficiency Ratio has improved from 5th to 2nd. As in previ - ous years, it ranks among the top 25 in all sub-pillars, with only three excep - tions: Business environment (33rd), Education (28th), and Information and communication technologies (ICTs, 30th). Switzerland ranks 1st in Knowledge creation and in a num - ber of important indicators, including patent families in 2 or more offices, PCT patent applications, and high- and medium-high-tech manufac - tures. With its favourable business environment and solid innovation capabilities, Switzerland remains highly successful in transforming its resources into more numerous, and more varied, innovation outputs. Despite this strong performance, Switzerland presents a few areas of weakness, especially on the input side. These include ease of starting a business, graduates in science and engineering, gross capital formation, ease of getting credit, and growth rate of GDP per worker. Sweden holds the second high - est position in the GII, remaining the top Nordic economy and ranking among the top 10 in all pillars with the exception of Creative outputs (11th). It improves in the Innovation Input Sub-Index (2nd), with gains in all pillars but Market sophistication (10th). Among the largest improve - ments, Sweden gains 11 positions in Innovation linkages (6th), 10 posi - tions in Knowledge impact (10th), 7 positions in ICTs (13th), and 6 positions in Knowledge absorption (7th). Its largest drops are in Tertiary education (28th), Ecological sus - tainability (20th), Trade, competi - tion, and market scale (28th), and Creative goods and services (18th). At the indicator level, Sweden keeps its 1st position in PCT patent appli - cations, while achieving a big leap in labour productivity growth. It improves the most in government's online service, e-participation, and JV-strategic alliance deals, while benefiting from the new measure averaging FDI net in-flows (see Annex 2). Areas of weakness include pupil-teacher ratio, GDP per unit of energy use, ease of getting credit, FDI net inflows, trademarks by Figure 3: Movement in the top 10 of the GII Note: Year-on-year GII

To this end, three additional indicators were introduced into the GII in 2013: (1) quality of local universi - ties (indicator 2.3.4, QS university ranking average score of top 3 universities); (2) inter-nationalization of local inventions (indicator 5.2.5, patent families filed in three offices, changed to patent families filed in two offices in the GII 2016); and (3) the number of citations that local research documents receive abroad (indicator 6.1.5, citable docu - ments H index). Figure 3.1 shows how the scores on these three indicators add up, and captures the top 10 highest performing high- and middle-income economies. Source: GII 2017 data. Notes: Numbers to the left of the economy name are the innovation quality rank. Economies are classified by income according to the World Bank Income Group Classification (July 2016). Upper- and lower-middle income categories are grouped together as middle-income economies.Figure 3.1: Metrics for quality of innovation: Top 10 high- and top 10 middle-income economies 0 50 100 150 200 250 of America n 2.3.4 QS university ranking average score of top 3 universities n 5.2.5 Patent families filed in at least 2 offices n 6.1.5 Citable documents H index Sum of scores origin, and printing and publishing manufactures. The Netherlands reaches the 3rd position this year, ranking 2nd in the Innovation Output Sub-Index and 4th in the Innovation Efficiency Ratio. Indeed, the Netherlands had lost five positions last year as a result of large fluctuations in selected data points (see page 26 in the GII 2016), which are now better accounted for. /three.superior As a result, this year the Netherlands ranks 6th in FDI net inflows and 1st in outflows. As discussed in more detail in Box/uni00A04, newly avail - able data positively affect two pil - lars of the Netherlands\u2014Business sophistication (1st) and Knowledge and technology outputs (2nd). The Netherlands has improved its rank - ings in a number of other areas as well, including Education (18th), Innovation linkages (7th), and Knowledge impact (17th), in part because of gains in GERD financed by abroad and expenditure in edu - cation. Areas of weakness include High-income economies Middle-income economies (Continued on next page)Box 3: Innovation quality: The USA, Japan, the UK, China, and India at the top of their income groups (continued) Top 10 high-income economies: The USA, Japan, Switzerland, and Germany in the leadAmong the high-income group, five econo - mies\u2014the United States of America (USA), Japan, Switzerland, Germany, and the United Kingdom (UK)\u2014have remained among the top five in innovation quality since the incep - tion of this metric. This year the USA moves to the 1st position, taking the place of Japan. The USA achieves this ranking as a result of continuous top scores in particular quality indicators and an improvement in its score in patent families. The USA takes the top position in citable papers, sharing this spot with the UK for the fifth consecutive year. In 2017 the USA also remains the world leader in the quality of its universities, outranking the UK for the second consecutive year. Also contributing to the USA's improvement, Japan shows a reduction in the scores for both university rankings and citable docu - ments this year. This year, for the first time, Switzerland ranks 3rd in the quality of innovation met-ric. Although showing a slightly weaker performance than last year in the quality of universities and a constant one in citable documents, the country enjoys a top score in patent families, helping it to achieve an overall quality score above those of both the UK and Germany. These two countries, on the other hand, show stable scores in citable documents this year, but a reduction in those for patent families and university rankings, respectively. Sweden improves its rankings, moving up two positions to replace the Republic of Korea (Korea) at the 6th position. Although Korea keeps the top spot in patent families, a reduction in its scores for university rank - ings, combined with a significant improve-ment in patent families for Sweden, can explain this switch. The Netherlands (8th, up by two) scores better in patent families, compensating for a fall in university rank - ings. Denmark and Finland enter the top 10 this year, replacing France and Canada. While the latter two show high scores in both university rankings and citable papers, improved scores for patents filed from both Denmark and Finland is the main reason for this change. Top 10 middle-income economies: China and India lead; the Russian Federation and Argentina re-join the groupA large gap remains between high-income and middle-income economies. Without China, the difference in average scores between these two groups in both the university rankings (1.13) and citable docu - ments (0.64) is expanding, while in patents filed the distance is narrowing (0.14). China moves up one spot to 16th posi - tion in innovation quality, retaining for the fifth consecutive year its position as the top middle-income economy and getting closer to high-income economies. This movement can be attributed to higher scores in univer-sity rankings (4th) and citable documents (14th). Although other middle-income economies still depend greatly on their uni - versity rankings to move ahead in the quality of innovation, China\u2014and to some extent South Africa\u2014display a balance between the three components of the quality index.India is 2nd in innovation quality for the second consecutive year. India's positive performance is the result of maintaining its 2nd position in both university rankings and citable documents among middle-income economies. The country shows a small reduction in the score of patent families, which, however, does not affect its quality of innovation ranking. With slight reductions in all three indi- cators, the Russian Federation moves to the 3rd position among the upper-middle-income economies and 28th overall, posi - tioned between India and Brazil. Brazil's performance also shows slight reductions in scores for all three indicators, resulting in a ranking of 29th among middle-income economies. Argentina, 5th among middle-income economies and 30th overall, shows reduced scores in university rankings and patent families and a marginal improvement in citable documents, yet its overall score puts it ahead of South Africa (6th among middle-income and 32nd overall) and Mexico (7th and 34th). The inclusion of the Russian Federation and Argentina in the middle-income group led to the downward movement of Mexico, Malaysia, Turkey, and Thailand\u2014economies that have been in the middle-income top 10 since the innovation quality metric was introduced. In addition, this inclusion also moved Colombia and Ukraine out of this list, although the performance of these economies has diverged greatly from that of previous years. Tertiary education (49th), General infrastructure (30th), Ecological sus - tainability (39th), Credit (35th), and Investment (26th). The United States of America (USA) maintains its 4th position this year. The USA keeps its top ranking in pillar 4\u2014Market sophistication\u2014and ranks among the top 25 in all other pillars. It improves its position in Human capital and research (13th), Business sophistication (8th), and Creative outputs (10th), while losing eight positions in Infrastructure (21st) and three in Knowledge and technol - ogy outputs (7th). At the sub-pillar level, the USA ranks in the top 25 with just four exceptions: Education (41st), Tertiary education (54th), Ecological sustainability (61st), and Intangible assets (38th). In the latter, the country improves by seven positions this year, a welcome improvement as this is the only output sub-pillar where the USA does not rank in the top 25. The USA holds the top rank in many indicators, including QS university ranking, 21 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 2017Box 4: The global innovation divide The top 25 GII ranks are occupied by a stable set of high-income countries that consistently lead in innovation. One major change took place last year: China, as the only middle-income economy included in this group of innovation leaders, took up the 25th position in 2016. China remains in this top group and keeps moving ahead (22nd this year). China's innovation ranking in 2017 reflects scores in Business sophistication and Knowledge and technology outputs that are above the average of the rest of the 11-25 group. In particular, top scores in some indicators\u2014domestic market scale, firms offering formal training, patents by origin, utility models by origin, high-tech exports less re-exports, industrial designs by origin, and creative goods exports\u2014are all factors contributing to this improved ranking. Over the past two years, in both absolute and rela - tive terms in relation to other countries, China has shown the strongest improvement in patent applications by origin, university rank - ings, citable documents H index, utility model applications by origin, gross expenditure on R&D, and PCT international applications by origin. In addition, China this year displays a strong performance in three indicators intro-duced in the GII 2016: global R&D companies, domestic market scale, and research talent in business enterprise. Stability is a feature among the top 10 economies this year, with Switzerland at number 1 for the seventh consecutive year. Although some variations in rankings are noticed, such as the Netherlands regaining 3rd place (thanks in part to methodological reasons explained in the country description on page 20), no economy moves in or out of this group in 2017. The Netherlands' noteworthy upward movement relies mostly on its consistently high performance in areas such as Business sophistication, Creative out-puts, and Knowledge and technology out - puts. Within Knowledge diffusion, available data for intellectual property receipts and ICT services exports rank the Netherlands in the top 10. FDI net outflows is also a strength and partly responsible for this improvement in ranking. In addition, top marks for intellectual property payments, ICT services imports, and country-code TLDs help explain this rise. Some changes occur this year in the composition of the top 25 group. For one, Belgium drops out of the top 25 this year while the Czech Republic moves back by relying on a better performance in high- and medium-high-tech manufactures, as well as improved scores for domestic credit to private sector and FDI net outflows. The distance between the top 25 and the groups that follow is still apparent. Figure 4.1 shows the average scores for six groups: (1) the top 10, composed of all high-income economies; (2) ranks 11 through 25, which are also all high-income economies with the sole exception of upper-middle-income China; high-income economies; and (6) low-income economies. The difference between the top 10 innovation leaders and others in the top 25Overall, the top 10 perform better than the 11-25 group in all pillars. The gap between these two groups is larger this year in both of the output-side pillars of the index. This contrast shows also that variations in perfor - mance are narrower in two of the input-side pillars, Institutions and Market sophistication. In contrast, these gaps have expanded in Human capital and research, Infrastructure, and Business sophistication. A number of high-income economies in the 11-25 range\u2014Hong Kong (China) (16th), Canada (18th), Norway (19th), and New Zealand (21st)\u2014perform above the top 10 average in various pillars (i.e., Institutions, Infrastructure, and Market sophistication). This year, for the first time, China displays a score higher than the top 10 average in Knowledge and technology outputs. Furthermore, China shows that the gaps are narrower between the top 10 average scores and its scores in Institutions, Human capital and research, Infrastructure, and Creative outputs. Conversely, this distance is larger this year in both Market and Business sophis - tication. This change is in addition to China scoring higher in Business sophistication and Knowledge and technology outputs than its peers in the 11-25 group. Middle-income economies: China, the only middle-income economy among the top 25 group; Bulgaria and Malaysia still at great distanceAside from China, which has been among the top 25 since 2016, this year Bulgaria and Malaysia are the two middle-income economies nearest to that group, with Malaysia slipping back to 37th and Bulgaria overtaking it. Bulgaria (36th) is now the clos - est upper-middle-income economy to the top 25. In particular, Bulgaria performs better this year in Information and communication technologies (ICTs) with an improved perfor - mance in government's online service and e-participation as well as in variables in other pillars, including research talent in business enterprise and growth rate of PPP$ GDP per worker. Malaysia, on the other hand, main - tains strengths in graduates in science and engineering, high-tech imports and exports, and creative goods exports, among other indicators. Both of these economies con - tinue to operate close to those high-income economies outside of the top 10, which is especially evident in Business sophistication, Knowledge and technology outputs, and Creative outputs. With the exception of these two countries, the gap between the group of 11-25 ranked economies (as well as high-income economies) and the upper-middle-income group remains wide, especially in Institutions, Human capital and technology, and Infrastructure; the gap is less wide in Creative outputs. With respect to last year, partially influenced by methodological con - siderations, the divide between these groups increases in Institutions and, to a lesser extent, in Market sophistication. Yet the gap seems to be lessening in Infrastructure and Human capital and research.

Low-income economies moving closer to middle-income onesContinuing with the trend identified in earlier editions, the group of low-income economies keeps closing the gap that separates them from the middle-income group. However, this gap remains significant in Infrastructure, Market sophistication, Creative outputs, and Knowledge and technology outputs. This year there is no difference between these groups in the Institutions and Business sophistication pillars, areas in which this group also continues to perform above the average of the lower-middle-income group. This suggests that efforts to strengthen insti - tutions and enable the necessary factors to promote stronger business environments continue to expand among these countries. The persistence of regional innovation divides: Regional scoresThe regional rankings based on the GII scores shows that the Northern America region\u2014consisting of the USA and Canada\u2014is still at the top (57.5; 2 economies), followed by Europe (47.1; 39 economies) and South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania (44.0; 15 econo - mies). Northern Africa and Western Asia (34.3; 19 economies) and Latin America and the Caribbean (31.7; 18 economies) have similar scores while the difference in average scores between Central and Southern Asia (28.5; 9 economies) and Sub-Saharan Africa (24.8; 25 economies) is expanding. When contrasted with the 2016 results, these averages show Latin America and the Caribbean to be the region with the widest average improve - ment, followed by Central and Southern Asia, Northern Africa and Western Asia, and Europe. Conversely, Sub-Saharan Africa shows the largest average score reduction, followed by South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania and Northern America. 23 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 2017venture capital deals, citable docu - ments, computer software spending, and IP receipts; it also gains the 1st position in global R&D companies, state of cluster development (see also the Special Section on Clusters, which shows that the USA has largest num - ber of clusters in the world), ICTs and organizational model creation, and cultural and creative services exports. This year the country also ranks 1st in the quality of innovation aggregate, overtaking Japan (see Box/uni00A03). The United Kingdom (UK) moves to 5th place this year. The UK improves its position in a number of input pillars, namely Institutions (9th), Human capital and research (6th), and Business sophistication (13th). /three.superior At the sub-pillar levels, the UK's largest gains are in Political environment (18th), Education (22nd), and Knowledge absorption (28th). The country loses ground in both output pillars\u2014Knowledge and technology outputs (13th) goes down by four, with the largest drop in Knowledge diffusion (38th); and Creative outputs (4th) by one. At the indicator level, expenditure on education, government expenditure by pupil, IP payments, ICT services imports and exports, growth rate of GDP per worker, and national feature films see some of the largest improve - ments. By contrast, items such as PISA results, ICT use, and patent families lose most positions (see also Box/uni00A03). The UK maintains its 1st spot in citable documents, and gains the 1st rank in government's online services, e-participation, and ICT and business model creation. Denmark ranks 6th in this year's GII, improving in both the Innovation Input and Output Sub-Indices, where it ranks respectively 6th and 12th. Denmark has the most notable forward shift in the top 10 (progressing continuously, from 10th overall in the GII 2015 and 8th in 2016). The country improves in all pillars except for Market sophistica - tion, where it retains the 6th spot, and Knowledge and technology outputs (16th), where it loses two positions. At the sub-pillar level, Demark improves the most in Education (4th), ICTs (14th), Ecological sustainability (11th), Innovation linkages (17th), Knowledge diffusion (17th), and Intangible assets (25th). Denmark ranks in the top 3 in a number of indicators, including expenditures on education, researchers, ICT use, and scientific and technical articles. It also improves its position in many areas such as government expenditure per pupil, PISA scales, GDP per unit of energy use, university/industry research collaboration, JV-strategic alliance deals, ICT services exports, and ICTs and organizational model creation. Opportunities for further improvement still exist, notably in Tertiary education (19th), General infrastructure (44th), Trade, compe - tition, and market scale (37th), and Knowledge impact (34th). Relatively weak indicators include graduates in science and engineering, gross capital formation, utility models by origin, growth rate of GDP per worker, and trademarks by origin. Singapore still holds the top rank in the South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania region while dropping by one position (see Box/uni00A06). It keeps its top spot in the Innovation Input Sub-Index and gains three positions in the Innovation Output Sub-Index (17th). Singapore ranks in the top 5 in all input pillars and 1st in Institutions. In terms of innovation outputs, Singapore loses one position in Knowledge and technology outputs (11th) while gaining one in Creative outputs (32nd). At the sub-pillar level, Singapore holds its 1st spot in Political environment, Regulatory environment, and Tertiary educa - tion, and gains the top rank in Investment. It improves substantially also in Education and Creative goods and services, moving up by nine positions in both sub-pillars. Despite these improvements, Singapore shows a relatively weak position in Education, where it ranks 76th. In this sub-pillar, Singapore is weak in all indicators except PISA results. Room for improvement also exists in growth rate of GDP per worker, ICT services exports, and trademarks and industrial designs by origin. Apart from these areas of opportunity, Singapore maintains its 1st place in FDI net outflows, while losing it in high- and medium-high-tech manu - factures, high-tech exports, market capitalization, and FDI net inflows. Singapore ranks 1st also in other eight indicators: government effectiveness, regulatory quality, cost of redun - dancy dismissal, PISA scales, tertiary inbound mobility, ease of protecting minority investors, applied tariff rate, and IP payments. Finland moves down to the 8th position this year from 5th in 2016. Finland keeps its 4th place in the Input Sub-Index, but loses three positions in the Output Sub-Index (13th). It maintains its 1st rank in Human capital and research, while improving in Infrastructure (8th). In all other pillars, however, Finland loses between one and four posi - tions. At the sub-pillar level, 12 out of 21 sub-pillars move down. The largest drops are in Creative goods and services (40th), Political environ - ment (8th), and Knowledge diffusion (14th). The largest gains are in ICTs (9th) and Knowledge impact (32nd). Finland also loses positions in a num - ber of indicators, including venture capital deals, GERD performed by business, IP receipts and payments, ICTs and business model creation, ICTs and organizational model cre - ation, cultural and creative services exports, and national feature films. THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 201724Indeed, as this list shows, Finland's downward movement this year is the result of a drop in a variety of indica - tors. Apart from Human capital and research and the sub-pillar Business environment, Finland ranks 1st in several indicators: rule of law, ease of resolving insolvency, environmental performance, and patent families. Germany continues its climb up the GII rankings, gaining a position from last year when it entered the top 10 for the first time. Germany is 1st in logistics performance and patents by origin. It is 2nd in global R&D companies expenditures, down from 1st place in 2016, and 3rd in state of cluster development and citable docu - ments\u2014the same as last year. On the pillar level, Germany safeguards all its respectable positions while improv - ing in Infrastructure (20th). It ranks in the top 25 economies across all pil - lars, and in the top 10 economies for output pillars. Areas of opportunity include Education (29th), Ecological sustainability (36th), Credit (28th), Investment (41st), and Creative goods and services (28th). At the indicator level, Germany improves in govern - ment expenditure by pupil (up by 5 spots), tertiary enrolment (up by 11), government's online service (up by 13), market capitalization (up by 6), FDI net inflows (up by 19), and ICTs and business model creation (up by 6). Germany has opportunity for improvement in ease of starting a business, gross capital formation, females employed with advanced degrees, IP payments, growth rate of GDP per worker, and new businesses. Ireland is ranked 10th this year, down three positions from last year. Ireland ranks in the top 25 across all pillars, but loses positions in Market sophistication (25th), Business sophis - tication (10th), Knowledge and tech - nology outputs (5th), and Creative outputs (13th). At the sub-pillar level, Ireland places in the top 2 in two important sub-pillars: Knowledge impact (2nd) and Knowledge dif - fusion (1st). Opportunities lie in General infrastructure (34th), Credit (40th), Investment (29th), Knowledge creation (38th), and Creative goods and services (33rd). Ireland shows weakness in a number of particular indicators, including domestic credit to private sector, market capitaliza - tion, intensity of local competition, industrial designs by origin, and cul - tural and creative services exports. Ireland holds the top position in IP payments, ICT services exports, and FDI net outflows, and shows a better ranking than in 2016 in a number of important indicators, including PISA results, researchers, global R&D companies, gross capital formation, and GDP per unit of energy use. The top 10 in the Innovation Input Sub- IndexThe Innovation Input Sub-Index considers the elements of an economy that enable innovative activity across five pillars. The top 10 economies in the Innovation Input Sub-Index are Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, the USA, Denmark, the UK, Hong Kong (China), the Netherlands, and Canada. Hong Kong (China) and Canada are the only economies in this group that are not also in the GII top 10. The Netherlands entered the top 10 in 2017, while Japan, ranked 9th on the input side last year, exited the top 10 this year. Hong Kong (China) drops from 2nd to 8th in the Innovation Input Sub-Index this year and ranks 16th overall, down from 14th in 2016. It retains its good positions in Institutions (3rd) and Market sophis - tication (2nd), but falls in three out of five input pillars, with the largest drop in Human capital and research (28th). In 9 of the 15 input sub-pillars, Hong Kong (China) ranks in the top 10, holding top spots in Regulatory environment (2nd), Business envi - ronment (2nd), Ecological sus - tainability (1st), Credit (3rd), and Knowledge absorption (3rd). Hong Kong (China), however, drops significantly in Education (73rd), which is a weak sub-pillar this year, and R&D (33rd). This is partly the result of a new missing value (school life expectancy) and a drop in global R&D companies (43rd). Other weak indicators include GERD financed by abroad, IP payments, and ICT services imports and exports. Despite these downward movements, Hong Kong (China) preserves its top spot in JV-strategic alliance deals, high-tech imports, and FDI net inflows and improves its rank in PISA results, patents by origin, and utility models by origin. Canada remains in the 10th position in the Innovation Input Sub-Index, while ranking 18th overall, down three positions from 2016. Canada's strengths on the input side are a result of having top 25 rankings in six of the seven pillars. Canada shows particular strengths in Institutions (7th) and Market sophis - tication (3rd), while improving in Human capital and research (20th). This year, however, Canada loses seven positions in Infrastructure (18th) and four in Business sophistication (24th). In Infrastructure, it loses posi - tions in all sub-pillars\u2014in particular in Ecological sustainability, where it loses 19 positions in ISO 14001 environmental certificates (73rd). In Business sophistication, Canada drops most in innovation linkages, driven by a decline in ranking in university/industry research collaboration. Top 10 sub-pillar rankings for Canada this year are Political environment (6th, a strength), Regulatory environ - ment (10th), Business environment (7th), General infrastructure (7th), Credit (8th), and Investment (2nd, also a strength). Canada improves in 25 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 2017Education in 2017, in part because of stronger rankings in expenditure on education, government expenditure by pupil, and PISA results. The top 10 in the Innovation Output Sub- IndexThe Innovation Output Sub-Index variables provide information on ele - ments that are the result of innovation within an economy. Although scores on the Input and Output Sub-Indices might differ substantially, leading to important shifts in rankings from one sub-index to the other for particular countries, the data confirm that efforts made to improve enabling environ - ments are rewarded with better innovation outputs. The top 10 econ - omies in the Innovation Output Sub-Index this year are Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg, the USA, the UK, Germany, Ireland, Korea, and Iceland. The 10 economies leading the Innovation Output Sub-Index remain broadly consistent with their rankings in 2016, with several shifts and one substitution: three economies move upward within the top 10 (the Netherlands, the USA, and Germany), while five econo - mies move downward (Sweden, Luxembourg, the UK, Ireland, and Iceland). Korea enters the top 10 on the Output side, while Finland exits the top 10 in 2017. Seven of these economies are ranked in the GII top 10; the profiles of the other three economies are discussed below. Luxembourg ranks 4th in the Innovation Output Sub-Index in 2017 and 12th in the overall GII. On the output side, Luxembourg loses four positions in Knowledge and technol - ogy outputs (15th), while gaining 1st place in Creative outputs. In this pillar, it maintains its strengths in cultural and creative services exports, national feature films, and generic top-level domains (TLDs) and improves in industrial designs by origin and ICT and organizational model creation. Luxembourg also keeps the top posi - tion in the Innovation Efficiency Ratio rankings. The Republic of Korea (Korea) attains the 9th position in the Innovation Output Sub-Index this year, up by two positions. Korea gains six positions in Creative outputs, ranking 15th this year. It improves in Creative goods and ser - vices (35th) and maintains the top spot in industrial designs by origin. Although the country drops one spot in Knowledge and technology outputs (6th), it improves in one of its areas of greatest strength\u2014Knowledge cre - ation (2nd)\u2014where it maintains its top rankings in patents by origin and PCT patent applications and advances to the top spot in utility models by origin. Korea also improves its rank in Human capital and research (2nd), where it holds its 1st place in R&D. Although its gross R&D expendi - ture goes down by one position, Korea manages to retain its 2nd and 3rd positions in GERD performed by business and GERD financed by business, respectively. The country's areas of relative weakness include ICT services exports and printing and publishing manufactures on the side of outputs; and tertiary inbound mobility, GDP per unit of energy use, knowledge-intensive employment, and FDI inflows on the inputs side. Iceland ranks 10th in the Innovation Output-Sub Index in 2017. This year, Iceland gains four positions in Knowledge and technol - ogy outputs (18th) and reaches 2nd place in Creative outputs. Iceland maintains the top spot in Creative goods and services and Online cre - ativity, ranking 1st in three of the indicators across these sub-pillars: national feature films, printing and publishing manufactures, and generic top-level domains (TLDs). Iceland advances its ranking in Knowledge creation (13th) and Knowledge dif - fusion (21st), ranking 1st in scientific and technical articles and improving in PCT patent applications, growth rate of GDP per worker, ISO 9001 quality certificates, IP receipts, ICT services exports, and FDI net outflows. Top performers by income group Viewing economies among their income-group peers can illustrate important relative competitive advantages and help decision makers glean important lessons for improved performance that are applicable on the ground. The GII also assesses results relative to the development stages of countries. Table/uni00A04 shows the 10 best-ranked economies in each index by income group. Switzerland, Sweden, and the Netherlands are among the high-income top 10 on the three main indi - ces, and the top 3 in the Innovation Output Sub-Index. Compared to last year, Hungary and Estonia leave the group, making space for the Czech Republic and Korea. Among the 10 highest-ranked upper-middle-income economies, nine remain from 2016 (see also Box/uni00A0 4): China (22nd this year), Bulgaria (36th), Malaysia (37th), Romania (42nd), Turkey (43rd), Montenegro (48th), Thailand (51st), Costa Rica (53rd), and South Africa (57th). The newcomer to this group of the 10 best upper-middle-income performers is the Russian Federation (45th), which displaces Mauritius (64th). China, Malaysia, Bulgaria, and Romania are among the 10 best-ranked upper-middle-income economies across all three main indi - ces and in the Innovation Efficiency Ratio. The same analysis for lower- middle-income countries shows that eight of the top 10 countries THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 201726Table 4: Ten best-ranked economies by income group (rank) Global Innovation Index Innovation Input Sub-Index Innovation Output Sub-Index Innovation Efficiency Ratio High-income economies (48 in total) 1 Switzerland (1) Singapore (1) Switzerland (1) Luxembourg (1) 2 Sweden (2) Sweden (2) Netherlands (2) Switzerland (2) 3 Netherlands (3) Switzerland (3) Sweden (3) Netherlands (4) 4 United States of America (4) Finland (4) Luxembourg (4) Iceland (5) 5 United Kingdom (5) United States of America (5) United States of America (5) Ireland (6) 6 Denmark (6) Denmark (6) United Kingdom (6) Germany (7) 7 Singapore (7) United Kingdom (7) Germany (7) Malta (8) 8 Finland (8) Hong Kong (China) (8) Ireland (8) Sweden (12) 9 Germany (9) Netherlands (9) Korea, Rep.

These include Viet Nam (47th), Ukraine (50th), the Republic of Moldova (54th), Armenia (59th), India (60th), Morocco (72nd), the Philippines (73rd), and Kenya (80th). New this year to the top 10 lower-middle-income countries are Mongolia (52nd) and Tunisia (74th), which displace Georgia (68th) and Tajikistan (94th). Seven of the top 10 lower-middle-income countries have rankings in the top 10 for each of the three indices and the Innovation Efficiency Ratio, with the exceptions of Morocco, Tunisia, and Kenya. There has also been a strong consistency among low-income countries, with eight out of 10 economies remaining in the top 10. The United Republic of Tanzania is the top-ranked low-income country (96th), having moved up nine spots in the overall GII since 2016, and with improvements in the Innovation Input (109th) and Output (76th) Sub-Indices (see Box/uni00A05). Following in the ranking of low-income coun - tries are Rwanda (99th), Senegal (100th), which the now-lower-middle-income economy displaces Mali (118th). Ranking well across all main indices of the GII, the United Republic of Tanzania, Senegal, Mozambique, Nepal, and Malawi are among the top 10 low-income countries. All economies in the low-income top 10, except Rwanda and Uganda, are in the low-income top 10 in the Innovation Efficiency Ratio. Maximizing innovation resources and synergies: The Innovation Efficiency RatioThe Innovation Efficiency Ratio is calculated as the ratio of the Output Sub-Index score over the Input Sub-Index score. It assesses the effec - tiveness of innovation systems and policies. It must be noted, however, that economies might also reach a relatively high Innovation Efficiency Ratio as a result of particularly low input scores. Because of this, effi - ciency ratios must be analysed jointly with GII, Input, and Output scores, and with the development stages of the economies in mind. The 10 countries with the high - est Innovation Efficiency Ratios are countries that combine certain lev - els of innovation inputs with more robust output results (see Table/uni00A01): Luxembourg, Switzerland, China, the Netherlands, Iceland, Ireland, Germany, Malta, Turkey, and Viet Nam. Compared to previous years, new middle-income economies joined the top 10 most efficient economies: China, which entered the top 10 last year, is accompanied this year by Turkey and a lower-middle-income economy, Viet Nam, which makes the most spectacular progress this year (see Box/uni00A06). Economies from Europe; South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania; and Northern Africa and West Asia take up the first 20 positions in this ratio ranking. Among high-income economies, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Korea, Kuwait, Estonia, and the UK are in the group of the 20 most efficient economies in innovation. Among upper-middle-income economies, Bulgaria and the Islamic Republic of Iran are in the top 20 in terms of efficiency. From the lower-middle-income group, the top 20 most efficient economies include Ukraine and Armenia. No low-income economies are in the top 20 this year in innovation efficiency rankings.Clustering innovation leaders, innovation achievers, and innovation performers at and below development relative to GDP: The GII bubble chartThe GII helps also identify countries' performance in innovation relative to their level of GDP. Figure/uni00A04 on pages 30-31 presents the GII scores plotted against GDP per capita in PPP$ (in natural logs). The econo - mies that appear close to the trend line show results that are in accor - dance with what is expected based on their level of development. The further up and above the trend line a country appears, the better its inno - vation performance is when com - pared with that of its peers at the same stage of development. Red-coloured bubbles in the figure correspond to the efficient innovators (a major - ity of them are situated above the trend line), while the blue-coloured bubbles represent those countries in the lower half of the Innovation Efficiency Ratio. In the group of innovation leaders we find the same top 25 economies as in 2016, with two exceptions: the Czech Republic is moving back into this group while Belgium is moving out. All of these are high-income economies, with the sole exception of China, which belongs to the upper-middle-income group. These econo - mies are located in four regions, with the majority in South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania and in Europe, and the rest in Northern America and in Northern Africa and Western Asia. All of the economies in this group have a GII score above 50. These economies show mature innovation systems with solid institutions and high levels of market and business sophistication, allowing investment in human capital and infrastructure to translate into quality innovation outputs. Economies that perform at least 10% above their peers for their level THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 201728of GDP are called 'innovation achiev - ers.' These are shown in Table/uni00A05 listed by income group and years as an innovation achiever. These econo - mies show better results in inno - vation because they continuously improve their innovation systems, have more structured institutional frameworks, develop linkages that allow knowledge absorption and the flow of highly skilled human capital, and foster a higher integration with international markets. Although these traits translate into proper resource allocation for education, higher levels of economic growth, and income for workers, they are not homogenous among these economies. A total of 17 economies compose the group of innovation achievers. This group has grown since the 2016 edition of the GII. Most of these economies\u2014nine in total\u2014come from the Sub-Saharan Africa region, followed by three economies in the Eastern region of Europe. A stronger performance in innovation outputs this year allows the Czech Republic to leave the achiever group and move into the group of leader economies. Portugal moves also out of this group and into the group of economies per - forming on par with their develop - ment for their level of GDP, partially as a result of a weaker performance in general infrastructure and knowl - edge absorption. Two new econo - mies join this group: Burundi and the United Republic of Tanzania from Sub-Saharan Africa, while Armenia from Northern Africa and Western Asia and Bulgaria from the Eastern Europe region appear in this list for the second year in a row. Importantly, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda, Mozambique, and Malawi stand out for being innova - tion achievers at least five times in the previous six years. Madagascar has done so in the two most recent years and both Burundi and the United Republic of Tanzania only in 2017. With the exception of Senegal, Bulgaria, and the latter two economies, all have been identified as innovation achievers in the two most recent years. Kenya, the chief innova - tion achiever in the region, has been considered as such every year since 2011. Most of these economies per - form above their peers in Innovation linkages, particularly in GERD financed by abroad and FDI net inflows. These economies also share strengths in government expenditure on education per pupil, gross capital formation, and the growth rate of GDP per worker. This analysis also allows for iden - tifying a group of economies that perform at least 10% below their peers for their level of GDP. This cluster includes 39 countries from different regions and income groups: 9 are from the high-income group (6 of these are from the Northern Africa and Western Asia region), 17 are from the upper-middle-income group, 11 are from the lower-middle-income group, and 2 are low-income economies. Regional rankings This section discusses regional and sub-regional trends, with snapshots for some of the economies leading in the rankings.

Both the USA and Canada are high-income economies and rank in the top 10 economies in terms of GDP. The USA ranks 4th overall this year, unchanged from 2016, and is in the top 10 economies in both the Innovation Input Sub-Index (5th) and the Innovation Output Sub-Index (5th). Canada is 18th overall and is in the top 25 economies in the Innovation Input Sub-Index (10th) and the Innovation Output Sub-Index (23rd), unchanged from last year.Sub-Saharan Africa (25 economies)For several editions, the GII has noted that the Sub-Saharan Africa region performs relatively well on innovation (see Box/uni00A0 5). Since 2012, Sub-Saharan Africa has had more countries among the group of innovation achievers than any other region. It will be important for Africa Since 2012 and to this day, the number of Sub-Saharan Africa countries in the group of innovation achievers has been the highest among all regions. \u00b9 Strengths in the region remain in areas considered crucial for the expansion of innovation locally. Factors such as improved business environments offer the necessary stimulus to maintain the positive development seen in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past years. Boosted by economies such as Mauritius, Botswana, South Africa, Namibia, Rwanda, and Burkina Faso, this year Sub-Saharan Africa has its highest scores in Institutions and Market sophistication, where these countries perform on par or better than some of their peers in Europe and South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania. In addition to developments in Business sophistication, efforts to improve Human capital and research as well as Infrastructure have also translated into higher regional scores in these pillars. Although larger economies such as South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Kenya help foster the expansion in Infrastructure, others such as Senegal, Mauritius, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe are helping to do so in Human capital and research. This box showcases the regional innova - tion performance of Sub-Saharan Africa coun-tries by considering both the overall GII scores and those of the seven individual GII pillars. Countries are termed 'innovation achievers' and said to outperform their peers if their GII scores are higher than expected based on their level of economic development (as measured by GDP per capita). Countries also have the opportunity to be 'pillar outperform - ers' if they outperform their peers on more than half of the seven GII pillars. Countries that meet both of these benchmarks are referred to as 'innovation outperformers'. Although the number of countries fea - tured in the GII this year is similar to last year's, the number of countries identified as innovation achievers is slightly higher. \u00b2 Figure 5.1 shows the performance of all 25 economies in Sub-Sahara Africa. This year over 50% of innovation achievers come from Sub-Saharan Africa, allowing this region to continue to lead in this metric. A total of nine economies\u2014Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Mozambique, Malawi, Senegal, Madagascar, Burundi, and the United Republic of Tanzania GII score Innovation achiever Performing at level of development Performing below level of development Upper bound Trend line Lower boundFigure 5.1: Innovation achievers in Burundi; = = Malawi; NAM = Namibia; NER = Niger; = Nigeria; = Rwanda; SEN = Senegal; = South ZWE = Zimbabwe.Box 5: Sub-Saharan Africa: The innovation momentum in the most promising region continues (Continued on next page)THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 201734to preserve its current innovation momentum. This year South Africa takes the top spot among all economies in the region (57th), followed by Mauritius (64th), Kenya (80th), Botswana (89th), the United Republic of Tanzania (96th), Namibia (97th), Rwanda (99th), and Senegal (100th). Among these, only Botswana and the United Republic of Tanzania improve their GII ranking compared to 2016, while Kenya remains stable and the other four economies (South Africa, Mauritius, Namibia, and Rwanda) lose positions. The remaining 17 economies in this region can be found at ranks lower than 100. Eight of them have improved since 2016: Benin (116th), Cameroon (117th), Togo (125th), and Guinea (126th). See Box/uni00A05 for more details. Because of issues with data cover - age, Ghana drops out of the GII this (Tanzania)\u2014perform better than their level of development would predict (see Figure 5.1 for details). The innovation achiever econo - mies are shown in red and located above the upper-bound, farthest from the trend line. A total of eight economies are identified as performing at development (yellow). In the same way, the remaining eight are signalled as performing below development (blue). \u00b3 Kenya, Mozambique, Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda, and Senegal stand out for being innovation achievers at least five times in the past six years. Kenya, the chief innovation achiever in the region, has been credited as such every year since 2011\u2014including in 2017. With the exception of Malawi, these economies, along with Mauritius, South Africa, Tanzania, and Niger, outperform their peers in more than half of the seven GII pillars and thus are also labelled pillar outperformers. Most of these innovation achiever economies outperform in Institutions, Infrastructure, and Market sophistication; they outperform this year also in Human capital and research and in Business sophistication, but not as much as they could. Uganda outperforms in all seven pillars, followed by Kenya and Rwanda that do so in six. South Africa and Tanzania outperform in five; while Mauritius, Mozambique, and Niger only in four. Malawi outperforms in three, while Madagascar and Burundi do so in two and therefore are the only innovation achievers that are not pillar outperformers. This year four of the innovation achievers mentioned above\u2014Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Mozambique\u2014are labelled innovation outperformers within the Sub-Saharan Africa region. Table 5.1 shows the full list of achiev - ers and outperformers in this region. However, although the region's relatively strong performance in innovation signals strengths, differences between the innova - tion levels of some of its economies still show large disparities. Because, since the big dip experienced in parts of the region last year, economies in Africa aim for economic recovery in 2017 and in the years following, and while commodity prices are recovering, it will be important for other less-developed economies to keep improving their innova - tion performance to maintain the momen-tum of the region's innovation efforts.

This table includes GII 2017. Economies identified as an innovation achiever and a pillar outperformer for two or more consecutive years, including 2016 and 2015, are also considered innovation outperformers. 35 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 2017year, while Zimbabwe is added (see Annex 2). Latin America and the Caribbean (18 economies)Latin America and the Caribbean includes only upper- and lower-middle-income economies, with three exceptions: Chile, Uruguay, and Trinidad and Tobago, which are all high-income economies. Still leading the region in the GII rank - ings for another year, Chile (46th) loses two positions, and is followed by Costa Rica (53rd, down by eight) and Mexico (58th, up by three). Following these countries, and ranking in the top half of the GII this year, is Panama (63rd). The top 100 economies overall include Colombia (65th), Uruguay (67th), Brazil (69th), Peru (70th), Argentina (76th), Dominican Republic (79th), Jamaica (84th), Paraguay (85th), Trinidad and Tobago (91st), Ecuador (92nd), and Guatemala (98th). The remaining economies in the region rank below 100 in the GII this year: El Salvador (103rd), Honduras (104th), and the Plurinational State of Bolivia (106th). Although important regional potential exists, the GII rankings of countries in Latin America relative to other regions have not steadily improved. In recent years and in 2017, no economies from this region are identified as innovation achievers (see Box/uni00A04 in the 2015 edition of the GII). As previously mentioned, the minimum data coverage threshold rule was adjusted this year to retain only those economies with suffi - cient data coverage in the GII. As a result, Nicaragua and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela drop from the GII 2017 (see Annex 2). Chile ranks 46th in the GII this year, at the top spot in the region, but down two positions since 2016. It is ranked 42nd and 53rd in the Innovation Input Sub-Index and Innovation Output Sub-Index, respectively, with a place in the top 50 economies across five pillars: Institutions (41st), Infrastructure (47th), Market sophistication (50th), Business sophistication (46th), and Knowledge and technology outputs (49th). Its improvements in 2017 lie in Knowledge and technology outputs, where it gains 10 positions, and Human capital and research (61st), where it advances one spot. In Knowledge and technology out - puts, major improvements are in Knowledge diffusion (34th), with better rankings in IP receipts and FDI net outflows, and in a number of individual indicators, including PCT patent applications, scientific and technical articles, and growth rate of GDP per worker. In Human capital and research, Chile improves mainly in Education (65th), gaining eight positions since last year and see - ing its ranking in every indicator in this sub-pillar improve. Tertiary edu - cation (55th) also gains one position, as Chile becomes the 5th economy in the world in tertiary enrolment. Despite the improvements, Chile still shows areas of weakness in pil - lar 2, Human capital and research, in a total of four indicators including government expenditure in educa - tion (60th), pupil-teacher ratio (83rd), tertiary inbound mobility (96th), and global companies by R&D (43rd). Brazil is ranked 69th in the GII 2017, the same position as last year. Brazil's strongest pillar ranking is in Business sophistication (43rd), where it sees one of its highest rankings in IP payments (8th). Brazil's biggest improvements are in Human capital and research (50th, up by 10) and Creative outputs (83rd, up by 7). In Human capital and research, Brazil improved its rank in all sub-pillars, in particular in expenditure on educa - tion and QS university ranking. In Creative outputs, gains are seen in Intangible assets and Online creativ - ity, primarily in ICTs and business model creation, Wikipedia edits, and video uploads on YouTube. Although Business environment and Tertiary education still have room for improve - ment, Brazil is also relatively weak in Credit and Knowledge impact. Some indicators where the economy could improve further include PISA results, graduates in science and engineering, tertiary inbound mobility, gross capi - tal formation, JV-strategic alliance deals, and growth rate of GDP per worker. Persistence will be needed in a time of political and economic uncertainty to benefit from the economic uptick as described at the outset of the chapter. Central and Southern Asia (9 economies) Economies of the Central and Southern Asia region have seen fur - ther improvements in their rankings since 2016, with seven economies improving their rankings and with India moving into the top half of the GII this year. India maintains its top place in the region, moving up six spots\u2014from 66th last year to 60th this year overall. The Islamic Republic of Iran becomes 2nd in the region, mov - ing from 78th to 75th and leaving its 78th spot to Kazakhstan, which drops three positions from 2016. The remaining economies rank in order within the region as follows: Sri Lanka shows a one-position improvement this year (90th); this is followed by Tajikistan (94th), Kyrgyzstan (95th), Nepal (109th), Pakistan (113th), and Bangladesh (114th). Despite the improvements in data coverage in the region, Bhutan does not meet the 66% data coverage threshold (see Annex 2) and is thus excluded from the 2017 GII. India remains 1st in the region and 6th among lower-middle-income THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 201736economies. India has also outper - formed on innovation relative to its GDP per capita for many years in a row (see Figure/uni00A04). India ranks 60th overall in the GII this year, is also among the top 50 economies in two pillars: Market sophistication (39th) and Knowledge and technology outputs (38th). It improves its rank - ings in five pillars: Institutions (up 4 spots), Infrastructure (up 14 spots), Business sophistication (up 2 spots), Knowledge and technology outputs (up 5 spots), and Creative outputs (up 9 spots). By contrast, Human capi - tal and research (64th) and Market sophistication lose one and six posi - tions respectively. At the sub-pillar level, India enjoys its largest gains in areas such as Knowledge absorption, Knowledge impact, and Intangible assets. Despite remaining a weak sub-pillar, India improves in Education, where it advances four positions because of better relative government expenditure by pupil. At the indicator level, India improves in a number of areas this year, including government's online services, e-participation, logistics performance, gross capital formation, high-tech imports, and industrial designs. Also worth mentioning is the six-position gain in global R&D companies, where India ranks 14th, considerably better than the respec - tive groups of lower- and upper-mid - dle-income economies on average. Other such areas in which India does far better than most middle-income economies include graduates in sci - ence and engineering, gross capital formation, state of cluster develop - ment, GERD performed by business, research talent, and patent families in two or more offices on the input side; and quality of scientific publications, growth rate of GDP per worker, high-tech and ICT services exports, high-tech manufactures, and IP receipts on the output side (Figure/uni00A06). India still has more potential. Business environment (121st) is an area where the country can improve on most indicators. On the input side, in environmental performance, PISA results, and tertiary inbound mobil - ity Indian scores are lower than the average for lower-middle-income economies. The same is true for other Human capital and research indicators, including researchers and tertiary enrolment, and for FDI net inflows. On the output side, a number of indicators\u2014such as scientific and technical articles and trademarks by origin\u2014are lower than upper-mid - dle-income economy averages. Other indicators on the output side that show room for improvement include indicators measuring new businesses and industrial design filings. In the same way as other coun - tries (on Viet Nam, see Box/uni00A06), India has worked intensively to improve its innovation performance, including by hosting innovation workshops and instituting important work in recent years with the use of the GII, and by instituting a high-level Task Force on Innovation to suggest ways the country can improve its innova - tion eco-system. /three.superior In this context, India has considerably improved its 020406080100 Patent families in 2+ ocesIntellectual property receiptsGERD R&D formationState of cluster developmentGraduates in science & engineeringResearch talent in business enterpriseHigh- & medium-high tech upper-middle-income economies37 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 2017data coverage in the 2016 and 2017 editions of the GII.

South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania (15 economies)This year all economies but Cambodia (101st) within the South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania region are ranked within the top 100 in the GII. With the exception also of Cambodia and of Brunei Darussalam, which enters the GII this year thanks to improved data coverage, all other economies in the region are also in the top 100 in the Innovation Input Sub-Index, the Innovation Output Sub-Index, and the Innovation Efficiency Ratio. The top five economies in the region rank in the top 25 overall for the GII, the Innovation Input Sub-Index, and the Innovation Output Sub-Index: Singapore (7th), Korea (11th), Japan (14th), Hong Kong (China) (16th), and New Zealand (21st). China ranks next (22nd), being the third most efficient econ - omy in the world; Australia follows (at 23rd). Malaysia moves down two positions to 37th, due mostly to a 10-position drop in Institutions (53rd), a drop driven by lower Box 6: ASEAN: Singapore and the new Asian Tigers? Ten out of the 15 economies in the South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania region are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). \u00b9 These economies are Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. In 2015, intra-ASEAN exports represented the 26% of exports by ASEAN countries. \u00b2 Electrical machinery and equipment is the single most exported com - modity within ASEAN.\u00b3 Since the 1980s, Singapore\u2014along with Hong Kong (China), the Republic of Korea, and, to some extent, Malaysia\u2014has been labelled one of the Asian Tigers. Singapore has managed to sustain its high economic growth rate to become one of the richest economies in the world. Correspondingly, it has ranked in the top 10 since the first edition of the GII. In comparison, the other ASEAN members are less rich and advanced. However, some of the ASEAN economies\u2014in particular, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014are now considered to be 'new Asian Tigers' on the rise. These economies participate more and more in a number of regional and global value chains, including some in relatively high-tech sectors. These countries have also become active in improving their innova - tion performance, sometimes in showcasing best practice use of the GII findings, paired with remarkable innovation results. In 2017, for example, the Vietnamese government mandated Resolution 19-2017/NQ-CP. Through this resolution, the Vietnamese government has assigned responsibilities to ministries, agencies, and local governments to undertake actions to improve Viet Nam's performance, and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) has been tasked with coordinating these efforts. A MOST workshop in cooperation with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) was organized in Hanoi in March 2017 to address missing and outdated data and to help leverage Viet Nam's innovation strengths and overcome related weaknesses. In the broader ASEAN analysis, both dif - ferences and similarities in innovation perfor - mance are evident across ASEAN economies. Figures 6.1 and 6.2 show the scores of these economies in selected innovation input and output indicators. Three findings emerge from these figures. First, a certain stability exists at the top of the ASEAN rankings. Singapore has the highest scores among ASEAN members in all selected indicators, except for expenditure on education (topped by Viet Nam), gross capital formation (topped by Brunei Darussalam), ICT service exports (topped by the Philippines), and trademarks by origin (topped by Thailand). Cambodia is relatively new in terms of economic catch-up. Although improving, it lags behind in most of the input indicators selected here, although it is second in FDI net inflows among ASEAN economies, foreshadowing welcome development ahead. Second, each economy is making an effort to build its innovation system: in each, areas of excellence are emerging, while oth - ers are still works in progress. For example, Viet Nam shows the best score of the group in expenditure on education and is also performing well in ICT use, gross capital formation, and FDI net inflows; at the same time, it has some of the lowest scores in tertiary enrolment, state of cluster develop - ment, university/industry research collabora - tion, and knowledge-intensive employment. Malaysia ranks second in the ASEAN group in expenditure on education, state of cluster development, university/industry research collaboration, and ICT use, but has low scores in PISA scores in reading, maths, and science; tertiary enrolment; and knowledge-intensive employment. Third, the distance between the top performer and the other ASEAN economies in output indicators is much larger than the distance in inputs. It takes time for economies to create the conditions and accumulate the capabilities required to convert a fertile innovation environment and solid innova-tion inputs into tangible innovation outputs and outcomes. Among ASEAN economies, Singapore is the top performer in the selected innovation outputs, with two exceptions: ICT services exports, where the Philippines leads; and trademarks by origin, where Viet Nam presents the highest score in the group. Malaysia has the second highest scores in patents by origin, scientific and technical articles, and ICT services exports. Thailand's strengths are in citable documents and trademarks by origin, where it places 2nd.

The lat - ter move is affected by the use of two more recent data points for firms offering formal training (from 25th to 79th) and GERD financed by business (from 11th to 75th). Malaysia is also among the middle-income economies that are the clos - est to the top 25 this year (see Box/uni00A04 on the innovation divide). Viet Nam, by contrast, gains 12 positions this year, ranking 47th. Viet Nam maintains its top place among lower-middle-income econ - omies and enters the world's top 10 in the Innovation Efficiency Ratio (see Box/uni00A0 6). Thailand (51st) and Mongolia (52nd) follow Viet Nam, ranking in the top half of the GII this year as well. Brunei Darussalam, the Philippines, and Indonesia rank 71st, 73rd, and 87th, respectively. Cambodia closes the rankings for the region, coming in at 101st. Japan has risen in the GII rank - ings each year for the last four years, moving up to 14th in 2017. Japan ranks 11th overall in the Innovation Input Sub-Index and 20th overall in the Innovation Output Sub-Index, up by four positions since 2016. This year Japan improves its rank in Institutions (13th) and Knowledge and technology outputs (12th), where it advances in all sub-pillars. Japan ranks in the top 10 economies for six sub-pillars: Research and development (3rd), Information and communication technologies (5th), Trade, competition, and market scale (3rd), Knowledge absorption (8th), Knowledge creation (9th), and Knowledge diffusion (10th). Japan ranks 1st in a number of input and output indicators, including inten - sity of local competition, GERD financed by business, patent families in two or more offices, patents by origin, and PCT patent applications. Opportunities for further improve - ment still exist, including in ease of getting credit, growth rate of GDP per worker, new businesses, and cul - tural and creative services exports. Northern Africa and Western Asia (19 economies)Israel (17th) and Cyprus (30th) achieve the top two spots in the region for the fifth consecutive year, improving by four and one positions, respectively. Third in the region is the United Arab Emirates (35th) which moves up six places from last year, the most striking upward move in the region. In the case of the United Arab Emirates, data col - laboration has also increased data availability, reducing missing values from 17 last year to 11 this year. Important data points, however, are still missing, making it difficult to evaluate certain pillars, most nota - bly in Education, where three out of five variables are not available, and Knowledge workers, with two out of five indicators missing. Sixteen of the 19 economies in the Northern Africa and Western Asia region are in the top 100, including Turkey (43rd), Qatar (49th), Saudi Arabia (55th), Kuwait (56th), Armenia (59th), Bahrain (66th), Georgia (68th), Morocco (72nd), Tunisia (74th), Oman (77th), Lebanon (81st), Azerbaijan (82nd), and Jordan (83rd). Of all the econo - mies in the region, Kuwait sees the most improvement in its overall GII ranking, having moved up 11 spots. Israel moves up four places, from 21st to 17th in 2017, remain - ing number 1 in the Northern Africa and Western Asia region. Israel is the only economy in the region to rank in the top 10 for any pillar (5th, Business sophistication, up one spot; and 9th, Knowledge and technology outputs, up three). The country ranks 20th and 14th in the Innovation Input Sub-Index and Innovation Output Sub-Index, respectively, seeing the most gains in Tertiary education (62nd, up 11 spots), Knowledge absorption (9th, up 7 spots), and Knowledge diffu - sion (8th, up 6 spots). Israel keeps its 1st place in researchers, venture capital deals, GERD performed by business, and research talent in business enterprise. It also gains top 3 positions in gross expenditure on R&D (1st), university/industry research collaboration (3rd), ICT services export (1st), and Wikipedia edits (3rd). Weaknesses for Israel are found in the input side of the GII and are more prominent in variables such as gross fixed capital formation. On the output side, two areas show possibilities for improvement: the growth rate of GDP per worker and trademarks by origin. Europe (39 economies) In this year's edition of the GII, 15 of the top 25 economies come from Europe. This region is home to the top 3 economies of the GII 2017: Switzerland (1st), Sweden (2nd), and the Netherlands (3rd). Following these regional leaders among this group of top 25 are the UK (5th), Denmark (6th), Finland (8th), Germany (9th), Ireland (10th), Luxembourg (12th), Iceland (13th), France (15th), Norway (19th), Austria (20th), the Czech Republic (24th), and Estonia (25th). It should be noted that most of the economies in this region have the fewest miss - ing values, leading them to display the most accurate GII rankings (see Annex 2). This includes the following THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 201740economies with 100% data coverage in the Innovation Input Sub-Index, the Innovation Output Sub-Index, or both: Denmark, Finland, Germany, France, Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and the Russian Federation. Eighteen economies follow among the top 50 and have main - tained relatively stable rankings since 2014: Malta (26th), Belgium (27th), Spain (28th), Italy (29th), Portugal (31st), Slovenia (32nd), Latvia (33rd), Slovakia (34th), Bulgaria (36th), Poland (38th), Hungary (39th), Lithuania (40th), Croatia (41st), Romania (42nd), Greece (44th), the Russian Federation (45th), Montenegro (48th, which joins the top 50 this year), and Ukraine (which joins the top 50 this year at the 50th position, moving up by six). The remaining European econo - mies remain among the top 100 econ - omies overall. The region's rankings continue as follows: the Republic of Moldova (54th), the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (61st), Serbia (62nd), Bosnia and Herzegovina (86th), Belarus (88th), and Albania (93rd), with Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina as the only improving economies in this group. France moves up another three spots in 2017, from 18th to 15th. France ranks 15th in the Innovation Input Sub-Index and gains one spot in the Innovation Output Sub-Index (18th). It ranks in the top 25 econo - mies in all pillars, showing improve - ments in Institutions (24th), Market sophistication (11th), Knowledge and technology outputs (20th), and Creative outputs (12th). France's three most-improved sub-pillars\u2014Investment (10th), Knowledge impact (36th), and Intangible assets (7th)\u2014gain positions in market cap - italization, growth rate of GDP per worker, and ICT and business model creation. France loses the most posi - tions in Infrastructure (12th), and in all its sub-pillars, including losses of the top spots in government's online service and e-participation. Furthermore, France becomes rela - tively weak in pupil-teacher ratio, while retaining all the other areas of weaknesses that it presented last year. Assessing regional innovation clusters This year the GII makes a first attempt at assessing sub-national innovation clusters. The Special Section on Clusters in this report sets out the approach and main findings in more detail. The importance of innovation hubs at the sub-national and interna - tional level has been at the forefront of GII discussions for the last 10 years for two main reasons. First, successful innovation clus - ters, and thus agglomerations of innovation activity, are consid - ered essential for national inno - vation performance. By pooling talent, know-how, research labs, and manufacturing capabilities they constitute 'spikes' or 'peaks of excellence' with critical inno - vation linkages. A discussion on this issue has been at the fore - front of almost every GII edi - tion. In particular, the GII 2013 on the theme 'Local Dynamics of Innovation' analysed clusters, asking which kinds of linkages exist among them, and to what extent knowledge spillovers occur. Importantly, some of these clusters are international in nature. They do not coincide with boundaries of sub-national cities or regions; rather they cross national borders. Second, over the last 10 years, one of the most frequent ques - tions asked by countries has been whether the GII model can be applied at the sub-national level to assess innova - tion clusters more broadly. Vari - ous countries have approached the GII co-publishers to create regional innovation indices on the basis of the GII model. In January 2017, the Indian gov - ernment decided to rank the performance of Indian states in the 'India Innovation Index'. A shared conviction underlying both points is that the interaction of critical innovation inputs and out - puts happens at the local level, and this phenomenon requires improved metrics. Yet this is where the prob - lem lies, as shown in Table/uni00A07. /one.superior Despite the progress that has been made, measuring the territorial dimension of innovation remains challenging. Only a few GII indi - cators are readily available at the regional or city level for a large set of countries. A case in point is that, at this time, the GII model relies on a survey-based question to assess the 'state of cluster development' (indi - cator 5.2.1) rather than official data. As a testament to imperfect data availability on this critical innova - tion dimension, efforts to replace this variable with hard data from recognized sources have so far failed. Besides, clusters often do not stop at national borders. By definition, they thus do not map to nationally available data sources; the search for readily available data is elusive. To make progress on this front, a first step is to identify clusters in an innovative way. The GII 2017 edi - tion makes progress in this regard. In the Special Section on Clusters at the end of the report, Bergquist, Fink, and Raffo propose a novel approach to assess the inventive capacity in clusters based on patenting data. By the means of inventor addresses, and using underlying geo-coding, the 41 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 1: The Global Innovation Index 2017authors identify the largest inventive clusters as measured by PCT patent - ing activity, possibly up to the street level thanks to advanced mapping techniques. Table/uni00A07 presents some of the leading innovation clusters that result from this analysis. In the coming years, attempts to foster data on local innovation clusters should receive increased attention, and consideration of clus - ters may possibly become a more important component of the GII and other innovation measurement efforts. Conclusions The theme for this year's GII is 'Innovation Feeding the World'. This chapter has provided an overview of the current trends, strategies, and policies for innovation in agriculture and food systems. Within agri-food systems, innovation needs to be a priority to achieve sustainable pro - ductivity growth and address the global food challenge. Successfully addressing this challenge will require a mix of technological and non-tech - nological solutions: organizational changes, public and private invest - ment in R&D, and more effective technology transfer mechanisms are all important elements of agri-food innovation systems. Historically, innovation in agri - culture has proven not only feasible but highly successful. Today, a new innovation drive is required among high-, middle-, and low-income economies. In high- and middle-income economies, a new innovation wave is on the horizon: innovations from other sectors are spilling over to agricultural and food systems, making them smart and digital. In low-income economies, the focus is on reducing the bottlenecks of agri-food innovation systems, while speeding up innovation convergence with more productive economies. In all economies, public policy is fun - damental to promoting an enabling environment that encourages tech - nology uptake, entrepreneurship and skills, and innovation. The remaining chapters of the report provide more details on this year's theme from aca - demic, business, and particular coun - try perspectives from leading experts and decision makers. This chapter has also presented the main GII 2017 results, distill - ing main messages and noting some important evolutions that have taken place since last year. Three main findings stand out. First\u2014and in a turn of events\u2014a novel and more sustained growth momentum is cur - rently in place. Second, more rapid economic growth can lay the founda - tion for innovation-driven economic development, but more investment would be needed to boost productiv - ity growth, which is still at historic lows. To this end, R&D efforts from both the public and private sector would also need to be intensified.

Over the last years, the GII has established itself as a leading refer - ence on innovation, becoming a 'tool for action' for decision makers wishing to improve their countries' innovation performance. Numerous workshops in different countries have brought innovation actors together, helped improve data availability, and contributed to designing effective innovation policies. These exchanges on the ground also generate feedback that, in turn, improves the GII and assists the journey towards improved innovation measurement and policy. This valuable feedback will continue to be integrated into future iterations of this lead chapter of the GII in the years to come. Notes for Box 5 1 In 2011 most innovation achievers were located in the South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania region. In 2012 and 2013 Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa shared the same number of innovation achievers: six and four in each year, respectively. 2 This can be partially attributed to improvements to data coverage. A stricter cut-off rule that increases the minimum required threshold for all countries in the GII to at least 66% of all indicators in each of the sub-indices was introduced this year (see Appendix IV: Technical Notes for more details). This procedure translates into more precise measurements of the innovation performance of each country and thus into a better identification of those that can be identified as innovation achievers. As a result of this improvement, however, two economies from this region identified as innovation achievers in previous years are no longer in the GII ranks: Gambia (2014) and Ghana (2011). 3 The general trend line is defined by the scores and economic development level of all countries considered in the GII. The threshold bounds are defined as 10% above and 10% below the scores defined by trend line (see Box 2 in Escalona Reynoso et al., 2015). 4 In addition to these 9 Sub-Saharan Africa countries, 26 countries (35 total) were identified as pillar outperformers this year. These come from Europe (9); South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania (6); Latin America and the Caribbean (5); Northern Africa and Western Asia (4); and Central and Southern Asia (2). 5 This can be partially attributed to the higher overall average scores in both of these indicators displayed by the region, which makes it harder for individual countries to perform above that level. 6 For a country to be labelled an 'innovation outperformer' it has to be identified as an 'innovation achiever' and it must also score above its income group average in four or more GII pillars for two or more years, including the two most recent\u20142015 and 2016. In 2017, 10 economies were identified as innovation outperformers. The other countries identified as innovation outperformers this year are Viet Nam, the Republic of Moldova, India, Armenia, Ukraine, and Tajikistan. See Escalona Reynoso et al. (2015) for more details. Notes for Chapter 1 1 Conference Board, 2017; IMF, 2017; OECD, 2017a. According to the World Bank (2017), the world economy will grow at 2.7% in 2017, up by 0.4% from 2016, with a downward revision of 0.1% from June 2016. For 2018, the OECD (2017a) and IMF (2017) forecast a growth rate of 3.6% without recent revisions. The World Bank (2017) predicted global GDP growth at 2.9%, and recently revised it downward by 0.1%. 2 IMF, 2017. 3 IMF, 2017; OECD, 2017a; World Bank, 2017. 4 IMF, 2017, with Russian GDP growth recently revised upwards. 5 World Bank, 2017. 6 Adler et al., 2017; OECD, 2017a; WIPO, 2015; World Bank, 2017. 7 World Bank, 2017. 8 Adler et al., 2017; Cornell et al., 2016. Estimates indicate that worldwide productivity growth slowed down in 2015 and remained at the same modest rate of 1.5% in 2016 (Conference Board, 2016, 2017). 9 The Conference Board, Total Economy Database (adjusted version), May 2017 release, available at http://www.conference-board.org/data/economydatabase/. 10 Fernald, 2014.

Based on our estimates, China is the only emerging economy with R&D intensity above the global average. Other middle-income economies, such as Malaysia, Brazil, India, and South Africa, present lower R&D intensities, between 1.3% and 0.7%. 20 Cornell et al., 2016; OECD, 2017b. 21 Despite these aggregate figures, some surveys indicate that top world R&D companies raised their R&D expenditures in 2015 and 2016 (European Commission, 2016; Strategy&, 2016). 22 WIPO, 2016. At the same time, worldwide patent applications under WIPO's Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) saw a 1.4% increase in 2015; a significant fall in growth compared with previous years (WIPO, 2016). 23 OECD, 2009, 2017b; WIPO, 2015. 24 A recent IMF analysis shows that, if advanced economies increased private R&D by 40% on average, they could increase their GDP by 5% in the long term (IMF, 2016). 25 FAO, 2016. 26 FAO et al., 2015. 27 FAO et al., 2015. 28 Malnutrition manifests itself in various forms beyond undernutrition, such as micronutrient malnutrition, obesity, calorie deficiencies, anemia, or diabetes (IFPRI, 2016). See also Chapter 6. 29 Pingali, 2012. 30 It was estimated that in the absence of the green revolution, crop yields in developing countries would have decreased by 23.5%, with prices between 35% and 66% higher in 2000. Caloric intake would have fallen by 14.4%, and the percentage of malnourished children would have increased by 8% (Evenson and Gollin, 2003). 31 Juma, 2011, 2015; Juma and Gordon, 2015. 32 See Dutta et al., 2015. 33 See, for example, WIPO, 2011. See also the ongoing WIPO project on 'International Comparison of Knowledge Transfer Policies and Practices' in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST); further details are available at http:// www.wipo.int/econ_stat/en/economics/ studies/. 34 On informal actors, see Kraemer-Mbula and Wunsch-Vincent, 2016. 35 Economies are grouped according to the World Bank classification (July 2016) gross national income (GNI) per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method. The groups are: low income, US$1,025 or less; to US$12,475; and high income, US$12,476 or more. 36 Since 2012, the regional groups have been based on the United Nations Classification: EUR = Europe; NAC = Northern America; LCN = Latin America and the Caribbean; CSA = Central and Southern Asia; SEAO = South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania; NAWA = Northern Africa and Western Asia; and SSF = Sub-Saharan Africa. 37 To address their inherent volatility (see previous GII editions) and thus reduce the swings in the ranking induced by FDI flows, this year the GII takes 3-year averages of FDI net inflows and outflows (see Annex 2). 38 Note that any assessment of how the UK's planned withdrawal from the European Union affected the country's GII rank would be speculative, at best. First, most of the data predate the actual related referendum. As is the case with other high-income countries, 37% of the UK's indicators are from 2016; the remaining 63% reflect 2015 and earlier years. Second, the causal relations between plans or the actual withdrawal from the EU and the 2016 GII indicators are complex and uncertain in size and direction. 39 See the Preface to this report by the Confederation of Indian Industry. 40 Government of India, Press Information Bureau, 2017. 41 See also Dutta et al., 2013; Hollanders, 2013; Primi, 2013.

First, innovation is important for driving economic progress and competitiveness\u2014both for developed and developing economies. Many governments are putting innovation at the centre of their growth strategies. Second, the definition of innovation has broad - ened\u2014it is no longer restricted to R&D laboratories and to published scientific papers. Innovation could be and is more general and hori - zontal in nature, and includes social innovations and business model innovations as well as technical ones. Last but not least, recogniz - ing and celebrating innovation in emerging markets is seen as critical for inspiring people\u2014especially the next generation of entrepreneurs and innovators. Now in its 10th edition, the GII helps to create an environment in which innovation factors are under continual evaluation, and it provides a key tool for decision makers and a ANNEX 1 rich database of detailed metrics for refining innovation policies. The GII is not meant to be the ultimate and definitive ranking of economies with respect to innova - tion. Measuring innovation outputs and impacts remains difficult, hence great emphasis is placed on measur - ing the climate and infrastructure for innovation and on assessing related outcomes. Although the end results take the shape of several rankings, the GII is more concerned with improving the 'journey' to better measure and understand innovation and with identifying targeted policies, good practices, and other levers that foster innovation. The rich metrics can be used\u2014on the level of the index, the sub-indices, or the actual raw data of individual indicators\u2014to moni - tor performance over time and to benchmark developments against countries in the same region or income classification. Drawing on the expertise of the GII's Knowledge Partners and its prominent Advisory Board, the GII model is continually updated to reflect the improved availability of statistics and our understanding of innovation. This year the model continues to evolve, although its mature state now requires only minor updates (refer to Annex 2). An inclusive perspective on innovation The GII adopts a broad notion of innovation, originally elaborated in the Oslo Manual developed by the European Communities and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD): /two.superior An innovation is the implementation of a new or signicantly improved product (good or service), a new process, a new marketing method, or a new organizational method in business practices, workplace organization, or external relations. This definition reflects the evo - lution of the way innovation has been perceived and understood over the last two decades. /three.superior Economists and policy makers used to focus on R&D-based tech - nological product innovation, largely produced in-house and mostly in manufacturing industries. This type of innovation was performed by a highly educated labour force in R&D-intensive companies. The process leading to such innovation was conceptualized as closed, inter - nal, and localized. Technological breakthroughs were necessarily 'radical' and took place at the 'global knowledge frontier'. This charac - terization implied the existence of leading and lagging countries, with low- or middle-income economies only catching up. Today innovation capability is seen more as the ability to exploit new technological combinations; it embraces the notion of incremental innovation and 'innovation with - out research'. Non-R&D innova - tive expenditure is an important The Global Innovation Index (GII) Conceptual FrameworkTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 1: The GII Conceptual Framework48 component of reaping the rewards of technological innovation. Interest in understanding how innovation takes place in low- and middle-income countries is increasing, along with an awareness that incremental forms of innovation can impact development. Furthermore, the process of innova - tion itself has changed significantly. Investment in innovation-related activity has consistently intensified at the firm, country, and global levels, adding both new innovation actors from outside high-income economies and nonprofit actors. The structure of knowledge production activity is more complex and geo - graphically dispersed than ever. A key challenge is to find metrics that capture innovation as it actually happens in the world today. Direct official measures that quantify inno - vation outputs remain extremely scarce. For example, there are no official statistics on the amount of innovative activity\u2014defined as the number of new products, processes, or other innovations\u2014for any given innovation actor, let alone for any given country (see Box 1, Annex 1 of Chapter 1 in the GII 2013). Most measures also struggle to appropri - ately capture the innovation outputs of a wider spectrum of innovation actors, such as the services sector or public entities. The GII aims to move beyond the mere measurement of such simple innovation metrics. To do so will require the integration of new variables, with a trade-off between the quality of the variable on the one hand and achieving good country coverage on the other hand. The timeliest possible indicators are used for the GII: 38.7% of data obtained are from 2016, 38.1% are from 2015, 11.3% are from 2014, 5.7% from 2013, and the small remainder 6.3% from earlier years. The GII conceptual frameworkThe GII is an evolving project that builds on its previous editions while incorporating newly available data and that is inspired by the latest research on the measurement of innovation. This year the GII model includes 127 countries/economies, which represent 92.5% of the world's population and 97.6% of the world's GDP (in current US dollars). The GII relies on two sub-indices\u2014the Innovation Input Sub-Index and the Innovation Output Sub-Index\u2014each built around pillars. Four mea - sures are calculated (see Figure 1):Figure 1: Framework of the Global Innovation Index 2017 Global Innovation Index (average) Innovation Efficiency Ratio (ratio) Innovation Input Sub-Index InstitutionsHuman capital and research InfrastructureMarket sophisticationBusiness sophisticationCreative outputs Knowledge creation Knowledge impact Knowledge diffusionInnovation Output Sub-Index Political environment Regulatory environment Business environmentEducation Tertiary education Research & developmentICTs General infrastructure Ecological sustainabilityCredit Investment Trade, competition, & market scaleKnowledge workers Innovation linkages Knowledge absorptionIntangible assets Creative goods and servicesKnowledge and technology outputs Online creativity49 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 1: The GII Conceptual Framework1. Innovation Input Sub-Index: Five input pillars capture ele - ments of the national economy that enable innovative activities. 2. Innovation Output Sub-Index: Innovation outputs are the re - sults of innovative activities within the economy. Although the Output Sub-Index includes only two pillars, it has the same weight in calculating the overall GII scores as the Input Sub-Index. 3. The overall GII score is the simple average of the Input and Output Sub-Indices. 4. The Innovation Efficiency Ratio is the ratio of the Output Sub-Index to the Input Sub-Index. It shows how much inno - vation output a given country is getting for its inputs. Each pillar is divided into three sub-pillars, each of which is com - posed of individual indicators, for a total of 81 indicators this year. The GII pays special attention to presenting a scoreboard for each economy that includes strengths and weaknesses (Appendix I Country/Economy Profiles), making accessi - ble the data series (Appendix II Data Tables), and providing data sources and definitions (Appendix III) and detailed technical notes (Appendix IV). Adjustments to the GII frame - work, including a detailed analysis of the factors influencing year-on-year changes, are detailed in Annex 2. In addition, since 2011 the GII has been submitted to an indepen - dent statistical audit performed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Union (results are detailed in Annex 3). A table is included here for each pillar. That table provides a list of the pillar's indicators, specifying their type (composite indicators are identified with an asterisk ' *', survey questions with a dagger ' ', and the remaining indicators are hard data); their weight in the index (indicators with half weight are identified with the letter 'a'); and the direction of their effect (indicators for which higher values imply worse out - comes are identified with the letter 'b'). The table then provides each indicator's average values (in their respective units) per income group (World Bank classification) and for the whole sample of 127 countries/economies retained in the final computation (Tables 1a through 1g). The Innovation Input Sub-Index The first sub-index of the GII, the Innovation Input Sub-Index, has five enabler pillars: Institutions, Human capital and research, Infrastructure, Market sophistication, and Business sophistication. Enabler pillars define aspects of the environment conducive to innovation within an economy. Pillar 1: Institutions Nurturing an institutional frame - work that attracts business and fosters growth by providing good governance and the correct levels of protection and incentives is essential to innovation. The Institutions pillar captures the institutional framework of a country (Table/uni00A01a). The Political environment sub- pillar includes two indices: one that reflects perceptions of the likelihood that a government might be destabi - lized; and one that reflects the qual - ity of public and civil services, policy formulation, and implementation. The Regulatory environment sub-pillar draws on two indices aimed at capturing perceptions on the ability of the government to formulate and implement cohesive policies that promote the develop - ment of the private sector and at evaluating the extent to which the rule of law prevails (in aspects such as contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts). The third indicator evaluates the cost of redundancy dismissal as the sum, in salary weeks, of the cost of advance notice requirements added to severance payments due when terminating a redundant worker. The Business environment sub- pillar expands on three aspects that directly affect private entrepreneur - ial endeavours by using the World Bank indices on the ease of start - ing a business; the ease of resolving insolvency (based on the recovery rate recorded as the cents on the Table 1a: Institutions pillar Average value by income group High Upper-middle Lower-middle Low Indicator income income income income Mean 1 Institutions 1.1 Political environment 1.1.1 Political survey question, (a) half weight, (b) higher values indicate worse outcomes.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 1: The GII Conceptual Framework50 dollar recouped by creditors through reorganization, liquidation, or debt enforcement/foreclosure proceed - ings); and the ease of paying taxes. Pillar 2: Human capital and research The level and standard of education and research activity in a country are prime determinants of the innova - tion capacity of a nation. This pillar tries to gauge the human capital of countries (Table/uni00A01b). The first sub-pillar includes a mix of indicators aimed at capturing achievements at the elementary and secondary education levels. Education expenditure and school life expectancy are good proxies for coverage. Government expenditure per pupil, secondary gives a sense of the level of priority given to second - ary education by the state. The qual - ity of education is measured through the results to the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which examines 15-year-old students' performances in reading, mathematics, and science, as well as the pupil-teacher ratio. Higher education is crucial for economies to move up the value chain beyond simple production processes and products. The sub-pillar on tertiary education aims at capturing coverage (tertiary enrol - ment); priority is given to the sectors traditionally associated with innova - tion (with a series on the percent - age of tertiary graduates in science, engineering, manufacturing, and construction); and the inbound and mobility of tertiary students, which plays a crucial role in the exchange of ideas and skills necessary for innovation. The last sub-pillar, on R&D, measures the level and quality of R&D activities, with indicators on researchers (full-time equivalence), gross expenditure, the R&D expen - ditures of top global R&D spend - ers, and the quality of scientific and research institutions as measured by the average score of the top three universities in the QS World University Ranking of 2016. The R&D expenditures of the top three firms in a given country looks at the average expenditure of these three firms that are part of the top 2,500 R&D spenders worldwide. The QS university rankings indicator gives the average scores of the country's top three universities that belong to the top 700 universities worldwide. These indicators are not aimed at assessing the average level of all insti - tutions within a particular economy. Pillar 3: Infrastructure The third pillar includes three sub-pillars: Information and communi - cation technologies (ICTs), General infrastructure, and Ecological sus - tainability (Table/uni00A01c). Good and ecologically friendly communication, transport, and energy infrastructures facilitate the Table 1b: Human capital & research pillar Average value by income group High Upper-middle Lower-middle Low Indicator income income income income Mean 2 Human capital and research 2.1 Education 2.1.1 Expenditure on education, % GDP .................................. 5.49 survey question, (a) half weight, (b) higher values indicate worse outcomes.

KwH = kilowatt hours.51 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 1: The GII Conceptual Frameworkproduction and exchange of ideas, services, and goods and feed into the innovation system through increased productivity and efficiency, lower transaction costs, better access to markets, and sustainable growth. The ICTs sub-pillar includes four indices developed by international organizations on ICT access, ICT use, online service by governments, and online participation of citizens. The sub-pillar on general infra - structure includes the average of electricity output in kWh per capita; a composite indicator on logistics performance; and gross capital for - mation, which consists of outlays on additions to the fixed assets and net inventories of the economy, includ - ing land improvements (fences, ditches, drains); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and the construction of roads, railways, and the like, including schools, offices, hospitals, private residential dwell - ings, and commercial and industrial buildings. The sub-pillar on ecological sustainability includes three indi - cators: GDP per unit of energy use (a measure of efficiency in the use of energy), the Environmental Performance Index of Yale and Columbia Universities, and the number of certificates of confor - mity with standard ISO 14001 on environmental management systems issued. Pillar 4: Market sophistication The availability of credit and an environment that supports invest - ment, access to the international market, competition, and market scale are all critical for businesses to prosper and for innovation to occur. The Market sophistication pillar has three sub-pillars structured around market conditions and the total level of transactions (Table/uni00A01d).The Credit sub-pillar includes a measure on the ease of getting credit aimed at measuring the degree to which collateral and bankruptcy laws facilitate lending by protecting the rights of borrowers and lenders, as well as the rules and practices affecting the coverage, scope, and accessibility of credit information. Transactions are given by the total value of domestic credit and, in an attempt to make the model more applicable to emerging markets, by the gross loan portfolio of microfi - nance institutions. The Investment sub-pillar includes the ease of protecting minority investors index as well as two indicators on the level of trans - actions. These two indicators look at whether market size is matched by market dynamism and provide a hard data metric on venture capital deals. The last sub-pillar tackles trade, competition, and market scale. The market conditions for trade are given in the first indicator measuring the average tariff rate weighted by import shares. The second indica - tor is a survey question that reflects the intensity of competition in local markets. Efforts made at finding hard data on competition so far remain unsuccessful. Domestic market scale, as measured by an economy's GDP, was incorporated in 2016, so the last sub-pillar takes into consid - eration the impact that the size of an economy has on its capacity to introduce and test innovations in the market place. Pillar 5: Business sophistication The last enabler pillar tries to cap - ture the level of business sophistica - tion to assess how conducive firms are to innovation activity (Table/uni00A01e). The Human capital and research pillar (pillar 2) made the case that the accumulation of human capi - tal through education, particularly higher education and the prioritiza - tion of R&D activities, is an indis - pensable condition for innovation to take place. That logic is taken one step further here with the assertion that businesses foster their produc - tivity, competitiveness, and innova - tion potential with the employment of highly qualified professionals and technicians. The first sub-pillar includes four quantitative indicators on knowledge workers: employment in knowledge-intensive services; the availability of formal training at the firm level; R&D performed by Table 1d: Market sophistication pillar Average value by income group High Upper-middle Lower-middle Low Indicator income income income income Mean 4 Market sophistication 4.1 Credit 4.1.1 Ease Trade, competition, and market scale survey question, (a) half weight, (b) higher values indicate worse outcomes.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 1: The GII Conceptual Framework52 business enterprise (GERD) as a per - centage of GDP (i.e., GERD over GDP); and the percentage of total gross expenditure of R&D that is financed by business enterprise. In addition, the sub-pillar includes an indicator related to the percentage of females employed with advanced degrees. This indicator, in addition to providing a glimpse into the gen - der labour distributions of nations, offers more information about the degree of sophistication of the local human capital currently employed. Innovation linkages and public/ private/academic partnerships are essential to innovation. In emerg - ing markets, pockets of wealth have developed around industrial or tech - nological clusters and networks, in sharp contrast to the poverty that may prevail in the rest of the terri - tory. The Innovation linkages sub-pillar draws on both qualitative and quantitative data regarding business/university collaboration on R&D, the prevalence of well-developed and deep clusters, the level of gross R&D expenditure financed by abroad, and the number of deals on joint ventures and strategic alli - ances. In addition, the total number of Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and national office published patent family applications filed by residents in at least two offices proxies for international linkages. In broad terms, pillar 4 on mar - ket sophistication makes the case that well-functioning markets con - tribute to the innovation environ - ment through competitive pressure, efficiency gains, and economies of transaction and by allowing supply to meet demand. Markets that are open to foreign trade and investment have the additional effect of expos - ing domestic firms to best practices around the globe, which is critical to innovation through knowledge absorption and diffusion, which are considered in pillars 5 and 6. The rationale behind sub-pillars 5.3 on knowledge absorption (an enabler) and 6.3 on knowledge diffusion (a result)\u2014two sub-pillars designed to be mirror images of each other\u2014is precisely that together they will reveal how good economies are at absorbing and diffusing knowledge. Sub-pillar 5.3 includes five metrics that are linked to sectors with high-tech content or are key to innovation: intellectual property payments as a percentage of total trade; high-tech net imports as a percentage of total imports; imports of communication, computer and information services as a percentage of total trade; and net inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) as a percentage of GDP (three-year aver - age). To strengthen the sub-pillar, the percentage of research talent in business was added in 2016 to pro - vide a measurement of professionals engaged in the conception or cre - ation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems, including business management. The Innovation Output Sub-Index Innovation outputs are the results of innovative activities within the economy. Although the Output Sub-Index includes only two pillars, it has the same weight in calculating the overall GII scores as the Input Sub-Index. There are two output pillars: Knowledge and technology outputs and Creative outputs. Pillar 6: Knowledge and technology outputs This pillar covers all those vari - ables that are traditionally thought to be the fruits of inventions and/or innovations (Table/uni00A01f). The first sub-pillar refers to the creation of knowledge. It includes five indica - tors that are the result of inventive and innovative activities: patent applications filed by residents both at the national patent office and at the international level through the PCT; utility model applications filed by residents at the national office; scientific and technical published articles in peer-reviewed journals; Table 1e: Business sophistication pillar Average value by income group High Upper-middle Lower-middle Low Indicator income income income income Mean 5 Business sophistication 5.1 Knowledge workers 5.1.1 ................. 0.10 ................. 1.44 5.3 Knowledge absorption 5.3.1 % ................. 7.98 ................. 7.91 ................. 9.36 ................. 5.32 survey question, (a) half weight, (b) higher values indicate worse outcomes. GERD = gross domestic expenditure on R&D.53 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 1: The GII Conceptual Frameworkand an economy's number of articles (H) that have received at least H citations. The second sub-pillar, on knowl - edge impact, includes statistics rep - resenting the impact of innovation activities at the micro- and macro - economic level or related proxies: increases in labour productivity, the entry density of new firms, spending on computer software, the number of certificates of conformity with standard ISO 9001 on quality management systems issued, and the measure of high- and medium-high-tech industrial output over total manufactures output. The third sub-pillar, on knowl - edge diffusion, is the mirror image of the knowledge absorption sub-pillar of pillar 5, with the exception of indicator 5.3.5. It includes four statistics all linked to sectors with high-tech content or that are key to innovation: intellectual property receipts as a percentage of total trade; high-tech net exports as a percentage of total exports; exports of ICT services as a percentage of total trade; and net outflows of FDI as a percentage of GDP (three-year average). Pillar 7: Creative outputs The role of creativity for innovation is still largely underappreciated in innovation measurement and policy debates. Since its inception, the GII has always emphasized measuring creativity as part of its Innovation Output Sub-Index. The last pillar, on creative outputs, has three sub-pillars (Table/uni00A01g). The first sub-pillar on intan - gible assets includes statistics on trademark applications by residents at the national office; industrial designs included in applications at a regional or national office, and two survey questions regarding the use of ICTs in business and organizational models, new areas that are increas - ingly linked to process innovations in the literature. The second sub-pillar on cre - ative goods and services includes proxies to get at creativity and the creative outputs of an economy. In 2014, in an attempt to include broader sectoral coverage, a global entertainment and media output composite was added. In addition, the indicator on audio-visual and related services exports was renamed 'Cultural and creative services exports' and expanded to include information services, advertising, market research and public opinion polling, and other personal, cultural, and recreational services (as a per - centage of total trade). These two Table 1f: Knowledge & technology outputs pillar Average value by income group High Upper-middle Lower-middle Low Indicator income income income income Mean 6 Knowledge and technology outputs 6.1 Knowledge creation 6.1.1 Patents by origin/bn PPP$ ................. 2.15 ................. 0.34 index, () survey question, (a) half weight, (b) higher values indicate worse outcomes.

Scores rather than values are presented for indicators 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7 .3.3, and 7 .3.4. TLDs = top-level domains.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 1: The GII Conceptual Framework54 indicators complement the remain - der of the sub-pillar, which measures national feature films produced in a given country (per capita count); printing and publishing output (as a percentage of total manufactures output); and creative goods exports (as a percentage of total trade), all of which are aimed at providing an overall sense of the international reach of creative activities in the country. The third sub-pillar on online creativity includes four indicators, all scaled by population aged 15 through 69 years old: generic and country-code top level domains, average yearly edits to Wikipedia; and video uploads on YouTube. Attempts made to strengthen this sub-pillar with indicators in areas such as Internet and machine learn - ing, blog posting, online gaming, and the development of applications have so far proved unsuccessful.

In addition, the GII is calculated on the basis of 9,225 data points (compared to 10,287 with complete series), implying that 10.3% of data points are missing. The Data Tables (Appendix II) include the reference year for each data point and mark missing data as not available (n/a).

The GII report pays special attention to making accessible the sta - tistics used in the Country/Economy Profiles and Data Tables, providing data sources and definitions, and detailing the computation method - ology (Appendices I, II, III, and IV, respectively). This annex summarizes the changes made this year and pro - vides an assessment of the impact of these changes on the comparability of rankings. Adjustments to the Global Innovation Index frameworkThe GII model is revised every year in a transparent exercise. This year, no change was made at either the pillar or the sub-pillar level. Beyond the use of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) data, we collaborate with both public international bodies such as the International Energy Agency; the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO); the International Telecommunication Union (ITU); and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC) as well as with private organizations such as ANNEX 2 the International Organization for Standardization (ISO); IHS and Google to obtain the best available data on innovation measurement globally. Table/uni00A01 provides a summary of adjustments to the GII 2017 frame - work for quick reference. A total of five indicators were modified this year: one indicator was removed, one indicator changed its number as a result, and three indicators under - went methodological and name changes. Indicators that retained the same name as last year but are derived from a source that changed its methodology are not identified in Table/uni00A01. The statistical audit performed by the JRC (see Annex 3) pro - vides a confidence interval for each ranking following a robustness and uncertainty analysis of the modelling assumptions. Sources of changes in the rankings The GII compares the performance of national innovation systems across economies, and it also presents changes in economy rankings over time. Importantly, scores and rankings from one year to the next are not Table 1: Changes to the Global Innovation Index framework GII 2016 Adjustment GII 2017 4.2.3 Total value of direct investment net inflowsName and methodology changed5.3.4 Foreign direct investment net inflows (3-year avg.) 6.3.4 Foreign direct investment net outflowsName and methodology Foreign direct investment net outflows (3-year avg.) 7.3.3 Wikipedia monthly edits Name and methodology changed7.3.3 Wikipedia yearly edits Note: Refer to Annex 1 and Appendix III for a detailed explanation of terminologies.

The underlying methodology for indicator 7.3.3 has also changed; it now measures edits within each econ - omy by year rather than by month. Missing values Since its inception, the GII has had a positive influence on data avail - ability, increasing awareness of the importance of submitting timely data. The number of data points submitted by economies to international data agencies has substantially increased in recent years. In the GII 2016, 12.8% of data points were missing; this year, in the GII 2017, coverage improved again, with only 10.3% of data points missing. When it comes to country cover - age, the objective is to include as many economies as possible. However, it is also important to maintain a good level of data coverage within each of these economies. Because the GII results are linked to data availability (see the JRC Statistical Audit pre - sented in Annex 3 for more details), which affects the overall GII ranks, this year the minimum data coverage threshold rule was strengthened\u2014on the recommendation of the JRC\u2014to maintain the significance of both the GII results and the country sample. To be included in the GII 2017, an economy must have a minimum symmetric data coverage of 36 indi - cators in the Innovation Input Sub-Index (66%) and 18 indicators in the Innovation Output Sub-Index (66%), and it must have scores for at least two sub-pillars per pillar. Missing values are indicated with 'n/a' and are not considered in the sub-pillar score. This adjustment derives from a sensitivity that is the result of the data availability, which is less satisfactory directly comparable (see Annex 2 of the GII 2013 for a full explanation). Making inferences about absolute or relative performance on the basis of year-on-year differences in rankings can be misleading. Each ranking reflects the relative positioning of that particular country/economy on the basis of the conceptual framework, the data coverage, and the sample of economies\u2014elements that change from one year to another. A few particular factors influ - ence the year-on-year ranking of a country/economy: the actual performance of the economy in question; adjustments made to the GII framework; data updates, the treatment of outliers, and missing values; and the inclusion or exclusion of countries/economies in the sample. Additionally, the following char - acteristics complicate the time-series analysis based on simple GII scores or rankings: Missing values. The GII pro - duces relative index scores, which means that a missing value for one economy affects the index score of other economies. Because the number of missing values decreases every year, this problem is reduced over time. Reference year. The data underlying the GII do not refer to a single year but to several years, depending on the latest available year for any given vari - able. In addition, the reference years for different variables are not the same for each economy. The motivation for this approach is that it widens the set of data points for cross-economy com - parability. Normalization factor. Most GII variables are normalized using either GDP or population. This approach is also intended to enable cross-economy com - parability. Yet, again, year-on-year changes in individual vari - ables may be driven either by the variable's numerator or by its denominator. Consistent data collection. Finally, measuring year-on-year performance changes relies on the consistent collection of data over time. Changes in the defi - nition of variables or in the data collection process could create movements in the rankings that are unrelated to true perfor - mance. A detailed economy study based on the GII database and the country/ economy profile over time, coupled with analytical work on grounds that include innovation actors and deci - sion makers, yields the best results in terms of grasping an economy's inno - vation performance over time as well as possible avenues for improvement. Methodology and data The revision of the computation methodology for certain individual indicators has caused shifts in the results for several countries. For indicator 3.3.1, which mea - sures energy use, the constant PPP$ per kg of oil equivalent was updated from 2005 PPP$ to 2010 PPP$. The methodology underpinning indicators 4.2.3 and 5.2.4 expanded to use datasets from previous years to improve data coverage. For indicators 5.3.4 and 6.3.4, the net inflows and outflows of foreign 57 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 2: Adjustments and Year-on-Year Comparabilty Economy Number of missing values Trinidad and Tobago 25 Togo 23 Burundi 22 Niger 22 Benin 21Economy Number of missing values Brunei Darussalam 21 Burkina Faso 20 Guinea 20 Nepal 20in the case of the Output Sub-Index: four countries that were part of the GII 2016 have data coverage below the 66% threshold in the 27 variables in the Output Sub-Index. In contrast, data coverage is satisfactory in all of these cases in the Input Sub-Index (all of these economies have indicator coverage of more than 66% over the 54 input variables). As a result, the fol - lowing countries included in the GII 2016 dropped out this year: Bhutan, Ghana, Nicaragua, and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. /one.superior The rules on missing data and the minimum cover - age necessary per sub-pillar will be progressively tightened, leading to the exclusion of countries that fail to meet the desired minimum coverage in any sub-pillar (see Appendix I for more details). Despite requiring minimum lev - els of coverage, for several economies the number of missing data points remains very high. Table/uni00A02 lists the countries that have the highest num - ber of missing data points (20 or more), ranking them according to how many data points are missing. Conversely, Table/uni00A0 3 lists those economies with the best data cover - age, ranking them according to the least number of missed data points. These economies are missing at most only five data points; some are miss - ing none at all.

In its 10th edition, the 2017 Global Innovation Index (GII) considers these conceptual challenges in Chapter 1 and deals with practical challenges\u2014related to data quality and methodological choices\u2014by grouping country-level data over 127 countries and across 81 indicators into 21 sub-pillars, 7 pillars, 2 sub-indices and, finally, an overall index. This annex offers detailed insights into the practical issues related to the construction of the GII, analysing in depth the sta - tistical soundness of the calculations and assumptions made to arrive at the final index rankings. Statistical soundness should be regarded as a necessary but not sufficient condi - tion for a sound GII, since the cor - relations underpinning the majority of the statistical analyses carried out herein 'need not necessarily represent the real influence of the individual indicators on the phenomenon being measured'. /one.superior Consequently, the devel - opment of the GII must be nurtured by a dynamic iterative dialogue between the principles of statistical and conceptual soundness or, to put it another way, between the theoreti - cal understanding of innovation and the empirical observations of the data underlying the variables. The European Commission's Competence Centre on Composite ANNEX 3 Indicators and Scoreboards at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra has been invited for the seventh consecutive year to audit the GII. As in previous editions, the present JRC audit focuses on the statistical soundness of the multi-level structure of the index as well as on the impact of key modelling assumptions on the results. /two.superior The independent statistical assessment of the GII provided by the JRC guarantees the transparency and reliability of the index for both policy makers and other stakeholders, thus facilitating more accurate prior - ity setting and policy formulation in this particular field. As in past GII reports, the JRC analysis complements the country rankings with confidence intervals for the GII, the Innovation Input Sub-Index, and the Innovation Output Sub-Index in order to better appre - ciate the robustness of these ranks to the computation methodology. In addition, the JRC analysis includes an assessment of the added value of the GII and a measure of distance to the efficient frontier of innovation by using data envelopment analysis. Conceptual and statistical coherence in the GII frameworkAn earlier version of the GII model was assessed by the JRC in April-May 2017. Fine-tuning suggestions were taken into account in the final computation of the rankings in an iterative process with the JRC aimed at setting the foundation for a bal - anced index. The entire process fol - lowed four steps (see Figure/uni00A01). Step 1: Conceptual consistency Eighty-one indicators were selected for their relevance to a specific innovation pillar on the basis of the literature review, expert opinion, country coverage, and timeliness. To represent a fair picture of country dif - ferences, indicators were scaled either at the source or by the GII team as appropriate and where needed. Step 2: Data checks The most recently released data within the period 2006-16 were used for each economy: 77% of the available data refer to 2015 or more recent years. In past editions, coun - tries were included if data availability was at least 60% across all variables in the GII framework. A more strin - gent criterion was adopted this year, following the JRC recommendation of past GII audits. That is, countries were included if data availability was at least 66% within each of the two sub-indices (i.e., 36 out of 54 vari - ables within the Input Sub-Index and 18 out of the 27 variables in the Output Sub-Index) and at least two of the three sub-pillars in each pillar could be computed. This more strin - gent criterion for a country's inclu - sion in the GII was introduced this year in order to ensure that country scores for the GII and for the two Input and Output Sub-Indices are Joint Research Centre Statistical Audit of the 2017 Global Innovation Index MICHAE LA SAISANA, , and Centre (JRC), Ispra, ItalyTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 3: JRC Statistical Audit of the GII60 Figure 1: Conceptual and statistical coherence in the GII 2017 framework Step 1.

In prac - tice, data availability for all countries included in the GII 2017 is very good: 80% data availability for 84% (107 out of 127) of the countries. Potentially problematic indicators that could bias the overall results were identified on the basis of two measures related to the shape of the distributions: skewness and kurtosis. In past edi - tions since 2011, values were treated if the indicators had absolute skew - ness greater than 2.0 and kurtosis greater than 3.5. /three.superior These criteria were decided jointly with the JRC back in 2011. This year and after having analysed data in GII 2011-GII 2017, a less stringent criterion was adopted: an indicator was treated if the abso - lute skewness was greater than 2.25 and kurtosis greater than 3.5. These indicators were treated either by win - sorization or by taking the natural logarithm (in case of more than five outliers; see Appendix IV Technical Notes in this report for details). Step 3: Statistical Coherence Weights as scaling coefficientsWeights of 0.5 or 1.0 were jointly decided between the JRC and the GII team in 2012 to be scaling coefficients and not importance coefficients, with the aim of arriving at sub-pillar and pillar scores that were balanced in their underlying components (i.e., that indicators and sub-pillars can explain a similar amount of variance in their respective sub-pillars/pillars). Becker et al. (2017) and Paruolo et al. (2013) show that, in weighted arithmetic averages, the ratio of two nominal weights gives the rate of substitutability between two indica - tors, and hence can be used to reveal the relative importance of individual indicators. This importance can then be compared with ex-post measures of variables' importance, such as the non-linear Pearson correlation ratio. As a result of this analysis, 35 out of 81 indicators and two sub-pillars\u20147.2 Creative goods and services and 7.3 Online creativity\u2014were assigned half weight while all other indica - tors and sub-pillars were assigned a weight of 1.0. Nevertheless, for seven indicators with Pearson correlation coefficients less than 0.3 with the respective sub-pillars, some further reflection is needed because they seem to be non-influential (i.e., they behave as 'noise') at all aggregation levels in the GII 2017 framework, despite the fact that their inclusion was based on conceptual grounds or practical experience. This applies to 2.1.2 Government expenditure on education per pupil, secondary; 2.2.2 Graduates in science and engineer - ing; 3.2.3 Gross capital formation; 5.2.3 GERD financed by abroad, 61 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 3: JRC Statistical Audit of the GII 5.3.4 Foreign direct investment net inflows; 6.2.1 Growth rate of GDP per person engaged; and 7.2.4 Printing and publishing output. For two out of the seven indicators listed above\u20142.1.2 and 7.2.4\u2014this is the first time that they are found to be non-influential at all in the GII framework. Instead, the remaining five indicators were found to be non-influential also in the GII 2016. On the other hand, two indicators that were found to be non-influential last year\u20143.3.1 GDP per unit of energy use and 4.1.3 Microfinance institutions' gross loan portfolio\u2014are instead found to be influential in this year's framework. It is suggested that the GII development team carefully assess how these variables behave in the coming releases of the index. If the 'noisy' behaviour persists, these variables could eventually be removed from the GII framework.Principal components analysis and reliability item analysisPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess to what extent the conceptual framework is con - firmed by statistical approaches. PCA results confirm the presence of a single latent dimension in each of the seven pillars (one component with an eigenvalue greater than 1.0) that captures between close to 60% (pillar 4: Market sophistication) up to 85% (pillar 1: Institutions) of the total variance in the three underlying sub-pillars. These results reveal that the modest adjustments made to the 2017 GII framework have left unaffected the already good statistical coherence properties of the previous version. Furthermore, results confirm the expectation that the sub-pillars are more correlated to their own pillar than to any other pillar and that all correlation coefficients are close to or greater than 0.70. (see Table/uni00A01). The five input pillars share a single statistical dimension that summarizes 80% of the total variance, and the five loadings (correlation coefficients) of these pillars are very similar to each other (0.86-0.92). This similarity suggests that the five pillars make roughly equal contributions to the variation of the Innovation Input Sub-Index scores, as envisaged by the developing team. The reliability of the Input Sub-Index, measured by the Cronbach alpha value, is very high at 0.94\u2014well above the 0.70 threshold for a reliable aggregate. The two output pillars\u2014 Knowledge and technology outputs and Creative outputs\u2014are strongly correlated to each other (0.81); they are also both strongly correlated with the Innovation Output Sub-Index (0.95). This result suggests that the Table 1: Statistical coherence in the GII: Correlations between sub-pillars and pillars Sub-pillar sustainability 0.53 0.67 Credit 0.63 0.58 assets 0.61 0.63 0.70 Centre, 2017..THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 3: JRC Statistical Audit of the GII62 Output Sub-Index is also well bal - anced in its two pillars. Furthermore, building the GII as the simple average of the Input Sub-Index and Output Sub-Index is also statistically justifi - able because the Pearson correlation coefficient of either sub-index with the overall GII is 0.97; the two sub-indices have a correlation of 0.89. Finally, an important part of the analysis relates to clarifying the importance of the Input and Output Sub-Indices with respect to the variation of the GII scores. The GII is built as the simple arithmetic aver - age of the five Input sub-pillars and the two Output sub-pillars, which implies that the Input-related pillars have a weight of 5/7 versus a weight of 2/7 for the Output-related pil - lars. Yet this does not imply that the Input aspect is more important than the Output aspect in determining the variation of the GII scores. In fact, the Pearson correlation coefficient of either sub-index with the overall GII is 0.97 (and the two sub-indices have a correlation of 0.89), which suggests that the sub-indices are effectively placed on equal footing. Overall, the tests so far show that the grouping of variables into sub-pillars, pillars, and an overall index is statistically coherent in the GII 2017 framework, and that the GII has a balanced structure at e`ach aggrega - tion level. The only recommendation for next year relates to a careful reflec - tion of the seven indicators discussed above\u20142.1.2 Government expen - diture on education per pupil, sec - ondary; 2.2.2 Graduates in science and engineering; 3.2.3 Gross capital formation; 5.2.3 GERD financed by abroad; 5.3.4 Foreign direct invest - ment net inflows; 6.2.1 Growth rate of GDP per person engaged; and 7.2.4 Printing and publishing output\u2014because their information content is lost in the aggregation at the pillar level or higher (sub-index and overall GII). For five out of the seven indicators (2.2.2, 3.2.3, 5.2.3, 5.3.4, 6.2.1) this was also the case in last year's audit. Added value of the GII As already discussed, the Input and Output Sub-Indices correlate strongly with each other and with the overall GII. Furthermore, the five pillars in the Input Sub-Index have a very high statistical reliability. These results\u2014the strong correlation between Input and Output Sub-Indices and the high statistical reliability of the five input pillars\u2014may be interpreted by some as a sign of redundancy of informa - tion in the GII. The tests conducted by the JRC confirm that this is not the case. In fact, for more than 42% (up to 61%) of the 127 economies included in the GII 2017, the GII ranking and any of the seven pillar rankings differ by 10 positions or more (see Table/uni00A02). This is a desired outcome because it demonstrates the added value of the GII ranking, which helps to highlight other aspects of innovation that do not emerge directly by looking into the seven pillars separately. At the same time, this result points to the value of duly taking into account the GII pillars, sub-pillars, and individual indicators on their own merit. By doing so, country-specific strengths and bottlenecks on innovation can be identified and serve as an input for evidence-based policy making. Step 4: Qualitative Review Finally, the GII results\u2014includ - ing overall country classifications and relative performances in terms of the Innovation Input or Output Sub-Indices\u2014were evaluated to verify that the overall results are, to a great extent, consistent with current Table 2: Distribution of differences between pillar and GII rankings Innovation Input Sub-Index Innovation Output Sub-Index Rank differences (positions) Institutions (%)Human capital and research (%) Infrastructure (%)Market sophistication (%)Business sophistication (%)Knowledge and technology outputs (%) Creative outputs (%) Research Centre, 2017. * This column is the sum of the prior three rows.

Notwithstanding these statistical tests and the positive outcomes on the statistical coherence of the GII structure, the GII model is and has to remain open for future improvements as better data, more comprehensive surveys and assess - ments, and new relevant research studies become available. The impact of modelling assumptions on the GII resultsModelling assumptions with a direct impact on the GII scores and rank - ings relate to: setting up an underlying struc - ture for the index based on a battery of pillars, choosing the individual variables to be used as indicators, deciding whether (and how) or not to impute missing data, deciding whether (and how) or not to treat outliers, selecting the normalization approach to be applied, choosing the weights to be assigned, and deciding on the aggregation rule to be implemented.The rationale for these choices is manifold. For instance, expert opin - ion coupled with statistical analysis is behind the selection of the indi - vidual indicators, common practice and ease of interpretation suggests the use of a min-max normaliza - tion approach in the [0-100] range, the treatment of outliers is driven by statistical analysis, and simplicity and parsimony criteria seem to advocate for not imputing missing data. The unavoidable uncertainty stemming from the above-mentioned model - ling choices is accounted for in the robustness assessment carried out by the JRC. More precisely, the meth - odology applied herein allows for the joint and simultaneous analysis of the impact of such choices on the aggregate scores, resulting in error estimates and confidence intervals calculated for the GII 2017 individual country rankings. As suggested in the relevant lit - erature on composite indicators, the robustness assessment was based on Monte Carlo simulation and multi-modelling approaches, applied to 'error-free' data where potential out - liers and eventual errors and typos have already been corrected in a preliminary stage. In particular, the three key modelling issues considered in the assessment of the GII were the treatment of missing data, the pillar weights, and the aggregation formula used at the pillar level. Monte Carlo simulation com - prised 1,000 runs of different sets of weights for the seven pillars in the GII. The weights were assigned to the pillars based on uniform continu - ous distributions centred in the refer - ence values. The ranges of simulated weights were defined by taking into account both the need for a wide enough interval to allow for mean - ingful robustness checks and the need to respect the underlying principle of the GII that the Input and the Output Sub-Indices should be placed on equal footings. As a result of these consider - ations, the limit values of uncertainty for the five input pillars are 10%-30%; the limit values for the two output pil - lars are 40%-60% (see Table/uni00A03). The GII developing team, for transparency and replicability, has always opted not to estimate missing data. The 'no imputation' choice, which is common in similar contexts, might encourage economies not to report low data values. Yet this is not the case for the GII. After 10 editions of the GII, the index-developing Reference Alternative I. Uncertainty in the treatment of missing values No estimation of missing data Expectation Maximization (EM) II.

The consequence of the 'no imputation' choice in an arithmetic average is that it is equivalent to replacing an indicator's missing value for a given country with the respective sub-pillar score. Hence, the available data (indicators) in the incomplete pillar may dominate, sometimes biasing the ranks up or down. To test the impact of the 'no imputation' choice, the JRC estimated missing data using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Regarding the aggregation for - mula, decision-theory practitioners challenge the use of simple arith - metic averages because of their fully compensatory nature, in which a comparative high advantage on a few indicators can compensate a comparative disadvantage on many indicators. For example, one may argue that the United Kingdom and Germany, despite their similar per - formance at the Innovation Output Sub-Index\u2014both close to 53.5 points (rank 6th and 7th respectively)\u2014are very different if one considers how these countries perform within the sub-index. Germany ranks 8th in Knowledge and technology outputs and 7th in Creative outputs, while the United Kingdom is much more diverse: the country ranks 13th posi - tion in Knowledge and technology outputs, but it notably improves its overall position in the Output Sub-Index thanks to its 4th rank in Creative outputs. To assess the impact of this compensability issue, the JRC relaxed the strong perfect substitut - ability assumption inherent in the arithmetic average and considered instead the geometric average, which is a partially compensatory approach that rewards economies with balanced profiles and motivates economies to improve in the GII pillars in which they perform poorly, and not just in any GII pillar. Four models were tested based on the combination of no imputa - tion versus EM imputation, and arithmetic versus geometric average, combined with 1,000 simulations per model (random weights versus fixed weights), for a total of 4,000 simulations for the GII and each of the two sub-indices (see Table/uni00A03 for a summary of the uncertainties considered).

All published GII 2017 ranks lay within the simulated 90% confidence intervals, and for most economies these intervals are narrow enough for meaningful inferences to be drawn: there is a shift of fewer than 10 posi - tions for 105 of the 127 economies. However, it is also true that merely two country ranks vary significantly with changes in weights and aggre - gation formula and because of the estimation of missing data. These two countries\u2014Niger and Belarus\u2014have 90% confidence interval widths of 22 and 28, respectively; hence their GII ranks should be interpreted cautiously and certainly not taken at face value. This is a remarkable improvement compared to the GII 2015, where confidence interval widths for 32 economies lay between 20 and 29, for another 7 economies between 30 and 39, and for 2 econo - mies the widths were 40 or greater. This improvement in the confidence one can attach to the GII 2017 ranks is the direct result of the developers' choice since 2016 to adopt a more stringent criterion for an economy's inclusion, which requires at least 62% data availability within each of the two sub-indices. Some caution is also warranted in the Input Sub-Index for 7 economies\u2014Ukraine, Argentina, Oman, Kenya, Jordan, Rwanda, and Burkina Faso\u2014that have 90% confidence interval widths over 20 (up to 27 for Oman). The Output Sub-Index is slightly more sensi - tive to the methodological choices: 8 countries\u2014Paraguay, Belarus, the United Republic of Tanzania, Namibia, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Niger, and Togo\u2014have 90% confi - dence interval widths over 20 (up to 41 for Paraguay and Belarus). This sensitivity is mostly the consequence of the estimation of missing data and the fact that there are only two pillars: this means that changes to the imputation method, weights, or aggregation formula have a more notable impact on the country ranks in the Innovation Output. Although a few economy ranks, in the GII 2017 overall or in the two sub-indices, appear to be sensi - tive to the methodological choices, the published rankings for the vast majority can be considered as repre - sentative of the plurality of scenarios simulated herein. Taking the median rank as the yardstick for an economy's expected rank in the realm of the GII's unavoidable methodological uncertainties, 75% of the economies are found to shift fewer than three positions with respect to the median rank in the GII, or in the Input and Output Sub-Index. For full transparency and infor - mation, Table/uni00A0 4 reports the GII 2017 Index and Input and Output Sub-Indices economy ranks together with the simulated 90% confidence intervals in order to better appreciate the robustness of the results to the choice of weights, of the aggregation formula and the impact of estimating missing data (where applicable). Sensitivity analysis results Complementary to the uncertainty analysis, sensitivity analysis has been used to identify which of the mod - elling assumptions have the highest impact on certain country ranks. Table/uni00A0 5 summarizes the impact of changes of the EM imputation method and/or the geometric aggre - gation formula, with fixed weights at their reference values (as in the original GII). Similar to last year's results, this year neither the GII nor the Input or Output Sub-Index are found to be heavily influenced by Table 5: Sensitivity analysis: Impact of modelling choices on economies with most sensitive ranks Index or Sub-Index Uncertainty tested (pillar level only)Number of economies that improve Number of economies that deteriorate by 20 or more positionsbetween 10 and 19 positionsby 20 or more positionsbetween 10 and 19 positions GII Geometric vs. arithmetic average 0 1 0 3 EM imputation vs. no imputation of missing data 0 3 0 3 Geometric average and EM imputation vs. arithmetic average and missing values 1 (Belarus) 3 0 3 Input Sub-IndexGeometric vs. arithmetic average 0 0 0 1 EM imputation vs. no imputation of missing data 0 2 0 2 Geometric average and EM imputation vs. arithmetic average and missing values 0 5 0 7 Output Sub-IndexGeometric vs. arithmetic average 0 0 0 3 EM imputation vs. no imputation of missing data 1 (Belarus) 10 1 (Tanzania, U.

Depending on the combination of the choices made, only Belarus or the United Republic of Tanzania can change rank by 20 positions or more. All in all, the published GII 2017 ranks are reliable and for the vast majority of countries the simulated 90% confidence intervals are narrow enough for meaningful inferences to be drawn. Nevertheless, the readers of the GII 2017 report should con - sider country ranks in the GII 2017 and in the Input and Output Sub-Indices not only at face value but also within the 90% confidence intervals in order to better appreciate to what degree a country's rank depends on the modelling choices. Since 2016, following the JRC recommendation in past GII audits, the developers' choice to apply the 66% indicator coverage threshold separately to the Input and Output Sub-Indices in the GII 2017 has led to a net increase in the reliability of country ranks for the GII and the two sub-indices. Furthermore, the adoption of less stringent criterion for the skewness and kurtosis (greater than 2.25 in absolute value and greater than 3.5, respectively) has not introduced any bias in the estimates.

Notes: Pie shares are in absolute terms, bounded by 0.05 and 0.20. In the GII 2017, however, the five input pillars each have a fixed weight of 0.10; the two output pillars each have a fixed weight of 0.25.Table 6: Pie shares (absolute terms) and efficiency scores for the top 25 economies in the GII 2017 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 3: JRC Statistical Audit of the GII70 weighting scheme might not be fair to a particular country. An appeal - ing feature of the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) literature applied in real decision-making settings is to determine endogenous weights that maximize the overall score of each decision-making unit given a set of other observations. In this section, the assumption of fixed pillar weights common to all countries is relaxed once more; this time country-specific weights that maximize a country's score are deter - mined endogenously by DEA. In theory, each country is free to decide on the relative contribution of each pillar to its score, so as to achieve the best possible score in a computation that reflects its innovation strategy. In practice, the DEA method assigns a higher (lower) contribution to those pillars in which a country is relatively strong (weak). Reasonable con - straints on the weights are applied to preclude the possibility of a country achieving a perfect score by assigning a zero weight to weak pillars: for each country, the share of each pillar score (i.e., the pillar score multiplied by the DEA weight over the total score) has upper and lower bounds of 5% and 20% respectively. The DEA score is then measured as the weighted aver - age of all seven pillar scores, where the weights are the country-specific DEA weights, compared to the best performance among all other coun - tries with those same weights. The DEA score can be interpreted as a measure of the 'distance to the effi - cient frontier'. Table/uni00A06 presents the pie shares and DEA scores for the top 25 countries in the GII 2017, next to the GII 2017 ranks and efficiency ratio ranks. All pie shares are in accordance with the starting point of granting leeway to each country when assigning shares, while not violating the (relative) upper and lower bounds. The pie shares are quite diverse, reflecting the different national innovation strategies. These pie shares can also be seen to reflect countries' compara - tive advantage in certain GII pillars vis-\u00e0-vis all other countries and all pillars. For example, Switzerland is the only country this year that obtains a perfect DEA score of 1 by assigning 19% of its DEA score to Business sophistication, Knowledge and technology outputs, and Creative outputs, while merely 8% to 9% of its DEA score comes from Institutions, Infrastructure, and Market sophisti - cation. Instead, countries including the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Singapore would assign 20% of their DEA scores to Market sophistication. Only Switzerland reaches a perfect DEA score of 1, closely followed by Sweden, the Netherlands, the United States of America, the United 0.00.20.40.60.81.0 Source: European Commission Joint Research Centre, 2017. Note: For comparison purposes, we have rescaled the GII scores by dividing them with the best performer in the overall GII 2017.Figure 3: GII 2017 scores and DEA 'distance to the efficient frontier' scores \u2014 DEA efficiency \u2014 GII 2017 score (rescaled)GII 2017 (rescaled) and DEA efficiency Countries/Economies71 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 3: JRC Statistical Audit of the GIIKingdom, Denmark, Singapore, and Finland, which score between 0.96 (Finland) and 0.99 (Sweden) in terms of efficiency. Figure/uni00A03 shows how close the DEA scores and the GII 2017 scores are for all 127 economies (correlation of 0.99). /one.superior Note that by construction, the version of DEA used herein is closer to the GII than to the efficiency ratio calculated as the Output Sub-Index score divided by the Input Sub-Index score (with a correlation of 0.63). Conclusion The JRC analysis suggests that the conceptualized multi-level structure of the GII 2017\u2014with its 81 indica - tors, 21 sub-pillars, 7 pillars, 2 sub-indices, up to an overall index\u2014is statistically sound and balanced: that is, each sub-pillar makes a similar contribution to the variation of its respective pillar. Nevertheless, a careful reflection by the GII team is needed for seven out of the 81 indicators because their capacity to distinguish countries' performance is lost in the aggregation at the pillar level or higher. Five indicators related to the inputs of innovation\u2014 2.1.2 Government expenditure on edu - cation per pupil, secondary; 2.2.2 Graduates in science and engineer - ing; 3.2.3 Gross capital formation; 5.2.3 GERD financed by abroad; 5.3.4 Foreign direct investment net inflows\u2014and two indicators related to the outputs of innovation, 6.2.1 Growth rate of GDP per person engaged and 7.2.4 Printing and pub - lishing output, need to be reviewed because their statistical relevance to the GII framework is very weak, unlike their strong conceptual rel - evance. The no-imputation choice for not treating missing values, com - mon in relevant contexts and justi - fied on grounds of transparency and replicability, can at times have an undesirable impact on some country scores, with the additional negative side-effect that it may encourage countries not to report low data values. The adoption, since 2016, by the GII team of a more stringent data coverage threshold (at least 66% for the input- and output-related indica - tors, separately) has notably improved the confidence in the country ranks for the GII and the two sub-indices. Additionally, the choice of the GII team, which was made in 2012, to use weights as scaling coefficients during the development of the index consti - tutes a significant departure from the traditional, yet erroneous, vision of weights as a reflection of indicators' importance in a weighted average. It is hoped that such a consideration will be made also by other develop - ers of composite indicators to avoid situations where bias sneaks in when least expected. The strong correlations between the GII components are proven not to be a sign of redundancy of information in the GII. For more than 42.2% (up to 60.9%) of the 127 economies included in the GII 2017, the GII ranking and the rankings of any of the seven pillars differ by 10 positions or more. This demonstrates the added value of the GII ranking, which helps to highlight other com - ponents of innovation that do not emerge directly by looking into the seven pillars separately. At the same time, this finding points to the value of duly taking into account the GII pillars, sub-pillars, and individual indicators on their own merit. By doing so, country-specific strengths and bottlenecks in innovation can be identified and serve as an input for evidence-based policy making. All published GII 2017 ranks lie within the simulated 90% confidence intervals that take into account the unavoidable uncertainties in the estimation of missing data, the weights (fixed vs. simulated), and the aggregation formula (arithmetic vs. geometric average) at the pil - lar level. For the vast majority of countries these intervals are narrow enough for meaningful inferences to be drawn: the intervals comprise fewer than 10 positions for 83% (105 out of 127) of the economies. Some caution is needed mainly for two countries\u2014Belarus and Niger\u2014with ranks that are highly sensitive to the methodological choices. The Input and the Output Sub-Indices have the same modest degree of sensitivity to the methodological choices related to the imputation method, weights, or aggregation formula. Country ranks, either in the GII 2017 or in the two sub-indices, can be considered repre - sentative of the many possible scenar - ios: 75% of the countries shift fewer than three positions with respect to the median rank in the GII or either of the Input and Output Sub-Indices. All things considered, the present JRC audit findings confirm that the GII 2017 meets international qual - ity standards for statistical soundness, which indicates that the GII index is a reliable benchmarking tool for innovation practices at the country level around the world. Finally, the 'distance to the effi - cient frontier' measure calculated with Data Envelopment Analysis could complement the Innovation Efficiency Ratio as a measure of efficiency, even if it is conceptually closer to the GII score than to the efficiency ratio. The GII should not be seen as the ultimate and definitive ranking of countries with respect to inno - vation. On the contrary, the GII best represents an ongoing attempt by Cornell University, the business school INSEAD, and the World Intellectual Property Organization to find metrics and approaches that better capture the richness of THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 3: JRC Statistical Audit of the GII72 innovation, continuously adapting the GII framework to reflect the improved availability of statistics and the theoretical advances in the field. In any case, the GII should be regarded as a sound attempt to pave the way for better and more informed innovation policies worldwide. Notes 1 OECD/EC JRC, 2008, p. 26. 2 The JRC analysis was based on the recommendations of the OECD/EC JRC (2008) Handbook on Composite Indicators and on more recent research from the JRC. The JRC audits on composite indicators are conducted upon request of the index developers and are available at https:// ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/coin. 3 Groeneveld and Meeden (1984) set the criteria for absolute skewness above 1 and kurtosis above 3.5. The skewness criterion was relaxed to account for the small sample (127 economies). 4 Nunnally, 1978. 5 Saisana et al., 2005; Saisana et al., 2011. 6 The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Little and Rubin, 2002; Schneider, 2001) is an iterative procedure that finds the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameter vector by repeating two steps: (1) The expectation E-step: Given a set of parameter estimates, such as a mean vector and covariance matrix for a multivariate normal distribution, the E-step calculates the conditional expectation of the complete-data log likelihood given the observed data and the parameter estimates. (2) The maximization M-step: Given a complete-data log likelihood, the M-step finds the parameter estimates to maximize the complete-data log likelihood from the E-step. The two steps are iterated until the iterations converge. 7 Munda, 2008. 8 In the geometric average, pillars are multiplied as opposed to summed in the arithmetic average. Pillar weights appear as exponents in the multiplication. All pillar scores were greater than zero, hence there was no reason to rescale them to avoid zero values that would have led to zero geometric averages. 9 A question that arises from the GII approach is whether there is a way to benchmark countries' multi-dimensional performance on innovation without imposing a fixed and common set of weights that may not be fair to a particular country. The original question in the DEA literature was how to measure each unit's relative efficiency in production compared to a sample of peers, given observations on input and output quantities and, often, no reliable information on prices (Charnes and Cooper, 1985). A notable difference between the original DEA question and the one applied here is that no differentiation between inputs and outputs is made (Cherchye et al., 2008; Melyn and Moesen, 1991). To estimate DEA-based distance to the efficient frontier scores, we consider the m = 7 pillars in the GII 2017 for n = 127 countries, with y ij the value of pillar j in country i. The objective is to combine the pillar scores per country into a single number, calculated as the weighted average of the m pillars, where wi represents the weight of the i-th pillar. In absence of reliable information about the true weights, the weights that maximize the DEA-based scores are endogenously determined. This gives the following linear programming problem for each country j: /H9018 j=1yijwij7 max 0, (non-negativity constraint) where j = 1, ..., 7, i = 1, ..., 127 In this basic programming problem, the weights are non-negative and a country's score is between 0 (worst) and 1 (best). 10 Instead, only Switzerland achieved a 1.0 score in the Innovation Efficiency Ratio, calculated as the ratio of the Output Sub-Index over the Input Sub-Index. The Efficiency Ratio and the DEA score embed very different concepts of efficiency, leading to completely different results and insights. A high score in the Innovation Efficiency Ratio is obtained by scoring more on the Output Sub-Index than on the Input Sub-Index, irrespective of the actual scores in these two sub-indices. Instead, a high score in the DEA score can be obtained by having comparative advantages on several GII pillars (irrespective of these being input or output pillars). The DEA scores are therefore closer to the GII scores than to the Innovation Efficiency Ratio.References and related reading Barbosa, N. and A. P. Faria. 2011.

Today robotics and bio - technological and digital technolo - gies are applied in agriculture and food systems. New actors enter the systems and traditional actors, such as farmers and food companies, grow into commercial farmers, bio/organic producers, and so on. Agriculture and food systems also vary greatly across countries, reflecting each country's level of development as well as the role that agriculture and food sectors play. Measuring agricultural innova - tion is challenging for several reasons: First, agriculture and food sys - tems span many different sectors, products, and service groups that are not easily grasped and that go far beyond the agriculture sector or agri - cultural farms alone. As Chapter 1 and the other substantive chapters of this report show, innovations occur along the value chain and involve (1) agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and seeds, at times coming from the chemical or the biotechnology sector; (2) product innovations coming from the capital goods sector; and (3) pro - cess or organizational innovations in the fields of payments, logistics, and distribution services coming from the banking, transport, and retail sectors. Second, key innovation data sources such as the innovation sur - veys based on the Oslo Manual focus on the manufacturing and services sectors, thus excluding agriculture for the most part. /one.superior Although the agricul - ture sector is likely to be included in future revisions of the Oslo Manual, it is currently unclear whether the cov - erage of the business sector alone will satisfy the innovation data require - ments of the agriculture sector. Third, in developing countries, agricultural activities and related innovations often take place at the farm or household level (especially in case of subsistence farming), not in private-sector firms as captured by most data collections. Statistically, however, capturing activity in the informal sector or at the grassroots level is challenging. /two.superior Clearly, the work of the African Union-New Partnership for Africa's Development (AU-NEPAD) on the African Innovation Outlook, /three.superior and application of innovation surveys, for example, is ongoing. Yet the focus is currently not on the informal or the agriculture sector. As a result of the complexities outlined above, and because of a lack of robust metrics (see Chapter 2), measuring innovation in agriculture and food systems is a difficult endeav - our. This annex maps agriculture and food systems based on the GII framework. Although incomplete, this map - ping illustrates the above challenge and provides guidance to research - ers and policy makers interested in benchmarking their agriculture and food systems. It also shows how the GII framework could be adapted to measuring innovation in specific systems and sectors, thereby laying the foundations for interesting future work. Potential indicators to benchmark innovation in agriculture and food systemsTable/uni00A01 shows how the GII frame - work could be used to measure the characteristics of agriculture and food innovation systems. The table includes only the indicators that are relevant to measuring innovation in agriculture and food systems and that are available for a large number of economies. The next sections look into some of these indicators and provide snapshots of top performing economies in each selected indicator. Human capital and research Education and research and develop - ment (R&D) investment are key to boosting productivity; they are also key for advancing the agriculture and food sector. /comma.superior Various studies dem - onstrate that better-educated farm - ers have the skills to run their farms more efficiently and are more prone to embracing innovation. Education has also proven to spill over, affecting the productivity of family members and neighbours. In spite of its role in agriculture and food systems, data on farmers' education are limited. This has led researchers to use other proxies, such 73 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 Annex 4: Measuring Innovation in Agriculture and Food SystemsTable 1: Adapting the GII framework to agriculture and food systems GII pillar GII indicator Are indicators available for agri-food?

According to available data, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, China, Indonesia, and Uganda receive the highest amounts of aid in agricultural education and training. Other top recipients include Malawi, Myanmar, and Sierra Leone. Lagging R&D expenditures in high-, middle-, and low-income economies affect productivity growth and innovation in agriculture. According to the data available, only about 6% of the world's R&D invest - ments and researchers are devoted to agricultural sciences (see Figure/uni00A01). /one.superior Although advanced economies have historically been the leaders in agri - cultural R&D, research capacity has also reached high standards in several emerging economies\u2014such as China, India, Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa. /one.superior/one.superior In agriculture, R&D affects output with a long lag, but the impact lasts for a long time. /one.superior/two.superior R&D spillovers tend to be geographically bounded because innovations produced in one part of the world require adaptations to work well in local soil and climate conditions. This makes indigenous R&D efforts essential. Developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, have traditionally underspent in agricultural R&D (see Chapter 2). When they undertake R&D, poor (or lacking) extension services generally delay the adoption of innovation. /one.superior/three.superior Indeed, research demonstrates that developing countries that invested the most in R&D while simultane - ously investing in extension have had the strongest productivity leap. /one.superior Overall, the top agricultural R&D spenders are India, the Republic of Korea (Korea), China, the Netherlands, and Australia (see Table/uni00A03), with India spending more than double than Korea. Singapore spends the most in relation to the size of its agriculture sector (as measured by value added), investing roughly 150% of its output in R&D. Qatar, the Netherlands, and Trinidad and Tobago follow, with roughly 10% of their agricultural output spent in R&D. Denmark spends 6% of its agricultural output in R&D. Another way to look at R&D is through ODA disbursements to agri - cultural research. Nigeria, Argentina, India, Uganda, and Ethiopia are the largest recipients of ODA in this Table 2: Official development assistance for education and training: Top five economies Economy ODA in US$, millions Afghanistan 8.2 Ethiopia 4.6 China 4.3 Indonesia 4.1 Uganda 3.4 Data source: FAOstats, February 2017.

Argentina is the only top ODA recipient among upper-middle-income economies, while the others are mostly low- and lower-middle-income economies. Among the top 10 recipients are Kenya, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Indonesia, which each received more than US$10 million. Finally, ODA to agricultural research reaches much higher values than ODA to agricultural education and training (see Table/uni00A04). Data on the share of tertiary stu - dents enrolled in agricultural studies indicate that agricultural studies are particularly relevant in the develop - ing world. The top five highest shares of agricultural students in tertiary students are in Ethiopia, Uzbekistan, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and Albania (see Table/uni00A05). Other countries with high shares of agricultural students in total graduates include Malawi, Sierra Leone, Eritrea, and Kenya.Market sophisticationFinancial markets are important components of any innovation sys - tem. In agriculture, credit is essential to modernize farms and access high-quality inputs such as seeds and fer - tilizers. Given the size and nature of most farms, credit constraints can be often severe. /one.superior According to available data, the countries with the largest credit markets for agriculture are the USA, Germany, Australia, France, and New Zealand (see Table/uni00A06). It is worth recalling that these econo - mies have very large credit markets. Indeed, in the GII, New Zealand, the USA, and Australia rank among the top five economies in the Credit sub-pillar. Still, New Zealand is the coun - try that allocated the highest portion of its credit to agriculture (26%). Uruguay, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and the Plurinational State of Bolivia are the other top economies.Business sophisticationThe adoption of synthetic fertiliz - ers, together with high-yield crop varieties, has been at the basis of the green revolution. Today, despite the growing demand for organic food, less than 1% of agricultural land is farmed using organic methods. /one.superior Although organic farming has a number of advantages, synthetic fertilizers are still widely used. /one.superior Limited access to high-quality fertilizers is still an issue in many countries, most notably in Sub-Saharan Africa (see for example the case of Uganda, described in Chapter 11). Estimates indicate that, from 2009 to 2015, global demand for fertilizers grew by roughly 15%, and will grow at least 1.6% annually from 2015 to 2020. Sub-Saharan Africa will be responsible for most of this growth, reaching an average annual growth rate of 4.4%. /one.superior Data on current fertilizer con - sumption show that global con - sumption is highly concentrated, with one single economy\u2014China\u2014consuming 31% of total world fertil - izers (see Table/uni00A07). Although the gap in fertilizer consumption between China and other economies is con - siderable, according to available data, other top fertilizer consum - ers are India, the USA, Brazil, and Indonesia. By contrast, Sub-Saharan African countries together account for only 3% of total world con - sumption. Considered in relation to arable land, Qatar, Malaysia, Hong Kong (China), New Zealand, and Bahrain are the five top consumers; other important consumers include Singapore, Costa Rica, the United Arab Emirates, and Colombia. Mechanization of agriculture has also contributed greatly to produc tivity growth in agriculture.

Italy, Thailand, France, Turkey, and Brazil also stand out in the use of machinery in agriculture. Although these statistics are extremely interesting, in the future, metrics on the use of drones and other autonomous vehicles might also be useful in assessing the inno - vativeness of agriculture and food innovation systems. According to recent estimates, the market for drone-powered solutions in agri - culture is US$32.4 billion\u201425% of the total drone application market. /one.superior Drones and robots can be inte - grated at every stage of the produc - tion cycle: they can be used for soil analysis, seed planting, spraying, and weed removal. They are more accurate and efficient than previous technologies such as satellite imagery and traditional tractors, allowing for productivity gains and cost savings. The last indicator on business sophistication reviewed in this annex is foreign direct investment (FDI) net inflows. Some agricultural and food innovation systems prove to be well integrated in international knowl - edge networks, receiving consider - able FDI. The United Kingdom, Italy, Brazil, China, and Sweden are the top five recipients of FDI inflows in food and agriculture, driven by FDI in food processing (except for China). Ghana, Argentina, and the Russian Federation are among the top five FDI recipients in the agri - culture sector, while Turkey is the fifth FDI recipient in food process - ing (see Table/uni00A09). Knowledge and technology outputsThis section looks at agricultural labour productivity growth, agricul - ture and food exports, and patents in technological fields related to agri - culture and food. /two.superior The top five economies in terms of agricultural labour productiv - ity growth are Slovenia, Bahrain, Luxembourg, Armenia, and Belgium (see Table/uni00A010). Others that stand out include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Senegal, and Morocco. Data on agricultural exports are widely available through the UN Comtrade database, which covers almost all economies in the world and allows for a highly disaggregated analysis. According to these data, a mix of high- and middle-income economies are among the top five exporters of agricultural and food products.

The Netherlands, Germany, Brazil, and China fol - low with shares of between 6% and 5% (see Table/uni00A011). Other European economies\u2014namely France, Spain, Italy, and Belgium\u2014follow. Among emerging economies, Argentina, India, and Indonesia stand out. The top five economies in agri-food patent applications by origin are the USA, Japan, China, Germany, and Korea (see Table/uni00A012). Other important players in agri-food PCT patenting are Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. Early high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice led to the most signifi - cant improvements in crop yields in the 20th century (see Chapters 3 and 10). The green revolution enabled developing economies to import cheaper grains and grow high-yield seed varieties, which were responsive to fertilizers and resistant to diseases and insects. Productivity gains from high-yield varieties are not over. First, new innovations\u2014for example, in genome-editing technologies\u2014are expected to drive the development of ground-breaking crop varieties that could not be obtained by traditional breeding (see Chapter 8). Second, the diffusion of seeds and new plant varieties can still bring considerable advantages, as demonstrated in the case of Bt cotton cultivation in India (see Chapter 5), or in the case of soybeans, corn, and cotton in Latin America and the Caribbean (see Chapter 10). Yet research shows that the knowledge accumulated in the development of new plant varieties is often tacit and difficult to appro - priate. /two.superior/one.superior Innovation in plant varieties tends to be cumulative, meaning that prior knowledge is needed to come up with new innovations. The adoption of new plant varieties also depends on the efforts to adapt innovation developed elsewhere to breed locally suitable varieties. /two.superior/two.superior These character - istics may make intellectual property protection of new plant varieties a critical issue. The legislation on plant variety protection is increasingly being adopted in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. /two.superior/three.superior WIPO data show that, since the early 2000s, plant variety application filings grew rapidly, with middle-income econo - mies\u2014especially in Asia\u2014contribut - ing to global figures more and more frequently. /two.superior Top filers of plant variety appli - cations are the Netherlands, China, and the USA, followed by France and Germany (see Table/uni00A013). Other important applicants are Japan, Korea, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Australia. Creative outputs The creative outputs of agriculture and food systems can be measured through trademarks and geographic indications. Looking at trademarks, Nice classes 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 43 are typically associated with the agri-food sector. /two.superior Still, identifying the Nice classes that capture agri - culture and food is a complex task because various other Nice classes can potentially contain agriculture- and food-relevant trademarks. For example, Nice class 1 includes genes of seeds for agricultural production and agricultural chemicals; Nice class 7 includes agricultural elevators and machines; and Nice class 44 includes Table 10: Agricultural labour productivity growth: Top five economies EconomyGrowth rate of agriculture value added per worker Slovenia 34.6 Bahrain 29.2 Luxembourg 19.9 Armenia 16.6 Belgium 15.8 Data source: World Bank's World Development Indicators, February 2017, available at http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators.

These indicators are not reported in Table 1. 6 This section has benefited from contributions from our colleagues from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) Martin Schaaper, Rohan Pathirage, and Klasen, 2013. 8 Adrian et al., 2005; Knight et al., 2003; Wheeler, 2008. 9 Knight et al., 2003; Weir and Knight, 2004. 10 Africa stands out as the region with the highest proportion of resources committed to agricultural sciences (16% of the region's total R&D expenditure). This is followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (11%), ahead of Asia (6%) and Europe (4%), indicating that middle- and low-income economies allocate more resources to agricultural sciences, whereas high-income focus more on other fields\u2014notably natural sciences and engineering.

Innovative responses to complex issues are needed to accel - erate progress towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Innovation, be it technologi - cal, institutional, or social, emerges from collective thinking, iterative learning, and action. It is a process by which multiple actors and stake - holders collectively put knowledge to use./one.superior Innovation outcomes\u2014such as poverty reduction, increases in agri - cultural productivity, and resource use efficiency\u2014are determined by the properties and capacities of the system in which organizations or individuals operate and engage with each other. Effective and dynamic systems are likely to generate more effective and relevant innovation outcomes. In addition to enhanced investments, policies, and technolo - gies, a balanced strategy for sustain - able agricultural productivity growth in developing countries involves strengthening agricultural innova - tion systems (AIS). /two.superiorAgricultural innovation systemsAIS can be understood as a network of actors (organizations and individuals), together with supporting institutions (formal and informal) and policies in the agricultural and related sectors that brings existing or new products, processes, and forms of organization into social and economic use. /three.superior System thinking is firmly established in the agriculture and rural development disciplines, and the AIS concept is widely recognized among research - ers. Adopting an AIS perspective for agricultural development issues is also becoming more commonplace beyond academia in international agencies and fora, donor organiza - tions, and government outfits. Based on a conceptual model proposed by Arnold and Bell (2001) and further refined by Spielman and Birner (2008) and Spielman and Kelemework (2009), four primary AIS domains comprising public, civil society, and private-sector actors are proposed: (1) research and education, involving research institutes, univer - sities, and vocational training centres; (2) business and enterprise, involving various value chain actors, agribusi - ness, producers, and consumers; (3) bridging institutions, involving stakeholder platforms, contractual arrangements, and various types of rural advisory services; and (4) an enabling environment, involving governance and policies as well as behaviours, mindsets, and attitudes (Figure/uni00A01). The actors in the sys - tem engage in collective action at various levels, from local to global, and with various objectives, be it a product, process, or any other type of innovation. Requirements for a robust AIS assessmentAssessing agricultural innovation system properties and performance is not a straightforward exercise. Whereas much emphasis has been put on analysing and assessing the overall role of agricultural research and of extension and rural advisory services, relatively little attention has been paid to the system-wide analysis (e.g., understanding AIS actors' linkages and relationships and how these shape AIS performance), or to developing a broader diagnostic tool for assessing national agricultural innovation sys - tems. AIS assessment has the poten - tial to inform decision-makers about strengths, gaps, and opportunities in capacity development and invest - ment. It can also be instrumental in meeting monitoring and evaluation requirements. A transition towards \u00a9Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The views expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 2: The Potential of a Global Diagnostic Tool for Agricultural Innovation Systems82 sustainable growth in the food and agriculture sectors needs evidence on what works and what does not. In recent years, countries have started to recognize the critical role that innovation plays and will continue to play in achieving the SDGs. During the 25th Session of the Committee on Agriculture (COAG) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), countries explicitly requested support for the assessment of their innovation systems, in particular through the development of a diag - nostic tool. Data related to different aspects of AIS are available from a wide range of sources. These include FAO, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Existing datasets include information, for example, on public spending and foreign aid for agricultural research and extension, ease of access to loans, and costs associated with agricultural policies. For a more comprehensive assessment, macro-level indicators measuring rather static properties and performance can be complemented by indicators that capture systems dynamics. These can help to under - stand how far a system is integrated, heterogeneous, and demand-driven. The AIS concept puts great emphasis on understanding the nature of relationships and interactions between actors and the knowledge, attitudes, and practices that shape these relationships. However, such information is not readily available. This chapter explores the poten - tial for a diagnostic tool to assess national agricultural innovation systems. Such a diagnostic tool needs to be geared towards identifying enabling and hindering factors that affect the performance of the system, with the aim of improving its overall performance to respond to the needs of its actors and stakeholders. More specifically, the chapter provides insights into data availability and discusses options for additional data gathering and validation. Data considerations Underpinning all these elements is the availability of good and up-to-date data. Good data are both essen - tial and difficult to identify. Overview of available information The complexity of the AIS concept poses challenges in terms of methods and data. The literature on innova - tion systems in agriculture has been making valuable contributions to the understanding of the role of AIS, mostly through the use of descriptive and case study methods, while usu - ally avoiding the use of more formal models and macro-level analysis. More systematic assessment approaches are, however, gaining Figure 1: Representation of the agricultural innovation system Source: Adapted from TAP , 2016, with permission from CAB International 2016.Research and Education Agricultural Research (public, private, civil society) Education (secondary, tertiary, and vocational)Business and Enterprise Agricultural Value Chain Actors & Organizations (agribusiness, farmers' organizations, cooperatives, smallholders, etc.) Enabling Environment Innovation Policies Investments Agricultural PoliciesMindsets & Attitudes Practices Informal InstitutionsBridging Institutions Stakeholder Platforms Agricultural Extension (public, private, civil society) Contractual Arrangements Partnership83 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 2: The Potential of a Global Diagnostic Tool for Agricultural Innovation Systemstraction. /one.superior A quantitative diagnostic of AIS at the country level or across a set of countries has been proposed by Spielman and Kelemework (2009) and Mekonnen et al. (2015). For their study of the determinants of technical efficiency in agriculture, Mekonnen et al. (2015) collected a dataset on innovation system properties cov - ering 85 low- and middle-income countries from 2004 to 2011. The results illustrate how a global analy - sis of AIS can contribute to a better understanding of key agricultural development challenges. At the same time, the study shed light on some of the difficulties related to obtain - ing meaningful and comprehensive aggregate data on agriculture-spe - cific innovation system properties. In terms of the explained variable, Mekonnen et al. decided to resort to technical efficiency. They point out that the innovation system properties selected for their study are expected to have a positive influence on the efficiency of agricultural production. The quality of institutions and legal systems as well as factors enabling business and enterprise influence the nature and performance of pub - lic- and private-sector innovation processes. Table/uni00A0 1 on page/uni00A0 84 compiles available information that is of poten - tial use for global AIS analysis. These are indicators that have already been used in the literature. As shown in the bottom part of the table, a range of AIS outcome indicators other than technical efficiency are available\u2014for example, eco-efficiency and total factor productivity (TFP)\u2014or sim - pler metrics, such as the value of agri - cultural production or agricultural exports. This wide range of indica - tors demonstrates the need to draw on records from a variety of sources to create a comprehensive database. The compilation reveals that several indicators pertain to innovation at large and are not specific to the agricultural sector. In the absence of more accurate data, these are consid - ered proxies for AIS characteristics. At the same time, they represent spill - overs from what shapes innovation in general to the agricultural innovation system, which are important to take into account. Several of the indicators shown in Table/uni00A01 have been used in the studies by Spielman and Kelemework (2009) and Mekonnen et al. (2015), while other variables\u2014such as public spending on extension and research-extension collaboration\u2014were not considered previously but have been added here, as deemed relevant. The IFPRI/ASTI database records num - bers of researchers and public spend - ing on research in agriculture but falls short of providing any indicators on the relevance and demand-orienta - tion of agricultural research. /one.superior/one.superior Three criteria were applied for selecting variables: (1) the indicator must be a potential parameter to assess innovation processes in agriculture; (2) the data must be openly accessible; (3) the level of data coverage across countries and years must be high (for most countries less than 20% of data are missing between 2000 and 2014). For any assessment of AIS on the basis of the data presented here, it is crucial to take into account issues regarding the quality and informative value of the data. Rather than focusing the analysis on single years or averages, data trends as well as variability, espe - cially in the case of financial flows, should be at the core of an innovation system diagnostic. AIS properties Although a range of useful indicators has been identified, it becomes clear that many gaps exist\u2014for example, gaps in data on rural advisory ser - vices and farmer organizations. Some indicators capture generic innovation system properties but lack precision in the context of analysing AIS. In Table/uni00A0 2 on page/uni00A0 85, additional indicators are proposed that would be desirable for a more accurate and in-depth diagnosis of AIS. The indi - cators listed here by no means present an exhaustive list but serve to draw attention to how some important gaps could potentially be filled. Data on these indicators exist but are available only for a limited number of countries. Furthermore, data from national sources or surveys exist for selected countries but require con - siderable effort to make them com - parable cross-country. In Tables 1 and 2, the AIS properties variables were attributed to one of the four AIS domains to reflect how they capture the educa - tion and research levels, business and enterprise development, bridging institutions, and enabling environ - ment aspects of the assessment. This categorization, however, falls short of making an important distinction that is of great relevance for any AIS analysis. Indicators can represent either more actor-oriented and static AIS characteristics or more system- and action-oriented properties. In addition, a distinction can be made in terms of specificity. While some indicators can be considered more generic, applying to innovation systems in general, others are more specific to innovation systems in the agricultural sector. The following indicators can be classified as representing mostly static and generic properties: health expenditures, foreign aid received, total tax rate, patent applications, sci - entific and technical journal articles, domestic credit to the private sector, and the credit information index. A range of indicators can be clas - sified as representing mostly static but fairly agriculture-specific properties: farmer organization membership, extension service providers, extension THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 2: The Potential of a Global Diagnostic Tool for Agricultural Innovation Systems84 Table 1: Selected easily accessible variables of relevance for global AIS analysis AIS PROPERTIES Domain Indicators Analytical focus Unit Sources Research and educationQuality of the education system Trend 1 (low) to 7 (high) WEF, GCR data Foreign aid for agricultural education/trainingTrend, variability % of agriculture GDP OECD, DAC data Quality of scientic research institutions Trend 1 (low) to 7 (high) WEF, GCR data Agricultural researchers Trend FTEs per 100,000 farmers IFPRI, ASTI data Agricultural research spending Trend, variability % of agriculture GDP IFPRI, ASTI data Foreign aid for agricultural research Trend, variability % of agriculture GDP OECD, DAC data Patent applications Trend Number per 1,000,000 people WIPO data Scientic and technical journal articles Trend, variability Number per 100 researchers WB, WDI data Bridging institutionsUniversity-industry collaboration in R&D Trend, variability 1 (minimal) to 7 (intensive) WEF, GCR data Foreign aid for extension Trend, variability % of agriculture GDP OECD, DAC data Business and enterpriseStart-up procedures to register a business Trend Number WB, WDI data Time required to start a business Trend Days WB, WDI data Total tax rate Trend % of commercial prots WB, WDI data Ease of accessing loans Trend 1 (low) to 7 (high) WEF, GCR data Domestic credit to private sectors Trend, variability % of GDP WB, WDI data Enabling environmentCredit information index Trend 0 (low) to 8 (high) WB, WDI data Credit to agriculture Trend, variability % of total credit FAOSTAT data Government expenditure on agriculture Trend, variability % of total outlays FAOSTAT data Agricultural policy costs Trend 1 (low) to 7 (high) WEF, GCR data Foreign aid received Trend, variability Current international US$ per capitaOECD, DAC data Foreign aid for agriculture Trend, variability % of agriculture GDP OECD, DAC data Gross capital formation Trend % of GDP WB, WDI data Health expenditures Trend, variability % of GDP WB, WDI data AIS OUTCOMES Domain Indicators Analytical focus Unit Sources ResultsAgricultural output Level, growth Tons per hectare / % FAOSTAT data Value of agricultural output Level, growth Current international US$ per hectare / %FAOSTAT data Value of agricultural exports Level, growth % of agricultural output FAOSTAT data Total factor productivity aGrowth Index FAOSTAT data (calculation required); USDA, ERS Eco-eciency Level, growth 0 (low) to (1high) / % FAOSTAT data (calculation required) Rural poverty Trend % of rural population WB, WDI data Note: FAOSTAT data = FAO Statistical Databases, available at http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home; IFPRI, ASTI data = International Food Policy Research Institute, Agriculture Science and Technology Indicators, available at https://www.asti. cgiar.org/; OECD, DAC data = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Development Assistance Committee, available at http://www.oecd.org/development/stats/idsonline.htm; USDA, ERS = United States Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, available at https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/international-agricultural-productivity/; WB, WDI data = World Bank, World Development Indicators, available at http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators; WEF, GCR = World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report 2016-2017, available at https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2016-2017-1; and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Global Brand Database, available at http://www.wipo.int/branddb/en/. a Environmentally adjusted total factor productivity has been suggested as an alternative measure by the OECD.85 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 2: The Potential of a Global Diagnostic Tool for Agricultural Innovation Systems agents, agricultural researchers, credit to agriculture, government expenditure on agriculture, public spending on agricultural research, public spending on extension, for - eign aid for agriculture, foreign aid for agricultural education/training, foreign aid for extension, and foreign aid for agricultural research. Several of the indicators can be classified as representing mostly dynamic and generic properties: quality of the education system, qual - ity of scientific research institutions, university-industry collaboration in R&D, start-up procedures to regis - ter a business, time required to start a business, ease of accessing loans, and gross capital formation. The remaining indicators can be classified as representing mostly dynamic and agriculture-specific properties: quality of university education in agriculture, quality of vocational training in agriculture, demand-orientation of agricultural research, research-extension col - laborations, demand-orientation of extension, research-policy col - laborations, agricultural policy costs, adoption of certification standards, seed regulation, fertilizer regula - tion, access to finance in agriculture, market regulation in agriculture, and transport regulation in agriculture. It should be noted that the above classification is not conceived of as a clear-cut typology, but rather an aid for reflection. AIS outcomes For the AIS outcome indicators shown at the bottom of Table/uni00A01, data on agricultural output for all major crops and the value of agricultural production are readily available through FAOSTAT. Outcomes measured through TFP growth or eco-efficiency entail calculations that can be performed using existing FAOSTAT data but require knowl - edge of appropriate methods. TFP denotes the ratio between total outputs and total inputs. It has been used to broaden the focus on land or labour productivity, improv - ing understanding of technical change in agriculture. Growth in TFP is interpreted as increased efficiency of input use. /one.superior/two.superior Fuglie (2015) explains the use of growth accounting to construct TFP indices for agriculture worldwide. /one.superior/three.superior Using FAO data and the growth accounting methodology, internationally consistent and compa - rable agricultural TFP growth rates Table 2: Proposed indicators for in-depth diagnosis of AIS AIS PROPERTIES Domain Indicators Analytical focus Unit Possible sources Research and educationVocational training graduates Trend Number per 100,000 farmers National data Quality of university education in agricultureTrend 1 (low) to 10 (high) Survey data Quality of vocational training in agricultureTrend 1 (low) to 10 (high) Survey data Demand-orientation of agricultural ResearchTrend 1 (low) to 10 (high) Survey data Research-extension collaborations 1 (low) to 10 (high) Survey data Bridging institutionsExtension service providers Trend Number National data Extension agents Trend Number per 100,000 farmers National data Public spending on extension Trend, variability % of agriculture GDP National data Demand-orientation of extension Trend 1 (low) to 10 (high) Survey data Business and enterpriseFarmer organization membership Trend % of total farmers National data Adoption of certication standards Trend 1 (low) to 10 (high) Survey data Seed regulation Trend 0 (poor) to 100 (good practice) WB, EBA data Fertiliser regulation Trend 0 (poor) to 100 (good practice) WB, EBA data Access to nance in agriculture Trend 0 (poor) to 100 (good practice) WB, EBA data Enabling environmentMarket regulation in agriculture Trend 0 (poor) to 100 (good practice) WB, EBA data Transport regulation in agriculture Trend 0 (poor) to 100 (good practice) WB, EBA data Research-policy collaborations Trend 1 (low) to 10 (high) Survey data Note: WB, EBA data = World Bank, Enabling the Business of Agriculture, available at http://eba.worldbank.org/; national data = national government statistical data; survey data = data collected through key informant/expert opinion interviews.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 2: The Potential of a Global Diagnostic Tool for Agricultural Innovation Systems86 can be computed, for which a com - plete dataset is accessible through the USDA website. /one.superior TFP rarely accounts for quality improvements in inputs or changes in natural resource stocks. 'Eco-efficiency' is defined as the ratio between economic value added and a composite variable of environ - mental pressures. /one.superior It must be stressed that measures used for computing eco-efficiency scores do not attempt to represent the environmental impact of agricultural production but rather the environmental pressures associated with it. Following the eco-efficiency definition, a country can be considered eco-efficient if it is impossible to decrease any environ - mental pressure without simultane - ously increasing another pressure or decreasing the economic value added. For calculation purposes, data envel - opment analysis is commonly used, /one.superior solving linear programming prob - lems to trace a global eco-efficiency frontier and determine the distance of countries from that frontier. Data on environmental pressures from agriculture are available through FAOSTAT to a steadily increasing extent. Conclusions The precise representation of AIS properties constitutes the most important constraint in any attempt of a diagnostic and/or assessment, where agriculture-specific data are by and large missing. As this chapter shows, some key data for character - izing and assessing national AIS cov - ering a wide range of countries and periods are available and accessible from various sources. These include inter-alia data from FAO, IFPRI, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Bank, OECD, WEF, WIPO, and so on. However, other crucial data are miss - ing or are not readily available. These include data on extension and civil society (non-governmental organi - zations and farmers' organizations), public spending on extension ser - vices, the responsiveness of research to the needs of producers, and regula - tory procedures in agriculture. A lack of structured data at the country level is particularly apparent for extension and other institutional arrangements that fulfil the bridging function between education and research actors and value chain actors. For these reasons, any AIS diagnostic tool remains exploratory rather than one that allows for precise analysis and definite answers. Despite limitations arising from the nature and scope of the data used, interesting results can emerge from AIS measurements and assessments. The information and knowledge generated can provide pointers to policy and investment gaps and innovation opportunities. There is potential for a com - prehensive diagnostic tool for AIS assessment, but data availability and accessibility at the county level remain a daunting challenge. For a thorough analysis of national AIS, it is important to identify available and accessible data and then fill gaps through additional data gather - ing. Equally important is to focus on trends and to rely on additional qualitative data sources and valida - tion to interpret results. A sizeable set of indicators has been presented in Table/uni00A02. Selecting key indicators characterizing actors and actions/interactions, linkages, and relation - ships in the AIS will allow for a meaningful analysis of the system in terms of strengths and weaknesses. A multi-criteria AIS diagnosis can thus generate the sound evidence required to formulate global, regional, and national agricultural innovation strategies. In order to draw mean - ingful results from the diagnosis, it is of paramount importance to define upstream its purpose and the infor - mation expected to be generated through the analysis of the diagnostic outputs. This requires the definition of information and knowledge needs by national actors and stakeholders that will guide data collection pro - cesses and the diagnostic process. Once the specific context is known, the selection of core indicators from the original set can then facilitate the data collection. The involvement of key AIS actors and stakeholders from the outset is therefore critical to ensure that the diagnosis responds to their information and knowledge requirements and needs.

The stage has been set for a potential global food crisis if policy makers and other stakeholders fail to act: Ensuring adequate supplies of food will require a 70% increase in agricultural production over the next 30 years. /two.superior The pace of agricultural innova - tion has increased over the last 10 to 15 years, with advances in genomics, software, communications, logistics, and technology. The public sector has traditionally been the driving force behind these advances and represented the lion's share of agri - cultural research and development (R&D) expenditures, with global public-sector R&D accounting for 55% of the US$69 billion total in 2011 (the most recent year for which global data are available). /three.superior But more recently, constrained fis - cal policies in many countries have slowed public-sector R&D growth. The private sector has increasingly filled the gap: Private investment in agricultural innovation has resulted in new technologies and production techniques with significant promise to boost productivity. Output and productivityBefore 1970, the expansion of land under cultivation and other inputs\u2014such as labour and capital per acre\u2014accounted for the vast majority of the growth in global agricultural out - put. Since 1990, however, the rate of growth in land, labour, capital, and other material inputs has dramati - cally slowed, and increasing total factor productivity (TFP)\u2014which measures the efficiency with which all agricultural inputs are trans - formed into outputs\u2014has become the main driver of agricultural productivity growth. From 2001 to 2013, TFP accounted for more than two-thirds of the overall growth in output (see Figure/uni00A01). However, the 2016 Global Agricultural Productivity Report, a benchmark that analyses agricultural productivity growth (compiled by the private-sector group Global Harvest 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0 2001-13 1991-2000 1981-90 1971-80 1961-70 n Expansion of agricultural land n Expansion of irrigation to croplandn More inputs per area n Improvements in total factor productivity Figure 1: Sources of growth in global agricultural output, 1961-2013 Source: USDA Economic Research Service, 2017. Output growth rate (annual average percentage change)THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 3: The Role of Private-Sector R&D in Agricultural Innovation90 Initiative), has found that global TFP is not growing fast enough to meet projected population-driven increases in food demand by 2050. This inadequate growth is mostly the result of lagging TFP growth in low-income countries, where the current average growth rate is 25% lower than the global average. In these countries, the bulk of output growth still comes from increasing agricultural inputs and land under cultivation\u2014creating even greater need for productivity gains. Driving further growth in TFP rates demands greater investment in agricultural R&D. Unfortunately, the growth of public-sector investment has slowed in many high-income countries, including those of Western Europe, and has declined sharply in the United States of America (USA) in recent years (falling more than 20% in real terms from 2008 to 2013). R&D spending in low-income countries is also lagging, particularly when measured on a per capita basis. In 2011, high-income countries spent US$17.73 per person, compared to US$1.51 in low-income countries. At the same time, public-sector spending has been increasing in middle-income countries, including Brazil, India, and especially China; the last-mentioned has accounted for a majority of the net growth in global public-sector agricultural R&D in recent years. From 2008 to 2013, China increased its spending nearly 70%. Private-sector R&D spend - ing, meanwhile, has been growing robustly in recent years, especially in high-income countries (see Figure/uni00A02). In the USA, private- and public-sector spending were roughly equal in the 1980s and 1990s; in 2000, for example, each sector contributed 50%. But by 2013, the public share had declined and private investment had risen; the private sector now accounts for 75% of total US R&D. Such growth can be traced to advances in genetic engineering in the mid-1980s, which gave rise to a wave of technological innova - tion that boosted returns on private investment, and to the increasing marketization of the agricultural supply chain in many regions. Over the past 10 years, investment in agri - cultural innovation has been fuelled by an unprecedented convergence of advances in biology, agronomy, plant and animal science, digitiza - tion, and robotics. These technolo - gies\u2014often referred collectively as 'digital agriculture', precision farming', or 'smart farming'\u2014are creating the foundation for a new, more productive and sustainable future of agriculture. Farm own - ership patterns are also changing, creating a multiplier effect because farmers who automate are able to manage larger fields and greater numbers of animals. Much of this new wave of innovation is enabled by the shift in corporate R&D towards soft - ware, advanced hardware, and ser - vice offerings. The integration of embedded software and sensors in farm equipment, in the soil, and on the animals\u2014as well as the ability to reliably and inexpensively connect and network agricultural producers, suppliers, products, and custom - ers using cloud-based systems and shared analytics\u2014has significant potential to increase output. /one.superior Such innovations are enabling major gains in yields, asset productivity, and sus - tainability that will be key factors in meeting the escalating demand for food (see Figure/uni00A03). Increasing yields The development and widespread adoption of hybrid seeds led to the most significant improvements in crop yields in the 20th century. For example, the adoption of hybrid corn (maize) in the USA\u2014aided by improvements in tillage prac - tices, herbicides, and equipment\u2014increased yields by a factor of five from the 1940s to the present. /one.superior/one.superior In the 1990s, genetically modified crops (GMCs) launched a new wave Source: Pardey et al.

These hybrids are also in wide use in South America and Asia\u2014most notably in China and in India. Adoption of GMCs has been controversial, however, and health fears have limited their penetration in Europe. /one.superior/two.superior The latest advances in genomics promise to increase crop yields while avoiding some of the features that have caused concern about GMCs. A technology under development known as CRISPR (which stands for 'clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats') for example, which is now being adapted for crop and animal science, uses the immune system of bacteria to edit specific genes in organisms. Unlike processes used for traditional GMCs, CRISPR does not introduce genes from other organisms into plants but instead edits the genome of the plant itself. Scientists believe the CRISPR outcomes could improve the natural characteristics of crops to make them more resistant to drought, pests, and weeds, and could boost their photosynthetic efficiency to make them grow faster. Companies are already developing applications of the technology to improve drought resistance for crops and to improve livestock resistance to diseases, such as African swine fever. /one.superior/three.superior R&D in sensor technology, geo-positioning, and big data will also enable significant increases in crop and livestock yields. The Climate Corporation, a subsidiary of Monsanto, launched its Climate FieldView platform in 2015. This platform, backed by a powerful data science engine and an extensive field research network, uses sensors and satellite imagery to provide farmers with real-time data to maximize crop yields. It enables precision application of fertilizers and can also identify and prevent disease vulner - ability. FieldView is already in operation on more than 100 million acres in the USA and Brazil. The Climate Corporation has recently expanded into the European mar - ket, and plans to also offer the plat - form in South Africa, Australia, and Argentina over the next few years. /one.superior More and more big-data solutions of this nature are expected both from start-ups and from legacy agribusi - ness organizations that serve growers around the world. Another example of the imple - mentation of new technology is hap - pening at My Dairy Dashboard, a joint venture of Virtus Nutrition and Dairy.com in the USA, announced in May 2017. Virtus had previously acquired Farmeron, a Croatian startup that developed a cloud-based software platform for data management and agricultural pro - duction performance optimized for dairy farmers. My Dairy Dashboard will provide data aggregation for the dairy farm industry, to help enhance production and streamline operations. /one.superior Innovations in drone technology will also enable increases in yields. Companies are adapting drones to produce precise three-dimensional maps for soil analysis and to optimize irrigation and nitrogen-level man - agement. Start-ups are developing drone systems for planting that shoot pods with seeds and nutrients into the soil. Drones are also being developed to spray crops far more precisely and efficiently than current tractor-based technologies. Drones with thermal sensors are well suited for monitoring crop health and growth. /one.superior Some African countries are pursuing R&D in aquaculture to develop inland fish farming as a potentially large future source of protein. In the United Republic of Tanzania, the National Aquaculture Development Centre is working with a consortium of local and global educational and nonprofit organiza - tions to identify and optimize the best species of native tilapia for farming, and to adopt best practices from aquaculture experience around THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 3: The Role of Private-Sector R&D in Agricultural Innovation92 the world. The Tanzanian govern - ment aims to triple the contribution of aquaculture to the nation's GDP from its current 1.4% to 4.2% by 2025. /one.superior Not all promising innovations for raising yields rely on cutting-edge science; some leverage older technologies. AgroStar, a start-up based in Pune, India, has devel - oped a mobile-commerce platform that helps small farmers access raw materials, seed, fertilizer, and other agricultural inputs in rural areas that are often plagued by product unavailability, unfair prices, substan - dard quality, and limited informa - tion. AgroStar enables its customers to order using a mobile app or via the 'missed call' technique (dialling a number and disconnecting before the call is picked up, thus signalling the recipient that the caller wants to order or communicate while avoid - ing cell-phone usage charges). The company, which launched in 2012, has partnered with more than 150 brands, including multinationals such as Syngenta, and has served 7 million farmers in the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. /one.superior Improving asset productivityOne of the most notable innova - tions in improving asset productiv - ity was the invention of the cotton gin in 1793. The new machine could process 1,000 pounds of cot - ton in the time it took an individual to process five pounds by hand. /one.superior Over the past decade, major agri - cultural equipment manufacturers have been attempting another dra - matic transformation by building increasingly sophisticated digital features into farm equipment to boost productivity. The latest models of tractors, planters, harvesters, and other equip - ment from companies such as Case IH, John Deere, and Kubota feature monitors, sensors, and software that optimize farming processes and generate detailed computerized data\u2014enabling farmers to maxi - mize their productivity and increase their yields while gaining a wealth of information to help them man - age their operations more efficiently. Manufacturers have also been devel - oping sophisticated autonomous tractors and other vehicles over the last several years, and have proto - types in operation today. Case IH, for example, unveiled an autonomous tractor concept in 2016\u2014the Case IH Autonomous Concept Vehicle\u2014built with a fully interactive interface that allows remote monitoring of pre-pro - grammed operations. These include automatically accounting for imple - ment widths, and plotting the most efficient paths in a field depending on terrain, obstructions, and other machines in use in the same field. A remote operator can monitor and control the tractor from a computer or tablet. Such vehicles can operate around the clock, and can provide the farmer with predictive informa - tion on maintenance. /two.superior Equipment manufacturers and third-party vendors are also offer - ing software and Global Positioning System (GPS) packages that can track and map an agricultural producer's mechanized equipment. This enables farmers to monitor their machines on a tablet or smart phone and direct them to where they are needed\u2014when, for example, a storm is coming\u2014and to re-route support vehicles carry - ing fuel, seed, and fertilizer. Similar tracking and mapping software is also available for livestock. Collars or tags placed on the animals can send real-time data to farmers and ranchers not only on livestock location, but also on weather conditions, health, and mating patterns. /two.superior/one.superior Finally, companies are devel - oping innovative technologies for offshore aquaculture operations that can grow and harvest different vari - eties of seafood in oceans, including smart floating farms and submersible cages that can be located near cit - ies or out at sea. /two.superior/two.superior Ocean Farming, for example, a subsidiary of the Norwegian fish farming company SalMar, is adapting deep-water petroleum technology to develop offshore salmon farms that would anchor 100-metre steel cages that float below the surface to the ocean floor and adapt to the motion of waves and currents. The company estimates these could be eight times as productive as traditional inshore fish farms. /two.superior/three.superior Enhancing sustainabilityThe introduction of sustainable techniques such as contour farm - ing\u2014the practice of planting crops in rows running parallel, rather than perpendicular, to the contours of the land\u2014reduced topsoil loss by 65% within five years during the envi - ronmental and humanitarian crisis known as the Dust Bowl in the USA during the 1930s. /two.superior In recent decades, many key innovations in sustainabil - ity have focused on more efficient irrigation techniques. In most parts of the world where irrigation is necessary, variations of field flood - ing\u2014the least efficient method\u2014are still used. More efficient methods, such as central pivot systems, which use wheeled booms to apply water to crops more precisely, have been in use in high-income countries since the 1950s. T-L Irrigation, a leading pro - ducer of centre wheel systems, introduced a new system for arid farming areas in 2014 that combines the central pivot and drip irrigation approaches. Drip hoses, spaced a 93 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 3: The Role of Private-Sector R&D in Agricultural Innovationfew feet apart, apply water directly to crops, minimizing evaporation, and can reach water efficiency lev - els of 95%. /two.superior By adding sensors to these types of irrigation equipment to optimize water application, water use could be reduced by as much as 50% and yields could be increased by 10% or more. /two.superior Access to fresh water is another focus of sustainability efforts, espe - cially in arid climates. In 2012, the World Bank reported that 14 of the 20 most water-scarce countries in the world were located in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. /two.superior Desalination currently plays a critical role in supplying water to the populations of MENA countries, and will con - tinue to do so moving forward as these populations continue to grow. But desalination plants are energy and resource intensive, and for that reason many MENA countries are investing in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, which use large mirrors to generate thermal energy for desalination. Given the high costs associated with CSP, the public and private sectors will need to work together to ensure broader adoption. /two.superior In addition to improving sus - tainability, players across the agri - cultural supply chain are also keenly interested in creating transparency and trust about their sustainability efforts. For example, major food companies and retailers are making public sustainability commitments to improve their environmental footprints. Land O'Lakes, a farmer-owned cooperative with more than 4,300 members based in Minnesota, USA, created a new business unit named SUSTAIN to align its envi - ronmental sustainability efforts across its enterprise, which operates in all 50 US states and more than 50 other countries. /two.superior The SUSTAIN programme focuses on sustainable crop production by delivering prod - ucts, services, and insights; enhanc - ing sustainability within the dairy foods and feed businesses; and part - nering with other entities, including governments, to improve efficiency and collaboration on water con - servation and sustainability. The programme also offers tracking, reporting, and aggregated results that enable farmers to communicate their sustainability results to their customers and retailers to document and communicate the sustainability of their products to end consumers. The R&D challenges in agriculture The imperative to raise the produc - tivity of agricultural R&D by up to 70% over the next three decades will require the public and private sector to address several critical challenges. Speeding R&D cycles and fur - thering the widespread adoption of promising innovations\u2014particu - larly in low-income countries\u2014are a precursor to improving outputs. The lags between successful R&D efforts and the widespread adoption of agricultural innovations tend to be long; at least 15 to 25 years before peak impacts, with further adoption lags that can continue for decades. In the USA, for example, the ear - liest research on hybrid corn tech - nology began as early as the 1890s, and focused research did not begin until 1918. Commercial adoption, however, began only in the 1930s and was uneven. And not until 1960 was almost all US corn acreage in hybrids. Thus the total adoption cycle took over 40 years\u2014or argu - ably longer. /three.superior Another challenge is that many of the most promising agricultural innovations are capital-intensive, and agriculture has historically been dominated by small businesses with low profitability and limited access to capital. Several trends offer prom - ise in overcoming such obstacles, however. For one, consolidation in agriculture will boost efficiency, with fewer farmers and ranchers managing larger fields. In addition, more widespread use of crop insur - ance is an example of a financial innovation that could provide farm - ers and ranchers with more finan - cial security. Agricultural insurance lowers risks as well as improving access to credit. At present, in higher-income counties, 1.99% of agricultural GDP is spent on agri - cultural insurance, but that falls to 0.29% in upper-middle-income countries, 0.16% in lower-middle-income countries, and 0.01% in low-income countries. /three.superior/one.superior Some scientists and researchers also note that economic and envi - ronmental changes, such as changes in weather patterns and crop pests and diseases, could undermine past patterns of productivity growth. This is a particular concern in low-income countries, where the demand for food is growing the fastest. Low levels of public-sector R&D invest - ment, which is best suited to creating solutions to these kinds of problems, could slow productivity improve - ments and put these countries at risk. Conclusions: Feeding the World The public sector needs to reverse the negative trend in R&D spending growth in many high-income coun - tries, and increase R&D spending in low-income countries\u2014mak - ing investments in basic scientific research in agriculture and support - ing technologies. But governments can also foster an attractive envi - ronment for venture capital funds and corporate ventures focusing on agricultural innovation, and help ensure that the investments being THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 3: The Role of Private-Sector R&D in Agricultural Innovation94 made by the private sector can make a greater impact, by taking the fol - lowing steps: Support agricultural extension efforts to disseminate knowl - edge about new technologies and techniques and to demonstrate their business case. Publicly funded agricultural extension has been a key historical link between agricultural R&D and farmers and ranchers in high-income countries. Governments and supra-national organizations should prioritize implementing such programmes in low-income countries. Streamline regulation to reduce lag times, provide targeted tax relief to enhance farmers' incomes and financial secu - rity, and offer preferential access to land and market support for promising agricultural tech - niques and technologies. Create public-private partner - ships, which governments can use to leverage public-sector investment, enhance private-sector involvement in agricul - ture infrastructure, and fill gaps in the delivery and adoption of innovation by public- and pri - vate-sector entities acting inde - pendently. /three.superior/two.superior Maintain and expand regional and international trade in agri - culture outputs. Many of the gains in productivity in recent decades have been enabled by globalization and the rise of extended agricultural value chains. The rise of commercial R&D in agriculture underway today\u2014and the resulting innovations in improv - ing yields, asset productivity, and sustainability\u2014provide the means for meeting the food needs of the world's growing population by 2050. But to reach that goal, both the pub - lic and private sectors will need to keep the R&D pipeline flowing and make investments and commitments to ensure that innovative technolo - gies and techniques are widely and rapidly adopted by countries across the income spectrum.

The remaining lands are increasingly lost to urban - ization or need to be preserved for habitat conservation, biodiversity, and climate buffers. /two.superior Moreover, the unsustainable overuse of freshwater resources from irrigation is making less water available for future crops, and food security is being affected by increased risk from climate change and an uncertain geopoliti - cal landscape. Concerns with diminishing resources and expanding populations are exacerbated by changing diets in many developing countries (which are now using more animal-based protein and fresh produce). This will ultimately require higher global production levels of the primary source of protein, carbohydrates, and nutrients: crops. An effective strategy for gaining enhanced agri - cultural production levels should focus on sustainable improvements in five major areas: further optimization of resources in currently productive agricul - tural regions; intensification of production in areas that have good basic agricultural resources but are currently low-producing (e.g., West Africa and Southeast Europe); /three.superior expansion of local and con - trolled environment production systems such as urban farms, greenhouses, and indoor grow - ing systems that provide high-value crops to local and regional markets; improved crop and animal genetics that facilitate higher production levels and result in less susceptibility to yield-depressing agents such as diseases and insects; and greater efficiencies and less waste in the food supply chain. Digital agricultureDigital data will be getting collected at a rate of 40 zettabytes (ZB\u2014the equivalent of 40 trillion gigabytes, or GB) per year by 2020. Increased storage and computational capacity, coupled with high-resolution envi - ronmental and remotely sensed data, have created unprecedented oppor - tunities for data-driven discovery in agriculture and food systems. Many agricultural improvements can be facilitated by these digital innovations. This chapter defines 'digital agriculture' as the deployment of computational and information technologies in farming, which will play a key role in achieving innova - tion goals. It is a new direction for 'precision agriculture', a more estab - lished concept that is historically aimed at crop production. Digital agriculture offers new opportunities through the ubiquitous availability of highly interconnected and data-intensive computational technolo - gies as part of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution. It can be applied to all aspects of agricultural production systems, and it reflects a shift from generalized management of farm resources towards highly optimized, individualized, real-time, hyper-connected and data-driven management. For example, instead of treating all farm fields uniformly, small field zones may each receive their own highly opti - mized management prescriptions; animals may be monitored and managed individually rather than as a whole herd. The desired outcomes of digital agriculture are more pro - ductive, profitable, and sustainable systems. Digital agriculture can leverage the smart use of data and communi - cation to achieve system optimiza - tion. The tools that enable digital agriculture are multiple and varied, and include cross-cutting technolo - gies such as computational decision and analytics tools, the cloud, sen - sors, robots, and digital communi - cation tools (Table/uni00A01). In addition, field-based activities are enabled THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 4: Innovation in Agriculture and Food Systems in the Digital Age98 by geo-locationing technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), geographical information systems, yield monitors, precision soil sampling, proximal and remote spectroscopic sensing, unmanned aerial vehicles, auto-steered and guided equipment and variable rate technologies. Animal-focused technologies include radio fre - quency identification (RFID chips) and automated (robotic) milk - ing and feeding systems, among others. Controlled-environment agriculture (greenhouses, indoor farms, etc.) is also increasingly enabled by digital technologies such as sensors and robots. Digital agriculture can poten - tially accumulate large amounts of data, and analytical capabilities that Table 1: Enabling technologies for digital agriculture Production environment Type of technology Purpose and benefits Cross-cutting technologiesComputational decision tools Use data to develop recommendations for management and optimize multitudes of farm tasks The cloud Provide ecient, inexpensive, and centralized data storage, computation, and com-munication to support farm management Sensors Gather information on the functioning of equipment and farm resources to support management decisions Robots Implement tasks with eciency and minimal human labour Digital communication tools (mobile, broad-band, LPWAN)Allow frequent, real-time communication between farm resources, workers, managers, and computational resources in support of management Field Geo-locationing (GPS, RTK) Provide precise location of farm resources (eld equipment, animals, etc.), often com-bined with measurements (yield, etc.), or used to steer equipment to locations Geographic information systems Use computerized mapping to aid inventory management and to make geographical crop input prescriptions (fertilizer, etc.) Yield monitors Employ sensors and GPS on harvesters to continually measure harvest rate and make yield maps that allow for identication of local yield variability Precision soil sampling Sample soil at high spatial resolution (in zones) to detect and manage fertility patterns in elds Unmanned aerial systems (UAS, or drones) Use small, readily deployed remote-control aerial vehicles to monitor farm resources using imaging UAS Spectral reflectance sensing (proximal and remote)Measure light reflectance of soil or crop using satellite, airplane, or UAS, imaging, or eld equipment-mounted sensors, to make determinations on soil patterns, crop, or animal performance, or on nutrient/pest problems Auto-steering and guidance Reduce labour or fatigue with self-driving technology for farm equipment (including robots); can also precisely guide equipment in elds to enable highly accurate crop input placement and management Variable rate technology Allow continuous adjustment of application rates to precisely match localized crop needs in eld areas with eld applicators for crop inputs (chemicals, seed, etc.) On-board computers Collect and process eld data with specialized computer hardware and software on tractors, harvesters, etc., often connected to sensors or controllers LivestockRadio frequency ID Transmit identity data with tags attached to production units (mostly animals) that allow data collection on performance as well as individualized management Automated milking, feeding, and monitoring systemsPerform milking or feeding operations automatically with robotic systems, often combined with sensors that collect basic biometric data on animals, thereby reducing labour needs and facilitating individualized animal management Note: GPS = global positioning system; LPWAN positioning system.99 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 4: Innovation in Agriculture and Food Systems in the Digital Agefacilitate the effective employment of these data are key implementa - tion factors. The development of computational tools that address system dynamics and optimization are similarly critical; they require a deep understanding of the biologi - cal, physical, chemical, and socio - economic processes that together make agricultural production pos - sible. Therefore digital agriculture technologies require talent in sci - ence and entrepreneurship. Production efficiencies can be gained both from the integration of data associated with multiple technologies and from the real-time transfer of data between field equipment, barn, office, and the cloud. The recent surge in digital agriculture technologies has led to the accumulation of large amounts of data. High-resolution soil data, site-specific weather maps, aerial imagery, nutrient applications, and milking and animal health records are being continuously generated by farms. Much of that information can be sent via broadband or mobile connections to cloud-based services, but inadequate telematics (the long-distance transfer of digital informa - tion) often constrains the potential benefits from these technologies. In addition, farmers and research - ers are finding it difficult to man - age, interpret, or make use of their data as a result of their volume and complexity. Growth in hybrid fields such as computational agriculture, computational sustainability, and data science that aim to use farm data are partial responses to these needs. In the end, agriculture will fol - low other industrial sectors in that the benefits from digital technolo - gies will materialize and become a source of increased production efficiencies once ubiquitously avail - able data are effectively employed. In a global economic environment, a nation's agricultural competiveness and ability to sustain critical natural resources will be strongly tied to its ability to innovate in these aspects of the production system. The question is not whether the global agricul - tural industry should adopt digital technologies, but how this adoption process can occur in an environment that encourages it to fully capitalize on the potential production gains. Types of innovation At the farm enterprise level, differ - ent types of technology investments may be distinguished: 1. Capital investments that pro - mote efficiencies (computer hardware/software, robotic sys - tems, variable-rate technolo - gy, sensors, high-precision GPS, etc.). These are invariably offered by established equipment com - panies that have made significant technology investments and typ - ically compete in global markets. 2. Service investments that pro - vide actionable information (re - mote sensing, cloud-based deci - sion models, etc.). These services are offered by companies ranging from global corporations to small tech companies. 3. Farm knowledge and human capital investments that involve the development of highly lo - calized actionable knowledge for a specific farm, herd, or crop-growing environment (opti - mized seeding, nutrient and pest management, animal feeding, etc.). These investments involve the collection of data\u2014often from investments discussed un - der (1) and (2)\u2014that are analysed to generate farm-specific rec - ommendations. These knowl - edge investments are made at the local level, with consultants working in partnership with farm managers. The above investments each require somewhat different sup - port infrastructures. Large capital investments not only require edu - cated farmers to use the equipment effectively, but also need dealership networks with competent staff and operational farm credit systems. Digital services such as remote sens - ing and decision models are highly scalable technologies that generally do not involve upfront financial or knowledge investments on the part of farm owners or managers, but are generally pay-as-you-go arrangements. However, in order to effectively incorporate digital tech - nologies, a farm-specific knowledge base that involves a more sustained commitment to technology invest - ments and analytics is still required, and it demands both educated farmers and local consultants who are trained in digital agriculture technologies. Where does innovation in digital agriculture occur?Digital agriculture innovation is both knowledge- and skills-inten - sive because agricultural production systems are complex and multifac - eted and solutions require knowl - edge ranging from broad to specific. For example, tools that optimize nitrogen dynamics (see below) need to consider soil, weather, and crop-related processes that all have interacting physical, biological, and chemical components. These in turn need to be considered in the context of a wide diversity of prac - tices, production environments, and socioeconomic conditions on farms. Solutions are often more complex and less scalable than optimization processes in manufacturing indus - tries or communications. This is THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 4: Innovation in Agriculture and Food Systems in the Digital Age100 arguably the primary reason why digital innovation in agriculture has been relatively slow and the leading global digital technology compa - nies have made few inroads into agriculture. Currently most digital innova - tions in agriculture are led by 'Big Ag' companies, smaller innovative agricultural technology (ag-tech) companies, and top agricultural universities. Where are they located? Corporate innovation in digital agriculture technologies is mostly associated with a few global-scale companies that offer durable (farm equipment) and consumable (seed, chemicals, etc.) goods and services. These industries have in recent years consolidated to the point where most major farm purchases are controlled by a small number of companies in a highly competitive global market. These corporate leaders are pri - marily headquartered in Northern America and Western Europe and increasingly differentiate themselves in the marketplace by their ability to innovate with digital technolo - gies. Yet smaller companies, typi - cally based in the same countries, also offer innovative technology solutions. University innovations are typically associated with the inter - nationally prominent agricultural institutions in developed countries (mostly in Northern America and Western Europe). A constraint on university-based innovation in many developing countries is the common institutional separation of agriculture from other relevant dis - ciplines\u2014basic sciences, engineer - ing, and medicine\u2014that is, separate agricultural universities cultivate intellectual isolationism at a time when collaboration with other disci - plines is critical for innovation. Not unrelated, agricultural universities in developing countries also gener - ally do not attract the most talented students and professors because the profession is considered less presti - gious and offers lower remuneration. In all, the primary innovations in digital agriculture occur in a limited set of countries in part because of structural, institutional, and eco - nomic barriers. Issues with digital agriculture adoption A recent report based on surveys and literature analyses identified a number of concerns and opportu - nities associated with the penetra - tion of advanced technologies into agriculture. Factors related to infra - structure (e.g., reliable mobile data access), research and development, technical information, and relevant educational resources were all cited in that report as important factors in a recent survey of farmers in New York State, United States of America (USA). Some of those factors are described below. Farm size: Large farms tend to engage in digital agriculture more readily because capital investments provide earlier returns on invest - ment as a result of scale efficiencies, but the technology competence of farmers is also an important adop - tion factor. /one.superior Some digital agricul - ture technologies are attractive to medium and small farms because they are less scale-dependent or are highly compelling for a specific pro - duction environment. For example, organic vegetable growers can ben - efit greatly from precision planting and equipment guidance systems because they rely on mechanical weed cultivation that risks crop damage if done without precision technologies. Similarly, medium-size farms may be attracted to robotic milking and feeding systems or automated greenhouses because of farm labour shortages. Data: As farmers adopt digi - tal agriculture technologies they accumulate large amounts of data, increasingly through cloud-based services. They are concerned with data privacy and ownership issues because legal concerns around agricultural data are unresolved at this time. Farmers are generally more comfortable sharing data with trusted partners such as universities and local cooperatives than with large companies that may repurpose the data for corporate interests. /one.superior/one.superior Farm data are generally not protected in current statutes, but nonprofit ini - tiatives (e.g., Ag Data Transparency) offer third-party certification on data ownership and privacy issues. /one.superior/two.superior A second, and related, data issue revolves around availability. As data are increasingly accumu - lated by large corporate entities, concerns arise about their avail - ability for aggregated analytics and the development of next-generation management recommendations. Public-sector and scientific commu - nities do not have universal access to valuable private-sector data, and ventures for community data sharing infrastructure are generally absent in agricultural and economics realms. A third issue is government agency attitudes towards agricultural research data and associated priority areas. Results of a recent survey of agricultural researchers suggest that widespread data management prac - tices fall short of generally accepted best practices. /one.superior/three.superior In this context, leg - islative proposals calling for greater data sharing among public-sector agencies have been put forward, /one.superior but, so far, with very little effect. /one.superior Public-private partnerships such as Socrata, CyVerse, and the Health Data Consortium have emerged to 101 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 4: Innovation in Agriculture and Food Systems in the Digital Agecoordinate and increase data shar - ing and access, which are important steps for data gathered under public auspices. Analytics and management gap: Production environments (soil, climate, crops, animals, etc.) vary greatly in agriculture. The effective employment of digital technologies therefore requires locally appro - priate analytics and management responses. In general, the engineer - ing innovations by means of sensors, robotics, and software are rapidly advancing, but the ability to make the technology smart and applicable to local production environments lags behind. Education and research gaps: The engagement of digital agricul - ture requires knowledgeable and skilled farm managers and labourers, as well as a cadre of well-educated consultants and service providers. Most educational institutions are inadequate in offering such instruc - tion, and professional talent tends to favour urban over rural living. In addition, few institutions have the capacity or resources to answer the research questions that advanced farmers ask. Connectivity and digital divide: Agriculture by its very nature is mostly conducted in rural areas that are poorly connected, even in the most developed coun - tries. The industry is therefore highly impacted by the so-called digital divide. This current state of inadequate connectivity limits the full deployment of digital agri - culture technologies in most rural areas, including broadband access for information communication; mobile (cellular) coverage and data transmission speeds for uploading and downloading data from field equipment or remote farm build - ings; universal access to precision equipment guidance technology that requires reliable relay stations and mobile connections; and low-power wide-area networks that offer opportunities for the widespread use of sensor technology and equipment communications. Advanced con - nectivity investments in rural areas are generally expensive because of low customer density and are often not regarded as economically justi - fied by communications companies. Business development and employment: Many farmers and ag-professionals agree that digi - tal agriculture has a bright future, offers good business and employ - ment opportunities, and will result in environmental benefits and efficiencies. /one.superior But it may also profoundly impact businesses and employment in rural areas around the globe. In high-wage countries, farmers are eager to employ auto - mation and digital technologies to reduce challenges with their farm labour force\u2014which often depends on migrant workers and therefore poses legal and management chal - lenges. Digital technologies will also facilitate those management farm enterprises that are larger than would otherwise be possible, and may intensify the global trend of farm consolidation. In developing countries where wages are lower and farms generally smaller, digital tech - nologies will help advance improved management practices and better access to markets (e.g., through mobile technologies), but will also impact employment opportunities in rural areas. Examples of digital agriculture technology implementationImplementing digital agriculture technology can take different forms. Three of these are considered below.Cloud-based nitrogen advisorsAgriculture includes some 'wicked problems', including the use of nitro - gen fertilizer that is needed to grow many of the world's crops at high production levels. The widespread adoption of nitrogen fertilizer use after World War II and especially during the Green Revolution has greatly enhanced food production and reduced malnutrition. But it has also led to serious environ - mental concerns, including high energy use, greenhouse gas emis - sions (through nitrous oxide), and water quality degradation. Notably many of the world's estuaries (Gulf of Mexico, Baltic Sea, etc.) experi - ence low oxygen levels (hypoxia) from nitrogen inflows, which in turn result in the high mortality of critical fish species. These concerns are in large part related to excessive nitrogen use, where more fertilizer is applied than is needed for the crop. This appears wasteful, but where farmers are uncertain about the 'right' amount of fertilizer needed they actually respond in an economically rational manner to the realities of their pro - duction environments, avoiding the high risk of under-nourishing their crops and incurring yield losses. Most of the uncertainties are asso - ciated with (1) variable production environments (soil, crop, manage - ment), and (2) weather variability. Recent technological develop - ments have proven that data and model computations can address these uncertainties and offer more reliable nitrogen management advice to farmers through cloud-based services. This technology offers real-time nitrogen fertilizer advice, based on weather condi - tions, that is specific to field zones and thereby allows farmers to more precisely match nutrient additions THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 4: Innovation in Agriculture and Food Systems in the Digital Age102 with crop needs (Figure/uni00A01). In on- farm field evaluations, this technol - ogy has proven to offer a win-win opportunity: it increases farmers' profits while reducing negative environmental impacts. /one.superior Similar technologies can be employed for irrigation and pest management, among others. Some of the main advantages of employing such cloud-based services are: the high scalability such services provide allows the technology to be rapidly employed in many growing environments, employment at scale allows for dramatic reductions in per-unit (hectare) expense and can drive down adoption costs, and cloud-based and mobile commu - nications allow for continuous access and real-time monitoring of the status of farm resources.The next phase of technology deployment will likely be the inte - gration of highly computational, data-intensive tools with low-cost field sensor technologies offer - ing management advice based on ensemble technologies. Precision farming services in Bulgaria Prior to Bulgaria's political and eco - nomic reforms of 1989, the country's agriculture was relatively efficient by Eastern European standards, and included large cooperative farms and highly consolidated production units (fields and livestock facilities). After the reforms, Bulgaria liqui - dated many of the former collec - tive farms, and the associated land privatization resulted in a subdivi - sion of fields into smaller plots with a great number of heirs\u2014that is, large fields are often owned by multiple absentee landowners (82% of hold - ings are comprised of fewer than two hectares). /one.superior But through lease agreements with many individual landowners, private farmers can still cultivate the vast majority of the land through large-scale agriculture, with wheat, sunflower, and maize as primary crops. Furthermore, since its European Union accession in 2007, the EU Common Agricultural Policy invested around US$4 billion in Bulgaria's agriculture, much of it through direct payments intended to support farms, rural employment, good management practices, and stable food supplies. These developments have resulted in viable large-scale farming in Bulgaria, and also created excep - tional opportunities for the adoption of precision farming methods. Many farmers are purchasing advanced field equipment, and regional tech - nical service providers are offering associated products and services. For example, NIK is a company that works with farmers to implement modern precision technologies in Figure 1: Real-time nitrogen field advice through a cloud service Source: Adapt-N.com.103 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 4: Innovation in Agriculture and Food Systems in the Digital AgeBulgaria. /one.superior These technologies are offered through (1) strategic partner - ships with Northern American and European technology leaders that allow for capital and service invest - ments (farm management software, mapping and navigation hardware and software, precision application equipment, auto-steering and guid - ance systems, weather and satellite monitoring, irrigation equipment, etc.), and (2) skilled field profes - sionals who implement technologies on farms and help develop local knowledge. In summary, the rapid adoption of digital farming technol - ogy in Bulgaria can be attributed to a combination of: large-scale production units that are a result of land reforms under socialist governments prior to 1989, a workable land lease system that allows private farmers to manage large land tracks with multitudes of small land owners, farm payments from the Euro - pean Union, and strategic partnerships with lead - ing technology providers. Remote sensing and financial risk management to alleviate povertyThe USA has long had major govern - ment programmes in place to facili - tate risk management for farmers in various forms. Today the bulk of that funding is allocated to risk manage - ment and insurance programmes with great success. However, uptake has been slower in the developing world. This is in part the result of the fact that the programmes are not as well funded in developing coun - tries; furthermore, verifying yields and losses is much more difficult in remote areas of the developing world, despite the fact that those agricultural producers face risk all the same. Several programmes have emerged recently to address these issues using index-based insurance schemes. /two.superior Initially, pilot programmes in the developing country context relied heavily on station-level weather data. However, these data are often sparse and are themselves difficult to verify. In recent years there has been a movement towards a different solu - tion: using remotely sensed data to determine losses. The Index Based Livestock Insurance programme (IBLI) in Kenya and Ethiopia was one of the earlier adopters of this approach. /two.superior/one.superior As newer remote sens - ing platforms come online, as well as lower-cost custom options (e.g., nano-satellites, unmanned aerial systems, etc.), there will likely be a large movement towards designing the risk management programmes of the future around these sensing tech - nologies to indicate both when losses occur and the extent of those losses. Conclusions The penetration of advanced digital technologies into the agricultural industry is progressing rapidly in advanced economies, and is increas - ingly impacting developing coun - tries. Because of several unique characteristics of agriculture (involv - ing its highly localized and variable resources, poor connectedness in rural areas, education and research gaps, support businesses, and global players), digital agriculture requires special consideration from govern - ments and industry leaders. This will be well worth the effort because it is a primary path towards a sustainable food supply.Notes 1 UN DESA, 2015. 2 Montgomery, 2007. 3 Foley, 2011. 4 Tien, 2013; Song et al., 2016. 5 Woodard, 2016a. 6 Schwab, 2016. 7 van Es et al., 2016. 8 Woodard, 2016a, 2016b. 9 van Es et al., 2016. 10 Castle et al., 2015. 11 Castle et al., 2015. 12 Further information about Ag Data Transparency is available at http://www. fb.org/ag-data. 13 Fernandez et al., 2016. 14 Murray, 2015. 15 Woodard, 2016a. 16 van Es et al., 2016. 17 Sela et al., 2016; Sela et al. 2017. 18 European Commission, 2015. 19 More information about NIK is available at http://www.nik.bg/en. 20 Woodard et al., 2016. 21 Woodard et al., 2016.

The impact of technology in unlocking value for the people at the bottom of the pyramid and improving access to critical services is well demonstrated in the healthcare sector in India, as observed in the case of mobile technology-enabled tele - medicine and low-cost devices that can address health conditions such as anaemia in a large section of the population. Technology has powered Indian agriculture time and again by helping overcome productivity stagnation, strengthening market linkages, and enhancing farm man - agement. In the past, Indian agri - culture faced a formidable challenge to grow more food, but it faces an even more difficult challenge today and for the future: to grow more sustainably and inclusively. Major challenges confronting Indian agri - culture include declining total pro - ductivity, diminishing and degrading natural resources, a rapidly growing demand for food (not just for quantity but also for quality), stagnating farm incomes, fragmented land holdings, and unprecedented climate change. It has been established that technol - ogy adoption modernizes farmers' production practices and leads to uniform annual returns for farm - ers, reduced risk of crop failure, and increased yields. /two.superior Direct applications of digital technology include remote sensing (via satellites), geographic informa - tion systems, crop and soil health monitoring, and livestock and farm management, among other applica - tions. At the pre-harvest stage, digital technology can recommend crop and input selection and assist in obtaining credit and insurance. At the on-farm stage, there is need for weather advi - sories and disease- and pest-related assistance; and at the post-harvest stage, real-time data on both domestic and export markets are needed. The growth of competitive markets and demand for consistent food quality is making the adoption of such tech-based solutions imperative for the Indian farmer. Much of the scope for application and innovation remains to be exploited. The application of digital technology in agriculture has been instrumental in promoting data generation as well as the advanced analytics that allow farmers to make smart decisions about farming and to benefit from an economical use of inputs and labour. Technology: A key driver for sustainable agricultureIndia is one of the leading contribu - tors to the global food basket. The country's food grain production stood at 252.23 million tonnes in 2015-16, and has a record production of 271.98 million tonnes in 2016-17. /three.superior India's horticulture output\u2014comprising fruits and vegetables, floriculture, honey, plantation crops, medicinal plants, and spices\u2014was around 283.4 million tonnes in 2015-16, surpass - ing food grains and making India the second largest fruit and vegetable producer in the world. India is also the world's largest producer of milk (155.5 million tonnes in 2015-16) and second largest producer of sugar, and the leading country in coconut pro - duction per government estimates. In 2016-17, after two successive years of sub-par monsoons, the growth of agriculture and allied sectors in India improved significantly (Figure 1). This growth is being primarily driven by the livestock and fisheries sectors, contributing to the diversification of the production basket towards high-value foods. Although fluctuating, the agricultural growth rate over the years reflects the increasing resilience of the sector to natural shocks and market volatility, an increase that also demonstrates the impact of favour - able investments, technology up-take, and strategic policy efforts. India's population has nearly dou - bled since the 1970s; it is currently estimated at over 1.2 billion and is THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 5: Digital Technologies Transforming Indian Agriculture106 growing at 1.4% annually, putting pressure on natural resources such as land and water to produce enough food. Moreover, with rising incomes, a structural change in the dietary pat - terns of an average Indian is diversi - fying the country's food demand to include high-value foods. According to the National Sample Survey esti - mates for 2011-12, although cereals account for 26% (20%) of the total food consumption expenditure in rural (urban) India, high-value foods (milk, meat, eggs, fish, fruits, and vegetables) account for 42% (46%) in rural (urban) India. Sustaining food security in India holds a larger implication for global markets. India's agricultural export value growth rate was the highest in the world for the decade ending 2013 (Figure/uni00A02), at 21.3%\u2014more than the average annual percent increase in agricultural export value in coun - tries such as Indonesia (17.6%), Brazil (14.9%), and China (11.8%). To respond successfully to the growing food demand both domesti - cally and globally, India will have to produce more. Yields of major crops are low in India compared with those in other countries. For instance, the rice yield in India is 2.6 tonnes per hectare\u2014far lower than the 4.7 in China, 3.7 in Brazil, 5.9 in the United States of America (USA), or 9.5 in Australia; that of wheat is 3.0 tonnes per hectare in India, 5.3 in China, and 3.1 in the USA; and the maize and soybean yields are 2.5 and 0.75 tonnes per hectare in India compared with 5.9 and 1.8 tonnes, respectively, in China. Leveraging technology to achieve higher and sustainable agricultural growth is not novel for farmers and other relevant stakeholders in India. Noteworthy are the green revolu - tion (1966-67), the white revolution (1970-96), and the gene revolution (in cotton) in early 2000. The green revolution, which relied on extensive cultivation of high-yielding varieties of wheat, led to a fivefold increase in production and, as a result, also led to rising farmers' incomes. The three decades from 1973 to 1999 can be regarded as the highlight in the timeline of agriculture productivity in India, when the food grain produc - tion nearly doubled. It is interesting to note that the increase in production was more a result of an increase in the yield rather than an expansion of cul - tivated area. Similarly, the white rev - olution led to record milk production in India and enabled higher returns for dairy farmers. It established a national milk grid and introduced the crossbreeding of indigenous cows with high-milk-yielding European breeds, pasteurization of milk for long-duration storage, and refriger - ated transport systems to distribute milk across the country. During the same period, agriculture machines were introduced on Indian farms; these primarily consisted of tractors and seed drills to improve produc - tivity per unit of land and water. Following the successful adoption of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton, India's cotton production increased from 14.0 million bales in 2000-01 to 38.6 million bales in 2014-15; it is estimated to be 35.1 million bales in 2016-17. India became the largest cotton producer in the world, accounting for 26% of the global production. Yield levels also increased from 278 kilograms (kg) per hectare to 511 kg per hectare to 568 kg per hectare during the above periods. /one.superior In 2015, India continued to have the largest area being cultivated with Bt cotton in the world\u201411.6 million hectares sowed by 7.7 mil - lion small farmers and an adoption rate of 95%. According to estimates, India enhanced farm income from Bt cotton by US$18.3 billion between 2002 and 2014 and US$1.6 billion in 2014./one.superior/one.superior In the wake of concerns that intensive farming adversely impacts environmental balance, India will need to adopt sustainable farming practices that include employing efficient irrigation methods with a -1012345 2016-17c 2015-16b 2014-15b 2013-14a 2012-13aFigure 1: Growth rate of gross value added in agriculture and allied sectors, 2011-12 base prices Source: Government of India, 2017b; 2017c.

Adopting advanced technology has helped small countries, including the Netherlands and Israel. Notably, these countries, have augmented the production of high-value crops through enormous productivity breakthroughs and, even more importantly, by ensuring the optimal utilization of resources and maintaining the environmental balance. Currently technologies that cater to the optimal utilization of resources (particularly those that are linked to natural resource availability and envi - ronmental impact), effective market linkages for improved service deliv - ery, and the discovery of the highest price possible as observed in the case of India through the country's elec - tronic National Agricultural Market (e-NAM)\u2014a technology-driven unified market platform\u2014have a brighter future in India. The success of technology adoption lies in cus - tomizing to address particular chal - lenges at the local level, supporting institutions and policies to create an enabling ecosystem, and harnessing the potential of these technologies to scale and commercialize within a defined time period. An emerging ecosystem of digital technologies in Indian agriculture: The rise of start-ups and young entrepreneurial firmsThe agriculture sector has attracted large conglomerates, leading IT companies, investors, and young innovators in India; the ecosystem for technology and digital solutions is expanding at an impressive pace. The global market for precision agricul - ture is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 13.09% to reach a mar - ket size of over US$6.34 billion by 2022. /one.superior/two.superior Although Northern America will maintain its dominance in the sector, the fastest growth is projected for India and China, which are expected to see an annual growth rate of 18.29% until 2022. /one.superior/three.superior The agro-tech start-up ecosys - tem in India has also been receiving renewed interest from investors, and an estimated 34 ventures received US$295 million in investments in 2016 in the country\u2014the highest investment amount recorded in India in the past three years. /one.superior In Asia, China had 10 deals totalling US$427 mil - lion, while 53 Indian start-ups raised US$313 million and four Japanese companies raised US$8.9 million. The most active geographies\u2014those countries with the highest number of agriculture start-ups\u2014remained consistent year-over-year, with the USA, India, Canada, the United Kingdom, Israel, and France remain - ing the top six by number of deals. /one.superiorAmong the prominent ventures backed by large conglomerates in India is ITC's e-Choupal, a com - prehensive digital knowledge hub for farmers, which has 6,100 instal - lations covering over 35,000 villages and serving over 4 million farmers. /one.superior Launched in 2000, the first-of-its-kind initiative not only benefited the farmers doing business through their network, but this model also led to a ripple effect on the public sector-managed food grain management systems that resulted in an upgrade. Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), one of India's leading producers of tractors and farm equipment, is inno - vating alongside expanding its core business. M&M's Trringo, a mobile-based app enabling farmers to rent tractors, is a unique example of lever - aging technology to help farmers use machinery without having to make the large investment (US$7,500) of buying tractors. /one.superior Through Trringo, 0510152025Other Processed F&V 2015-16 2014-15 2013-14 n Horticulture & fresh fruits & vegetables n Processed fruits & vegetables n Animal products n Cereals n Other processed foods Figure 2: Key agricultural exports from India, US$ billions Source: APEDA 2017 , statistical data on agricultural exports, available at http://agriexchange.apeda.gov.in/indexp/exportstatement.aspx. US$, billionsTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 5: Digital Technologies Transforming Indian Agriculture108 the farmers benefit from available lat - est machines, freeing labour as well as raising productivity and product quality. In addition, the farmers are required to pay only for the services they use without locking any money in as capital. This is particularly revo - lutionary in a country such as India, where agriculture is characterized by smallholders (who operate on less than 2 hectares of land) and who are often resource poor and lack access to formal channels of credit. The 'uber - ization' of tractors and farm machines (as some have coined it\u2014a concept similar to uber taxis, which is a plat - form aggregating demand and supply of taxi services and connecting both through a mobile app) has the poten - tial to fast-track farm mechanization and take it to regions within India where farm sizes are really small, yet abundant in water and exhibit suit - able soil and climate conditions that could produce much more than their current output. In another example, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's leading IT firm, offers personalized advisory services in voice and visual formats using communication devices such as mobile phones through its mKRISHI platform. The grow - ing penetration of mobile phones in rural regions of India is driving the development of several mobile-based applications by government departments, entrepreneurs, and the private sector. /one.superior The rural subscriber base in India for mobile services has been growing at steady pace, reach - ing approximately 342 million sub - scribers in 2012-13, 378 million in 2013-14, and 414 million at the end of 2014-15. /one.superior With easier access to mobile phones, farmers can connect with traders and other farmers. Small farmers can also utilize their mobile phones to seek information on input availability or market prices, thereby reducing costs\u2014both because they do not have spend the time needed to get into town to find this infor - mation, and because it allows them to get competing prices and choose the best one. Other benefits that have been recorded are improved access to information about selecting seed varieties appropriate to a particular farm; and how to identify best cul - tivation practices, protect from weather-related damage, and get a better handle on plant diseases. /two.superior Digital technology in Indian agriculture is not about big box solu - tions only. A large number of young entrepreneurs have ventured into this sector to tackle specific challenges. The technology thrust of these ventures has been on reducing the time duration of crop cycles, saving on water and energy, reducing the usage of agro-chemicals, automat - ing for efficient farm management, strengthening farmer market link - ages, and improving cold chain logis - tics for higher value addition. Examples of these leading start- ups include Stellapps Technologies, which is providing dairy farm opti - mization and monitoring services with a special focus on small- and medium-herd farms. Their applica - tions and tools leverage the Internet of Things, big data, the cloud, mobility, and data analytics to improve milk production, milk pro - curement, and the cold chain, and to boost animal insurance and farmer payments. /two.superior/one.superior Ekgaon Technologies, an IT-based network integrator, offers a range of services to farm - ers, rural businesses, and women. The ekgaon OneVillageOneWorld Network is leveraging mobile com - munication technology to encour - age the sustainable development of women-self-help-groups (SHGs) and small farmers across India. The platform has over 900,000 women and 300,000 farmers spread across villages in India. /two.superior/two.superiorDrones and robotics are also increasingly used in Indian agricul - ture, although the ventures in this area are still budding and there is a long way to go before these tech - nologies are scaled up in any major way. Agnext, an Indian start-up, has developed drones among other digi - tal technologies with the objective of creating an integrated hyperlocal farm data collection and crop analyt - ics platform. A number of new start-ups are developing solutions to tackle climate change challenges. For example, Skymet Weather Services is involved in monitoring and predicting weather and providing agri-risk solutions. /two.superior/three.superior Skymet can measure and predict yield at the village level for any crop with a high level of accuracy and can also accurately forecast the weather in the short, medium, and long term. Ecozen Solutions has developed state-of-the-art solar-powered products for irrigation and cold storage, with the aim of catering to smallholder farms and regions with limited or no elec - tricity. /two.superior Barrix Agro Sciences offers eco-friendly crop protection meth - ods that have the potential to mini - mize a significant proportion of the damage caused by pests and diseases without overdosing crops and plants with chemicals, thus preventing soil and water contamination. /two.superior There are also ventures that started out as agri-tech start-ups in India but, owing to their innova - tive solutions, are now operating as medium-scale businesses. EM3 AgriServices, founded in 2014, has quickly risen to become a pioneer in the farming-as-a-service (FaaS) model. EM3's Samadhan techno kheti centres offer machines needed to per - form all critical farm operations on a pay-for-use basis. /two.superior At their centres, the organization employs agri-pro - fessionals who are well versed in the agronomy of the target area. Another 109 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 5: Digital Technologies Transforming Indian Agriculturesuch noteworthy venture, eKutir Global, offers an online and mobile-based platform to connect marginal farmers with stakeholders across the value chain such as soil-testing labs, suppliers of seeds and fertilizers, banks, exporters, food-processing units, and branded retailers. Agri Suite by eKutir offers a one-stop solution for all the needs of a farmer; their field partners also train farmers to use their application. /two.superior Over time, services that go beyond merely sell - ing a product but that also provide training about how to use, maintain, and repair that product, as well as supplementary components such as advisory and marketing services, have become an increasingly impor - tant and integral part of any product offering. Technology is playing an important role in bringing these ele - ments together. Despite the tremendous gains achieved, the long-term impact of the earlier technology revolutions was limited to selected agricultural pockets in the country, and further efforts to advance these revolutions lost momentum over time. In the context of start-ups, the common barriers to commercialization and the scaling up of technology are related to access to finance, which is in turn related to operational finance, fund - ing/capital deficiencies, and cash flow management; gaps in technology infrastructure; and issues concerned with cyber security. Furthermore, limited access to farmer networks for effective piloting of the products is seen to impede the commercializa - tion plans of start-ups. For innovation and entrepreneurship to be effective in transforming agriculture in India, it will be important to address these issues and create an enabling envi - ronment in which they can grow and flourish. To a large extent, the effort towards this transformation has been catalysed by the government's special programme on start-ups, Startup India. /two.superior Moreover, large companies with knowledge about the diversity of Indian agriculture could also sup - port these start-ups by mentoring, which would help them pilot and scale up their activities for potential commercialization. Policy and institutions: Key enablers for scaling up digital technologies in IndiaIndia's present public policy with regard to agriculture is focused on encouraging innovation and entre - preneurship, and out-of-box think - ing towards achieving sustainable higher growth and income security in the farm sector. Because more than 50% of the working population is in agriculture and farm size is shrink - ing, the per capita output is small. Thus it is true and desirable that people move out of agriculture and bring the current percentage of the workforce employed in agriculture from 54.6 % down many fold. New forms of engagement have emerged in this sector that could make agri - culture more remunerative and exciting for the new generation. The government\u2014through its flagship programme Startup India, launched in 2016\u2014aims to boost start-ups across sectors by providing hand - holding services, access to funding, and incubation. This programme is of immense significance for the agri - culture sector. The other flagship programme\u2014Digital India, which seeks to empower people through access to digital technology riding an increasingly robust infrastructure and service platform\u2014has equally immense potential to positively impact agriculture. The govern - ment has also launched the Custom Hiring Centre, a rental model for using tractors and other farm equip - ment with the twin objective of encouraging rural entrepreneurship and fast-tracking the mechanization of Indian agriculture. The budget for 2016-17 announced by the central govern - ment confirms its commitment to modernize agriculture systems in India through a slew of mea - sures such as setting up a dedicated micro-irrigation fund, establishing new mini labs in the Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) agricultural exten coverage of all 648 KVKs in the country for soil sample testing, and expanding the coverage of the e-NAM from 250 markets to 585 markets. /two.superior According to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Indian agricultural services and machinery sectors have cumulatively attracted foreign direct investment equity inflow of about US$2,278.3 million from April 2000 to March 2016. /three.superior This reveals the trend of global and domestic part - nerships being forged across the value chain to keep agriculture on a path of fast-track growth. Some notable developments include the launch of an Agritech laboratory with a focus on agri-biotech in Hyderabad by the Intertek Group, a UK-based total quality assurance provider; Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd acquisition of a 35% stake a Finnish combine harvesters manufacturer, Sampo Roselnew Oy; ICRISAT's plan to set up a Rs.100 crore (US$14.67 million) fund in a year to help small entre - preneurs in the agribusiness space; and the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative (IFFCO)'s joint venture with Japanese firm Mitsubishi Corp for manufacturing agrochemicals in India. Conclusions A successful future growth strategy for agriculture will need to perceive THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 5: Digital Technologies Transforming Indian Agriculture110 agriculture as a business enterprise involving constant innovation and catering to dynamic market demand. Although agricultural technologies are fast evolving in India and a mix of business models are driving the eco - system, there is a need to design the pathway to successful commercializa - tion and to scale it up by utilizing the right incentives and policy support. Technology will continue to play an important role while the dynamics of the agriculture sector changes and produces new challenges. With the private sector playing an increas - ingly important role in investments, operations, and expertise, agriculture will gain immensely as the public sector catalyses these efforts. The IT revolution in India was brought forward by the private sector, with the public sector creating an enabling environment. Uptake of technologies at market prices in a sector that has tradition - ally been heavily subsidized remains challenging, but farmers are prompt to identify what works in their inter - est and are ready to pay for it. Digital technologies offer the potential to achieve the necessary conditions for scale, with distributed low cost and customized delivery, creating a unique opportunity for private enterprise and innovation to thrive. The challenge before India lies in balancing high growth with inclu - sive growth; leveraging technology to achieve these twin goals will be a fascinating journey to track. A developed agriculture system is based on three key pillars: knowl - edge, infrastructure, and a robust delivery mechanism. Supporting the research and development ecosystem in agriculture directly contributes to creating knowledge and prepar - ing for the future. To strengthen the supporting framework for growth, it will be important to focus on creat - ing new physical markets, improving storage and transport facilities, mak - ing better roads, and ensuring a con - tinued electricity and water supply. These system components also facili - tate efficient mechanisms for deliv - ery and the monitoring of relevant government schemes and extension services that will accelerate the pace of development. The public policy regime in India has been supporting technology-led agricultural growth and has been increasingly developing new institutions to ease access and affordability of technology adoption among farmers.

G \u00d3MEZ and KATIE D. RICKETT S, Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management, Cornell SC Johnson College of Business, Cornell UniversityCHAPTER 6 Millions of individuals are affected by malnutrition globally. Malnutrition in developing countries is charac - terized as a triple burden, /one.superior which includes undernourishment (insuf - ficient calorie and protein intake), micronutrient malnutrition (hidden hunger), and over-nutrition (excess calories leading to overweight and obesity). In 2010, undernourishment and micronutrient malnutrition affected about 900 million and 2 billion people, respectively, in devel - oping countries. /two.superior Meanwhile, over- nutrition\u2014reflected in escalating overweight and obesity rates along with higher incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes\u2014continues to expand in developing countries. /three.superior The causes of this triple burden are multiple, but the availability, variety, and composition of foods that make up peoples' diets play a major role. This chapter explains how food value chain (FVC) innovations in recent years are influencing the triple burden of malnutrition in developing countries. These chains are chang - ing fast as a result of population and income growth; technological prog - ress in food production and distribu - tions; urbanization; and the expansion of modern food retailing, distribu - tion, and wholesaling firms. As a result, today's developing-country FVCs exhibit great diversity, because modern food sector firms either establish their own food chains or interact with traditional FVC actors, such as smallholder farmers and trad - ers, wet markets (which sell fresh meat and produce), corner stores, and street vendors. A deeper under - standing of the drivers of emerging FVC arrangements, the interactions of businesses that participate in them, the products offered, and the markets targeted can provide valuable insights into strategies to curb malnutrition. Food system transformation Figure/uni00A01 highlights key differences between a representative food sys - tem in 1980 and 2010. In 1980, about 74% of people in low- and middle-income countries resided in rural areas. The share of food sold in local rural wet markets and grown for household consumption was rela - tively high, while the share sold in supermarkets out of total food con - sumed was very small. In the same year, the share of low- and middle-income countries' total labour force in agriculture was approximately 69%; these workers expended con - siderable energy in manual labour. In addition, domestic public food-based safety nets to provide food assistance to those missed by the commercial sector were practically non-existent This chapter is based on the article by M. I. G\u00f3mez and K. D. Ricketts, 'Food Value Chain Transformations in Developing Countries: Selected Hypotheses on Nutritional Implications' . Food Policy 42 (2013): 139-50.Source: Based on G\u00f3mez et al., 2013. Note: The trend of people moving to urban areas and working in less physically demanding jobs continues in 2017. Updated data would show an even higher percentage of urban dwellers and beneficiaries of food assistance programmes.Figure 1: Developing-country food systems: Key differences between 1980 and 2010 In 1980 ... After 2010 ... Urban population: 26% Share of labour in agriculture: Small number of international food aid recipients, primarily in rural areas 115 million people are beneficiaries, primarily from domestic food assistance programmes in urban and rural areas; still, this is a very small proportion of the total food systemTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 6: Innovations in Food Distribution114 in developing countries, other than those programmes supported by for - eign food aid shipments from high-income countries. Developing-country food sys - tems became dramatically different by 2010. A larger portion of people in developing countries lived in urban areas by then and depended on com - mercial FVCs to deliver their food, while they typically worked in less physically demanding jobs than agri - culture, expending far fewer calories in daily labour. In 2011, only about 52% of low- and middle-income coun - try people resided in rural areas and the share of agricultural labour had fallen to about 46%. Thus the share of food sold in local rural markets and grown for household consumption after 2010 was significantly smaller than it was in 1980. The percentage of people residing in rural areas and the share of agriculture in total labour continue falling today. Meanwhile, modern food retail and wholesale and the foreign direct investment of global food manufacturers have expanded rapidly. /one.superior Another key feature of today's food systems is that many developing countries are establishing food-based safety nets\u2014'food assistance programmes' (FAPs)\u2014for those individuals who are at risk of experiencing macronu - trient and micronutrient deficiencies. The World Bank (2013) estimates that, on average, nearly 115 million people benefited annually from safety nets in developing countries during 2011-14. Emerging food value chain typologies: Implications for nutritionTable/uni00A01 offers a typology that assigns FVCs into four broad categories to reflect ongoing FVC transformations Table 1: Food value chain typologies and their influence on nutrition Type Participants Implications for food access Nutritional impacts Traditional Traditional traders buy primar - ily from smallholder farmers and sell to consumers and traders in wet, mostly local, markets. Aordability: A local clearing-house for products, with flexible prices, product volumes, and quality standards. Availability: Food hub for consumers and local 'mom and pop' stores to access directly from trad-ers and smallholder farmers; market oerings are highly dependent on seasonality. help reduce micronutrient deciencies and undernourishment by oering low-priced fruits, vegetables, livestock products, and staples, particularly in rural areas and in poor neighbourhoods of urban areas. Production seasonality, combined with lack of post-harvest and distribution infrastructure, increase FVC intermediation costs and limit the ability of traditional FVCs to reduce micronutrient deciencies and undernourishment. Modern Domestic and multinational food manufacturers procure primarily from commercial farms and sell through modern supermarket outlets. Aordability: Economies of scale enable the pro - duction, marketing, and distribution of packaged/processed foods at low per-unit prices. Availability: Modern supermarkets provide year round, wide product assortment, primarily in urban areas; supermarkets are successfully expand - ing the market for processed and packaged foods. Modern FVCs may contribute to alleviate micronu-trient deciencies by oering a wide assortment of products year round, but supermarkets' physical locations and quality standards may imply higher retail prices, missing the poor. Modern FVCs may contribute to obesity/over - weight malnutrition by expanding the reach of inexpensive, calorie-dense processed/packaged foods, primarily in urban areas. Modern-to-traditionalDomestic and multina-tional food manufacturers sell through the network of traditional traders and retailers (e.g., mom and pop stores). Aordability: Food manufacturers benet from economies of scale to connect with traditional distributors and retailers, oering low-priced pro - cessed foods to reach low-income consumers. Availability: By linking with traditional retailers, food manufacturers develop intense distribution strategies in urban areas and in rural, isolated markets. Expansion of processed/packaged foods into isolated, rural regions may alleviate undernourish-ment, but it can result in over-nutrition among urban consumers. Food fortication initiatives focusing on modern-to-traditional FVCs may help reduce micronutrient malnutrition. Traditional-to-modernSupermarkets and food manufacturers source food from smallholder farmers and traders. Aordability: Increased income opportunities in high-value crop and livestock production for smallholder farmers and traders can expand food budgets because most are net food buyers. Availability: Increased production and crop diversication may increase food available for local consumption. Traditional-to-modern FVCs may reduce micro - nutrient deciencies and undernourishment of smallholder farmers and traders through higher incomes leading to diet diversication. Opportunities for smallholder farmers and traders to benet directly from participation appear lim- ited and may miss asset-poor farmers; 2013.115 INDEX 2017 6: Innovations in Food Distributionin developing countries. For each FVC category, the table describes its pri - mary characteristics and participants, explains the essential mechanisms affecting food access (availability and affordability), and describes its impact on elements of the triple malnutrition burden. The typology recognizes the existence of a modern sector (e.g., large commercial farms, agribusi - nesses, multinational food manufac - turers, and modern supermarkets), a traditional sector (e.g., smallholder farmers and traders, wet markets, and 'mom and pop' stores), and the interaction between modern and traditional actors at different FVC stages. A discussion of the implica - tions of each FVC type on nutrition follows. Traditional food value chains Consumers in traditional FVCs fol - low long-established patterns and most often purchase food directly from smallholder farmers and traders in regional/local wet markets, or from a network of traditional retailers that includes independently owned mom and pop corner stores, street vendors, or roadside stands. /one.superior/one.superior Wet markets, in turn, can include large, regional markets that function like distribu - tion hubs, or smaller, local, weekly markets with more limited product assortment. Product availability in these FVCs tends to be seasonal. Traditional FVCs are common in small rural markets located relatively close to production regions. Products delivered by traditional FVCs travel longer distances to reach urban con - sumers, primarily in lower-income neighbourhoods. /one.superior/two.superior Despite the expansion of modern supermarkets and food manufacturers, evidence suggests that food categories that are important sources of micro - nutrients continue to be accessed pri - marily through traditional FVCs in developing countries. /one.superior/three.superior For example, over 90% of all fruits and vegetables are purchased in traditional FVC retail outlets in Kenya, Nicaragua, and Zambia, /one.superior and 90% of households in Ethiopia buy their beef through a local butcher in wet markets. /one.superior These large market shares are mainly the result of three advantages accruing to traditional FVCs, particularly with respect to perishable products: (1) their ability to offer products at low prices, (2) their considerable flexibil - ity in product quality standards, and (3) their convenience for consumers as a result of their flexible retail mar - ket locations. /one.superior Food products rich in micronu - trients (e.g., fruits and vegetables) and staple foods rich in calories (e.g., pulses, grains) tend to be more affordable in traditional FVCs than in modern supermarkets. These mar - keting channels often deliver nutri - tional benefits to rural residents who are largely missed by modern FVCs. Additionally, important nutritional benefits accrue to low-income people in urban areas, where traditional FVC retailers enjoy cost and location advantages. Moreover, traditional FVCs offer relatively more flexibility to target consumers who are willing to settle for lower food standards. This is reflected in significant retail price differences between modern and traditional FVCs. Nevertheless, the post-harvest and distribution infrastructure requirements of perishable foods are more expensive and more techno - logically advanced than they are for other food types. Traditional FVC infrastructure is typically lacking in developing countries and may imply higher price variability and limited year-round availability in traditional FVCs, imposing higher distribution costs and high post-harvest losses, as well as less quantity and lower qual - ity./one.superior Lack of access to adequate post- harvest processing and distribution infrastructure may limit the ability of traditional FVCs to contribute to year-round availability of micronu - trient-rich foods, resulting in high intermediation costs that may offset, to some extent, the cost advantages in retailing. Modern food value chains These FVCs are largely driven by the expansion of modern retail enterprises in developing countries, primarily in urban areas with a large consumer base. They generally involve domestic and multinational food manufacturers and wholesalers, as well as commercial agribusinesses and farms. /one.superior In general, modern FVC participants coordinate the supply chain through formal, well-docu - mented contractual arrangements that feature predetermined product standards, volume requirements, and purchase prices. /one.superior Such tight coordination, together with access to a network of global and domestic suppliers, allows modern FVCs to offer a wide year-round assortment of fresh and processed/packaged food products. These chains also gener - ally benefit from economies of size in the production, marketing, and distribution of shelf-stable packaged/processed foods. Modern FVCs are changing the dietary landscape in the developing world. Overall, research suggests that modern FVCs help alleviate micro - nutrient deficiencies by offering a wide assortment of products year round for a diverse diet, but often only for urban households with relatively high incomes. /two.superior Higher retail prices of foods rich in micronutrients (pro - duce, dairy products, meats) resulting from stricter product standards may limit the ability of lower-income consumers to afford a diet with an adequate micronutrient intake. /two.superior/one.superior A number of studies suggest that the expansion of modern FVCs is THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 6: Innovations in Food Distribution116 associated with an increased market for processed/packaged foods, with at least two implications for nutri - tion./two.superior/two.superior First, modern FVCs may be contributing to obesity/overweight malnutrition by expanding the reach of inexpensive, calorie-dense pro - cessed/packaged foods, primarily in urban areas. There is evidence that dietary changes in developing coun - tries, along with other factors (e.g., change in lifestyles, reduced manual labour), are associated with the emergent global epidemic of obesity, particularly among younger people. /two.superior/three.superior Although there are no studies show - ing causality between the expansion of processed/packaged food catego - ries and obesity, it is plausible that this is a primary contributing factor driving the increase in the number of overweight and obese people in developing countries. Second, there may be demand substitution effects, such that low-priced packaged/pro - cessed foods substitute for fresh pro - duce and livestock products, further worsening nutritional outcomes. Modern-to-traditional food value chains These FVCs consist of food manu - facturers utilizing traditional whole - sale and retail networks to market primarily processed/packaged foods. Two key characteristics of these FVCs are that food manufac - turers often benefit from economies of scale in production and distribu - tion, and from an increased ability to coordinate the downstream supply chain (as opposed to having to nego - tiate with large, powerful super - markets). These two characteristics allow modern-to-traditional FVCs to implement intensive, year-round distribution strategies for processed/packaged foods, targeting lower-income consumers in urban areas as well as consumers who get their food from smaller, remote markets in rural areas.The market for processed/pack - aged foods has been growing sub - stantially more quickly in developing countries than in their developed counterparts. /two.superior Much of this growth is being fuelled by food manufacturers selling products through traditional FVC retailers in urban and rural areas. For example, in India, small independent grocers ( 'kirana' stores) are ubiquitous in urban and rural areas and represented over 53% of processed/packaged food retail sales in that country in 2010. /two.superior Similarly in Brazil, small corner stores (called 'mercadinhos' ) represented over 21% of processed/packaged food retailing in 2010. /two.superior Moreover, processed/packaged foods sold through modern-to-traditional FVCs may help alleviate (and prevent) undernourishment in remote rural areas. These products can be made available to consumers year round at stable prices in remote rural areas, which often experience high food price variability as a result of production seasonality and produc - tion risk (e.g., adverse weather during the cropping cycle). The influence of modern-to-traditional FVCs on the nutrition of urban consumers with relatively low incomes appears to be negative because, similar to the case of modern FVCs, the ongoing mar - ket expansion of processed/packaged foods through modern-to-traditional FVCs may be associated with excess weight and obesity, mirroring long-established over-nutrition trends in developed countries. /two.superior Although expanded sales of pro - cessed/packaged foods may be asso - ciated with over-nutrition in urban areas, fortification of these foods may provide an avenue for alleviat - ing micronutrient deficiencies with modern-to-traditional FVCs. The World Economic Forum (2009) sug - gests that innovative public-private partnerships can create incentives to develop business models targeting micronutrient concerns among the poor. These partnerships are being established at three distinct levels: 1. Investing in new product develop - ment of fortified foods \u2014for ex - ample, nutritious yogurt forti - fied with essential micronutri - ents is distributed by Grameen- Ladies at affordable prices to ad - dress vitamin A deficiency in Bangladesh and elsewhere in South Asia, where over 8 million children are affected. /two.superior 2. Expanding distribution networks for existing fortified foods \u2014for ex - ample, in Mozambique, the National Committee for Food Fortification is a government-food industry partnership aim - ing at expanding distribution of fortified products such as veg - etable oil with vitamin A, and wheat flour with zinc, iron, B-complex vitamins, and fo - lic acid. /two.superior 3. Strengthening consumer demand for micronutrient-rich processed/pack - aged foods \u2014examples of public- private collaborations expand - ing education and distribution of fortified foods include a partner - ship between GAIN and nutri - tion/supplement companies such as Herbalife. /three.superior These private-public partnerships necessarily include the network of traditional FVC retailers and traders because these entities offer the pri - mary point of sales employed by the poor to access food. Increasing business partnerships between large food manufacturers and traditional retailers is (and will con - tinue) expanding the affordability and availability of processed/packaged foods in developing countries. These products are often rich in calories but poor in important micronutrients. 117 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 6: Innovations in Food DistributionModern-to-traditional FVCs may have a mixed influence on nutrition, depending on the population seg - ment targeted. For example, they can assist in efforts to prevent or at least reduce undernourishment in some rural, remote areas, but they can also create problems associated with over-nutrition in urban areas for patrons of traditional FVC retail outlets. There is substantial enthusiasm for public-private partnerships that link food manufacturers to the network of traditional retailers to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies through fortification. Traditional-to-modern food value chains These chains are characterized by smallholder farmers and traders sell - ing primarily high-value crop and livestock products (e.g., meats, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables) to modern supermarkets and food man - ufacturers. These FVCs are interest - ing primarily for their impacts on the nutrition of smallholder farmers and traders, not of end consumers. The impacts come from higher-income opportunities, which may involve selling products to supermarket sup - ply chains directly; or indirectly, through off-farm employment in food production and post-harvest activities. Here we focus on partici - pation in domestic markets because developing-country FVCs are pri - marily domestically oriented, /three.superior/one.superior and also focus on nutritional implications for smallholder farmers and traders in rural areas because most of them are net food buyers. /three.superior/two.superior Farmers who participate in supermarket supply chains enjoy higher income opportunities, /three.superior/three.superior even when facing strict product safety and product standards established by supermarkets. /three.superior Nevertheless, these benefits may reach only farmers with advantageous endowments and edu - cation. /three.superior Furthermore, recent studies suggest that the poorest farmers and traders may benefit indirectly by link - ing with modern FVCs though the labour market markets\u2014for example, off-farm employment in commercial agriculture and post-harvest process - ing./three.superior There is evidence of a positive correlation between smallholder farmer and trader participation in traditional-to-modern FVCs and reduction in undernourishment. /three.superior Most of these benefits appear to occur indirectly, particularly for the poorest farmers, in the form of off-farm employment opportunities in commercial farms and post-harvest businesses. Conclusions FVCs in developing countries have changed dramatically in recent years, driven primarily by the expansion of modern food manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers, which coexist and interact with traditional FVC actors. These FVCs are chang - ing in ways that have no precedent in developed countries, where the transition occurred gradually, over a longer period of time. The FVC typology discussed here sheds light on how the relationships among participating business, the types of products offered, and the needs of the consumer targeted are all affect - ing the triple malnutrition burden (undernourishment, micronutrient deficiencies, and over-nutrition) in the developing world. Drawing general conclusions about the impact of emerging value chains on nutrition is far from simple. Traditional FVCs, for example, tend to facilitate access to micronutrient-rich foods (e.g., fruits and vegetables) for urban low-income people and most rural residents. Nevertheless, lack of post-harvest and distribution infrastructure may limit the abil - ity of traditional FVCs to assist in micronutrient deficiency reduction year round, and may result in higher intermediation costs affecting the food prices and demand for low-income consumers. Given that micronutrient deficiencies affect more people today, interventions to boost the efficiency of traditional FVCs can be effective in improving access to micronutri - ents, particularly among urban and rural poor people. Modern FVCs, for their part, may simultaneously promote over-nutrition and reduce micronutrient deficiencies among urban emerging middle- and high-income individuals. Nevertheless, these effects may be nonexistent for the urban poor and rural residents because these markets are missed by the modern supermarket. The interactions between tradi - tional and modern FVC participants in developing countries are extremely important, highlighting the need for a more nuanced view of the links between nutrition and food value chains. In particular, intensive pro - cessed/packaged food distribution strategies promoted by modern food manufacturers linking to traditional retailers may contribute to over-nutrition in urban areas, but may prevent or reduce undernourishment in remote rural areas. In addition, the distribution networks established in these chains may offer opportunities to form partnerships between gov - ernments and private businesses to use food fortification to reduce micronu - trient deficiencies targeting specific regions where this malnutrition prob - lem is prevalent. Regarding efforts to link smallholder farmers and traders to the modern sector, the evidence suggests that important nutritional benefits may occur through elevated incomes, and primarily generated by off-farm employment in farm and post-harvest activities\u2014as opposed to direct selling.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 6: Innovations in Food Distribution118 Developing-country FVCs will continue evolving with the expan - sion of the modern sector and the adoption of innovative food distri - bution and retailing technologies. This ongoing transformation will play a key role in global initiatives to alleviate the triple burden of malnu - trition. Future research should shed light on how these FVC transforma - tions can be leveraged by private firms and governments to reduce micronutrient deficiencies, alleviate undernourishment, and control the so-called over-nutrition epidemic. In addition, very little is known about demand substitution effects among process/packaged foods, staples, fruits and vegetables, and livestock prod - ucts and how consumers respond to changes in the relative prices of these product categories. This should be a priority for future research. Finally, future work examining individual- or household-level consumption patterns over time can illuminate ways that changes in product assort - ments offered to end consumers affect malnutrition.

It has several universities well placed in the world rankings, a growing role in world knowledge production, and a diversified economic structure. However, from the point of view of the National Industry Confederation (CNI) and the Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Service (Sebrae), the coun - try still faces many challenges in fostering science and technology and in creating an environment more suitable for innovation. Perhaps the most successful example in Brazil of how policies and institutions can fos - ter science and innovation oriented towards society's major goals is in the agricultural sector. This chapter first aims to describe the main characteristics of the Brazilian innovation system and poli - cies. Second, it provides evidence of the growing participation of a differ - ent set of agents in the country's inno - vation system. Finally, it depicts the country's agriculture research system and outlines improvements needed to address new technological challenges in agriculture and food production. Brazil's innovation policies and institutions: The current scenarioOver the last 15 to 20 years, Brazil has greatly improved the policies that are intended to foster innovation. Indeed, the country has implemented a series of measures and policies to reinforce its innovation capacity. Among the new policies are research and devel - opment (R&D) tax incentives and subsidized credit for innovation, as well as some regulatory measures that ease the university-enterprise rela - tionship. The Brazilian government also substantially increased public R&D expenditures, at least until the recent fiscal crisis in 2014. Zuniga et al. have systematized the main public policies and instru - ments that currently exist in Brazil to support innovation (Table/uni00A01) as well as the estimated amount of money invested through these instruments in 2012. /one.superior Some of the funding sources for innovation indicated in the table, such as the mandatory R&D invest - ments from companies in regulated sectors, are not strictly public. These investments are obligations assumed by companies in regulated sectors and are, therefore, private resources. /two.superior According to De Negri, all this effort in designing new policies builds a relatively comprehensive picture of innovation policies when it comes to the diversity of instruments. She explains, 'Currently, the country can count on many of the instruments used in most of the developed world to foster innovation, such as: i) sub - sidized credit; ii) tax incentives; iii) subventions for companies (grants); iv) grants for research projects at uni - versities and research centers, among others'. /three.superiorSome recent policies deserve special mention because of their role in the country's innovation system, specifically in the agriculture sector. The first relevant attempt to increase funding to foster innovation in the country was the creation of Sectoral Funds. These funds are meant to be defrayed by taxes or contributions levied on certain sectors and to sup - port innovation projects in those sectors. The first of these funds, cre - ated in 1999, was the fund for the oil sector, financed by a share of oil and gas royalties. One of the funds, for agribusi - ness, was created in 2001; it specifi - cally aims to foster technologies in areas such as agronomy, veterinary medicine, biotechnology, economics, and agricultural sociology. This fund also intends to promote technological updates in the agricultural industry and to stimulate the expansion of investments in tropical agricultural biotechnology and in the diffusion of new technologies. Also created in 2001, the Biotechnology Fund aims to support technologies, research infrastructure, and qualification in the area. Another important sectoral fund for agriculture in Brazil is the Energy Fund, which is particularly concerned with improving energy efficiency and fostering renewable energy, such as biofuels. The innovation law of 2004, in turn, established the rules of engage - ment for researchers from public institutions in research projects with THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 7: Policies and Institutions Fostering Innovation and Agriculture Technologies in Brazil122 companies, as well as for the com - mercialization of intellectual prop - erty derived from these partnerships. This was a significant improvement in the regulations concerned with the interaction between universities and companies. This law also launched the possibility of public funds being given to companies in the form of a grant for carrying out R&D. Until the promulgation of this law, there had been no such possibility in the Brazilian legal framework. Finally, the 'Good Law' (Lei do Bem) generated several tax incen - tives for Brazilian companies in 2005. When it comes to innovation, one of the most important of these is the tax incentives for private investments in R&D. Before this law there were two programmes that provided tax breaks to private companies that invested in R&D in both industry and agricul - ture. Those programmes demanded that, before receiving the incentive, companies should have their research projects approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology. The bureaucracy involved in this kind of requirement was responsible for this earlier incentive never having been broadly used by Brazilian compa - nies\u2014either in industry or in agri - culture. The Good Law, therefore, expanded the comprehensiveness of the tax incentives and facilitated its use for private companies conducting R&D in the country. From the regulatory point of view, several improvements have been made in Brazilian legislation in the last decades. These begin with the Industrial Property law, approved in 1996, and the cultivars protection law, in 1997. Besides these, a new law on biodiversity made research on Brazilian biodiversity easier. This law entered into force in 2015 and, from this date, research using Brazilian genetic resources, as well as the development of products based on the country's biodiversity, do not require prior authorization. The emerging role of CNI and Sebrae New institutional actors have recently emerged as important play - ers in the Brazilian debate on innova - tion and technology. CNI business leaders created the Entrepreneurial Mobilization for Innovation (MEI) in 2008. The MEI aims to make innovation a centre of corporate strategies and increase the effective - ness of innovation policies in the country. This initiative recognizes that innovation is essential for com - petitiveness and, therefore, for the country's growth and development. Currently, the MEI has around 200 business leaders as members and counts on support from government working in partnership to strengthen innovation in Brazil.

BNDES = National Bank for Social and Economic Development; FINEP = Brazilian Innovation Agency; S&T = science and technology.123 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 7: Policies and Institutions Fostering Innovation and Agriculture Technologies in BrazilBesides mobilizing Brazilian entrepreneurs, the CNI, by means of the Brazilian National Service for Industrial Training (SENAI), has also created several new techno - logical institutes in the country. The SENAI institutes of innovation were inspired by the German model of the Fraunhofer Institutes, and they aim to increase the productivity and com - petitiveness of Brazilian industry by developing innovative solutions for companies of all sizes. Until now, 21 different institutes have been established to conduct applied R&D, providing technologi - cal and laboratory support for pro - totyping and pilot plants, as well as consultancy work to facilitate tech - nology transfer to Brazilian compa - nies. These institutes are spread over 12 different states of the country. For instance, the Institute of Innovation in Biotechnology, in S\u00e3o Paulo, develops innovative solutions for bioengineering focused on areas such as food processing, chemistry, and energy, among others. The Institute for Biomass Innovation, in Tr\u00eas Lagoas in the state of Minas Gerais, offers solutions in biomass processing for sugar and ethanol producers, pulp and paper, biofuels and biodiesel, and the chemical sectors. Brazil also has an important net - work of public and private providers of technology extension services for small and medium-sized enterprises. These services include training in technology and managerial skills, in the diffusion of information, and in metrological services. The most important organization providing these services and sup - porting micro and small enterprise development in Brazil is the Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Service (Sebrae), created in 1972 by the Brazilian government. Sebrae became independent, as a private nonprofit organization, in 1990. It develops its activities in collaboration with the public and private sectors through its National Deliberative Council, which includes government institutions, business organizations, and research institutions. Sebrae offers several solutions in different areas of business organization, among them innovation. Specific programmes to foster innovation have been created. One of these is SEBRAETEC, a programme that allows small businesses access to technological and innovation support in order to improve processes, products, and services and to introduce innovation in enterprises and markets in the fol - lowing areas: quality, productivity, intellectual property, sustainability, digital services, and design. Sebrae pays 70% of the company\u00b4s innovation costs, and the company is responsible for 30%. Some specific examples of services covered by SEBRAETEC in agriculture and food production are: genetic selection in the search for yield increase, because this diagnoses genetic problems that affect fertility, diseases, longev - ity, and quality in milk and ani - mal farming; good agricultural practices and HACCP (Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points) needed to meet the required standards for wholesale markets and export markets for fruits, vegetables, coffee, honey, distilled bever - ages (cacha\u00e7a), and agroindustry products; laboratory analysis for quality diagnosis and monitoring, such as water quality parameters for fish and shrimp farming, micro - bial standards for milk and for sugarcane juice (for cacha\u00e7a pro - duction), and soil tests; technical assistance for several types of crops; and assistance in meeting the country\u00b4s Technical Norms and Standards. Outcomes and challengesIn terms of innovation policies and the engagement of society in knowl - edge production, it is possible to conclude that Brazil has achieved important advances in the last decade. One indication of this broader cov - erage of the policies appears in the latest Brazilian innovation survey. The survey indicates that the share of innovative companies reporting having received public support to innovate has reached about 40%, compared with around 20% in the early 2000s. The framework of Brazilian innovation policies is broader than it used to be. When it comes to their effectiveness, the results are not so clear. Different researchers in the country have carried out some studies to evaluate the effectiveness of several of these policies. These evaluations, however, are not regular and system - atic and are not frequently used by the government to redesign the policies. To some extent Brazilian innovation policies have been known to inspire good examples around the world, although the policy design should eventually be improved. Some stud - ies also suggest that some of the poli - cies adopted are not crowding out but are instead stimulating private invest - ment in R&D. Tax incentives from The Good Law, for instance, have been evaluated by several research - ers./one.superior The results from these studies, as well as testimonies from several Brazilian industrial leaders, suggest that the effects of this incentive are relevant for Brazilian industry. However, several other policies need much better evaluation. Indeed, improving the evalua - tion of innovation policies in Brazil THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 7: Policies and Institutions Fostering Innovation and Agriculture Technologies in Brazil124 is crucial, especially in terms of data transparency and accountability. The agencies responsible for supporting innovation should be more commit - ted to evaluation and to the creation and disclosure of indicators and data on the policies. The ministries and public agencies responsible should provide incentive for the creation of some key performance indicators to evaluate the policies under their responsibility. Reinforcing transpar - ency and accountability is, in fact, the only way to improve the assess - ment of the results of innovation policies. A more in-depth evaluation could help with an understanding, for example, why\u2014despite the creation and consolidation of several pub - lic policies for innovation\u2014overall Brazilian performance on several innovation indicators is still lacking in efficacy. The country's position in the Global Innovation Index (GII) is not improving over the years. On the contrary, in 2011, Brazil held 47th place in the GII rankings; in 2016, the country ranked 69th. /one.superior/one.superior Figure/uni00A01 shows business R&D investments (BERD) as a share of GDP. The stability of the Brazil's per - formance over the years, especially after 2008, is evident. Compared to the performance of most other coun - tries, the country is clearly lagging behind. Why is this happening? Despite all the efforts that have been made in terms of public policies, why are the aggregate results of the country still weaker than expected? According to De Negri, part of this can be explained by the decrease of indus - try's share in GDP, since this sector is responsible for a great share of total R&D investment in the country. /one.superior/two.superior There are other relevant constraints, however, that prevent the Brazilian economy from becoming more inno - vative; these constraints equally affect industry and agriculture. The first obstacle is a very bureaucratic and rigid business environment. One of the indicators of such an environment is the time necessary for an entrepreneur to start a new business: in Brazil, this is more than 100 days. To answer to the demands of the market and to create new products and processes to meet these demands, agility and flexibility are crucial. It is not by chance that the institutional dimension is where Brazil has the worst GII scores. Even worse, the indicators on this dimen - sion show no improvement over the last few years. That is a serious defi - ciency for the country, and it is time to address it. The second relevant factor hinder - ing the country's innovation perfor - mance is competition and integration with international markets. To foster competition, it is important for Brazil to build an economy that is more integrated in global value chains and international markets. The country needs to foster internationalization\u2014not only in terms of goods and ser - vices, but also in terms of knowledge, ideas, and human capital. Finally, there is a need for readily effective and focused public policies. In spite of the fact that some poli - cies are relatively well evaluated, the country still has to make them more mission-oriented than before. One of the gaps apparent in the Brazilian innovation system is the lack of interaction between universities and research centres, on one hand, and companies on the other. It is necessary to build instruments able to integrate scientific production, knowledge, and technologies with the greater needs of Brazilian society. 0.00.51.01.52.0 China Spain EU average USA Brazil n 2005n 2008n 2011 n 2014Figure 1: Business R&D investments (BERD) as a share of GDP , Brazil and selected countries (2005, 2008, 2011, and 2014) Source: IBGE, 2016; OECD, Innovation in Science, Tewchnology and Industry database, available at http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/, accessed February 2017.

Percent of GDP125 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 7: Policies and Institutions Fostering Innovation and Agriculture Technologies in BrazilIn this regard, the innovation system in Brazil's agriculture sector is a great example to follow. Fostering technologies for agriculture and food production: The challenges aheadIn addition to improving the busi - ness environment and building a more internationalized economy, one of the major challenges for Brazilian innovation policies is their ability to promote, in a more inten - sive way, a kind of R&D geared to the greater needs of Brazilian society\u2014research that is sometimes called 'mission-oriented R&D'. The agriculture sector in Brazil is one of the best examples of how to support mission-oriented R&D. Throughout its history, Brazil has established a broad and competitive R&D system focused on the agricul - ture sector. The National Agricultural Research System (SNPA), established in 1992 by ordinance of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply, has been able to develop technological innovations that were critical for agribusiness expansion in the country. From more resistant and productive seed varieties to new cultivation techniques, the technolo - gies developed by the SNPA made it possible to grow soybeans in the Brazilian Cerrado. The system includes institutions such as the Brazilian Agriculture Research Corporation (Embrapa), the State Agricultural Research Organizations (OEPAS), universi - ties, and federal and state research institutions as well as other orga - nizations related to agriculture research. The Agronomic Institute of Campinas (IAC), for instance, founded in 1887, is one of the oldest research institutions in the coun - try and one of those responsible for developing several agriculture technologies. The entire system comprises a very diverse set of insti - tutions\u2014each with several different characteristics and roles\u2014that work together to sustain a virtuous process of innovation in agriculture sector. Embrapa, a public research institution founded in 1973 under the stewardship of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food Supply, plays a leadership role in this system. Currently, the institution counts on a budget of around 3 bil - lion Brazilian reais (R$) and more than 9,000 employees. It operates through 46 decentralized research units spread out in almost every state in the country. The research portfolio of the agency includes projects such as (1) diagnosing the physical, chemical, and microbiological quality of soils; (2) identifying and mapping weeds resistant to herbicides; (3) using geo - technologies (such as those that map rainfall); and (4) conserving plant growth-promoting microorganisms by working with biological nitrogen fixation and other mechanisms. Embrapa is also known for its strong use of intellectual property protection and has served as a model for other centres on how to manage technology and technology transfer to other companies and institutions. Embrapa\u00b4s Technology Transfer Office staff is recognized as a group of well-trained and competent pro - fessionals and Embrapa is among the top patent applicants in the country. One of the main advantages of this system is its proximity and close relation to farmers, which allows it to provide them with the necessary solutions to their problems. It has proved to be very successful in pro - viding Brazilian farmers with new technologies in areas such as genetic engineering, soil improvement and correction, plant and animal breed - ing, livestock technologies, and so on. However, some researchers are pointing to the risk that the country will lose technological leadership in several areas in which it has already had a strong influence, falling behind the technological frontier in agriculture. The main chal - lenges in this regard are the human capital and scientific competences in agriculture research. To overcome this risk, Bonacelli et al. suggest an urgent reorientation of policies for agriculture that takes into account new technologies and new scientific competencies. /one.superior/three.superior This reorientation is even more important in face of new trends and challenges in agriculture technolo - gies. Improvements in agricultural productivity and sustainability nowa - days depend much more heavily on industrial technologies provided by the agricultural inputs industry than ever before. The Business Insider Review, /one.superior for instance, as well as other technological publications, /one.superior have listed some of the main emerg - ing agriculture technologies over the next several years. Sensors are making farms smarter and more connected, which enables real-time traceability as well as the diagnosis of crop and soil conditions, and the monitoring of livestock and farm machinery in real time. Sensors can be useful in several types of situ - ations. Collars with chips and bio - metrics can identify and monitor vital information about livestock in real time. Crop sensors could prescribe the correct amount of fertilizers to apply to a specific site at a specific point in time, and this information could be sent directly to the applica - tion equipment. Information technology can con - nect all the machinery and sensors in a farm to provide real-time informa - tion and to adopt the measures neces - sary to solve several kinds of problem. The adequate treatment of the vast amounts of data from crop yields, THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 7: Policies and Institutions Fostering Innovation and Agriculture Technologies in Brazil126 soil-mapping, fertilizer applications, weather data, machinery, animal health, and so on can make farms much more efficient than before. Precision agriculture will enable farming management based on observing all these kinds of data and providing adequate answers. Besides that, 'further understand - ing of crop variability, geo-located weather data and precise sensors should allow improved automated decision-making and complemen - tary planting techniques'. /one.superior The food processing industry could also benefit greatly from genetic engineering to create 'new strains of food animals and plants in order to better address biological and physiological needs'. /one.superior Automation continues to be an important tool for improving agriculture productivity. Nowadays automation also implies using drones, robots, machine learn - ing, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. There are several examples of these technologies that are already developed or in development in Brazil. Embrapa, for instance, has developed the 'electronic tongue' (a conductive and lipid-based sensor for the taste evaluation of beverages) and an irrigation sensor that informs the producer about the need for water in the soil. The combination of sensors and information technologies is the focus of a product developed by a start-up company that allows con - sumers to track the origin of meat. Another Brazilian company is devel - oping solutions for topography, pest detection, and cattle counting using drones. The fact that most new agriculture technologies are coming from the input industry\u2014including machin - ery, agriculture chemical, animal genetics, seeds\u2014demonstrates the enormous challenges faced by the agricultural research system, both in Brazil and in general. Although it has the biggest tropical agriculture indus - try in the world, until now Brazil has not been able to take advantage of this large-scale production to create a competitive and internationalized input industry. In fact, despite having produced several important technol - ogies for the agriculture sector, there are few internationally competitive Brazilian companies in either the food production chain or in the agricultural input market. Indeed, in the list of the major food-processing companies in the world, there is just one Brazilian company, which is in the meat industry. The Brazilian international presence in the agri - culture input industry\u2014such as crop seed/biotech, agricultural chemicals, animal health and breeding, and farm machinery industries\u2014is also not as relevant as it could be given the size of its agriculture sector. Moreover, increasing global market concentration in the agri - culture input industry\u2014as noted by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\u2014implies that fewer firms are now responsible for many of the innovations that result in growth in agriculture productivity. /one.superior ConclusionsFor Brazil to play a leading role in the most important technological trends in agriculture today, it is vital that the country place the technolo - gies of industry and services at the service of agriculture. Thus, from the perspective of CNI and Sebrae, some challenges faced by Brazilian agricul - ture need much more attention from public policies and the agriculture research system. These challenges are related, among others, to determin - ing the best way to: intensify the adoption of preci - sion agriculture and zootechnics, genetics, geo-technology, big data, robots, drones, and artifi - cial intelligence; increase the use of sustainable production processes; incorporate low-cost technolo - gies, product innovations, and business model innovations into family agriculture; and intensify the use of software and mobile applications to sup - port business management in the areas of logistics, farm finance, traceability, weather informa - tion, e-commerce, and coopera - tive organizations\u00b4 management. The challenge presented by these trends is to make it possible for smallholders as well as large farms to access the new technologies so that they too can benefit from the promise of productivity and quality offered by these innovations. Several of these technological trends and chal - lenges also constitute opportunities for small business, especially in the service sector. The implications for the Brazilian innovation system in agriculture are huge. They demand a new vision with policies oriented towards fostering innovation in agri - culture to prevent the country from being relegated to only using new technologies instead of also generat - ing them. It is necessary, for instance, that the government continue to spon - sor research to develop and deliver new technologies to Brazilian farms. To address the challenges above, it is also necessary to integrate agri - culture needs with industry and services inputs. To provide just one example, the European Union, under the umbrella of the Horizon 2020, is sponsoring projects that look at the feasibility of bringing cost-effective precision farming tools from the laboratory to the farm. /one.superior127 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 7: Policies and Institutions Fostering Innovation and Agriculture Technologies in BrazilBesides designing more focused innovation policies, it is vital to solve some of other challenges mentioned earlier. Reducing bureaucracy and improving the business environment could be an important boost to the generation of new ideas and the cre - ation of new businesses that could take advantage of the huge size of the Brazilian agriculture market. It is also imperative to look abroad and be connected to the main trends in agriculture research, which implies modernizing and internationalizing Brazilian research institutions and companies.

A comparison of statistical data for the years 1980 to 2016 shows that gross agricultural production decreased from 10.3 trillion yen to 8.8 trillion yen, agricultural land decreased from 5.46 million hectares (ha) to 4.47 mil - lion ha, the working population in the agricultural sector decreased from 6.97 million to 1.92 million, and the food self-sufficiency rate decreased from 53% to 39%, indicating a clear contracting tendency for agriculture in Japan. Moreover, the total area of farmland that has been abandoned because small-scale farmers quit or did not have a successor has increased from 123,000 ha to 284,000 ha, and the average age of farmers has greatly increased\u2014reaching 66.8 years old in 2016. As a response to these trends, there has been an accumulation of agricultural land for specific core farmers, /one.superior a trend that is expected to continue. Japanese agriculture is thus drastically changing from small-scale farming to large-scale farming with fewer workers. However, complex farmland structures with numerous small independent farms still remain in many places, making the produc - tivity of agriculture in Japan low compared with that of other devel - oped countries. Japanese agriculture: The current state and policy objectivesIn 2013, the Japanese government initiated the Japan Revitalization Strategy, a new growth strategy to overcome two decades of economic stagnation since 1990. With regard Box 1: Key performance indicators for agriculture in the Japan Revitalization Strategy \u00bbIncrease the ratio of farmland used by business farmers to 80% in the next 10 years (ending in 2023); this was 48.7% as of the end of Fiscal Year 2013. \u00bbReduce the cost of rice production by business farmers by 40% in the next 10 years (ending in 2023) over the current national average cost, including through efforts by industry on aspects of materials and distribution. The national average cost of rice production in 2011 was \u00a516,001/60 kg. \u00bbIncrease the number of corporate farmers fourfold from the 2010 level to 50,000 in the next 10 years (ending in 2023). In 2010 there were 12,511 farming corporations. \u00bbExpand the size of the agriculture sector based on the collaboration of primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors of the economy (called the 'sixth industrialization of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries') to \u00a510 trillion in 2020. \u00bbWith regard to dairy farming, increase the number of projects to promote collaboration among the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors to 500 by 2020. \u00bbIncrease the value of exports of Agricultural, Forestry and Fishery products and foods to \u00a51 trillion before 2020, the initial target year. Source: Japan Revitalization Strategy, 2013; see http://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/keizaisaisei/pdf/ en_saikou_jpn_hon.pdf.to agriculture, the government stated that its objective was to make agriculture, forestry, and fishery a growing industry, and it set key per - formance indicators (KPIs) (Box/uni00A01), such as an increase in the ratio of farmland used by business farmers to 80% in the next 10 years (ending in 2023). In order to achieve this objective, the government estab - lished a new organization called the Public Corporation for Farmland Consolidation to Core Farmers through Renting and Subleasing in 2014 (Figure/uni00A01). This organization rents separated small areas of farm - land or uncultivated land from quit - ting farmers and consolidates small areas, if needed, to provide large-scale farmland for core farmers. In 2015, the farmland area utilized by core farmers increased by 80,000 ha, THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 8: Mobilizing Science, Technology, and Innovation to Transform Japanese Agriculture130 indicating that the accumulation of farmlands to the core farmers is pro - gressing properly. To promote the transition to large-scale farming, Japan's agricul - tural land law was amended to ease regulations for possession of farmland by a farming company (the new law was implemented on 1 April 2016). Of the four conditions (company style, business style, constituent members or voting rights, and board members) required for companies to own farmland, the last two were eased, allowing farming companies to be scaled up. The new law eases the promotion of investment into farm - ing companies, which is expected to eventually make Japanese business farms larger. This will contribute to reaching another KPI formulated in the Japan Revitalization Strategy: 'Increase the number of corporate farmers fourfold from the 2010 level to 50,000 in the next 10 years (ending in 2023)'. Another KPI in that strategy is a reduction by 40% of the cost of rice production by business farmers in the next 10 years (ending in 2023) compared with the current national average cost, /two.superior including through efforts by industry on aspects of materials and distribution. It seems to be difficult to reach this number using only policy tools. Investment in research and technology develop - ment is critical in this circumstance. Since the structure of Japanese agriculture is evolving to large-scale farming, technology that supports this transition is needed. Two main technical problems face this trend in land use-based agriculture. First, automation technology for farm oper - ations is needed to expand the limit of farmland use per person, which is critically important for large-scale farming. Second, the establishment of an efficient farm management system is needed for appropriate farm work plans to enable the manage - ment of many separated small-scale farms with multiple crop varieties to spread out harvest timing. In fact, the Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP) /three.superior\u2014a national pro - gram for science, technology, and innovation initiated in 2013 by the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation\u2014aims to confront the most important societal challenges facing Japan, as well as to contrib - ute to the resurgence of the Japanese economy. The SIP has become a powerful tool to address these chal - lenges. Indeed, the project entitled 'Technologies for Creating Next-Generation Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries' is among 11 projects selected for the SIP. One of the main goals of this project is to increase the income of farmers by using innovative technol - ogy for smart farming and to enhance the value of agricultural products, working with agricultural policy making to introduce farmland struc - tural reform, and expanding the size of agriculture-related industry (e.g., seedling industry). The project has identified two major ways to reach these goals: 1. Incorporate robotics, informa - tion and communication tech - nologies (ICTs), genome in - formation, and other leading- edge technologies to produce a uniquely Japanese smart, ultra-labour-saving, and highly pro - ductive agriculture model. 2. Enhance the value of agricul - tural, forestry, and fishery prod - ucts by developing new materials and offering distinct, functional health foods and other products, using techniques from medicine and engineering. Finally, in 2016 the Japanese gov - ernment formulated its 5th Science and Technology Basic Plan. In this document, the government propos - es the living concept 'Society 5.0', where ICTs, which have recently significantly advanced, will be fully utilized for the benefit of all citizens. Eleven projects in the SIP have been assigned as to explore the concept of Society 5.0, including the project Source: Based on MAFF, with permission, available at http://www.maff.go.jp/j/keiei/koukai/kikou/attach/pdf/index-39.pdf (in Japanese). Note: Because the average age of farmers has greatly increased and small-scale farmers have been quitting, the accumulation of farmlands to core farmers is in progress. In many cases, small farmlands are separated and so cannot be used by core farmers, thus inhibiting the improvement of productivity. To solve this problem, public corporations that rent farmland from quitting farmers and sublease to core farmers are established in each prefecture. Under this scheme, farmland owners will be paid by the corporation, and the corporation will consolidate the small farmlands into one large area, which it subleases to core farmers.Figure 1: Farmland consolidation through public corporation Current Small farmlands (about 3,000 square metres on average) are separately accumulated to the core farmers. Some are abandoned.Policy-guided Farmland is consolidated to farms of about 1 hectare for core famers.Public Corporation for Public Corporation for Farmland Consolidation Farmland Consolidation to core farmers through to core farmers through renting and subleasingrenting and subleasing131 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 8: Mobilizing Science, Technology, and Innovation to Transform Japanese AgricultureTechnologies for Creating Next- Generation Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Research on smart agriculture: An overviewRecently research deploying the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) has been galvanized. In the SIP project Technologies for Creating Next-Generation Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, these novel tech - nologies are also integrated into the research activity for developing next-generation technologies that boost the productivity of Japanese agriculture. To establish a large-scale smart farming system for rice production, automation technology needs to be developed. An efficient farm man - agement system for appropriate farm work plans that enable the manage - ment of many separated small farms is also needed to reduce rice production costs. In this SIP project, two types of end users are considered: core farmers with family-style farms (of about 30 ha) and company farmers with larger farms (about 100 ha). Research is being carried out to develop cultivation techniques based on automatically driven farm equip - ment, an automated water control system for paddy fields, a farming assistance system based on space assessment information, a precise automated fertilization system with sensing soil fertility for each farm, and a farming plan simulation system that enables efficient farm work in many small separated farms. Research is also being carried out to develop ground-breaking varieties of crops\u2014such as crops with super high produc - tivity, using various techniques such as genome-editing technology\u2014and to enhance the value of agricultural products based on scientific evidence for health (brain function and body locomotive function, etc.). By devel - oping these technologies, the area of farm land per person is expected to expand from 12 ha to about 24 ha, thus removing factors limiting farm size for core farmers. These technologies include an automatic driving system for farm equipment that is expected to con - tribute to the expansion of working farmland per person by using geo - metric space information generated by precise Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. This will enable work to be done at night as well as performed simultaneously by mul - tiple types of equipment. Automatic driving systems for tractors and unstaffed work system products (with human monitoring) will be put on the market by 2018, when the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System service will become available. Moreover, an unstaffed automatic driving system with remote monitoring that can cross fields is under development and expected to be ready by 2020. Ensuring that safety guidelines are met is an ongoing effort of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. A first-of-its-kind system for working large fields was developed successfully in 2016. Four automatic robot-tractors are used in this system to boost work efficiency. These tractors can work together with location error of less than 4 cen - timetres. Although tractor systems for large fields in Western countries have adverse effects on plant growth because of the high pressure exerted by tractors on the soil, the Japanese system does not have this problem, and farm work plans can therefore be designed to be flexible by changing the number of tractors being used. To control water in paddy fields, farmers manually change the water level by using valves. Developing labour-saving technology is therefore needed. Core farmers have to man - age many small areas of farmland that have been abandoned by small-scale farmers. Core farmers plant different varieties of rice to distribute the har - vesting timing, resulting in a signifi - cant increase in the burden of water management. To address this issue, research is now being conducted to develop an automated remote-controlled water control system. Automated valve-controlling equip - ment with a water-level sensor and networking equipment for wireless control have so far been developed. Water level-sensing data are stored in a cloud service, and farmers can remotely monitor these data and set the desired water level with a smart phone or tablet. This technology enables a 50% to 90% reduction in labour required for water control, which accounts for about 30% of rice paddy farm work. The technology is therefore expected to contribute to a significant increase in the area of farmland that can be used per person. Technologies for an automated multi-robot tractor system or auto - mated water control system for paddy fields need farm work plans based on precise farmland information such as specific data on crop growth, cli - mate, water level, temperature, and so on. In the SIP Technologies for Creating Next-Generation Agricul - ture, Forestry and Fisheries project, technologies for collecting data on crop growth (nitrogen content, chlorophyll content, etc.) and soil fertility from many small separated farmland areas are being developed to maximize appropriate harvest timing and efficient fertilization. Satellites or drones are used to obtain these data. A system that generates maps over an area of 3,000 square kilometres for a crop's protein content or the appro - priate harvest timing for rice has been developed. Farmers or farming advisors can obtain information at THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 8: Mobilizing Science, Technology, and Innovation to Transform Japanese Agriculture132 any time from this system by using a tablet or smart phone. The informa - tion enables quality control of prod - ucts, and the system has been used for a branding strategy for local rice labels such as 'Seiten no Hekireki' in Aomori Prefecture and 'Tuya Hime' in Yamagata Prefecture. Research is also being conducted to develop a sensing system that uses a drone equipped with a spectroscopic sen - sor or thermal imaging sensor and a controlling module. Information about visible light, near-infrared light, or thermal infrared light can be used to estimate nitrogen content, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis activity, and water stress. Based on this information, a diagnostic algo - rithm for accurately estimating plant growth is now being established. Information about farmland such as data on plant growth, soil fertil - ity, and climate data obtained by various sensors must be appropri - ately selected and processed before providing the results to farmers. Therefore a system for managing many farmlands that integrates and processes information from multiple systems and generates a farming plan according to each farmer's strategy is now being developed. Elements of this system\u2014including technologies such as an automatic driving system, an automated water-control system, and a farming plan simulation sys - tem\u2014have been integrated into a single package of technologies and introduced to representative farmers in Chiba Prefecture. This enables the optimization made possible by using multiple technologies that comprise a single system and assessment of inte - grated technologies from the view - point of management. This approach is also effective for obtaining feedback from users, which can lead to practi - cal improvements of the integrated technologies. The newly developed technologies are expected to be used widely by Japanese rice farmers. Many types of sensing systems for obtaining climate information on soil fertility, water level, temperature, and so on in paddy fields are connected to the Internet, and numerous data collected by these sensing systems will be accumulated in cyberspace. A data platform will be established and a huge amount of data about paddy fields will be available to everyone. These data can be analysed by AI or other tools, and data obtained every year will be utilized for further advanced cultivation technology. In the field of horticulture, for example, environmental infor - mation\u2014such as information on temperature, humidity, and CO concentration inside a solar-powered plant factory\u2014are collected by sen - sors connected to the Internet. These data are analysed together with bio - logical data inside the tomato fruit obtained by cyclopaedic analysis of gene expression, metabolites, or other biological data. These integrated data will be utilized for environment control programmes to optimize the cultivating environment for tomatoes and other crops, enabling maximiza - tion of crop yield and controlling its quality to meet market requirements that may change on a daily basis. This novel technology will also be used to analyse the know-how of excellent farmers. Their techniques will be digitalized and provided to young farmers who have less experience with cultivation. These novel trials will enable a smooth transition of the cultivation techniques of experienced farmers to young farmers, and this is expected to help the Japanese agricul - ture industry to be competitive in the international market. The future of crop breeding: Utilizing genome-editing technologyRecently, in addition to traditional breeding techniques, genome-edit - ing technology that assists in mak - ing precise and targeted changes to the genome of living cells has been greatly advanced (the most significant of these techniques is the CRISPR/Cas9). This is expected to be a driv - ing force for the development of ground-breaking crop varieties that cannot be achieved by traditional breeding techniques, and is predicted to accelerate the development of new varieties with high capacity. In the SIP's Technologies for Creating Next-Generation Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, studies with mutagenesis induced by heavy ion beams or other mutagens have been carried out to elucidate specific genomic loci that are respon - sible for production traits and to apply them for developing new ground-breaking varieties. The SIP project has already obtained null-segregant rice plants in which genes responsible for grain size or number have been edited. These plants can contribute to the ground-breaking variety with super high yield. In the near future, the isolation and characterization of useful genes that are responsible for the trans - location of nutrient compositions will enable the development of more pro - ductive varieties with greater yield. In tomatoes, genes responsible for gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) content and parthenocarpy or other traits are now being edited to create varieties that are free from the need for artificial pollination or have a high GABA content in order to reduce the farmer's hormone processing cost (for pollinating the plants) or to enhance the value of the products. Other major crops such as wheat, soybeans, potatoes, and so on have also been investigated as possible candidates for 133 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 8: Mobilizing Science, Technology, and Innovation to Transform Japanese Agricultureoptimizing genome-editing condi - tions or creating ground-breaking varieties. Because the CRISPR/Cas9- based technology and other exist - ing genome-editing technology, such as TALEN-based technology, have already been patented mainly by universities in the United States of America and Germany, research is also being conducted to develop Japanese genome-editing technol - ogy. Technology that induces point mutations in the targeted genes, such as target-AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase), as well as tech - nology utilizing a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motif, which can be designed to bind any specific DNA/RNA site, are under development. These technologies are also being examined for creating ground-break - ing crop varieties, and they constitute an integral part of the SIP project. Internationally competitive crop varieties and agricultural products based on these technologies will be developed in the near future and will contribute to an increase in exports of Japanese agricultural products. Living modified organisms (LMOs) are regulated by multiple laws in Japan, but primarily by the law on biosafety\u2014the Law Concerning the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biological Diversity through Regulations on the Use of Living Modified Organisms\u2014which has been enacted to 'ensure the precise and smooth implementation of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity'. In this Law, 'LMO' is defined as 'an organism that possesses nucleic acid, or a replicated product thereof, obtained through technologies for the processing of nucleic acid extra - cellularly or technologies for fusing of the cells of organisms belonging to different taxonomical families'. /one.superior Genome-editing technology can edit intended specific genomic sites without external nucleic acid or trace marks. Therefore there is no consis - tent decision as to whether genome-edited crops are subject to regulation or not. Considering this situation, research is also being conducted to develop a method to prove that the genome-edited crops do not possess extracellularly processed nucleic acid; methods for promoting consumer acceptance based on benefits are also being considered. Thus there is cooperation between administra - tive work and technology aiming at public acceptance of genome-edited agricultural products. Conclusions In the SIP project Technologies for Creating Next-Generation Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, research on smart agriculture\u2014especially research concerning rice production and the development of ground-breaking varieties\u2014are ongoing towards the KPIs stated in the Japan Revitalization Strategy. By combining novel varieties that respond to consumers' needs with next-generation cultivation tech - nology that utilizes ICTs and other cutting-edge technologies, the pro - ductivity of Japanese agriculture is expected to be greatly enhanced. These state-of-art technologies could also be introduced to developing countries, and are expected to con - tribute to tackling the global food supply problem in the future. Notes 1 'Core farmer' is defined in Japanese agriculture policy as an 'efficient and stable farming management body such that the main workers' lifetime income and labor time are at a level similar to that of workers in other industries'. 2 The average cost of rice production in 2011 was 16,001 yen per 60 kilograms. 3 See http://www8.cao.go.jp/cstp/panhu/ sip_english/sip_en.html. 4 For more information about the Technologies for Creating Next-Generation Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries project, see http://www8.cao.go.jp/cstp/panhu/ sip_english/42-45.pdf. 5 The 2016 budget for the SIP Technologies for Creating Next-Generation Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries was 2.925 billion yen.

There is a clear need for improvement in the sector's technological, infrastructural, and institutional basis to ensure its sus - tainable development. The situation is further aggra - vated by a number of environmen - tal issues, including the degradation of ecosystems, biodiversity loss, and the deterioration of soil and sea productivity. Climate change leads to growing pressures on the agricultural productive areas and on the world's oceans. In the long term, there are significant risks of fertilizer deficits due to depletion of mineral deposits. Furthermore, declining pesticide efficiency due to the inability of agrichemical science to keep up with the pace of pests' evolution is an unfolding trend with serious implications. This creates risks for the globaliza - tion of agri-food trade, and it leads to a resurrection of 'food nation - alisms' and intensifying economic vulnerabilities associated with the globalized trade. /one.superiorUnfortunately, the new wave of technological advances (such as bio - technology, artificial ecosystems, circular agriculture, precision agri - culture, robotics, smart logistics, and landless food production through the direct chemical synthesis of nutrients) rolls out rather slowly in many parts of the world. This is the result of a shortage of investment, political/societal/religious hostility to radical technologies, and inad - equate labour force competences. Less expensive, yet highly effec - tive, technological innovations and entirely new mechanisms for their promotion are required. The lat - ter include the redesign of existing government policies related to sci - ence and technology (S&T), inno - vation, entrepreneurship, industrial organization, competition, and investment. Having abundant land resources and significant industrial, S&T, and educational capacities, the Russian Federation (Russia) will, most probably, play an important role in combating the global challenges outlined above. To achieve this, however, the country will need to continue its reforms of the agri - culture and food sector so that it becomes able to generate and absorb technological and organizational innovations more efficiently. Implications of global challenges In today's deeply internationalized economy, global challenges are important elements of the strategic agendas of national agriculture and food sectors, although some national priorities are determined solely by domestic factors. The global chal - lenges affecting the agriculture and food sector could be categorized, rather generally, into environmen - tal, social, economic, political, and axiological (related to the values foundations of societies). /two.superior However, most of the challenges and trends, in terms of their causation, are mixed by nature. First of all, a growing discrep - ancy between the dynamics of food demand and supply makes the future of agriculture rather diffi - cult to predict. Rates of agricultural productivity growth are declining because there is now a 'technology pause' between the 'green revolu - tion' and the emergence of future production systems, which prom - ise to be highly efficient, agile, autonomous, and isolated from the natural environment. /three.superior The authors acknowledge the technical assistance provided by Elena Tochilina and Irina Loginova, who greatly helped in preparing this chapter. The chapter was prepared within the framework of the project 'Study of Global Technology Trends: Development of Quantitative Approaches for Trend Analysis' of the Basic Research Program at the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and supported within the framework of a subsidy by the Russian Academic Excellence Project '5-100' .THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 9: Technological Future of the Agriculture and Food Sector in Russia136 The interlinked environmental challenges\u2014which affect (and are partially produced by) the agricul - ture and food sector and threaten the stability of the world's food sup - ply\u2014further aggravate the global food problem. As mentioned ear - lier, they include climate change, soil degradation, decreasing bio - productivity of the oceans, biodi - versity loss, groundwater scarcity and contamination, reduction of the effectiveness of agrochemicals due to evolution of pests, and the long-term threat of exhaustion of mineral resources for fertilizers, among others. Therefore the trend of declining productivity growth rates can even evolve into declin - ing overall production with dire consequences for the food security of developing nations. There are also a number of socio - economic and values-based chal - lenges. Among them are economic globalization and the volatility of global food markets affected by new, non-food uses of agricultural prod - ucts, such as biofuels; the growing polarization of food consumption patterns as a result of income, cul - tural, and educational gaps; the trans - formation of the demand for labour in agriculture, which threatens the sustainability of the rural lifestyles; growing biosafety threats against the backdrop of the rise of 'garage biotechnology', or amateur biotech endeavours; risks to arranging guar - anteed continuity of food supply for megacities and broader urban agglomerations; and many others. The answers provided by S&T and innovation to the global chal - lenges are expressed in terms of the rise of new platform (universal, or convergent) technologies. The developed nations demonstrate the rapid progress of radically new tech - nologies (new generation sequenc - ing, bioreactor-based synthetic food production, total recycling, biocon - trolled and artificial agroecosystems, vertical farms, swarm robotic intel - ligence, etc.), while the developing ones are still engaged in the adoption of the technologies of the previous wave (genetically modified crops, drip irrigation, and so on). S&T and innovation processes are enabled by accompanying new busi - ness models made possible by mod - ern information and communication technologies, which dramatically reduce both food losses and trans - action costs in agriculture and food logistics. The diffusion of convergent technologies\u2014including combina - tions of high-performance compu networking, and near-real-time data flows from satel - lites and aerial vehicles\u2014seems to be one of the most important drivers of these organizational innovations. In parallel, technology devel - opment creates certain threats of large-scale disruptions for developing countries. These could be beneficial in the long term and on the global scale, but are harmful to short-term economic stability and food security at the national level. There are numer - ous 'wild cards' (or 'black swans') of this sort that refer to structural shifts with low probability but high impact for the agriculture and food sector. The diffusion of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in global crop production and aquaculture could make exports of the non-GMO countries uncompetitive and dam - age their trade balance. Shifts in the natural habitats imposed by climate change can cause unexpected panzo - otic events, which are negative for the animal husbandry sector. Synthetic food technology commercialization can radically shift the demand-supply balance for factors of production, such as agricultural land, resulting in financial turmoil in some countries.It is particularly important to dis - tinguish the opportunities and threats on the national level that are emerg - ing from global challenges. Because of Russia's circumstances and loca - tion, the global food problem, cli - mate change, and the development of radical technologies tend to affect the country differently than the rest of the world, at least in the short term. Russia comes out ahead in this regard mainly because less technologically advanced and less industrially and institutionally developed countries often lose from global innovation in the short run, when they lose rents associated with inexpensive exports. The global food problem is con - stituted of the global demand for food rising above limits of sustainable sup - ply./one.superior It poses tremendous challenges to sustainable development, creating the risk of extreme famine events in Africa and South East Asia. /one.superior/one.superior For Russia, with its vast land and water resources, the rising global demand for food provides a chance to establish itself in new international agriculture and food markets in circumstances when the markets of developed nations, being divided between producers from the United States of America, the European Union, Brazil, Canada, and Australia, are virtually closed for the country's exporters. Climate change, being disastrous for most subtropical and tropical agri - culture and food producers because of higher frequencies of droughts, tsunamis, floods, and other extreme weather conditions, affects mostly non-agricultural areas of Russia, such as its Arctic regions. The impact of climate change on the main agricul - tural regions in chernozyom (fertile black soil) and grey wood soil zones is mild and mixed, though the scien - tific consensus on the long-term net effects for Russia's agriculture has not yet been reached. /one.superior/two.superior137 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 9: Technological Future of the Agriculture and Food Sector in RussiaDiffusion of many promising technologies, such as genetically modified crops associated with much lower production costs, pres - ents both opportunities and threats for the Russian agriculture and food sector\u2014which is an established grain and oil seed exporter with a very conservative political stance towards GMOs. Recent progress in aquacul - ture (including recirculating aqua - culture systems and plant-based fish feed) promise substitution of tradi - tional, inefficient, and environmen - tally harmful sea fishing practices. In Russia, aquaculture technologies are quite underdeveloped, although its fisheries sector is one of the largest in the world. This situation creates eco - nomic threats to sectoral businesses in the northern and far eastern regions of the country. In general, the described pat - tern is caused by excessive reliance on extensive production factors as a result of quite favourable natural pre - requisites and insufficient attention to longer-term competitiveness fac - tors related to progress in technology. The Russian agriculture and food sector is sensitive to the situation in global markets of both the means of production (machinery, biomateri - als, etc.) and the final products (grain, milk, meat, etc.). The capacity to both absorb foreign and domestic knowledge and to produce domes - tic innovations will be crucial to successfully facing the global chal - lenges. Intensive investment and new initiatives in this field are needed for the agriculture and food sector to become more resilient. It must have less reliance on imported tech - nologies, genetic material, veterinary drugs, fine biochemical and chemical substances, and less dependence on exports of agricultural raw materials rather than food products with high added value.The status of the Russian agriculture and food sectorRussia is one of the world's largest producers of food products (e.g., grain, oil seed, and meat). Its output reached US$80 billion in 2015, with exports of US$16.2 billion. This sec - tor has shown remarkable stability during the economic turbulence of recent years. Although the national economy has experienced some stag - nation effects since 2014, the agricul - ture and food sector demonstrated steady growth rates of 2% to 3% per year, and the share of loss-making agricultural companies has contin - ued to shrink, becoming significantly lower than that in many other sectors of the economy. Nowadays this sec - tor is an important pillar of political stability on the national level, which is highly dependent on the wide availability of affordable food of good quality. Russia is almost self-suffi - cient in food: from 81% to 100% of internal demand for food (depending on the product category) was covered by domestic production in 2015. The agriculture and food sector is crucial for social welfare in the rural areas because it employs around 9 million people. It is anticipated that growth rates of production and exports could accelerate further because of the growing demand in developing countries of Africa and Asia for the food products that Russia produces. Although the country has inher - ited a rather unbalanced and rigid agriculture and food sector from the Soviet era, post-Soviet institutional reforms allowed for the efficient reallocation of resources based on market competition and the adop - tion of state-of-the-art technological innovations. The optimization of supply chains was coupled with the concentration of production in the areas that were most favourable in terms of both their soil and climate conditions and their location. All these factors allowed Russia to move from the brink of famine in the late 1980s to solid food security in the 2010s, and to significantly increase agriculture and food exports. At the same time, the overall productivity of the sector remains relatively insufficient because of the uneven penetration of new technolo - gies and the slow diffusion of the new wave of organizational innovations, such as digitization of trading and logistics, equipment time sharing, life-long learning, and so on. These factors underpin the slow progress of production intensification across certain regions, sub-sectors, and par - ticular types of producers. Other challenges include low demand for innovations produced by the domestic applied agricultural research and development (R&D), as well as weak communication between the sectors of education, S&T, and agricultural business. The latter does not demonstrate substantial demand for domestic R&D and technology, while research institutes and univer - sities have been generally unable to provide a continuous supply of ready-to-use and commercially attractive technologies (they are more and more inclined towards research that is sup - ported by public funding but that has no specific objective or orientation). /one.superior/three.superior Thus the positive effects of weak national currency for production and exports growth have been countered because a quick import substitution of significant part of technologies, equipment, chemicals, and genetic materials is not feasible. The chal - lenge for domestic manufacturing of high-tech agriculture inputs, such as equipment, genetics, advanced fer - tilizers, and specialized information systems, is even more difficult to solve because of other barriers, such as economies of scale. Of great importance is the sector-wide application of enabling THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 9: Technological Future of the Agriculture and Food Sector in Russia138 technologies such as broadband digital communications, /one.superior the Internet of Things, global geoposi - tioning and other satellite services, unmanned aerial monitoring, smart digital trade infrastructures, robot - ics, biotechnology and bioenergy, and nanotechnology and new mate - rials. However, efficient production systems based on the state-of-the-art technologies are concentrated within a limited range of large companies, mostly in the southern regions and around the largest urban agglomera - tions, while small producers in other areas are not able to absorb available technology innovations (Figure/uni00A01). An answer to such challenges can be found in the re-arrangement of the sectoral innovation system, which is notable for its poor link - ages between S&T organizations and businesses. Bridging the gap between academia and industry may allow Russia to become one of the major exporters of globally competi - tive high-quality agricultural prod - ucts, production means, and services within two decades. There is also a need for closer technological coop - eration and market integration with other emerging economies, because this could allow Russia to gain access to large export markets for various means of agricultural production. No less important are further efforts to improve the domestic investment climate to attract direct investment from developed countries with grad - ual localization of high-tech products and technologies. Prospects of S&T development A complex picture of global chal - lenges creates both threats and opportunities for Russia's agriculture and food sector. Whether Russian regulators, S&T organizations, and agriculture and food producers will be able to proactively adapt to threats and efficiently use evolving opportunities depends on the ability of different actors to clearly identify emerging global trends, map existing strengths and weaknesses, be agile in adapting the developmental strate - gies, and cooperate efficiently on a wide range of issues. For the agriculture and food sec - tor's stakeholders to become more able to participate in cooperative future-oriented capacity building, the Government of the Russian Federation set the task of develop - ing long-term S&T foresight of the agriculture and food sector in 2015. Depending on the future evolu - tion of various global and national trends; the composition of existing strengths, weaknesses, opportuni - ties, and threats; and the most likely policy choices made at key threshold points\u2014macroeconomic, institu - tional, and political ones\u2014two pos - sible development scenarios can be considered for the period from 2020 to 2030. /one.superior Russia can become a global sup - plier of high-value-added products, technologies, and services. This is the goal of the 'Global Breakthrough' scenario. Another option is less ambi - tious and easier to achieve, yet also desirable: this entails saturating the domestic market with competitive domestic products and technolo - gies\u2014the 'Local Growth' scenario. Both trajectories are possible and may start at the same point in time from identical external conditions. The difference between the higher and the lower trajectories is determined Source: HSE, 2017a. Note: Likelihood of technology introduction: n High n Medium n Low.Figure 1: Propensity to introduce new technologies by economic entities of different types in Russia's agriculture sector Technology to be introducedPrivate farm holdings (self-sufficient farms)Owner-operated farms/ individual enterprises (semi-commercial farming)Medium agricultural enterprises, agricultural cooperatives (commercial farming)Major agricultural holdings (commercial, export- oriented farming) Organic agriculture Precision agriculture Large-scale 'assembly-line' livestock breeding Zero-tillage farmingLoose housing of livestockDrip irrigation Custom on-demand preparation of fertilizers Integrated pest managementUrban agriculture (vertical farming) Automation and computerization Genetically modied and hybrid seed useBiofuels139 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 9: Technological Future of the Agriculture and Food Sector in Russia by the quality of the institutional framework and economic mecha - nisms by the year 2020; the gap between these trajectories will grow over time, making the leap from the less favourable scenario to the more ambitious one more and more resource-intensive (Figure/uni00A02). In the Local Growth scenario, increasing commodity prices and devaluation-driven import substitu - tion would stabilize the economy and allow it to return to a model of intensive imports of advanced tech - nologies, equipment, and materials and large-scale exports of agricul - ture and food products. By 2020, the annual growth rate of the agriculture and food sector output would achieve 3% to 4% because of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to help improve the investment climate. There would be a steady positive growth in the amount and quality of the harvest of most agricultural crops. In the food industry, a steady increase of output is expected. There would be a decrease in the growth rates of animal farming, which is affected by both the saturation of the internal market and the existing barriers to export expansion. No significant structural changes in the sector and no intensive revitalization of national agricultural applied R&D based on cooperation with business would be expected (the level of non-public funding of agricultural R&D in this scenario could grow slightly from the current 17% to about 20%). /one.superior Slow import substitution of basic and tradi - tional technologies would continue, while dependence on state-of-the-art solutions would persist. The points of growth under this scenario would be traditional commodities markets, which would not require adaptations to shifts in consumer preferences. In the Global Breakthrough scenario, the strong growth of the agriculture and food sector would be supported by reformed S&T and innovation policies, a sound institu - tional environment, and an efficient innovation infrastructure and would go hand in hand with timely struc - tural changes in production chains. Because more efficient business models and new technologies would enable highly competitive produc - tion, no export barriers would hinder the expansion of the sector. Natural resources (vast fertile lands, avail - able water resources) and cheap yet high-quality domestically produced fertilizers would be utilized in full. The growth of the agriculture and food sector would be accelerated by 1 to 2 percentage points in rela - tion to the Local Growth scenario. Significant structural shifts would be envisaged for S&T and innovation activities, particularly those that take place on the basis of effective stimuli for academy-industry cooperation. The share of non-public funding of agricultural R&D could reach 35% to 45%. Accelerated replacement of obsolete production facilities, tax incentives, and other benefits aimed at promoting high-tech import sub - stitution could lead to an intensifica - tion of innovation activity. Increased competition due to saturation of the domestic market could also contrib - ute to growth in innovation. In addition to traditional markets, domestic producers would be able to occupy various highly profitable niches in knowledge-based services for the agriculture and food sector; among these are cutting-edge solu - tions in biotechnology, information Figure 2: S&T development scenarios for the Russian agriculture and food sector Source: HSE, 2017a.2016Global Breakthrough scenario Local Growth scenarioRussia's share in world agriculture & food exports 1.3% 2020 20303-4% 1.5%Implemented entirely Implemented partiallyAvailability of necessary institutional framework and economic mechanisms to ensure global competitiveness of the agriculture & food sectorScenario leap is still possible with mobilization policiesScenario leap is extremely resource-intensive because of the increasing technological gapScenario leap is feasible under favourable external conditionsTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 9: Technological Future of the Agriculture and Food Sector in Russia140 and communication technologies, robotics, aerospace, remediation of natural environment, and ecosys - tems design (Table/uni00A01). These would allow the sector to diversify overall output and secure export revenues. Technology-supported gradual tran - sition from cycle-vulnerable business models of bulk commodities produc - tion to those based on the creation and export of intellectual property and tacit knowledge in various forms would also contribute to the sustain - able growth of the sector. Conclusions The Russian agriculture and food sector may be defined as stable for the time being because of the strong institutional reforms that have been implemented during the last 25 years. Post-Soviet Russia has managed to establish an effective production-distribution system in agriculture, thus deflecting the risks of acute food shortages and achieving food security. However, the current productivity level in agriculture is not yet satisfac - tory. Undoubtedly there is still room for improvement in the institutional design of the sector to resolve such negative issues as regional and sub-sectoral monopolies, administrative pressures on local businesses, high transaction costs due to deficiencies of the commodities exchange infra - structure, and so on. In addition, a number of problems concerning both the adoption of imported technolo - gies and the development of domestic ones that would be competitive on the market need to be addressed. Therefore the current main goal is to shift the agriculture and food sector from a sustainable production system to a sustainable innovation system. For this purpose, it is nec - essary to revive the sector's applied agricultural R&D capacity, making agricultural R&D activities finan - cially sustainable. Reforms aimed at the revival of applied agricultural R&D can be implemented only by promoting close cooperation between agricultural science and business under a suitable institutional frame - work. Fostering the ability of the agriculture and food sector to create new knowledge and technologies and promote them to competitive markets is a necessary condition for achieving the developmental parameters of the Global Breakthrough scenario. To this end, S&T and innovation policy for the agriculture and food sector in Russia must, within several years, evolve towards an evidence-based paradigm designed to encourage intensive development, resource effi - ciency, and environmentally sound practices; provide targeted support for innovating companies; and sup - press the opportunities of benefiting from non-innovative rents (such as land ownership) at the cost of other market actors and consumers. The scenarios described above will assist policy makers in establish - ing relevant measures for the uptake of technologies by national agriculture and food producers. Development of national S&T capacities will depend on proper institutional solutions and economic mechanisms for technol - ogy transfer and innovation; a har - monious system of S&T foresight and monitoring will play important role in this regard. Notes 1 'Food nationalism' here refers to a government stance that emphasizes import substitution and protectionism in food and trade policy, so that the country primarily targets growth in domestic production to ensure food self-sufficiency for major products, rather than importing them from international markets. 2 HSE, 2017a.Source: HSE, 2017a. Note: a 'Deep processing' refers to the production of high-value-added products with the use of sophisticated technologies\u2014such as producing not only flour from grain, but also extracting amino acids from grain for the purposes of biotech industry; or producing pharmaceuticals from fish-based raw materials.

At the same time, many new technologies are being introduced rather slowly.

Over and above their contribution to a country's gross domestic product (GDP), which is less than the contribution of the manufacturing and services sec - tors, the multiple strategic functions of agriculture in economic, social, and environmental development determine that its participation is far greater than its share of GDP. The agri-food sector faces the global challenge of providing enough food, feed, fuel, and fibre to meet growing and changing demand. The agricultural innovation system needs to develop and distribute innovations able to enhance productivity and sustainability along the supply chain, while helping the sector cope with climate change issues. /one.superior In develop - ing countries, when talking about rural development it is fundamental to consider the additional challenge of strengthening rural societies and addressing the sustainability chal - lenge, paying particular attention to social inclusion and equity. The food processing industry is typically described as a relatively mature and slow-growing area of business that displays a relatively low level of research and development (R&D) investment and is quite con - servative in the type of innovations it introduces to the market. The main reason for this characterization relates to end-customers, who are usually wary of radically new prod - ucts and changes in consumption patterns. Nevertheless, the recent stringency of legal requirements related to safety and health trans - forms food product and process innovation into a highly complex, time-consuming, and risky endeav - our. Moreover, recent changes in the nature of both food demand and food supply, coupled with an ever-increasing level of competitiveness, have rendered innovation not only an unavoidable corporate activity, but also one that is increasingly vital for overall agribusiness profitability. /two.superior This chapter analyses the main sources of innovation for agri-food systems and current trends in tech - nological change, with an emphasis on biotechnology. It also includes a review of the scientific and techno - logical activities necessary for innova - tion in the agri-food sector. Finally, the chapter adopts a system's approach and includes an analysis of the role of the different actors of innovation in the sector. Innovation in the agri-food sector An innovation system for food and agriculture includes both participants of the supply chain (suppliers, pro - ducers, agro-industrial processors, distributors, exporters) and govern - ment workers and those involved with universities, research institutes, outreach and development agencies, and so on. Policies, legal frame - works, and attitudes that encourage and guide knowledge incorporation processes, technology, and value-added production also complement the concept. /three.superior In the case of agriculture, inno - vations commonly originate with suppliers; these can be considered 'process innovations' because they relate to production techniques\u2014for example, the adoption of improved seeds; equipment for irrigation, harvesting, and packaging; and information management technolo - gies\u2014as well as improvements for quality assurance and farm manage - ment. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), suppliers of farmers develop product innovations such as improved seeds and animal breeds, agricultural machines, irriga - tion systems, and greenhouses. The same happens in food processing industries, which produce product innovations such as particular foods to satisfy special niche markets (organic foods, for instance), functional food ingredients, and nutraceuticals (any products with extra health benefits derived from food sources) as well as enhanced raw materials from agriculture for industries such as the chemical, pulp, and paper, and phar - maceutical industries. The value chain: Complex and evolving Innovations are now common along the value chain, which is extremely complex and multi-layered with a wide range of actors who participate THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 10: Innovation in the Agri-Food Sector in Latin America and the Caribbean144 in innovation in the agri-food sector. According to the OECD, govern - ments implement policies and regu - lations that affect the business and innovation environment (tax and agricultural policies, for example). Other actors involved in the innova - tion process are brokers, input suppli - ers, markets, and consumers. Suppliers, who can be considered the first of the direct actors in the chain, include suppliers of seeds, fertilizers, crop protection, gene-modifying technologies, machinery, equipment, veterinary vaccines, probiotics, infor - mation technology, and energy. They are connected by networks to produc - ers or agriculture firms that work in agriculture, livestock, and fisheries and aquaculture. These producers are in turn connected to agro-industrial firms that provide processing, pack - aging, storage, and conservation services. Distributors and brokers then provide traders, storage services, and distribution agents. Finally, local and export markets service retailers, consumers, and export/import agen - cies. Underlying all these elements are financial services, which include development banking, commercial banks, public funds, international cooperation (international research centres, such as the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center), and multi-lateral aid. Over all these direct actors is the regulatory and policy framework, which establishes incentives and 'rules of the game' that also have an influence because they set the envi - ronment for firms' activities. External sources of innovation include public and private research organizations, extension services, international research centres, technology brokers, universities, and technology transfer offices. These external actors supply important knowledge-based services to support innovations along the value chain. Sources of innovation for the agri-food sectorBecause of the complexity of the agri-food value chain, many technological inputs are used to support innova - tion. A review of recent advances is presented in Table/uni00A01 to illustrate the diversity of technologies impacting different activities of this industry.Table 1: Summary of innovations for the agri-food sector, 2012-17 Technology Main innovations Purpose or expected results Agrochemicals Fertilizers Nano-fertilizers that supply one or more nutrients to plants and enhance their growth and yields Nano-materials that improve the performance of conventional fertilizersNano-fertilizers can signicantly improve crop growth and yields; enhance the eciency of fertilizer use; reduce nutrient losses; and/or minimize adverse impacts on the environment.

Biotechnology in Latin America and the CaribbeanApplications of agricultural bio - technology have demonstrated its potential to support improvements in agricultural productivity and the sector's economic growth. However, biotechnology opens new challenges and issues that must be addressed by R&D organizations as well as systems and policy makers. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the biotechnology indus - try began to develop in the second half of the 1980s as a consequence of the reduction of barriers that limited foreign investment. The growth of the biotechnology industry was also associated with changes in the laws of intellectual property rights to grant patent protection to biotech inven - tions and plant breeders' rights to new plant varieties. Patent protection The wide range of innovations introduced to this sector meets the requirements of a new competitive environment. The main drivers for efficiency in the agriculture and agri-food industry relate to increased pressure by customers on suppliers for sustainably produced products, as well as competitive pressure that triggers the need to reduce costs and the desire to expand into new export markets, which in turn implies com - plying with international food safety and health regulations. Biotechnology innovations for agri-food A set of important innovations is based on biotechnology. The phrase 'modern biotechnology' refers to various scientific techniques used to produce specific desired traits in plants, animals, or microorganisms using genetic knowledge. Since its introduction to agriculture and food production in the early 1990s, biotech - nology has been utilized to develop new tools for improving productivity in crops such as soybeans, corn, cot - ton, canola, papaya, squash, potato, and apple that are improved versions of the traditional varieties. In addi - tion, improved yeast and enzymes are used to make different food products through biotechnology. In the area of agriculture, bio - technology has been used to pro - duce genetically modified organisms (GMOs), thus increasing productivity and introducing plants that are resis - tant to pests, drought, and contami - nated soils. The use of biotechnology has led to an increase in yields and reduced cost in important crops such as maize, soybeans, cotton, and canola. Just recently genetically modified (GM) apples and potatoes have been approved for environmen - tal release and consumption in the United States of America. The use of biotechnology in pro - cessing has brought better quality, safety, and long life to food products. New developments are also expected to bring to light raw materials with specific traits useful to specific processing industries. But modern biotechnology has been undergoing a heated debate about the safety of products that has led to strict regula - tions and entry barriers in important markets (notably in Europe). Table/uni00A02 presents a classification of new plant breeding techniques that are being developed as a response to that restrictive environment. They include: (1) improved plants that Table 2: New plant breeding techniques Technique Purpose Sequence-specic nuclease (SSN) Facilitates precise insertion and editing of genes through mutation or replacement Oligo-directed mutagenesis (ODM) Introduces a similar sequence that can be used as pattern to repair dierences Cisgenesis and intragenesis Uses genes of the same species to induce new traits in specic crops RNA-dependent DNA methylation Induces transcriptional silencing of genes Reverse breeding Provides a precise method of producing hybrids Agro-inltration Uses Agrobacterium as a tool for the temporary expression of genes in plant tissues Grafting on genetically modied (GM) rootstock GM rootstocks can be used for improving performance of non-GM scions Genomics or synthetic biology Implies the introduction of multiple genes to modify metabolic paths Induced early flowering Transgenic early-flowering F1 seedlings are backcrossed in year 2 with another line Source: Authors, based on Schaart et al., 2016.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 10: Innovation in the Agri-Food Sector in Latin America and the Caribbean146 brought confidence to investors, which led to an intensification of research and technology flows. Research in biotechnology has been supported in different coun - tries in the region, resulting in the development of some new research institutions (universities and research centres). But the creation of biotech - nology firms has not been supported to the same degree, so there has been only limited success in building local successful biotech industries. On the other hand, starting in the 1990s, large multinational corporations with large research budgets entered the markets of the largest countries in the region and began to play an increasingly important role as agents of biotechnology diffusion. As a consequence, even though the land area cultivated with GMOs has grown at an accelerated pace, this expansion has happened only for three crops (soybeans, corn, and cotton), two traits (herbicide resistant and insect resistant, or combina - tions of both) and eight countries\u2014Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, and Uruguay\u2014with a large concentra - tion in Argentina and Brazil. Chile has allowed GM plants exclusively for seed production and export. All the GM crops launched commercially in the region have been developed by private multinational firms. Although important investments have been made in research, no GM product developed by national inno - vation systems in Latin America has yet been transferred to producers in the region. This reveals that one important problem faced by Latin American innovation systems is the lack of interaction between institu - tions that generate knowledge and the users of the innovation. A new system of incentives is needed to encourage knowledge generators to embrace diverse demands and propose effective solutions to the problems of producers and companies of different sizes. This does not mean that technol - ogies have not been produced by the innovation sector in Latin American countries. However, most of the bio - technology innovations produced by the public and private sectors in these countries are conventional applica - tions of biotechnology (tissue culture, fermentation, and the use of molecu - lar tools for breeding). Countries with a recorded history of investment in human resources as well as innovation and techni - cal change\u2014namely, Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, and Mexico\u2014have an enhanced capacity in terms of the number of techniques used and mas - tered. There have been some notable achievements in these countries in the development of genomics and some GM crops, but a problem arises in developing commercial applications for those technologies. Countries with an intermediate capacity\u2014such as Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\u2014have the capacity to utilize conventional and modern techniques, but their capaci - ties are geographically dispersed and highly concentrated in academic set - tings. In turn, the rest of the coun - tries in Latin America\u2014Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Paraguay\u2014have a poor innovation capacity for conventional biotechnology innova - tions and even less capacity for mod - ern biotechnology. Regulatory systems in the region are rather restrictive. Some countries (such as Mexico for corn between 1998 and 2009, as well as Ecuador and Peru declaring moratoria for planting all GM crops) have declared moratoria on the use of GM plants in their agriculture. Such precautionary measures have proven to be ineffec - tive because these countries import GM food products, but they erect barriers to the environmental release of seeds. This has established obsta - cles to the development of locally modified plants, which demotivates investments in innovation. There is an intense debate in Mexico about GM food production and its impact on the environment and the popula - tion. Thus it is necessary to strengthen the study of GMOs through mul - tidisciplinary and committed work that can objectively demonstrate the challenges and feasibility of this type of production. Regarding research, regional institutions working on agricultural biotechnology in Latin America cover a wide range of techniques, crops, and productivity limitations. This range reflects the wide diver - sity of genetic resources in the region and the notable efforts made by the research systems and organizations to address strategic regional and national crops and traits. This diverse innovation port - folio has, however, led to a disper - sion of efforts mainly because no concurrent significant increase in the level of human and financial resources is in place. Countries need to set priorities to focus their efforts and resources towards feasible pro - grammes with stronger ties to farm - ers and firms. In terms of the environmental and food safety evaluations needed to commercialize GM products, most countries require improve - ments to their regulatory bodies and oversight mechanisms. Even in those countries with an existing critical mass of mechanisms (institutions, regulations, infrastructure) to ensure biosafety, social and political pres - sures have caused the dissemination of technologies approved by the bio - safety regulatory authorities to slow.147 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 10: Innovation in the Agri-Food Sector in Latin America and the CaribbeanA faster response from regula - tory authorities is required, because a poor capacity to conduct biosafety assessments, strongly influenced by the lack of political will to implement modern biotechnology applications, is demotivating investment by public and private sectors to boost R&D and biotechnology diffusion. Even if the institutional framework is com - plete, it is essential to assume that a major overhaul of the organization of the structures will be required for its implementation\u2014the framework is currently extremely complex and bureaucratic, which contributes to the uneven diffusion of its benefits, since only a few actors have the qualifications to manage innovation in this environment. In the case of intellectual prop - erty management, countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico make use of instruments and negotia - tion capacity. However, the highest shares of intellectual property protec - tion instruments in these countries are held by non-residents. This sug - gests that more effective incentives for creative processes should be imple - mented. In most Latin American countries, agricultural research has taken a very academic route. The indicators are telling: while produc - tion of scientific articles has solidly increased in the last 10 years, the generation of intellectual property and effective technological solutions for producers represents a very small percentage of research results. This relative scarcity of innova - tive solutions is the consequence of an incentive system for researchers that emphasizes academic produc - tion and sidesteps problems in the sector. More technologies are now urgently needed for the efficient use of water to improve land, correct pollution problems, increase pro - duction yield, and improve compre - hensive farm management.Moreover, a lack of reliability and quality of supplies means that success - ful industries resort to imports or to large local suppliers to obtain their supplies. No effort is made to develop new suppliers, which would gener - ate market incentives to improve production. This is an opportunity for innovators. Technological innovations are systematically incorporated by com - mercial agriculture producers, who resort to technological resources in other countries. They also turn to these other countries for technical support as well as for machinery, agrochemicals, and seed suppliers. Some local producers work by con - tract to export vegetables, and their relationship with a broker or their customers in the importing market gives them access to technological packages supplied by sales companies that act as intermediaries. In both cases, links with domestic institutions are scarce. In some countries, public and some private financial organizations have various support schemes for farmers and companies, but they do not have effective instruments to finance tech - nology development projects, create new businesses, or adopt technology. The requirements of these organiza - tions often exclude a wide range of producers (small farmers), which can widen performance gaps. A sound innovation policy requires that shared socioeconomic objectives provide the motivation for better articulation of the innovation system and the space for designing more effective policy instruments than what now exists. The formulation of policies that raise the public's confidence and that successfully insert useful and sustain - able biotechnology innovations will be a major challenge that countries in Latin America and the Caribbean will face in the near future. Challenges for agri-food biotechnology innovations: The case of MexicoMexico is equipped with knowledge and expertise in agricultural biotech - nology\u2014it has important research facilities at universities such as the National University of Mexico, the Center for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, and the Metropolitan Autonomous University, as well as public research centres such as the Center for Research and Assistance in Technology and Design of the State of Jalisco; the Yucatan Center for Scientific Research; and the National Institute of Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research. Mexico also has regulatory systems in place to assess biotechnology products according to the country's Biosafety of GMOs Law. However, Mexico is at crossroads as a result of negative perceptions of GMO technology, including fears about the environmental impacts of geneti-cally engineered crops that some opponents have spread among some sectors of society. This has erected additional barriers to new investors, and the number of Mexican biotech - nology firms is low and concentrated in applying traditional techniques (fermentation, use of enzymes, tissue culture, and molecular breeding). The most important GM crop produced in Mexico is cotton, which covers more than 90% of the planted area in the country. It is a success story because the use of chemical pesticides has been reduced by more than 50% and important cost advantages have been brought to producers. /one.superior The second GM crop that has reached commercial release in Mexico is soybeans. Permits were granted in 2012 for production on 253,500 hectares. However, Mexican honey producers have expressed great con - cern, particularly since the European Court of Justice ruled that honey\u2014which contains trace amounts of THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 10: Innovation in the Agri-Food Sector in Latin America and the Caribbean148 pollen from genetically engineered crops authorized for human con - sumption in the European Union\u2014must be labelled if the amount of genetically engineered pollen sur - passes 0.9%. Because of this ruling, all honey shipments from Mexico must undergo laboratory testing to identify and quantify the type of genetically engineered presence. /one.superior/one.superior The Mexican government was about to grant permits for the com - mercial planting of GM corn in very specific areas that are distant to fields considered centres of ori - gin and diversification for the crop. In September 2013, a federal judge responding to a legal action initiated by a consortium of activist groups effectively suspended the plantings of all GM corn in Mexico by placing a provisional injunction. After four years it is still not clear whether those permits will be granted. This lack of clarity is an obstacle not only for the commercial use of seeds developed by multinational firms but also for technologies generated by Mexican research groups. This discussion highlights the role of institutions and policies in the diffusion and generation of new biotechnological innovations. It also shows that emphasis has to be given to the transfer of knowledge to commercial firms because they are a key factor in the development of agri-food biotechnology. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean need new policies aimed not only at strengthening research capacities but also at translating research results into viable biotechnologies to solve some of the critical problems of agriculture.ConclusionsResearch capacities created in Latin American countries need to translate into actual solutions to the problems of the agri-food sector. In order to achieve this goal, a new system of incentives is necessary to encourage knowledge generators to embrace diverse demands and propose effective solutions to the problems of producers and companies of different sizes. Although the institutional frame - work that is essential for regulating new technologies, such as innova - tions in biotechnology, is complete, it still needs a fundamental overhaul of its structure so that it can be imple - mented. Currently the institutions are so complex and bureaucratic that only a few actors\u2014primarily multi - national firms\u2014have the qualifica - tions needed to navigate the system. The result is that the framework, instead of helping to diffuse the ben - efits of new technologies through all levels of the sector, ends up ensuring that their diffusion is uneven. Innovation policy requires that shared socioeconomic objectives, such as those related to sustainabil - ity and more equitable development of the agri-food sector, provide the motivation for a better articulation of the innovation system and increasing the space for designing more effective policy instruments than now exists. Notes 1 Moreddu, 2016. 2 Costa and Jongen, 2006. 3 The Oslo Manual defines innovation as the implementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service) or process, a new marketing method or a new organizational method in business practices, workplace organization or external relations (OECD and Eurostat, 2005). 4 OECD, 2013. 5 OECD, 2013, p. 13. 6 Food Insight, no date, available at http:// www.foodinsight.org/Background_on_Food_ Biotechnology. 7 To get a more precise view on biotech innovations, a review was conducted of recent biotechnology patents (2011-2017). There were 736 identified patents. The leading inventors are Monsanto Technology LLC, Pioneer Hi Bred Int., BASF Plant Science, Du Pont, and Syngenta. Together these firms have more than 50% of the patent files, which is an indicator of the high level of concentration of innovation. 8 Schaart et al., 2016. 9 Otero, 2008. 10 Solleiro et al., 2014. 11 Mexican honey producers filed a court injunction against the approval of GE soybeans for commercial production. This has led to a long legal procedure and the judge has ordered a temporary suspension of the permits arguing that the public consultation of the local communities was not adequate. 'As a result of this issue, approximately 15,000 hectares were not planted to GE soybeans in 2012 and there have been no more applications for commercial or pilot releases of GE soybeans during 2013 to 2015' (USDA FAS, 2015, p. 5).

Since 2015, the Global Innovation Index (GII) has ranked Uganda as an 'inno - vation outperformer,' a title given to countries that, over a number of years including the two most recent, have been identified as innovation achievers and pillar outperformers. /one.superior This laudable progress stems from sustained economic growth coupled with a commitment to private-sector development and innovation policy reforms. /two.superior Though encouraging, this nascent progress will translate into real benefits for the broader Ugandan population only if policy makers understand and address specific con - straints in the innovation systems of the agri-food sector\u2014the largest sec - tor in the Ugandan economy. Agriculture is the backbone of Uganda's economy, employing about 73% of the country's labour force predominantly in rural areas, but it made up 27% of the country's GDP in 2014. /three.superior Given that many house - holds in Uganda rely on agricultural production for their livelihoods, innovation in this sector can have direct and potent welfare effects. This potential is particularly striking given that the Ugandan agri-food sector is hampered by low productivity and profitability. Annual growth in agri - cultural output has also been lower than expected, declining from 7.9% in 2001 to 3% in 2014 and falling short of the 6% growth target for the per capita agricultural GDP set by the African governments under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme. Increasing agricultural produc - tivity through improved technology and production practices has been a persistent priority at the national level. To be effective, this prior - ity must prompt policy actions that specifically and explicitly account for the underlying innovation systems that will ultimately generate real productivity improvements. Distinctive features of agri-food value chains in AfricaThe agri-food value chain compo - nents range from the supply of agri - cultural inputs such as seeds by input suppliers, wholesalers, and retailer agro-dealers to farming activities such as planting, farming, and har - vesting and to post-harvest activities such as bulking and processing of raw output, branding, and marketing of value-added agri-food products that reach end consumers (see Figure/uni00A01). With these important dimensions in mind, it is easy to appreciate the marked heterogeneity that charac - terizes agricultural value chains in Africa. Indeed, this heterogeneity is often so pronounced that it results in three distinct and parallel systems of Source: Authors, based on A.T. Kearney, 2016.Figure 1: Agriculture value chain with links between consumers and producers Production Smallholder farmers Farmers' associations Input providersHarvesting and transport Smallholder farmers Farmers' associations Logistic companiesPrimary processing and storage Primary processors Machinery suppliersSecondary processing Secondary processors Machinery suppliersDistribution, packaging, and handling Packaging companies Logistic companiesWholesale and retail markets Grocery stores and supermarkets Food and beverage companiesTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 11: Enhancing Innovation in the Ugandan Agri-Food Sector152 value chains. In the A system shown in Figure/uni00A02, local value chains consist of low-value-added staple foods; low-income and low-productivity farm - ers; and local, low-value-added spot markets. The B system comprises larger local farmers with access to improved input markets and products as well as higher-value crops; these farmers can tap into higher-value-added domestic agri-food markets. In the C system, much larger (often plantation-style) farms produce specialized products (often under production contracts) for high-value export markets and must therefore satisfy high international sanitary and phytosanitary standards. In develop - ing countries, these systems typically operate in parallel, often with little interaction, further isolating the most vulnerable and least productive pro - ducers in the A system. These realities are key to understanding how value chains operate in Uganda and what upgrading options exist for farmers trapped in less productive systems. Innovation constraints in African agri- food value chainsThe agricultural sub-systems described above often function in par - allel with few links other than relying occasionally on another sub-system to balance demand and supply gaps. The existence of these heterogeneous sub-systems, which are only weakly connected, poses unique challenges for supporting innovation and upgra - dation of these value chains. In many African countries, pro - ducers are saddled with poor infra - structure, weak institutions, barriers to entry, coordination failures, and unfavourable social and political conditions. Although these hurdles may be surmounted individually in some cases, they can be pervasive and subject to substantial collective action problems, with the end result that they complicate the entire culture in which business activities take place. Barriers to entry are a disadvan - tage to small-scale producers that have little capital to invest, use tra - ditional techniques, and depend on family labour. Such an environment causes difficulties in meeting prod - uct standards and makes it difficult to compete with larger-scale, more efficient, and more technologically sophisticated multinational corpora - tions. Without market knowledge or competitive products, many small-scale producers fail to take advantage of larger markets or the techniques that could help them do so.

Because of poor past performance, many value chains do not engender trusting relationships. This can lead to excessive risk mitigation, caus - ing inefficiencies and reduced value addition. For commodities with low value added, such as raw agriculture staples, the terms of trade with Western countries are typically asymmetric. In such circumstances, Western part - ners capture only the high-value por - tion of the chain, thereby excluding small-scale farmers from participat - ing in larger markets. These obstacles constrain the ability of system A and B value chain actors from innovating in a way that not only increases their agricultural productivity but also upgrades their systems. Innovation constraints in the Ugandan agri-food sectorUgandan farms are typically small: Roughly half of Ugandan farmers own less than three acres of land, a quarter own three to five acres, and a quarter own more than five acres. /one.superior The total area of arable land planted with either seasonal or permanent tree crops has increased at an annual rate of over 2% over the past 20 years. /one.superior/one.superior This increase in crop area, however, was outpaced by population growth, and crop area per capita declined nearly 25% during this period as a result. /one.superior/two.superior These trends have contributed to an annual decline in both food and agricultural production per capita of about 2% since 2002. /one.superior/three.superior Thus at both the national and household levels there is a pressing need to increase agricultural productivity in Uganda. Mirroring the above chal - lenges, Ugandan farmers face a host of constraints that limit their ability and incentives to invest in their productivity. Among these constraints are unreliable growing conditions; natural disasters; liquid - ity constraints; high market risk and uninsured production; lack of access to high-quality agricultural inputs (only poor quality of agricultural inputs are available); lack of training, information, and awareness; limited output market opportunities; and few spillovers from public agri - cultural research and development (R&D). To the extent that farm-level constraints discourage farm - ers from adopting new technology, they also discourage private-sector investments in the development, distribution, and marketing of improved agricultural inputs and other technologies. Downstream markets for agricultural outputs are similarly suppressed by low on-farm productivity and concerns about the stability and quality of outputs. As a result, only one-third of agricultural production reaches market. /one.superior Key Ugandan agriculture innovation constraints at the value chain level are discussed in the next section. The low quality of agricultural inputs The low quality of agricultural inputs in Uganda has been documented in several recent studies. /one.superior Thirteen percent (nine out of the 67 fertilizer retailers surveyed) reported receiving low-quality supplies from wholesal - ers./one.superior In practice, the poor quality appears to be a result of counter - feited or adulterated or generic ver - sions of the supplies. The ubiquity of low-quality inputs seems to be more a result of weak enforcement of guidelines and regulations on input producers and dealers than the lack of technology to produce high-quality supplies. Better enforcement and the adherence to higher standards would help overcome this bottleneck. Additionally, institutional changes aimed at improving the quality of agricultural inputs, markets, and supply chains are central to the inno - vation process. Importantly, such institutional changes make input sup - pliers more responsive to the needs of farmers because they increase competition in the market. In many cases, upstream innovation in inputs (e.g., improved germplasm) involves significant public-sector support, but the ultimate return on this public R&D investment is dependent on the efficiency and resilience of the input supply chains that deliver appropriate improved inputs to producers. Constraints to public and private innovation in the agricultural input supply chain\u2014in particular in the area of seeds, crops, and fertilizers\u2014remains a bottleneck to improving the output of Ugandan agriculture. On the one hand, access to inferior inputs (e.g., counterfeit or ineffec - tive fertilizer) remains a significant challenge where issues of quality and suitability prevail. On the other hand, the rise of new, sometimes domestic, hybrid seed varieties along with organizational innovations and improved distribution of agricultural inputs might offer novel possibilities. Imperfect financial markets In Uganda, the majority of rural households do not have access to credit. At the time of the 2005/06 Uganda National Household Survey, 24% of rural households had applied for credit from informal sources compared with 4.4% and 1.8% that had applied to micro-finance insti - tutions and banks, respectively; only 15% and 12% of household heads have the capacity to borrow from micro-finance institutions and banks, respectively. /one.superior Following the conceptual framework of Boucher et al. (2009), of the non-borrowers in the 2008/09 Uganda Census of Agriculture, about half were credit THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 11: Enhancing Innovation in the Ugandan Agri-Food Sector154 unconstrained, meaning that\u2014given their production opportunities\u2014they did not need a loan, did not borrow because of high interest rates, or could not profitability pay back the loan. /one.superior The other half of non-borrowers were credit constrained as a result of lack of collateral, lack of information about credit sources, negative past experiences with receiving credit, or unavailability of lending facili - ties./one.superior Thus financial markets in rural Uganda should not only be equipped to provide finance to individual households in a community experi - encing hardship but should also look critically at the demand for start-up capital or insurance against risk that is common across households in a com - munity. Prices and market uncertain - ties contribute to low investment by making borrowing more uncertain and therefore less attractive. This environment of uncertainty inevi - tably affects household liquidity. Hybrid seeds and inorganic fertil - izers that must be purchased each season are two technologies that are most likely to be affected by liquid - ity constraints at the household level. Furthermore, imperfect financial markets also impact the way labour is allocated across crops. The poor - est households, which are less able to insure themselves against price risk, would tend to allocate less labour to high-return cash crop production, such as coffee production. /two.superior Information constraints and a weak knowledge baseInformation constraints and also, sometimes, a weak knowledge base among farmers are further bottlenecks. Information constraints reduce productive investments by farm - ers by imposing constraints on (1) information about inputs/products and (2) information about practices/processes. Addressing this lack is the focus of public- and private-sector initiatives as well as research and policy recommendations. /two.superior/one.superior Limited information on inputs and products, in turn, negatively affects decisions about what prac - tices and processes to adopt. For example, researchers found that only 2% of farmers in their sample cor - rectly identified the variety of maize that they were growing. /two.superior/two.superior If farmers believe they are growing a different variety than the one they are actually planting, they may apply practices and technology appropriate to the wrong variety; this can affect their produc - tivity, as has been shown among cowpea producers in Tanzania. /two.superior/three.superior Often farmers also lack the capa - bilities to assess the potential and practical use of new technology or innovation, leading to underinvest - ment and limited adoption of new technologies. Output markets, processing, and marketing Agricultural output markets (e.g., markets for coffee, maize, or mangos) can play an important role in facili - tating agricultural innovation. They are the first and the most important link through which the farmers can access domestic agro-processors, neighbouring countries, or global markets via processor-exporters. However, output sold by farmers is often purchased by middlemen in the village or at the farm gate shortly after harvest. /two.superior The interdependence between actors along this chain implies that downstream costs of market imper - fections may be transferred upstream to farmers themselves. Because farm - ers make input investment decisions with an eye on the ultimate output markets, reforming agricultural out - put markets is an important way to increase farmers' use of improved inputs such as fertilizer. /two.superior The nascent rice value chain in Uganda provides a concrete example of this dynamic. Since upland rice has only recently been introduced in the country, there are few rice mills and only one industrial agro-processor of rice in Uganda. /two.superior The costs of transporting rice between farms and these mills was one of the main factors driving over half of the farmers who had ini - tially adopted this crop two years ear - lier to abandon growing NERICA rice./two.superior Relatedly, low levels of invest - ment in Uganda's agriculture sec - tor are in part due to coordination problems between producers and purchasers of agriculture products. Smallholder farmers face uncertain demand for output, which reduces their incentives and ability to invest in agricultural production. Agro-processors face uncertain quantity and quality of supply, which is exacerbated by potential suppliers' side-selling opportunities on agri - cultural spot markets. /two.superior In this way, uncertainty about demand and supply of commodities facing farmers and agro-processors, respectively, reduces their investment incentives. This agricultural investment trap results in only one-third of agricultural production reaching domestic and export markets. /two.superior Lacking spillovers from public agricultural R&DThe public sector conducts the vast majority of agricultural R&D in Uganda, as in many least-developed and low-income countries. These investments focus primarily on technologies to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability. Yet a number of factors, including the lack of complementary investments and capacity, hamper spillovers from public research to private enterprises. These spillovers and the interactions and processes that generate them are complex and dynamic. It is critical 155 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 11: Enhancing Innovation in the Ugandan Agri-Food Sectorthat researchers and policy makers better understand the drivers and challenges inherent in generating R&D spillovers, as well as the levels and direction of agricultural R&D. Creating an enabling environment for agri-food innovation in UgandaUganda's performance in previ - ous editions of the GII attests to its growing focus on innovation as a driver of development in some of its key sectors. Within the agricul - ture sector, Uganda is prioritizing investments in modern biosciences, with a particular focus on disease diagnostics, vaccine development, crop productivity improvement, and value addition. /three.superior The government is also taking steps (though small) to improve institutional capacity, as evi - denced by the growing importance of work of R&D institutions such as the National Coffee Research Institute (NaCORI) and others within the National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO). The growing focus and recent measures taken by the government for promoting innovations and value addition in agro-based industries is definitely a step in the right direction. However, to truly stimulate growth, the government needs to create an enabling environment for agri-food innovations by addressing obstacles that impede value addition and inno - vation in agri-food systems. Among policy measures to encourage innovation, governments can establish intellectual property rights (IPR) and maintain the insti - tutions that enable these rights to be used and enforced. An IPR regime encourages innovation by allowing inventors to recoup their invest - ments through monopoly rents. The agricultural industry typically relies on patent protection, plant variety protection, and trademarks.In the past decade, Uganda has taken some major strides towards establishing a well-functioning IPR regime in agriculture. The country recently introduced its Plant Variety Protection Act 2014 and became a signatory to the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, to which it acceded in 2003. It also enacted its Geographical Indications Act 2013, which provides protection and pro - motes the value of its indigenous and traditional agricultural produce. Enhancing the instruments available to both private and public players in the agri-food sector to create viable business opportunities based on innovation could be a policy prior - ity. At the most basic level, firms will invest in innovation only if they have a defensible strategy for build - ing and maintaining a reputation that attracts customers and differentiates high-quality products and services. The effective use of trademarks may therefore play a role in improved branding and longer-term invest - ments in innovation. Uganda also enacted its Trademark Protection Act in 2010. Since then, compared with other forms of intellectual property (IP) protection\u2014such as patents\u2014the use of trademarks has increased rapidly. Furthermore, trademarks are emerging as the preferred form of protection in the agricultural and food and beverage sectors because the majority of trademark filings occur within these sectors. /three.superior/one.superior In order to provide institutional support for IP protection, Uganda has mandated by law two institutions for the formulation, administration, and enforcement of IPR. The Uganda Registration Services Bureau is mandated with the registration of IP instruments, and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology is concerned with for - mulating the national science and technology policy and protection of IPR. This demonstrates that Uganda has the basic framework it needs to promote formal agricultural invest - ment in innovation. However, to foster innovation in agriculture, Uganda needs to define its key innovation policy commit - ments in this sector and involve a larger actor base in the management and promotion of IPR. An ongo - ing World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) study will shed further light on the policy options available to Uganda for enhancing its IP regime and making it more inclusive for the agriculture sector (see Box/uni00A01). Policies for supporting innova - tion include fostering an enabling environment and collective action. The former typically relates to the provision of public goods to address market failures in transportation, communication, and processing. However, policies can also focus on the small producers by aiming to integrate them into the market economy. Indeed, a strong agro-processing sector, which is linked to farmers, is an incentive for small producers to invest more to increase the productivity of their farms. These links with agro-processing rely on a combination of service provision, as mentioned above; facilitation of the private sector through financial services and fiscal policy; and an appropriate regulatory environment achieved through standards, regula - tions, and enforcement. Collective action offers the possibility of lower costs, a more reliable network, and potentially higher profits. /three.superior/two.superior Umbrella organizations play a major role in marketing agricultural produce, pro - viding access to training, and service delivery from external organiza - tions. /three.superior/three.superior They also provide an ideal environment for knowledge transfer and innovation as they link farmers THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 11: Enhancing Innovation in the Ugandan Agri-Food Sector156 with similar interests. Finally, gov - ernments can also engage in the direct funding of agricultural R&D. Public-private partnerships also sup - port R&D, education, technology transfer, and incremental problem solving. /three.superior The ongoing WIPO-Uganda study titled 'Innovation in the Agro-Based Industry in Uganda: An Empirical Study of Agricultural Innovation in a Least Developed Country' (see Box/uni00A01) pays particular attention to the policy options that enhance spillovers from public R&D to private enterprise and to innovation and the productivity of the agri-food sector more broadly. /three.superior In particular, the study aims to understand how firm innovation processes could help translate public R&D into improved firm or household productivity and social returns. On this basis, the study will apply existing findings to the case of Uganda, and then analyse how innovation and (formal and informal) IP, and related policies, affect returns on R&D investment. The possibility of domestic spill - overs to other sectors of the Ugandan economy is particularly important in this regard because these spillovers are central to the economic develop - ment and poverty alleviation process that can be unleashed by investment and innovation in the agri-food sector. For this reason, the WIPO-Uganda study will focus on domestic innovation relevant to domestic and regional agricultural varieties and market opportunities. A variety of specific policy solutions to questions that will likely emerge throughout the course of the study include (1) ways to stimulate or import African domestic research and technology to solve local problems; (2) ways to use local brands, local techniques, local tools, local seeds, and local IP to improve the efficiency and dyna - mism of the agri-food sector; and (3) ways to transfer promising research, innovation, products, and even ser - vices that emerge from the Ugandan agri-food sector to neighbouring markets in the surrounding region. Conclusions Uganda has been taking several mea - sures designed to improve its perfor - mance in the innovation rankings. The GII rankings for the period 2013 through 2016 show Uganda to be a consistent innovation outperformer in comparison to other economies Box 1: Innovation in the Agro-Based Industry in Uganda: Insights from coffee seed supply chains and tropical fruit processing The Ugandan government has requested the Economics and Statistics Division (ESD) of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to conduct a study on innovation in the agro-based industry in Uganda. Two value chains have emerged as promising and two focal links in these value chains have emerged as particularly relevant for this study: 1. The seed/seedling supply chain in the coffee value chain. Coffee has always been an important cash crop in the Ugandan agri-food sector. It has endured the booms and busts of the global coffee market as well as devastat-ing diseases. Still, coffee yields continue to be low by international standards (e.g., Robusta coffee yields in Viet Nam are, on average, three to four times larger than yields of the same coffee in Uganda). Although there are several reasons for this, the quality and suitability to local agro-climatic conditions of the coffee varieties and the level of input usage play a central role. Getting high-quality and suitable seedlings to farmers may catalyse other investments. For example, investment in several inputs (i.e., fertilizer, pesticides, and agronomic practices such as planting, spacing, and intercropping) is likely to be higher when a grower has planted the varieties best suited to his growing conditions (such as farm size, soil type, and climate). Thus providing better traceability and information along the seed supply chain could create more favourable incentives and induce more on-farm investment. This focus aligns well with the current agricultural agenda of the Ugandan government, which has set extremely ambitious coffee produc - tion goals for the next several years. 2. Primary post-harvest processing\u2014especially drying and juicing\u2014in the tropical fruits value chain. Nearly every Ugandan farmer grows tropical fruits of some kind. Although fruits such as man - gos, pineapples, and bananas can be highly profitable, they are also perishable and costly to transport. Moreover, mar-kets for unprocessed fruit are typically poorly integrated spatially and prices often fluctuate wildly. Immediately after harvest prices can collapse locally, with a glut of perishable fruit in mar - kets and roadside stalls. In this context, even rudimentary post-harvest process-ing technologies can add significant value; this has motivated innovative activities in the public and private sector among both formal and informal play - ers. For example, the Food Technology Incubator at Makerere University has played an active role in developing and diffusing these technologies and in pro-viding the marketing and distributional expertise required to form profitable small and medium-sized enterprises in this value chain.

However, for Uganda to translate this success to economy-wide gains, it needs to address constraints ham - pering innovation and productivity improvements in its agriculture sec - tor. This chapter has outlined several factors that impede value addition and upgradation of its agriculture value chains. It has also highlighted some possibilities that could improve the country's agri-food innovation. The policy measures required for Uganda to improve its current inno - vation standing focus on enhanc - ing its institutions to promote and protect IPR, foster innovation, and provide an enabling environment to cultivate collective action. The ongoing WIPO-Uganda study seeks to improve the understanding of the role of innovation and IPR in the Ugandan agriculture sector and will identify key policy responses that have the potential to enhance the impact of agricultural R&D for innovation and technology diffusion. It will offer policy recommendations and describe possible interventions for enhancing innovation and agri - business in Uganda by providing empirical evidence from an analysis of innovation in the value chain of its key cash crop, coffee.

This focus is rooted in the recognition that innovation outcomes are determined by factors\u2014such as national policies, laws and institutions, federal spend - ing, and cultural ties\u2014that operate at the level of countries as a whole. The country perspective will con - tinue to be a central focus of the GII. However, this emphasis masks important differences in innova - tion performance within countries, because innovation activities tend to be geographically concentrated in specific clusters linked to a single city or a set of neighbouring cities. Adopting a cluster perspective opens the door to better understand - ing the determinants of innovation performance that do not operate at the country level\u2014such as physical and economic geography, sub-national policies and institutions, social net - works, and local labour market link - ages. The GII has long recognized that innovation hubs at the city or regional level tend to be drivers of innovation performance that deserve an in-depth analysis. /one.superior Unfortunately, gaining empirical insight into the comparative performance of indi - vidual innovation clusters is chal - lenging. There is neither a generally accepted definition of what actually constitutes an innovation cluster nor an 'off-the-shelf' list of such clusters (see the section on assessing regional innovation clusters in Chapter 1). In addition, the geographical boundar - ies of innovation clusters typically do not correspond to the geographical units for which governments or other entities collect statistical data. Seeking to overcome these chal - lenges, this special section presents an empirical approach to identifying and ranking the world's largest clus - ters of inventive activity on the basis of patent filings. Patent data offer rich information on the location of innovative activity. Many researchers have already made use of these data to study individual clusters or selected clusters within a particular region. /two.superior Our approach goes beyond existing work by identifying and ranking innovation clusters on an interna - tionally comparable basis. We present our empirical approach in several stages. We first describe the patent data that underlie our research and explain how we geocoded these data to enable the identification of clusters in the next section. We then describe the algorithm we employed to map clusters. Once identified, we discuss how we measured the size of the clusters and explore how sensitive the resulting top 100 rankings are to the algorithm's input parameters. We finally present the key characteristics of the top 100 clusters as they emerge from patent data, and end with a few concluding remarks. Description of patent data Patents protect inventions that are new, involve an inventive step, and are capable of industrial application. Innovators interested in obtaining exclusive rights for their inventions have to formally apply for protection at authoritative offices. The patent records of these offices thus offer rich\u2014and otherwise rare\u2014infor - mation on the nature of inventive activity. Nonetheless, it is important to point out at the outset that pat - ent data provide only an incomplete and imperfect perspective on overall innovative activity. The well-known limitations of patent data include the following: /three.superior Patents (mostly) capture techno - logical inventions and thus miss out on non-technological inno - vations\u2014such as organizational or logistical advances\u2014that can be an important source of pro - ductivity gains in an economy. Patents do not capture all tech - nological inventions because inventors can also protect their Comments and suggestions from Edward Harris, Yo Takagi, Sacha Wunsch-Vincent, Maryam Zehtabchi, and Hao Zhou are gratefully acknowledged.

Some industries use the patent system more intensively than others, depending on the nature of relevant technologies and pre - vailing business strategies. Some patents are more valuable and technologically important than others; indeed, research has pointed to a highly skewed dis - tribution of patent value, with relatively few patents account - ing for a high share of the overall value of patents. These limitations do not mean that patent data cannot usefully inform innovation research. However, they should be kept in mind when inter - preting the cluster rankings described in this section. For our investigation, we rely on patents published between 2011 and 2015 under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) System, which is operated by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The PCT is an international cooperation agreement that patent applicants use when they seek patent protection internationally. The System came into force in 1978; by 2010, it had 142 members that together accounted for more than 98% of national and regional patent filings worldwide. In a nutshell, by filing a patent applica - tion under the PCT, applicants can delay deciding whether and in which countries they would like to pursue exclusive rights for their inventions, thereby saving in fees and legal costs. In addition, the patent receives a first evaluation, which similarly helps applicants in their subsequent patent filing decisions. Our reliance on PCT filing data has two motivations. First, the PCT System applies a single set of proce - dural rules to applicants from around the world and collects information based on uniform filing standards. This reduces potential biases that would arise if similar information was collected from different national sources applying different rules and standards. Second, PCT applica - tions are likely to capture the most commercially valuable inventions. Patenting is a costly process, and the larger the number of jurisdictions in which a patent is sought, the greater the patenting cost. An applicant will seek international patent protection only if the underlying invention gen - erates a sufficiently high return\u2014one that is higher than for patents that are filed only domestically. On the downside, not all pat - ent applications for which applicants pursue protection internationally go through the PCT System, and not every PCT application will eventually result in a granted patent. Systemic differences in PCT use across coun - tries, industries, and applicants may thus introduce a measurement bias, which\u2014again\u2014should be kept in mind when interpreting our cluster rankings. Geocoding PCT inventor addresses Between 2011 and 2015, approxi - mately 950,000 applications were published under the PCT System. Each of these applications lists the names and addresses of the inventor(s) responsible for the inven - tion described in the application. In total, these amount to 2.7 million addresses. Previous work using patent data assigned inventors to districts, pri - marily on the basis of the postal codes included in their addresses. /one.superior However, this approach biases the identification and measurement of clusters because of the so-called modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP)\u2014the choice of district boundaries exerting a strong influence on the shape and size of clusters. /one.superior/one.superior The MAUP bias would be compounded in our case, because we seek to identify clusters on an inter - nationally comparable basis and the geographical units associated with postal codes, for example, differ sub - stantially in both characteristics and size, both within and across countries. For this reason, we geocoded inventor addresses at a higher level of accuracy\u2014ideally at the rooftop level\u2014using the returns of Google Maps. Although the quality of the returns varied, we were able to obtain highly accurate geo-coordinates for most inventors. /one.superior/two.superior Table/uni00A01 presents a summary of the geocoding results for the top PCT-filing countries. If Google Maps could not identify a specific geocode associated with an address, it typically returned an approximate area where that address is found. Extrapolating this informa - tion we were able to categorize our results into different accuracy scores. For most countries, more than two-thirds of the returned geocodes were within a 100 metre accuracy radius and more than 90% of the returns were within a 25 kilometre radius, which is the accuracy threshold we employed for geocodes to be used for identifying clusters. /one.superior/three.superior Since patent applications can list more than one inventor, the share of PCT filings with at least one inventor meeting the accuracy threshold is even higher. Density-based cluster identification Researchers have used a variety of methods to identify clusters from raw spatial data, depending on the nature of the data and the hypoth - esized forces giving rise to cluster - ing. These methods range from pure visual identification to different kinds of technical algorithms.163 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 SPECIAL SECTION: Identifying and Ranking the World's Largest Clusters of Inventive Activity Having considered the alternative options, /one.superior we adopted the density- based algorithm for discovering clusters originally proposed by Ester et al. (1996), also referred to as the 'DBSCAN algorithm'. Two reasons determined this choice. First, this algorithm can account for inventor address points that do not belong to any cluster or 'noise points'. This is important for our dataset, because patenting can occur outside of any innovation cluster\u2014by, say, single 'garage inventors'. Second, we are interested in descriptively measur - ing the innovation output of differ - ent localities, while initially being agnostic about what precisely drives the formation of these clusters. The DBSCAN algorithm allows us to flexibly map clusters across countries with varying physical and economic geographies on the basis of the same density criteria. We performed the DBSCAN algorithm on the geocoded inven - tor locations. In doing so, we treated multiple listings of the same address\u2014for example, a single inven - tor being listed in multiple patent applications\u2014as separate data points. The DBSCAN algorithm re - quires two input parameters: the radius of the cluster-identifying circle around any given data point, and the minimum number of data points within that circle required for them to be counted towards a cluster. The choice of these input parameters critically determines the shape and size of identified clusters. We tested various combinations of input pa - rameters with three guiding criteria. First, we focused on identifying the world's largest innovation clusters, which calls for a relatively high-density threshold. Second, we visu - ally inspected the resulting clusters to evaluate the extent to which they correspond to intuitive notions of ex - isting clusters. Third, we made use of co-inventor relationships to evalu - ate the fit of the identified clusters. In particular, we gave preference to parameters that minimized the share of co-inventors outside the identified cluster but located within 160 kilo - metres of the cluster midpoint. On the basis of these criteria, we settled on baseline input param - eters of 13 kilometres (radius) and 2,000 (minimum number of data points), corresponding to a density of approximately five listed inventors per square kilometre. /one.superior With these parameter values, the DBSCAN algorithm identified 162 clusters in 25 countries. Although most clusters were geographically separated from one another, a few were contiguous. /one.superior In order to decide whether to merge these contiguous clusters into one, we again made use of co-inventor rela - tionships. In particular, we calculated the share of a cluster's co-inventors belonging to all the other clusters as well as to two noise categories\u2014namely, co-inventors located within and beyond 80 kilometres of the cluster midpoint not belonging to any other cluster. We then merged two clusters if two conditions were met for at least one of the clusters: first, the minimum distance between any two points of the two clusters was less than 5 kilometres; and second, Addresses (%) CountryGeocode accuracy of 100 mGeocode accuracy of 10 kmGeocode accuracy of 25 kmShare of PCT filings covered by America 83.0 Source: WIPO IP Statistics Database, February 2017; Google Maps API, April 2017.Table 1: Summary of geocoding resultsTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 SPECIAL SECTION: Identifying and Ranking the World's Largest Clusters of Inventive Activity164 the neighbouring cluster accounted for the largest share of co-inventors among all clusters worldwide plus the two noise categories. This procedure led to the merging of 16 contiguous clusters into eight distinct clusters, so that we ended up with 154 clusters for our ranking. /one.superior Measuring cluster size and sensitivity analysisWe measured the size of the identi - fied clusters by the number of PCT applications associated with the data points in a given cluster. In doing so, we adopted a fractional counting approach, whereby counts reflect the share of a patent's inventors present in a particular cluster. /one.superior For example, a patent that lists three inventors in cluster A and one inventor in cluster B would contribute 0.75 to cluster A and 0.25 to cluster B. /one.superior Table/uni00A01 in Annex 2 presents the resulting ranking of the top 100 clus - ters. The top 100 clusters account for 59.0% of all PCT filings in 2011-15, the period under consideration. We named clusters according to the main city or cities covered by the cluster. Tokyo-Yokohama\u2014with a wide margin\u2014emerges as the top-rank - ing cluster, followed by Shenzhen-Hong Kong (China), San Jose-San Francisco, Seoul, and Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto. These five clusters alone account for 23.9 % of all PCT filings. Figure/uni00A01 in Annex 1 depicts the location of the top-100 clusters on a world map, also showing the 'raw' inventor address data points. Figures 2-4 offer zoomed-in regional per - spectives and Figures 5-7 depict the shape of the top-3 clusters. /two.superior The distribution of clusters across countries is highly uneven. Seven countries feature four or more clus - ters in the top 100: the United States of America (USA, has 31), Germany (12), Japan (8), China (7), France (5), Canada (4), and the Republic of Korea (4). An additional 16 countries host between one and three clusters. /two.superior/one.superior Among middle-income economies other than China, India features three clusters and Malaysia and the Russian Federation each feature one. The top 100 do not include any cluster from Latin America and the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, or Northern Africa and Western Asia. The distribution of clusters within countries is also uneven. Notably, in the case of the USA, fewer than half of the 50 states feature a cluster, while California (CA), New York (NY), and Texas (TX) each feature three or more. Finally, note that several clusters span more than one territory\u2014most notable of these is the cluster located in the tri-border region around Basel. How sensitive is the ranking presented in Table/uni00A01 in Annex 2 to different cluster-identifying input parameters? We tested different combinations of input parameters and compared the results to our baseline results. Two important insights emerged. First, although different input parameters influ - ence the exact shape and size of the clusters, the resulting rankings were for the most part similar, with clusters moving up or down only a few ranks, especially for those in the top 30. /two.superior/two.superior Tokyo-Yokohama consistently emerged as the top cluster. Second, two prominent (sets of) clusters were particularly sensitive to the chosen input para - meters: New York and Frankfurt- Mannheim either emerged as broad clusters\u2014as shown in Table/uni00A0 1 in Annex 2 \u2014or were divided into smaller clusters associated with the main population centres within those two clusters. These included Trenton, New Jersey (NJ); Newark, NJ; and Armonk, NY, for the former, and Wiesbaden, Mannheim-Heidelberg, and Karl - sruhe for the latter. Once divided, the smaller clusters had lower ranks, though Frankfurt and New York typically remained within the top 30. Cluster characteristics As already mentioned, patent data provide rich information on the nature of inventive activity and we can exploit these data further to char - acterize the top 100 clusters. Table/uni00A02 in Annex 2 presents the largest patent filing entity, the main field of tech - nology, the share of universities and public research organizations (PROs), the largest co-inventing cluster, /two.superior/three.superior and the share of women inventors associ - ated with each cluster. For most clusters, the largest pat - ent applicant is a company, although for several of them it is a univer - sity\u2014most notably the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for the 8th ranked Boston-Cambridge cluster. Interestingly, several companies con - stitute the top applicant for more than one cluster. Ericsson stands out as the largest applicant in five different clus - ters. Siemens and Intel each appear as the top applicant in four different clusters. There are pronounced differences in the share of PCT filings accounted for by a cluster's top applicant. For many clusters, this share stands below 10%, suggesting a high degree of applicant diversity. For others, this share is higher, pointing to a more concentrated distribution of appli - cants within clusters. Most notably, Philips accounts for 85% of the 18th ranked Eindhoven cluster, suggesting a cluster largely revolving around a single company. Cluster diversity is also reflected in the share of the main technological field associated with a cluster's patent filings. For example, the 2nd ranked Shenzhen-Hong Kong (China) 165 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 SPECIAL SECTION: Identifying and Ranking the World's Largest Clusters of Inventive Activitycluster has a strong focus on digital communications, with around 41% of patent filings falling into this technol - ogy field. By contrast, the 1st ranked Tokyo-Yokohama cluster appears significantly more diversified, with its main technology field\u2014electrical machinery, apparatus, and energy\u2014accounting for only 6.3% of its PCT filings. The most prominent technol - ogy field among the top 100 clusters is medical technology\u2014accounting for the top field in 17 clusters\u2014fol - lowed by digital communication (16), pharmaceuticals (15), and computer technology (12). Overall, 18 different technology fields\u2014out of a total of 35\u2014feature as the top field in at least one cluster. Interesting variation also exists in the prominence of universities and PROs among the top 100 clusters. For some clusters\u2014in particular, Baltimore, Daejeon, Grenoble, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore\u2014universi - ties and PROs account for more than one-third of PCT filings. In many others, inventive activity largely occurs in companies, with academic institutions accounting for negligible filing shares. Interestingly, many clusters featuring medical technology or pharmaceuticals as their top field have relatively high university and PRO shares, underlying the impor - tance of science linkages in these two fields. How do the top 100 clusters connect to one another? One way of answering this question is to look at co-inventors located outside a clus - ter's borders, specifically in the other 99 clusters. On this basis, Table/uni00A02 in Annex 2 identifies a cluster's most important partner cluster\u2014defined as the cluster accounting for the larg - est share of external co-inventors. At least two interesting insights emerge. First, distance and cluster size\u2014in line with the classic grav - ity model of economists\u2014can in many cases explain the identity of the top partner cluster. For example, Tokyo-Yokohama is the top partner cluster for all other clusters in Japan and Seoul is the top partner cluster for all other clusters in the Republic of Korea. Second, the San Jose-San Francisco cluster is by far the most collaborative cluster, emerging as the top partner in 24 cases, including 6 clusters located outside of the USA. The value of the top partner's share of external co-inventors cap - tures the diversity of partner clusters. The low share for San Jose-San Francisco confirms the high degree of partner diversity for this cluster. Conversely, many clusters in Japan and the Republic of Korea show high shares, pointing to a more confined set of partners\u2014possibly influenced by language barriers. The last column in Table/uni00A02 in Annex 2 presents the share of women inventors among all inventors located in a particular cluster. As can be seen, women inventors account for fewer than one-third of all inven - tors across all clusters. However, there is substantial variation in the extent of women's participation; among the top 10 clusters alone the share ranges from 5.6% for Nagoya to 28.9% for Shenzhen-Hong Kong (China). Overall, the patterns shown largely reflect prior insights on the participation of women inventors: clusters in China and the Republic of Korea tend to be relatively more gender equal, as are clusters for which the main field of technology is either pharmaceuticals or biotechnology. /two.superior Concluding remarks This special section has described an empirical approach towards identi - fying and measuring the size of the world's largest clusters of inventive activity on the basis of international patent filings. It provides a fresh perspective on the spatial agglomera - tion of innovative activity, relying on a globally harmonized set of criteria. Notwithstanding the mea - surement progress offered by this approach, it is important to view the analysis presented here as a first step in a longer-term effort to better capture innovative activity at the sub-national level. Our approach relies exclusively on patent data, which are an imper - fect metric for inventive activity and an even less perfect metric for innovative activity more broadly. In addition, although the identification and ranking of clusters is reasonably robust to different input parameter choices, the rankings should be used with due caution. Aside from Tokyo's top rank, they are best interpreted as orders of magnitude, with clusters moving up and down a few ranks depending on meaningful parameter choices. For the future, we aim to improve and broaden the analysis presented here in at least three ways. First, we will seek to obtain more empirical insights into the forces giving rise to clustering and use these insights to refine our cluster identification approach. Second, we will analyse clusters at the level of specific tech - nologies and industries. Finally, we will try to include other measures of innovative activity\u2014such as scientific publications and the performance of universities and firms\u2014in the analy - sis to obtain a more complete picture of the innovation taking place across the world's largest clusters.

Saudi Arabia joined in 2013. An applicant from a non-member state can still file a PCT application if there is a co-applicant from a member state. However, non-membership generally has a negative effect on the participation of applicants from non-members in the System, which one should keep in mind when interpreting the rankings presented here. The 98% coverage figure is an estimate based on national patent filing statistics available in WIPO's IP Statistics Data Centre (http://ipstats.wipo.int). 7 See WIPO (2016) for a more detailed description of the PCT System. 8 For other empirical investigations relying on PCT data, see Miguelez and Fink (2013) and Lax-Mart\u00ednez et al. (2016). 9 In 2015, so-called PCT national phase entries accounted for 57% of non-resident patent filings worldwide (WIPO, 2016). However, this figure understates the 'market share' of the PCT, because it does not account for PCT applications that do not see any subsequent national phase entry. 10 See, for example, Maraut et al., 2008. 11 See Oppenshaw (1983) for the seminal discussion of the MAUP. 12 For some jurisdictions, this required fine- tuning the address feeds\u2014mainly by progressively removing information that seemingly confused the API's address matching algorithm, such as the applicant name or outdated postal codes. 13 The choice of this threshold partly reflects the reporting categories of the Google Maps API and the choice of cluster density parameters, as described in the next section. 14 For a recent review of clustering methodologies, see Sharma et al., 2016. 15 Since DBSCAN relies on latitude and longitude coordinates to calculate the distance between two points, the second (inverse) geodetic problem implies somewhat shorter distances the further away those points are from the equator. 16 The presence of contiguous clusters partly reflects the nature of the DBSCAN algorithm, because this method has difficulties accounting for obstacles\u2014such as rivers or train tracks\u2014that cut through a cluster. Imperfect geocodes\u2014say, those with an accuracy radius of only 25 kilometres\u2014may compound this problem because they often lead to the same geocode covering a large number of listed inventors. Our choice of a relatively large radius (13 kilometres) for DBSCAN minimizes but does not completely overcome these problems. 17 In particular, we merged Alzenau with Frankfurt-Mannheim, Karlsruhe with Frankfurt-Mannheim, Bonn with Cologne- Dusseldorf, two separate clusters in Houston clusters into a single entity, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje with Stockholm, Takasaki with Tokyo-Yokohama, and Tsukuba with Tokyo-Yokohama. In addition, we merged Cheongju with Daejeon. Although Daejeon was only the second largest co-inventing cluster for Cheongju after Seoul, this largely reflects the strong presence of the Seoul cluster in the Republic of Korea. Indeed, all other identified clusters in the Republic of Korea feature Seoul as the largest co-inventing cluster (see Table 2 in Annex 2). It is also worth pointing out that the merging of clusters had a negligible influence on the overall ranking of clusters, because at least one of the merging entities was always small in size. 18 As alternative size measures, we also tested the simple count of listed inventors belong to a given cluster, and the (non-fractional) number of patents associated with those inventors. The resulting rankings correlated closely with the ranking relying on the fractional count for the top 35 clusters, though it led to several sizeable rank shifts for the remaining clusters that overall showed smaller differences in size scores. We report only rankings relying on fractional patent counts because this is the conceptually most appropriate size measure. 19 Our fractional counts ignore inventors for which we obtained inaccurate geocodes (> 25 kilometres). For example, if a patent has three inventors and the geocode for one inventor is inaccurate, we assigned 0.5 scores to the two inventors with accurate geocodes. However, given the small share of listed inventors and patents affected (see Table 1), the resulting measurement bias is likely to be small. 20 Note that the visualization of the Shenzhen- Hong Kong (China) cluster is somewhat misleading, as the relatively less accurate geocoding results for China (see Table 1) imply that many Chinese addresses are associated with the same geocode; in fact inventors located in Shenzhen account for a far higher share of cluster points than inventors located in Hong Kong (China). 21 This count of clusters assigns multi-territory clusters to the territory accounting for the largest share of PCT filings. Note that an additional two countries\u2014Norway and Hungary\u2014feature clusters that do not rank among the top 100. 22 For this sensitivity analysis, we ignored extreme parameter values that led to counter-intuitive results\u2014such as mega- clusters spanning several hundred kilometres. 23 The 'largest co-inventing cluster' refers to the cluster that appears most often as the location of a listed co-inventor for patents associated with a primary cluster. 24 See Lax-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2016.References Boix, R. and V.

and are based on fractional counts, as explained in the text. The identification of technology fields relies on the WIPO technology concordance table linking International Patent Classification (IPC) symbols with 35 fields of technology (available at http://www.wipo.int/ipstats/en/). The identification of universities and public research organizations (PROs) relies on keyword-based searches of PCT applicant names, which encompasses all types of educational and public research entities, including universities, colleges, polytechnics, and university hospitals; it also takes account of the different languages used by PCT applicant names. Patent records may show different names for the same applicant. WIPO carries out a name cleaning and harmonization process based on keyword searching and manual verification. This process takes historical changes into account, but not company structure; in other words, subsidiaries or applicants sharing a common parent company are not consolidated. In the table presented here, the colloquial name of the applicant is used where appropriate and may differ from the actual name listed in the application, or from WIPO's cleaned and harmonized name. *The largest co-inventing top-100 cluster refers to the cluster hosting the highest share of co-inventors. The share of co-inventors is relative to the total number of co-inventors located outside the cluster in question. The identification of women inventors relies on the name dictionary described in Lax-Mart\u00ednez et al. (2016). With this dictionary, we can attribute gender for more than 90% of listed inventors for each cluster except for Beijing, Bengaluru, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, Shanghai, and Suzhou, for which we attribute gender for 84-90% of listed inventors. The share of women inventors is calculated on the basis of listed inventors, so inventors listed in multiple applications are counted multiple times. The calculation ignores inventors whose gender could not be attributed.Table 2: Cluster characteristics (continued)Appendices I Country /Economy ProfilesThe following tables provide detailed profiles for each of the 127 econo - mies in the Global Innovation Index 2017. They are constructed around three sections. 1 Five key indicators at the beginning of each profile are intended to put the economy into context. They present the popu - lation in millions, 1 GDP in US$ billions, and GDP per capita in PPP current international dol - lars. 2 The fourth indicator cate - gorizes the economy into income group and the fifth indicates its geographical region. 3 2 The next section provides the economy's scores and rankings on the Global Innovation Index (GII), the Innovation Output Sub-Index, the Innovation Input Sub-Index, and the Innovation Efficiency Ratio. The GII ranking for the 2016 edition comes next. Because there is one less economy in 2017 than in 2016 (four dropped out and three were added), and because of adjustments made to the GII frame - work every year and other technical factors not directly related to actual performance (missing data, updates of data, etc.), the GII rankings are not directly comparable from one year to the next. Please refer to Annex 2 of Chapter 1 for details.Scores are normalized in the 0-100 range except for the Innovation Efficiency Ratio, for which scores revolve around the number 1 (this index is calculated as the ratio between the Output and Input Sub-Indices). The Innovation Input Sub-Index score is calculated as the simple aver - age of the scores in the first five pil - lars, while the Innovation Output Sub-Index is calculated as the sim - ple average of the scores in the last two pillars. 3 Pillars are identified by sin - gle-digit numbers, sub-pillars by two-digit numbers, and indicators by three-digit numbers. For exam - ple, indicator 1.3.1, ease of starting a business, appears under sub-pillar 1.3, Business environment, which in turn appears under pillar 1, Institutions. The 2017 GII includes 81 indi - cators and three types of data. Composite indicators are iden - tified with an asterisk ( *), sur - vey questions from the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey are identified with a dagger ( ), and the remain - ing indicators are all hard data series. For hard data, the origi - nal value is provided (except for indicators in sub-pillar 7.3, for which the raw data were pro - vided under the condition that only the normalized scores be published). Normalized scores in the 0-100 range are provided for everything else (index and sur - vey data, sub-pillars, pillars, and indices). When data are either not avail - able or out of date (the cutoff year is 2007, with the exceptions of indi - cators 2.2.2, 5.1.2, 6.2.5, and 7.2.4; see Appendix III for more details), 'n/a' is used. The year of each data point is indicated in the Data Tables shown in Appendix II. To the right of the indicator title, a clock sym - bol indicates that the country's data for that indicator are older than the base year. More details, including the year of the data in question, are available in Appendix II.

All ranks of 1, 2, and 3 are high - lighted as strengths, except in partic - ular instances at the sub-pillar level where strengths and weaknesses are not signaled when the desired min - imum indicator coverage (DMC) is not met for that sub-pillar. 4 For the remaining indicators, strengths and weaknesses of a particular economy are based on the percentage of econ - omies with scores that fall below its score (i.e., percent ranks). For a given economy, strengths ( l) are those scores with percent ranks greater than the 10th larg - est percent rank among the 81 indicators in that economy. Similarly, for that economy, weaknesses ( ) are those scores with percent ranks lower than the 10th smallest percent rank among the 81 indicators in that economy. In addition, this year countries with a sub-pillar that does not meet the DMC, independently of whether it is signaled as a strength/weakness, will show the rank for that sub-pil - lar within brackets. Those that have more than one sub-pillar that fails to meet the DMC in the same pillar will also show the ranks of the pil - lar where these are located within brackets. Percent ranks embed more infor - mation than ranks and allow for com - parisons of ranks of series with miss - ing data and ties in ranks. Examples from the Russian Federation (Russia) illustrate this point: 1. Strengths for Russia are all indi - cators with percent ranks equal to or above 0.83 (10th largest percent rank for Russia); weak - nesses are all indicators with percent ranks equal to or below 0.26 (Russia's 10th smallest per - cent rank). 2. Russia ranks 22nd out of 127 economies in 6.1.5, citable doc - uments H index, with a percent rank of 0.83; this indicator is a strength for Russia. 3. Russia ranks 25th in 2.3.4, QS university rankings, but with a per - cent rank of 0.81, this indicator is not a strength for Russia. 4. The rank of 48 (percent rank of 0.24) in 7.2.3, global entertain - ment and media market, is a weak - ness for Russia. By contrast, the rank of 47 for Senegal in 5.2.1 university/industry research collab - oration is a strength for Senegal (with a percent rank of 0.62, this is above the cutoff for strengths for Senegal, which is 0.57). Percent ranks are not reported in the Country/Economy Profiles but they are presented in the Data Tables (Appendix II). Notes 1 Data are from the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision. 2 Data for GDP and GDP per capita are from the International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook 2016 database. 3 Countries/economies are classified according to the World Bank Income Group (July 2016; see https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/ new-country-classifications-2016) and special classification based on the online version of the United Nations publication Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use, originally published as Series M, No. 49, and now commonly referred to as the M49 standard (April 2017; see https://unstats. un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/). These are: EUR = Europe; NAC = Northern America; LCN = Latin America and the Caribbean; CSA = Central and Southern Asia; SEAO = South East Asia, East Asia, and Oceania; NAWA = Northern Africa and Western Asia; SSF = Sub-Saharan Africa. 4 Data stringency requirements are used in the attribution of strengths and weaknesses at the sub-pillar level. When countries do not meet a data minimum coverage (DMC) requirement at the sub-pillar level (for sub-pillars with two indicators, the DMC is 1; for three it is 2; for four it is 2; and for five it is 3), they are not attributed a strength or weakness at the sub-pillar either. Furthermore, if the country in question does not meet the DMC requirements at the sub-pillar level, but still obtains a ranking higher than or equal to 10 or a ranking equal to or lower than 100 at the sub-pillar level, for caution this rank is put in brackets. This procedure is to ensure that incomplete data coverage does not lead to erroneous conclusions about strengths or weaknesses, or particularly about strong or weak sub-pillar rankings.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2016 I: Country/Economy Profiles183 Index Country/Economy Profiles Country/Economy Page Albania 185 Algeria ...................................................... 186 Argentina ............................................... 187 Armenia .................................................. 188 Australia .................................................. 189 Austria ...................................................... 190 Azerbaijan ............................................. 191 Bahrain .................................................... 192 Bangladesh ...........................................

indicators that make up the Global Innovation Index 2017. Structure Each table is identified by indica - tor number, with the first digit representing the pillar, the second representing the sub-pillar, and the final digit representing the indicator within that particular sub-pillar. For example, Table 5.1.4 shows results for indica - tor 5.1.4, GERD financed by business enterprise, which is the fourth indicator of sub-pillar 5.1, knowledge workers, within pillar 5, Business sophistication. The sub-heading text pro - vides a detailed description of each indicator and includes information on the units of each variable, the scaling factor (if any), the question asked (for survey questions), and the most frequent year for which data were available. For each indicator for each economy, the most recent value within the period 2007-16 was used (with the exceptions of four indica - tors, which are further explained in Appendix III). In instances where this base year does not correspond to the most frequent year reported in the sub-heading, the year of the value appears in parentheses after the economy name. These instances are noted in the Country/Economy Profiles after the indicator name with a clock symbol. A total of 57 variables are hard data. A total of 19 variables are com - posite indicators and 5 are survey questions from the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey. The source of each indica - tor is indicated at the bottom of the page; details for each can be found in Appendix III, Sources and Definitions. Explanation of scores The tables list the economies by their rank order, with the best performers at the top. After the rank comes the country/economy name, the original value of the specific indicator for that country (in the units specified in the sub-heading), the normalized score in the 0-100 range, and the percentage of economies with scores that fall below the normalized score (i.e., percent ranks). To the far right of each column, a solid circle indicates that an indicator is a strength for the country/economy in question, and a hollow circle indicates that it is a weakness (refer to Appendix I, Country/Economy Profiles, for details). Strengths ( l) are all ranks of 1, 2, and 3, as well as all scores with percent ranks greater than the 10th highest percent rank among the 81 indicators in a specific economy. Weaknesses ( ) are all scores with percent ranks lower than the 10th smallest percent rank among the 81 indicators in a specific economy. For four hard data series (7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.3, and 7.3.4), the raw data were provided under the condition that only the normalized scores be published and therefore the original value equals the normalized score. For indicators 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 2.3.4, 3.3.2, 4.1.1, and 4.2.1, the range for both measures is the same\u2014(0-100)\u2014and therefore both measures are also identical. Details on the computation methodology can be found in Appendix IV, Technical Notes.Data Tables Rank Countr y/Economy Value Score Political stabilit y and absence of violen ce/terrorism index | 20 15

For each indica - tor for each country/economy, the most recent value within the 10-year period 2007-16 was used (with four exceptions: indicators 2.2.2, 5.1.2, 6.2.5, and 7.2.4, for which time periods were extended to 2006, and are noted in this appendix). Further details are explained in Appendix IV Technical Notes. The single year given next to the description cor - responds to the most frequent year for which data were available; when more than one year is considered, the period is indicated at the end of the indicator's source in parentheses. Some indicators received special treatment in the computation. A few variables required scaling by some other indicator to be comparable across countries, or through division by gross domestic product (GDP) in current US dollars, purchasing power parity GDP in international dol - lars (PPP$ GDP), population, total exports, total trade, and so on. Details are provided in this appendix. The scaling factor was in each case the value corresponding to the same year of the particular indicator. In addi - tion, 35 indicators that were assigned half weight are singled out with an 'a'. Finally, indicators for which higher scores indicate worse out - comes, commonly known as 'bads', are differentiated with a 'b' (details on the computation can be found in Appendix IV Technical Notes). A total of 57 variables are hard data; 19 are composite indicators from international agencies, dis - tinguished with an asterisk ( *); and 5 are survey questions from the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey (EOS), singled out with a dagger ( ).Sources and DefinitionsAPPENDIX IIITHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 III: Sources and Definitions404 1Institutions 1.1 Political environment 1.1.1 Political stability and absence of violence/ terrorism Political stability and absence of violence/terrorism index* | 2015 Index that measures perceptions of the likelihood of political instability and/or politically motivated violence, including terrorism.

Over the period from 2007 to 2011 improve - ments were made to align the methodol - ogy for the labour market regulation indi - cators (formerly the employing workers indicators) with the letter and spirit of the International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions. Redundancy cost measures the cost of advance notice requirements and severance payments due when ter - minating a redundant worker, expressed in weeks of salary. The average value of notice requirements and severance pay - ments applicable to a worker with 1 year of tenure, a worker with 5 years, and a worker with 10 years is also considered. One month is recorded as 4 and 1/3 weeks. If the redundancy cost adds up to 8 or fewer weeks of salary, a value of 8 is assigned but the actual number of weeks is published. If the cost adds up to more than 8 weeks of salary, the score is the number of weeks. Assumptions about the worker: the worker is a cashier in a super - market or grocery store, age 19, with one year of work experience; is a full-time employee; is not a member of the labour union, unless membership is mandatory. Assumptions about the business: the business is a limited liability company (or the equivalent in the economy); operates a supermarket or grocery store in the economy's largest business city (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city); has 60 employees; is subject to collective bar - gaining agreements if such agreements cover more than 50% of the food retail sector and they apply even to firms that are not party to them; abides by every law and regulation but does not grant workers more benefits than those man - dated by law, regulation, or (if applicable) collective bargaining agreements.

These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the component indica - tors. Doing Business records all procedures officially required, or commonly done in practice, for an entrepreneur to start up and formally operate an industrial or commercial business, as well as the time and cost to complete these procedures and the paid-in minimum capital require - ment. These procedures include obtain - ing all necessary licenses and permits and completing any required notifica - tions, verifications, or inscriptions for the company and employees with relevant authorities. To make the data comparable across economies, several assumptions about the business and the procedures are used. The business: is a limited liabil - ity company (or its legal equivalent). If there is more than one type of limited liability company in the economy, the lim - ited liability form most common among domestic firms is chosen. Information on the most common form is obtained from incorporation lawyers or the statistical office; the business operates in the econ - omy's largest business city. For 11 econo - mies the data are also collected for the second largest business city; the business is 100% domestically owned and has five owners, none of whom is a legal entity; has start-up capital of 10 times income per capita; performs general industrial or commercial activities, such as the produc - tion or sale to the public of products or services. The business does not perform foreign trade activities and does not handle products subject to a special tax regime, for example, liquor or tobacco. It is not using heavily polluting production processes; leases the commercial plant or offices and is not a proprietor of real estate; the amount of the annual lease for the office space is equivalent to 1 times income per capita; the size of the entire office space is approximately 929 square meters (10,000 square feet); does not qualify for investment incentives or any special benefits; has at least 10 and up to 50 employees one month after the commencement of operations, all of them domestic nationals; has a turnover of at least 100 times income per capita; has a company deed 10 pages long. The distance to frontier score shows the distance of an economy to the 'frontier', which is derived from the most efficient practice or highest score achieved on each indicator.

These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the recovery rate and the strength of insolvency framework index. The recovery rate is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization, liquida - tion, or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. The calcula - tion takes into account the outcome: whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the proceedings are deducted (1 cent for each percentage point of the value of the debtor's estate). Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is taken into account, including the loss of value due to depreciation of a hotel's furniture. Consistent with international accounting practice, the annual depreciation rate for furniture is taken to be 20%. The furniture is assumed to account for a quarter of the total value of assets. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates from the International Monetary Fund's International Financial Statistics , supplemented with data from central banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit. If an economy had zero cases a year over the past five years involving a judi - cial reorganization, judicial liquidation, or debt enforcement procedure (foreclosure or receivership), the economy receives a 'no practice' mark on the time, cost, and outcome indicators. This means that creditors are unlikely to recover their money through a formal legal process. The recovery rate for 'no practice' econo - mies is zero. In addition, a 'no practice' economy receives a score of 0 on the strength of insolvency framework index even if its legal framework includes provisions related to insolvency proceed - ings (liquidation or reorganization). The strength of insolvency framework index is based on four other indices: commence - ment of proceedings index, management of debtor's assets index, reorganization proceedings index, and creditor partici - pation index. To make the data on the time, cost, and outcome of insolvency proceedings comparable across econo - mies, several assumptions about the busi - ness and the case are used: the business is a limited liability company; operates in the economy's largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city; the business is 100% domestically owned, with the founder, who is also chairman of the supervisory board, owning 51% (no other shareholder holds more than 5% of shares); has downtown real estate, where it runs a hotel, as its major asset; has a professional general manager; has 201 employees and 50 suppliers, each of which is owed money for the last deliv - ery; has a 10-year loan agreement with a domestic bank secured by a mortgage over the hotel's real estate property. A universal business charge (an enterprise charge) is also assumed in economies where such collateral is recognized. If the laws of the economy do not specifi - cally provide for an enterprise charge but contracts commonly use some other provision to that effect, this provision is specified in the loan agreement; the busi - ness has observed the payment schedule and all other conditions of the loan up to now; has a market value, operating as a going concern, of 100 times income per capita or $200,000, whichever is greater. The market value of the company's assets, if sold piecemeal, is 70% of the market value of the business. Refer to indicator 1.3.1 for details regarding the distance to frontier measure.

(http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2017) 1.3.3 Ease of paying taxes Ease of paying taxes (distance to frontier)* | 2016 The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for paying taxes. These scores are the simple aver - age of the distance to frontier scores for each of the component indicators, with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of the component indica - tors, the total tax rate. The 'threshold' is defined as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall distribution of the total tax rate indicator for all years included in the analysis up to and includ - ing Doing Business 2015. The threshold is set at 26.1%. All economies with a total tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the thresh - old. The threshold is not based on any economic theory of an 'optimal tax rate' that minimizes distortions or maximizes efficiency in an economy's overall tax system. Instead, it is mainly empirical in nature, set at the lower end of the distri - bution of tax rates levied on medium-size enterprises in the manufacturing sector as observed through the paying taxes indicators. To make the data comparable across economies, several assumptions about the business and the taxes and contributions are used. The business: is a limited liability, taxable company. If there is more than one type of limited liability company in the economy, the limited liability form most common among domestic firms is chosen. The most com - mon form is reported by incorporation lawyers or the statistical office; the busi - ness started operations on 1 January 2014. At that time the company pur - chased all the assets shown in its balance sheet and hired all its workers; it operates in the economy's largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also col - lected for the second largest business city; the business is 100% domestically owned and has five owners, all of whom are natural persons; at the end of 2014, it has a start-up capital of 102 times income per capita; performs general industrial or commercial activities. Specifically, it produces ceramic flowerpots and sells them at retail. It does not participate in foreign trade (no import or export) and does not handle products subject to a special tax regime, for example, liquor or tobacco; at the beginning of 2015, it owns two plots of land, one building, machinery, office equipment, computers, and one truck and leases one truck; does not qualify for investment incentives or any benefits apart from those related to the age or size of the company; has 60 employees\u20144 managers, 8 assistants, and 48 workers. All are nationals, and one manager is also an owner. The company pays for additional medical insurance for employees (not mandated by any law) as an additional benefit. In addition, in some economies reimbursable business travel and client entertainment expenses are considered fringe benefits. When applica - ble, it is assumed that the company pays the fringe benefit tax on this expense or that the benefit becomes taxable income for the employee. The case study assumes no additional salary for meals, transpor - tation, education, or others. Therefore, even when such benefits are frequent, they are not added to or removed from the taxable gross salaries to arrive at the labour tax or contribution calculation; it has a turnover of 1,050 times income per capita; makes a loss in the first year of operation; has a gross margin (pretax) of 20% (that is, sales are 120% of the cost of goods sold); distributes 50% of its net profits as dividends to the owners at the end of the second year; sells one of its plots of land at a profit at the beginning of the second year; is subject to a series of detailed assumptions on expenses and transactions to further standardize the case. For example, the owner who is also a manager spends 10% of income THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 III: Sources and Definitions406 per capita on traveling for the company (20% of this owner's expenses are purely private, 20% are for entertaining custom - ers, and 60% are for business travel). All financial statement variables are propor - tional to 2012 income per capita as of and including Doing Business 2014 (this is an update from Doing Business 2013 and pre - vious years' reports, where the variables were proportional to 2005 income per capita). For some economies a multiple of two or three times the income per capita has been used to estimate the financial statement variables. The 2012 income per capita was not sufficient to bring the sala - ries of all the case study employees up to the minimum wage thresholds that exist in these economies. Assumptions about the taxes and contributions: all the taxes and contributions recorded are those paid in the second year of operation (calendar year 2015). A tax or contribution is considered distinct if it has a different name or is collected by a different agen - cy. Taxes and contributions with the same name and agency, but charged at differ - ent rates depending on the business, are counted as the same tax or contribution; the number of times the company pays taxes and contributions in a year is the number of different taxes or contribu - tions multiplied by the frequency of pay - ment (or withholding) for each tax. The frequency of payment includes advance payments (or withholding) as well as regular payments (or withholding). Refer to indicator 1.3.1 for details regarding the distance to frontier measure.

The scores are calculated in each year so that the mean is 500 and the standard devia - tion 100. The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities. The use of such data by the OECD is without prejudice to the status of the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem, and Israeli settle - ments in the West Bank under the terms of international law. B-S-J-G (China) refers to the four PISA-participating China provinces: Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Guangdong. CABA (Argentina) refers to the adjudicated region of Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires (CABA). FYROM refers to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Russia refers to the Russian Federation. 2015 scores from the United Arab Emirates are from Dubai. 2010 scores from India are from Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu (average); 2010 scores from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela are from Miranda. The results of adjudication and subsequent further examinations showed that the PISA Technical Standards were met in all coun - tries and economies that participated in PISA 2015 except for the following countries: In Albania, the PISA assessment was conducted in accordance with the operational standards and guidelines of the OECD. However, because of the ways in which the data were captured, it was not possible to match the data in the test with the data from the student questionnaire. As a result, Albania cannot be included in analyses that relate stu - dents' responses from the questionnaires to the test results. In Argentina, the PISA assessment was conducted in accordance with the operational standards and guidelines of the OECD. However, there was a significant decline in the propor - tion of 15-year-olds who were covered by the test, both in absolute and relative numbers. There had been a re-structuring of Argentina's secondary schools, except for those in the adjudicated region of Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires, which is likely to have affected the coverage of eligible schools listed in the sampling frame. As a result, Argentina's results may not be comparable to those of other countries or to results for Argentina from previous years. In Kazakhstan, the national coders were found to be lenient in marking. Consequently, the human-coded items did not meet PISA standards and were excluded from the international data. Since human-coded items form an important part of the constructs that are tested by PISA, the exclusion of these items resulted in a significantly smaller coverage of the PISA test. As a result, Kazakhstan's results may not be comparable to those of other countries or to results for Kazakhstan from previous years. In Malaysia, the PISA assessment was conducted in accordance with the operational standards and guidelines of the OECD. However, the weighted response rate among the initially sampled Malaysian schools (51%) falls well short of the standard PISA response rate of 85%. Therefore, the results may not be com - parable to those of other countries or to results for Malaysia from previous years.

Source: United Nations Public Administration Network, e-Government Survey 2016. 3.1.4 Online e-participation E-Participation Index* | 2016 The E-Participation Index (EPI) is derived as a supplementary index to the UN E-Government Survey. It extends the dimension of the Survey by focusing on the use of online services to facilitate pro - vision of information by governments to citizens ('e-information sharing'), interac - tion with stakeholders ('e-consultation'), and decision-making processes. A country's EPI reflects its e-participation mechanisms that are deployed by the government as compared to all other countries. The purpose of this measure is not to prescribe any particular practice, but rather to offer insight into how dif - ferent countries are using online tools to promote interaction between citizen and government, as well as among citizens, for the benefit of all. Because the EPI is a qualitative assessment based on the availability and relevance of participa - tory services available on government websites, the comparative ranking of countries is for illustrative purposes and should serve only as an indicator of the broad trends in promoting citizen engagement. As with the E-Government Development Index (EGDI), the EPI is not intended as an absolute measurement of e-participation, but rather it attempts to capture the e-participation performance of counties relative to one another at a particular point in time. The index ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 showing greater e-participation.

ISO 14001:2015 is intended for use by an organization seeking to manage its environmental responsibilities in a sys - tematic manner that contributes to the environmental pillar of sustainability. ISO 14001:2015 helps an organization achieve the intended outcomes of its environ - mental management system, which provide value for the environment, the organization itself, and interested parties. Consistent with the organization's envi - ronmental policy, the intended outcomes of an environmental management system include enhancement of environmental performance, fulfilment of compliance obligations, and achievement of envi - ronmental objectives. ISO 14001:2015 is applicable to any organization, regardless of size, type, or nature, and applies to the environmental aspects of its activities, products, and services that the organiza - tion determines it can either control or influence from a life cycle perspective. ISO 14001:2015 does not state specific environmental performance criteria. ISO 14001:2015 can be used in whole or in part to systematically improve environ - mental management. Claims of confor - mity to ISO 14001:2015, however, are not acceptable unless all its requirements are incorporated into an organization's environmental management system and fulfilled without exclusion.

These scores are the dis - tance to frontier score for the sum of the strength of the legal rights index (range 0-12) and the depth of credit informa - tion index (range 0-8). Doing Business measures the legal rights of borrowers and lenders with respect to secured transactions through one set of indicators and the reporting of credit information through another. The first set of indica - tors measures whether certain features that facilitate lending exist within the applicable collateral and bankruptcy laws. The second set measures the cover - age, scope, and accessibility of credit information available through credit reporting service providers such as credit bureaus or credit registries. Although Doing Business compiles data on getting credit for public registry coverage (% of adults) and for private bureau coverage (% of adults), these indicators are not included in the ranking.

The extent of conflict of interest regulation index measures the protection of shareholders against directors' misuse of corporate assets for personal gain by distinguishing three dimensions of regulation that address conflicts of interest: transparency of related-party transactions (extent of disclosure index), shareholders' ability to sue and hold directors liable for self- dealing (extent of director liability index), and access to evidence and allocation of legal expenses in shareholder litigation. The extent of shareholder governance index measures shareholders' rights in corporate governance by distinguishing three dimensions of good governance: shareholders' rights and role in major cor - porate decisions (extent of shareholder rights index); governance safeguards protecting shareholders from undue board control and entrenchment (extent of ownership and control index); and cor - porate transparency on ownership stakes, compensation, audits, and financial pros - pects (extent of corporate transparency index). The index also measures whether a subset of relevant rights and safeguards are available in limited companies. The data come from a questionnaire adminis - tered to corporate and securities lawyers and are based on securities regulations, company laws, civil procedure codes, and court rules of evidence.

A 'patent' is a set of exclusive rights granted by law to applicants for inventions that are new, non-obvious, and commercially applicable. A patent is valid for a limited period of time (generally 20 years), during which patent holders can commercially exploit their inventions on an exclusive basis. In return, applicants are obliged to disclose their inventions to the public in a manner that enables others, skilled in the art, to replicate the invention. The patent system is designed to encourage innovation by providing innovators with time-limited exclusive legal rights, thus enabling them to appropriate the returns from their innovative activity.

Data refer to trademark application class counts\u2014the number of classes specified in resident trademark applications\u2014and include those filed at both the national office and the regional office, where applicable. Data are scaled by PPP$ GDP (billions). A 'trademark' is a sign used by the owner of certain products or provider of certain services to distinguish them from the products or services of other companies. A trademark can consist of words and/or combinations of words, such as slogans, names, logos, figures and images, letters, numbers, sounds and moving images, or a combination thereof. The procedures for registering trademarks are governed by the legisla - tion and procedures of national and regional IP offices. Trademark rights are limited to the jurisdiction of the IP office that registers the trademark. Trademarks can be registered by filing an applica - tion at the relevant national or regional office(s) or by filing an international application through the Madrid System. A resident trademark application is one that is filed with an IP office or an office acting on behalf of the state or jurisdic - tion in which the applicant has residence. For example, an application filed with the Japan Patent Office (JPO) by a resident of Japan is considered a resident application for Japan. Similarly, an application filed with the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM) by an applicant who resides in any of the EU member states, such as France, is considered a resident application for that member state (France).

For the seventh con - secutive year, the JRC has agreed to perform a thorough robustness and sensitivity analysis of the Global Innovation Index (GII) to look at some structural changes made to the list of indicators by the GII develop - ing team (see Table 1 of Annex 2 to Chapter 1 for more details). The recommendations from the JRC audit of the 2016 GII model were reviewed and incorporated into the 2017 GII model. Expanding on recommendations included in the GII 2016, this year an economy must have a minimum symmetric data cover - age of at least 36 indicators in the Innovation Input Sub-Index (66%) and 18 indicators in the Innovation Output Sub-Index (66%), and it must have scores for at least two sub-pillars per pillar. The GII rules on data requirements will be continually strengthened in future years, incen - tivizing countries to further improve their data collection. A final audit was performed in May 2017 on the 2017 GII model, the results of which are included in Annex 3 to Chapter 1.Composite indicatorsThe GII relies on seven pillars. Each pillar is divided into three sub-pillars, and each sub-pillar is composed of two to five individual indicators. Each sub-pillar score is calculated as the weighted average of its individual indicators. Each pillar score is calcu - lated as the weighted average of its sub-pillar scores. The notion of weights as impor - tance coefficients was, as in the previ - ous three years, discarded to ensure a greater statistical coherence of the model, following the recommenda - tions of the JRC. /one.superior The GII includes three indices and one ratio: 1.The Innovation Input Sub-Index is the simple average of the first five pillar scores. 2. The Innovation Output Sub-Index is the simple average of the last two pillar scores. 3.The Global Innovation Index is the simple average of the Input and Output Sub-Indices. 4. The Innovation Efficiency Ratio is the ratio of the Output Sub-Index over the Input Sub-Index. Country/economy rankings are provided for indicator, sub-pillar, pillar, and index scores. The Innovation Efficiency Ratio serves to highlight those economies that have achieved more with less as well as those that lag behind in terms of achieving their innovation potential. In theory, assuming that innovation results go hand in hand with innovation enablers, efficiency ratios should evolve around the num - ber one. This measure thus allows us to complement the GII by providing an insight that should be neutral to the development stages of economies. /two.superior Individual indicatorsThe model includes 81 indicators, which fall into the following three categories: 1. quantitative/objective/hard data (57 indicators), 2. composite indicators/index data (19 indicators), and 3. survey/qualitative/subjective/soft data (5 indicators). Hard dataHard data series (57 indicators) are drawn from a variety of pub - lic and private sources such as United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the World Bank, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC), PwC, Bureau van Dijk (BvD), Thomson Reuters, IHS Global Insight, and Google. Indicators are often correlated with population, gross domestic Technical NotesAPPENDIX IVTHE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 IV: Technical Notes420 product (GDP), or some other size- related factor; they require scaling by some relevant size indicator for economy comparisons to be valid. Most indicators are either scaled at the source or do not need to be scaled; for the rest, the scaling factor was chosen to represent a fair picture of economy differences. This affected 40 indicators, which can be broadly divided into four groups: by GDP in current US dollars. /three.superior 2. The GDP in purchasing power parity current interna - tional dollars (PPP$ GDP). This choice of denominator was dic - tated by a willingness to appro - priately account for differenc - es in development stages; in ad - dition, scaling these variables by population would improperly bias results to the detriment of economies with large young or large ageing populations. lation (total population for 3.2.1, population 25+ years old for 5.1.5, population 15-64 years old for 6.2.2, and population 15-69 years old for the rest). 5.3.3, 6.3.1, trade; indicators 6.2.5 and 7.2.4 were scaled by the total unit corresponding to the particular statistic. IndicesComposite indicators come from a series of specialized agencies and academic institutions such as the World Bank, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the UN Public Administration Network (UNPAN), and Yale and Columbia Universities. Statisticians discourage the use of an 'index within an index' on two main grounds: the distorting effect of the use of different computing methodologies and the risk of duplicating variables. The nor - malization procedure partially solves for the former (more on this below). To avoid incurring the mistake of including a particular indicator more than once (directly and indirectly through a composite indicator), only indices with a narrow focus (19 in total) were selected. Any remaining downside is outweighed by the gains in terms of model parsimony, acknowledge - ment of expert opinion, and focus on multi-dimensional phenomena that can hardly be captured by a single indicator. Survey dataSurvey data are drawn from the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey (EOS). Survey ques - tions are drafted to capture subjec - tive perceptions on specific topics; five EOS questions were retained to capture phenomena strongly linked to innovative activities for which hard data either do not exist or have low economy coverage. Country/economy coverage and missing dataThis year's GII covers 127 econo - mies, which were selected on the basis of the availability of data. Economies with a minimum indica - tor coverage of 36 indicators in the Innovation Input Sub-Index (66%) and 18 indicators in the Innovation Output Sub-Index (66%) were retained. This minimum data cover - age threshold rule was adjusted\u2014on the recommendation of the JRC\u2014from the 60% minimum coverage for both Sub-Indices introduced in the GII 2016\u2014to maintain and improve the significance of both the GII results and the country sample. In addition, all selected countries are required to have scores for at least two sub-pillars per pillar. The last record available for each economy was considered, with a cut-off at year 2007, with four exceptions: indicators 2.2.2, 5.1.2, 6.2.5, and 7.2.4, for which time periods were extended to 2006. For the sake of transparency and replicability of results, no additional effort was made to fill missing val - ues. Missing values are indicated with 'n/a' and are not considered in the sub-pillar score. However, the JRC audit assessed the robustness of the GII modelling choices (i.e., no imputation of missing data, fixed predefined weights, and arithmetic averages) by imputing missing data, applying random weights, and using geometric averages. Since 2012, on the basis of this assessment, a confi - dence interval is provided for each ranking in the GII as well as the Input and Output Sub-Indices (see Annex 3 to Chapter 1). Treatment of series with outliers Potentially problematic indicators with outliers that could polarize results and unduly bias the rankings were treated according to the rules listed below, following the recom - mendations of the JRC. This affected a total of 33 indicators; 31 out of the 57 hard data indicators and 2 out of the 19 composite indicators.421 THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 IV: Technical NotesFirst rule: Selection The identification of indicators as problematic used skewness or kur - tosis. The problematic indicators had either: an absolute value of skewness greater than 2.25, or a kurtosis greater than 3.5. Second rule: TreatmentSeries with one to five outliers (28 cases) were winsorized: The values distorting the indicator distribution were assigned the next highest value, up to the level where skewness and/or kurtosis entered within the ranges specified above. /one.superior With one exception (see note 10) for series with five or more outliers (5 cases), skewness and/or kurtosis entered within the ranges speci - fied above after multiplication by a given factor f and transformation by natural logs. /one.superior/one.superior Since only 'goods' were affected (i.e., indicators for which higher values indicate better outcomes, as opposed to 'bads'), the formula used was: ln[(max xf - 1) (economy value - min) +1]\u00b9\u00b2 max - min where 'min' and 'max' are the minimum and maximum indicator sample values. Normalization The 81 indicators were then nor - malized into the [0, 100] range, with higher scores representing better outcomes. Normalization was made according to the min-max method, where the min and max values were given by the minimum and maxi - mum indicator sample values respec - tively, except for index and survey data, for which the original series' range of values was kept as min and max values (for example, [1, 7] for the World Economic Forum Executive Opinion Survey questions; [0, 100] for World Bank's World Governance Indicators; [0, 10] for ITU indices, etc.). The following formula was applied: Goods: economy value - min x 100 max - min Bads: max - economy value x 100 max - min Notes 1 Paruolo et al. (2013) show that a theoretical inconsistency exists between the real theoretical meaning of weights and the meaning generally attributed to them by the standard practice in constructing composite indicators that use them as importance coefficients in combination with linear aggregation rules. The approach followed in the GII this year, in the last several years, is to assign weights of 0.5 or 1.0 to each component in a composite to ensure the highest correlations between them (i.e., indicator/sub-pillar, sub-pillar/pillar, etc.). Two sub-pillars (7.2 Creative goods and services, and 7.3 Online creativity) and 35 0.5; the rest have a weight of 1.0. Seven indicators with Pearson correlation coefficients with their respective sub-pillar scores below 0.3 were kept in the model to ensure a conceptual coherence (as opposed to a statistical coherence) in the belief that some cyclical (as opposed to structural) dimension might be at the source of their behaviour as 'noise' (see also Annex 3 to Chapter 1): government expenditure on secondary education per pupil (2.1.2), graduates in science and engineering (2.2.2), gross capital formation (3.2.3), GERD financed by abroad (5.2.3), foreign direct investment net inflows (5.3.4), growth rate of GDP per person engaged (6.2.1), and printing and publishing output (7.2.4). Two out of the seven indicators listed above\u20142.1.2 and 7.2.4\u2014are found to be non-influential in the GII framework for the first time this year. The remaining five indicators were found to be non-influential also in the GII 2016. On the other hand, two indicators that were found to be non-influential last year\u2014GDP per unit of energy use (3.3.1) and Microfinance institutions' gross loan portfolio (4.1.3)\u2014are instead found to be influential in this year's framework. 2 To account for differences in development, other composite indicators use weighting schemes differentiated by income level. 3 These indicators are expenditure on education (2.1.1); gross expenditure on R&D (GERD) (2.3.2); gross capital formation (3.2.3); domestic credit to private sector (4.1.2); microfinance institutions' gross loan portfolio (4.1.3); market capitalization (4.2.2); GERD performed by business enterprise (5.1.3); foreign direct investment net inflows (5.3.4); total computer software spending (6.2.3); and foreign direct investment net outflows (6.3.4). 4 These count variables are mainly indicators that increase disproportionately with economic growth. They include: ISO 14001 environmental certificates (3.3.3); venture capital deals (4.2.3); joint venture/ strategic alliance deals (5.2.4); patent families filed in two or more offices (5.2.5); patent applications by origin (6.1.1); PCT applications by origin (6.1.2); utility model applications by origin (6.1.3); scientific and technical publications (6.1.4); ISO 9001 quality certificates (6.2.4); trademark application class count by origin (7.1.1); and industrial designs by origin (7.1.2). 5 These variables are electricity output (3.2.1); females employed with advanced degrees (5.1.5); new business density (6.2.2); national feature films produced (7.2.2); global entertainment and media market (7.2.3); generic (7.3.1) and country-code (7.3.2) top- level Internet domains; yearly edits (7.3.3); and video uploads on YouTube (7.3.4). 6 Intellectual property payments (5.3.1); high- tech imports less re-imports (5.3.2); ICT services imports (5.3.3); intellectual property receipts (6.3.1); high-tech exports less re-exports (6.3.2); ICT services exports (6.3.3); cultural and creative services exports (7.2.1); and creative goods exports (7.2.5) were scaled by total trade; high-tech and medium- high-tech output (6.2.5) and printing and publishing output (7.2.4) were scaled by total manufactures output. 7 For example, GII sub-pillar 3.1 Information and communication technologies (ICTs) is composed of four indices: ITU's ICT Access and Use sub-indices and UNPAN's Government Online Service and E-Participation indices. The first two are components of ITU's ICT Development Index together with an ICT skills sub-index that was not considered, because it duplicates GII pillar 2. Similarly, the Online Service Index is a component of UNPAN's E-Government Development Index together with two indices on Telecommunication Infrastructure and Human Capital that were not considered, because they duplicate GII pillars 3 and 2, respectively. The e-Participation Index was developed separately by UNPAN in 2010.THE GLOBAL INNOVATION INDEX 2017 IV: Technical Notes422 8 Indicator 2.2.2 (graduates in science and engineering): Because of the change in ISCED fields of classification and the transition to new questionnaires, when countries did not report detailed data, the UIS was not able to re-assign numbers into new field classifications. As a result, the UIS was not able to produce this indicator for these countries, so\u2014per the recommendation of the UIS\u2014the dataset from the GII 2016 was used. There was one economy affected: Hong Kong (China). Indicator 5.1.2 (firms offering formal training): The time period of data for Guinea includes 2006 for heightened coverage based on this economy's GII 2016 data availability. Indicator 6.2.5 (high-tech and medium-high-tech output) and indicator 7.2.4 (printing and publishing output): The time periods of data for Iceland, Madagascar, and Pakistan for these indicators include 2006 for heightened coverage based on these economies' GII 2016 data availability. 9 Based on Groeneveld and Meeden (1984), which sets the criteria of absolute skewness above 1 and kurtosis above 3.5. The skewness criterion was relaxed to account for the small sample at hand (127 economies). 10 This distributional issue affects (4 outliers). The treatment criterion was relaxed this year to allow a single series (6.3.4) with 7 outliers\u20146 outliers given the next highest value and 1 given the next lowest value\u2014to be winsorized instead of subjected to natural log transformation. This is because applying a log transformation at 1, 10, and 100 had the reverse effect, and instead of reducing skewness and kurtosis, it increased them. 11 This distributional issue affects variables 2.3.3, 4.3.3, 5.3.4, 6.3.1, and 7.2.5 (factor f of The corresponding formula for bads is: ln [(max x f - 1) x (max - economy value) + 1] max - min These formulas achieve two things: converting all series into 'goods' and scaling the series to the range [1, max] so that natural logs are positive starting at 0.

The Global Innovation Index (GII) aims to capture the multi-dimensional facets of innovation by providing a rich database of detailed metrics for 127 economies, which represent 92.5% of the world's population and 97.6% of global GDP. As Ban Ki-moon, the eighth Secretary-General of the United Nations, noted at the UN Economic and Social Council in 2013, the GII is a 'unique tool for refining innovation policies . . . for providing an accurate picture on the role of science, technology and innovation in sustainable development'. The GII 2017 marks the 10th edition of the GII, providing data and insights gleaned from tracking innovation across the globe for more than a decade. The GII was created to measure and understand which economies and regions respond best to the challenges of innovation, and has helped to shape the innovation agendas of nations since 2007. For more than 10 years, the agriculture and food sector has faced growing global demand and increased competition for limited natural resources. Within the agricultural and food systems, innovation is indispensable to achieving sustainable productivity growth; this innovation must be a priority and include organizational change, cooperation along the value chain, public and private investment in R&D, adaptation and adoption of new innovations, and education. A review of how innovation and technology trends and the enabling environments in which these systems operate and evolve will be essential to the success of this endeavour, creating an urgent need for improved metrics and indicators. The analysis in this year's edition, The Global Innovation Index 2017: Innovation Feeding the World, is dedicated to this theme, paving the way for improved strategies and policy making to foster innovation in food systems. Launched by INSEAD in 2007, today the GII is co-published by Cornell University, INSEAD, and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), a specialized agency of the United Nations. The 2017 edition of the GII draws on the expertise of its Knowledge Partners: the Confederation of Indian Industry, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Strategy&, and the National Confederation of Industry de Apoio \u00e0s Micro e Pequenas Empresas (Sebrae), as well as an Advisory Board of eminent international experts. For the seventh consecutive year, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission audited the GII calculations. The GII is concerned primarily with improving the journey towards a better way to measure and understand innovation and with identifying targeted policies and good practices that foster innovation. Written in a nontechnical language, the GII appeals to diverse groups including policy makers, business leaders, academics, and organizations of civil society. The full report can be downloaded at "}
