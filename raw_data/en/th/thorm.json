Persistent in fection with oncogenic HPV is rec- ognized as a necessary cause of cervical cancer. Approximately 70% of cervical cancers in the world are attributed to two of the most common HPV types, 16 and 18. This systematic review was carried out to assess whether the HPV vaccines currently offered to 11 to 12 year-old girls in Norway are also effective as a catch-up vaccination for women up to age 26 in pre- venting HPV-related diseases. For HPV vaccination of women aged 16 and older: The results show a protective effect of HPV vaccination against Cervical intraepithelial neopla sia grade 2 and higher (CIN2+) associated with the HPV types included in the vaccines (high quality of the evidence), and indica te a protective effect against all CIN2+ lesions (independent of HPV types in the lesions) (moderate quality of evidence). The quadrivalent HPV vaccine protects against genital warts (high quality evidence).

However, a small number of HPV types contribute to a large proportion of HPV-related diseas- es. Persistent infection with oncogenic HP V is recognized as a necessary cause of cervical cancer. Approximately 70% of cervical cancers in the world are attributed to two of the most common HPV types, 16 and 18. Efficient prophylactic vaccines can have an important public health impact. Under several plausible assumptions, an economic evaluation suggest that introduction of HPV 16/18 type vaccination to current scre ening in Norway may be a cost-effective strategy for further reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Prophylac-tic HPV vaccination was introduced in th e Norwegian childhood immunization pro- gram in 2009. It is unclear whether vaccinating older girls will also be beneficial, and The Norwegian Institute of Public Health requested a Health Technology As- sessment to ascertain the potential effectiveness of a catch-up vaccination of females up to 26 years of age. Objective To carry out a systematic review in order to assess whether HPV vaccines currently offered to 11- to 12-year-old girls in Norway are also effective as a catch-up vaccina-tion for women up to age 26 in preventing HPV-related diseases. Method We have conducted this systematic review in accordance with the Handbook for the Norwegian Knowledge Center for the Health Services. Two review authors reviewed all citations to identify relevant publications according to pre-specified criteria. Full text publications of potentially eligible references were 4Executive summary retrieved, and we assessed all included refe rences for risk of bias according to the Handbook. We extracted data from the incl uded references using a pre-designed da- ta recording form. These steps were done independently and then jointly by two re- view authors or by one of the review authors and then checked by one of the others. We entered and analyzed data using the Review Manager software and calculated risk ratios and the associated 95 % confiden ce interval for the es timate of effect. We applied the GRADE method (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop- ment and Evaluation) to assess the overal l quality of evidence for each outcome. Results The literature search for randomized controlled trials on HPV vaccines was conduct-ed in October 2012. We identified 616 refe rences. In addition, we received 12 refer- ences from the pharmaceutical companies with marketing authorization for HPV vaccines in Norway. After reading titles and abstracts and full texts, we included 46 references in the present report. The main findings of the review are: The pooled estimate for cervical intrae pithelial neoplasia grade 2 and higher (CIN2+) show a borderline statistically significant difference in CIN2+ risk between the vaccine and the control groups (inten 0.62, 1.02). The quality of the evidence for this outcome is moderate. The pooled estimate for CIN2+ lesions associated with the HPV types in the vaccine shows a statistically significant difference in the risk of these lesions between the vaccine and control groups (intention-to treat population, 0.44, 0.67). The quality of the evidence for this outcome is high. The pooled estimate for serious adverse events shows that there is no statistically significant difference between the vaccine and the control groups (safety population, longest reported follow-up) (RR= 0.99; 95 % CI= 0.91, 1.08). The quality of the evi- dence for this outcome is moderate. Discussion When combining the data for all pre-canc erous cervical lesions (CIN2+) in young women our results indicated a protective effect of these lesions. However, there is some uncertainty about the effectiveness of prophylactic HPV vaccination. The un-certainty is due to borderline significant results for CIN2+ lesions in the intention- to-treat and the per protocol population after a four-year follow-up. 5Executive summary Examining CIN2+ lesions independent of HPV type may reflect the possible wider public health impact of a HPV vaccination. Previous meta-analyses presented mostly results for lesions containing the HPV types included in vaccines under study (64;65). In line with previous meta-analyse s, we found that assumed risk in the pla- cebo group for HPV type related CIN2+ lesions is 22 per 1000, and the correspond- ing risk in the vaccine group is 12 per 1000. The confidence in this estimate (quality of the evidence) is high. High grade cervical lesions were chosen as the outcome of interest because they are immediate precursors to cervical cancer, and because they were described as the best outcome to us e when examining the effect of HPV vac- cination. There is some uncertainty regarding the long -term effect of the vaccines due to the relatively short follow-up periods of the clin ical trials. Since we will only know the true effect of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer and mortality outcomes in 20-30 years, long-term follow-up data for the vaccinated populations are important. No statistically significant difference in serious adverse events between the vaccina- tion and the placebo groups were found. Nevertheless, the number of cases within the clinical studies is not sufficient to determine the occurrence of rarely occurring (severe) adverse events in a reliable way. Long-term safety needs to be assessed in future trials and in possible follow-up publications of existing trials. We have conducted a systematic review base d on primary clinical trials of a random- ized controlled design. Randomized controlled trials are expected to be more robust against bias than observational studies, and are therefore the preferred design for studies of effect of an intervention. Howeve r, to assess long-term follow-up data and outcomes related to harm, observational and registry studies might be more appro-priate. National vaccination programs have already been started in many countries, but the true effect on cervical cancer outcomes of this vaccine will be observed 20-30 years from now. It remains to be seen whether we will see a dramatic reduction in HPV- associated diseases, such as cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, oral cavity, and oropharynx and tonsil cancers, as a result of a national vaccination programs. Conclusion Our systematic review of the effect of a catch-up HPV vaccination of young women demonstrates that: There is a protective effect of HPV vaccination against CIN2+ lesions associated with the HPV types in the vaccines (high quality of the evidence) and against all CIN2+ lesions (independent of HPV types in the lesions) (moderate quality of evidence). 6Executive summary Long-term (up to 8 years) follow-up after HPV vaccination indicates little or no difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events in the vaccine group when compared to the control group (moderate quality of evidence). Further research is needed to demonstrat e if there is an association between HPV vaccination and incidence of HPV related cancers, cancer related mortality and long-term safety. 70 % av halskreft i verden tilskrives to til \u00e5r og ca. 70 % av livmorhalskreft i verden tilskrives to av de vanligste fikk vi 12 referanser de farmas\u00f8ytiske ma rkedsf\u00f8ringstillatelse i vaksinene som studeres. per 1000, og derfor den foretrukne design for www.kunnskapssenteret.no/Publikasjoner 12Table of contents Table of contents KEY MESSAGES 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3 Background 3 Objective 3 Method 3 Results 4 Discussion 4 Conclusion 5 HOVEDFUNN (NORSK) 7 SAMMENDRAG (NORSK) Resultat 9 Diskusjon 9 Konklusjon 10 TABLE OF CONTENTS 12 PREFACE 14 OBJECTIVE 15 BACKGROUND 16 METHOD 19 Literature search 19 Inclusion criteria 20 Article selection 20 Assessment of risk of bias 21 Data extraction and management 21 Grading the quality of evidence 22 RESULTS 23 Description of included literature 24 HPV vaccine versus control (placebo, no vaccine or other vaccine) 28 13Table of contents HPV 16/18 vaccine versus HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccine 36 DISCUSSION 38 Main findings 38 Strengths and limitations of this review 39 Implications for practice and research 40 CONCLUSION 42 Need for further research 42 REFERENCES 44 APPENDIXES 50 Appendix 1.

We will perform a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) consisting of at least the three following elements: efficacy, safety and health economic evaluation. Efficacy and safety will be assessed through systemat ic reviews, and the economic evaluation will be performed through a modeling analysis. This systematic review of the effect of HPV vaccination of young women is the first deliverable of the Health Technology Asse ssment regarding a potential expansion of the current HPV vaccination strategy to include 12- year-old boys and catch-up vaccination of both young women and men. The project group consisted of: Project coordinator: Ingvil S\u00e6terdal, The Norwegian Knowledge Centre for Other participants: Elisabeth Couto, Lene Juvet, Ingrid Harboe and Marianne Klemp, The Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services We would like to thank Ingvild Vistad og Jon Mork for their expertise in this project. Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services assumes final responsibility for the content of this report. The aim of this report is to support well-informed decisions in health care that lead to improved quality of services. The evidence should be considered together with other relevant issues, such as clinic al experience and patient preference.

The burden of HPV infection is considerable (2;3). More than 100 types of HPV have been identified (4;5). However, a small number of HPV types contribute to a large proportion of HPV-related diseases. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV is recognized as a necessary cause of cervical cancer, with approxi- mately 70% of cervical cancers in the worl d attributed to two of the most common HPV types, 16 and 18 (3) (2,5). The WH O International Agency for Research on Cancer judged that there was sufficient evidence to support a causal role of HPV 16 infection in carcinoma of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, oral cavity, and oro-pharynx and tonsil (6). It was estimated th at 5.2% of all cancers worldwide are at- t r i b u t e d t o H P V i n f e ct i o n s ( 2 ) . M os t s e x u al l y ac t i v e w o men , a n d me n , w i l l ex p er i - ence an HPV infection during their lifetime (7). Efficient prophylactic vaccines could have an important public health impact. As cancer takes a long time to develop, it would be difficult to conduct clinical trials as- certaining the efficacy of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer and other cancer types associated with HPV. Furtherm ore, as screening for cervical cancer is available, con- ducting such trials would be unethical. Fo r these reasons, the WHO and the US Food and Drug Administration recommended that phase III trials examine vaccination efficacy on high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and 3 (CIN2/3) (8). These dysplastic lesions are precursors of invasive cervical cancer, as shown in Fig- ure 1. HPV 16 and 18 causes 50% of high -grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2/3) (9). Figure 1: Natural history of cervical cancer HPV infection is an established risk factor for vulvar and vaginal cancers (6). Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) are pre- cursor lesions for vulva and vaginal cancers, respectively. Examining the possible association between HPV vaccination and VIN and VaIN lesions could give an in-sight into the possible association between such a vaccination and the incidence of vulvar and vaginal cancers. The current cervical screening strategy in Norway is to take a cytological Pap-smear once every 3 years for women aged 25 to 69 (detailed algorithm for the Norwegian Cervical screening program can be found on the Cancer registry website (http://kreftregisteret.no/). A reduction in cervical cancer incidence was observed after screening program implementation (10). However, screening does not prevent HPV infection or development of pre-cancerous lesions. Identified pre-cancerous cells (CIN2+) are carefully followed and most commonly treated with excisional treatments, including loop electrosurgical excision procedures, laser conization and conization. Approximately 100% of genital warts (condy loma acuminate) are caused by either HPV 6 or 11 (11). An increasing incidence of genital warts has been described over recent decades in Europe (12). The prevalence of genital warts peaks in early sexual-ly active years (13). A Nordic study reported that approximately 10% of women had been diagnosed with genital warts before the age of 45 (13). Diagnosis of genital warts can cause psychological stress and -sexual dysfunction; treatment is expensive and recurrences are common (14-16). 18Background Under several plausible assumptions, an economic evaluation suggests that intro- duction of HPV 16/18 type vaccination to current screening in Norway may be a cost-effective strategy for further reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortal- ity (17), (18). Prophylactic HPV vaccination was introduced in the Norwegian child- hood immunization program in 2009. In Norway, the vaccines Gardasil\u00ae (directed at HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 ) and Cervar ix\u00ae (against 16 and 18 HPV types) were licensed for women aged 9 to 26, and currently Gardasil\u00ae is used to immunize 7 th grade school girls (aged 11 to 12 years). These vaccines are no n-infectious and con- tain virus-like particles. Because these vacc i n e s w e r e s h o w n t o b e m o r e e f f e c t i v e among women who were not already infected with HPV, it is unclear whether vac-cinating older women would be beneficial. Catch-up vaccination programs for older women have been implemented in 10 out of the 29 EU/EEA countries (19). Howev- er, the cost-effectiveness of a catch-up vacci nation for females up to 26 years has not yet been established in Norw ay and needs assessment before a decision can be made regarding implementation. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health requested a Health Technology Assess- ment to ascertain the potential effectivene ss of a catch-up vaccination of females up to 26 years of age. 19Method Method This report presents a systematic review of the effect of a catch-up HPV vaccination of young women. It sheds light on whether HPV vaccines currently offered to 11 to 12-year-old girls in Norway are also effective as catch-up vaccination of women up to 26 years in preventing HPV-related cancers. Literature search We systematically searched for relevant literature in the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE(R) 1946 to Present Embase 1980 to present Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central) ISI web of Science PubMed (epub ahead of print) Google scholar A methodology search filter was used to limit retrieval to randomized controlled tri- als. The search filter consisted of a comb ination of Randomized Controlled Trial.pt. (publication type), Randomized Controlled Trial (MeSH) and random*. as a text word (*=truncation). Studies about animal s or animal experiments were removed. The year of publication was limited to 1999 to current (since the vaccines were in-troduced to the international market, including Norway, in 2006 we did not expect to find relevant studies with publication date before this). The research librarian, Ingrid Harboe, plan ned and executed all the searches in col- laboration with the project group. We de veloped search strategies that combined selected index and free text terms. The complete search strategy is shown in appen- dix 1. Last search for studies was carried out in October 2012. We also looked for ongoing trials in Clinical Trials.gov and WHO ICTRP. We have listed all relevant trials in Appendix 5. Furthermore, we contacted the pharmaceutical companies with marketing authori- zation for HPV vaccines in Norway (Glaxo SmithKline AS and Sanofi Pasteur MSD) 20Method to obtain additional information and, if any, unpublished results that could be rele- vant to the reviewed topic and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Supplemental informa- tion was considered. Inclusion criteria The inclusion criteria for the systematic review were defined using the following PICO: Population: Women aged 16 and older (this population is currently not included in the HPV vaccina-tion program in Norway) Interventions: HPV vaccines Control: Placebo, no vaccine or other vaccines Outcome: Overall mortality Cancer related mortality Cervical cancer Cervical intraepithelial neop lasia grade 2 and higher (CIN2+) Vaginal stage 2 and higher (VaIN2+) Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia stage 2 and higher (VIN2+) Serious adverse events (SAE) Genital warts/condyloma Study design: Randomized controlled trials Languages: No language restrictions was applied during the literature search, but we only included studies written in English, Ger- man, Italian, French, Portuguese and Spanish, or one of the Scandinavian languages. We included full text references that assessed any of the predefined outcomes. Article selection The review authors worked independently and in pairs and reviewed all citations generated by the search to identify potentially relevant publications based on title and/or abstract. We retrieved the full text of all potentially eligible references and worked independently and in pairs to asse ss whether these references should be in- cluded based on the inclusion criteria. We resolved disagreements by discussion or, if required, we consulted one of the other review authors. 21Method Assessment of risk of bias Publications that met the predefined incl usion criteria were assessed for potential risk of bias according to the Handbook for the Norwegian Knowledge Centre (20). All assessments were performed and agreed upon by two of the review authors working independently. We resolved disagree ments by discussion or, if required, by consulting one of the other review authors. Data extraction and management One review author extracted data from the included references and another review author verified the data. We used a data extraction form that capt ured the following information: Identifica- tion details of the study (authors, year of publication, design and setting, clinical trial identification number or name, funding); Participant characteristics (gender, age); Intervention and control characteristics (type of vaccine and control, dose, vac- cination schedule); Outcomes (outcome data (results)), methods for assess- ing/measuring the outcome data, length of follow-up, loss to follow-up). We entered and analyzed the data using the Review Manager software (RevMan). We performed the meta-analyses using th e Mantel-Haenszel \"random effects mod- el\", since we expect some differences in effect sizes between populations and set- tings. However, if fewer than three studies reported the same clinical outcome we chose the \"fixed effect model\". We did this because we realized that the calculation of inter-study heterogeneity will be imprecise when the included studies show in- consistent results. If using fixed versus random effects models revealed significant results for one method and non-significant results for the other or if the results dif- fered significantly, we have presented the results for both methods. For dichoto- mous outcomes we calculated risk ratios (RR) and associated 95% confidence inter-vals. For all outcomes, we conducted each analysis according to the \"intention-to- treat\" principle, when possible. However, the intention-to-treat principle in its strictest form (all randomized subjects) wa s not possible, so we have defined the in- tention-to-treat population matching best the definition used in included studies. In addition, we conducted analyses according to per-protocol, when possible. For as- sessment of serious adverse events we co nducted the analyses based on the safety population as it was defined in each of th e studies. When the outcome data could not be pooled in meta-analyses, we described the results in a narrative form. Where data was reported in several publications, we used the publication with the longest follow-up. When a publication included several trials, preference was given to the publication that included the most trials in order to include the largest num-ber of participants in the analysis. 22Method We carried out analyses for HPV vaccination versus control. For the outcome CIN2+ and Condyloma we also carried out analysis based on the HPV DNA status in the lesions. Grading the quality of evidence Two review authors assessed the overall quality of evidence for each outcome ascer- tained using GRADE (Grading of Recomme ndations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). GRADE provides criteria for rating the quality of evidence considering study design, risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, publication bias, large effect, dose response gradient an d confounding factors. We followed the GRADE guidelines and categorized our confidence in the effect estimates into four levels: high, moderate, low and very low. We have presented both the results from the meta-analyses (the estimate of effect) and the quality rating in the \"Summary of Findings\" tables prepared using GRADE pr ofiler software (GRADEpro) . For more details about the GRADE system we refer to publications by the GRADE Working Group (www.gradeworkinggroup.org). 23Results Results The literature search for randomized controlled trials on HPV vaccines was conduct- ed in October 2012. We identified 616 refe rences. In addition, we received 12 refer- ences from the pharmaceutical companies with marketing authorization for HPV vaccines in Norway. After reading titles an d abstracts, 127 references were consid- ered as possibly eligible and were read in full text. We excluded 81 references (these are listed in Appendix 4), and examined 46 references for the present report. A flow diagram of the selection proc ess is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Flow diagram for selection of literature. 127 references evaluated in full text 501 references excluded on the basis of title and abstract 81 references excluded for details, see Appendix 4 46 references included 616 identified references from literature search 12 references received from industry 24Results Description of included literature The 46 included references represent 13 diff erent main clinical trials, with some of the main clinical trials included in severa l studies. An overview of the included ref- erences is given in Table 1 and characteristics of the included studies are shown in Appendix 2. The participants in the studies were health y, non-pregnant women with an age rang- ing from 15 to 45 years. One of the studies included women aged 9 to 23 years, but the mean age was 17 years, so we decided to include the study (21). FUTURE proto-col 19 (22;23) included women aged 24 to 45, mean age 34 years. However, we in- cluded this study since our inclusion criterion was women aged 16 and older. For some of the studies, there was a requirement of no history of HPV infection and negative HPV tests at entry into the study (24). In addition, fewer than four to six lifetime sex partners was also a requiremen t in some of the studies (21;24-26). The studies were conducted in North America (USA and Canada), South America, Eu- rope and Asia. Vaccines used in the trials were the bivale nt vaccine containing HPV 16 and 18 virus- like particles (VLP) from GlaxoSmithKline, and the monovalent vaccine containing HPV 16 VLP and quadrivalent vaccine containing HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 both from Merck. All trials used placebo as comparat or except for one that used hepatitis B vaccine in both the intervention and the control groups (27), and another that com-pared the bivalent and the quadrivalent va ccines (28). All vaccines were given as three doses within six months (Day 1, mont h 2 and month 6 or month 0, 1 and 6). The studies were generally assessed as having low risk of bias; however some of the studies had unclear allocation concealment and unclear blinding. The risk of bias assessment for the included references is shown in Appendix 2. Table 1.

The au- thors reported that none of the deaths were considered to be related to the vaccina- tion in either the vaccine or control groups. Cancer related mortality and cervical cancer We did not find any references that reported results for cancer related mortality or cervical cancer for this comparison. CIN2+ For the outcome CIN2 and higher grade lesions (CIN2+), we present data for all CIN2+ lesions and for CIN2+ lesions associ ated with the HPV types in the vaccine. HPV CIN2+ lesions associated with the HPV types in the vaccine are those for which the HPV type in the lesion is the same as in the vaccine. Results are presented for a follow-up period of four years for both the intention-to-treat and the per protocol populations. We also present results for th e intention-to-treat population for up to eight years. All types of CIN2+ lesions (in intention-to-treat- and per protocol-populations) We included five studies that reported on all CIN2+ lesions for the intention-to-treat population after a four-year follow-up.

The cost-effectiveness of such a vaccination will be covered in a separate report. Since cervical cancer usu- ally develops very slowly, HPV vaccine data are still too recent to provide long-term evidence on cervical cancer and cancer related mortality. While this review indicates a protective effect of HPV vaccination on cervical pre-cancerous lesions, it is still un- known whether the HPV vaccines lower cervical cancer incidence. Due to the rela- tively short follow-up periods of published cl inical trials up, the long term effect of HPV vaccination remains unclear. This systematic review can therefore not demon- strate any prevention of cervical cancer or reduction in overall mortality from the included studies. Main findings When combining the data for all pre-canc erous cervical lesions (CIN2+) in young women our results indicated a protective effect of these lesions. However, there is some uncertainty about the effectiveness of prophylactic HPV vaccination. The un- certainty is due to borderline significant results for CIN2+ lesions in the intention-to-treat and the per protocol population after a four-year follow-up. Examining CIN2+ lesions independent of HP V type may reflect the possible wider public health impact of an HPV vaccination. Previous meta-analyses presented mostly results for lesions containing the HP V types included in vaccines under study (64;65). In line with previous meta-analyse s, we found that assumed risk in the pla- cebo group for HPV type related CIN2+ lesions is 22 per 1000, and the correspond- ing risk in the vaccine group is 12 per 1000. The confidence in this estimate (quality of the evidence) is high. High grade cervical lesions were chosen as the outcome of interest because they are immediate precursors to cervical cancer, and because they were described as the best outcome to us e when examining the effect of HPV vac- cination (8). The intention-to-treat analysis is the most relevant from a public health perspective since it reflects the expected results if the HPV vaccine was offered to a broader pop- 39Discussion ulation (the population would include peop le who will not take the vaccine or not take all the required doses). The studies va ried in their inclusions criteria regarding previous HPV status. We have not analyzed separately the results for HPV na\u00efve women and women with a previous history of HPV infection. However, the com-bined analysis might better reflect the general population, and, in particular, the population that would be targeted by a potential catch-up HPV vaccination. There is some uncertainty regarding the long term effect of the vaccines due to the relatively short follow-up periods of the clin ical trials. Since we will only know the true effect of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer and mortality outcomes in 20-30 years, long term follow-up data for the vaccinated populations are important. Using population registry data matched to vacc ination information has been described as the best study design for studying long-term effects after HPV vaccination (66). Evidence from clinical trials has shown lo wer incidence of genital warts (condyloma acuminata) in HPV vaccinated women. Am ong all women in the intention-to-treat analysis, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine provided protection against genital warts associated with the HPV types included in the vaccine. For genital warts, associated with the HPV types in the vaccine, the assumed risk in the placebo group is 30 per 1000, and the corresponding risk in the vaccine group is 8 per 1000. The confidence in these estimates (quality of the evidence) is high. Large cohort studies in Sweden and in Australia reported similar results (67) (69). Genital warts has a shorter incu- bation time after incident HPV infection an d, as such, is an ideal measure for early evaluations of HPV vaccine effectiveness (68). The follow-up period of vaccinated cohorts in Sweden is still too short to assess the effectiveness against pre-cancerous lesions or invasive HPV-related cancers (6 7). Cohorts in Australia showed the same trend (69). An analysis of 85 770 new patien ts from six Australian sexual health clin- ics showed a remarkable reduction in the proportion of women under 21 years of age presenting with genital warts\u2014from 11.5 % in 2007 to 0.85 % in 2011 (69). No statistically significant difference in serious adverse events between the vaccina-tion and the placebo groups were found. Nevertheless, the number of cases within the clinical studies is not sufficient to determine the occurrence of rarely occurring (severe) adverse events in a reliable way. Long-term safety needs to be assessed in future trials and in possible follow-up publications of existing trials. Strengths and limitations of this review We have conducted a systematic review base d on primary clinical trials of a random- ized controlled design. Randomized controlled trials are expected to be more robust against bias than observational studies, and are therefore the preferred design for studies of the effect of an intervention. However, to assess long-term follow-up data 40Discussion and outcomes related to harm, observational and registry studies might be more ap- propriate. Since data from the same clinical trial are published in many different publications within the field of HPV vaccination, we ch oose to prepare our ow n systematic review rather than building on others. We did this in order to get an overview of all the da-ta, and also to assure, as far as possible, that all the data is compiled. All included studies are sponsored by the vaccine producers. This can be a source of bias since drug studies funded by the pharmaceutical industry have been found to be more likely to present outcomes in favor of the sponsor (70). To limit the risk of publication bias, protocols for clinical trials are supposed to be registered in interna-tional databases so that it will be more transparent to follow what was planned and what is published. Implications for practice and research In 2007, Australia became one of the first countries to implement a nationally fund- ed HPV vaccination program for girls and young women with the quadrivalent vac- cine (71). It started with the vaccination in schools of girls aged 12 years and was fol- lowed by a catch-up program of girls and women aged 13-26 years. Quadrivalent vaccine protects against HPV types 6 and 11, which cause more than 90% of genital warts, in addition to HPV types 16 and 18, which are strongly associated with an in-creased risk of cervical cancer. Australian vaccination coverage rates were almost 80% for all three doses. Both Sweden and Denmark from the Nordic countries have already implemented catch-up programs, while Finland has not made the decision at the time of this report's publication. Most women have positive attitudes and high intentions toward HPV vaccination as stated by a recent systematic review (72). Modeling the impact of screening policy and screening compliance on incidence and mortality of cervical cancer has shown that greatest health gains were accomplished by ensuring a high vaccine uptake (73). It still needs to be assessed whether the HPV vaccine program could lead to a reduc- tion in attendance at cervical cancer screening programs. The model showed that screening of young women <30 years remains important and that increasing the screening interval to 5 years might lead to 4.7-11,3% additional cancers per year (73). HPV distribution varies a bit geographically. Our review includes studies from South and North America and from Europe. In No rth America HPV 16 and 53 are the most common HPV types, in South America HPV 16 and 58 are most frequent and in northern Europe HPV 16 and 18 are the most prevalent types (1). Since the vaccine seems to be effective for the lesions that are HPV related to the vaccines, the results 41Discussion might be even better for the northern Euro pe population than was demonstrated in the trials. National vaccination programs have already been started in many countries, but the true effect on cervical cancer outcomes of this vaccine will first come 20-30 years from now. It remains to be seen whether we will see a dramatic reduction in HPV- associated diseases, such as cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, oral cavity, and oropharynx and tonsil cancers, as a result of a national vaccination programs. 42Conclusion Conclusion Our systematic review of the effect of a catch-up HPV vaccination of young women demonstrates that: There is a protective effect of HPV vaccination against CIN2+ lesions associated with the HPV types in the vaccines (high quality of the evidence) and all CIN2+ lesions (independent of HPV types in the lesions) (moderate quality of evidence). Long-term (up to 8 years) follow-up after HPV vaccination indicates little or no difference in the occurrence of serious adverse events in the vaccine group when compared to the control group (moderate quality of evidence). Need for further research The present systematic review found no results for incidence of cervical cancer or cancer related mortality. Long-term follow -up studies are required to demonstrate if there is an effect of HPV vaccination on cancer outcomes. Long-term follow-up studies are also required to generate more data on the safety aspects of the vaccine. We suggest the following PICO for long-term studies to demonstrate effect on can- cer, cancer related mortality and safety: Design: Prospective observational studies (vaccinated versus non-vaccinated co- horts) and registry studies. Population: Women Intervention and comparator: HPV vaccines versus placebo or other HPV vaccines. Outcomes: Cancer related mortality, cervical cancer, other cancer types, pre- cancerous lesions unrelated of HPV status in the lesions, serious adverse events International collaboration is essential in order to generate sufficient data and avoid duplication of work. 43Conclusion 44References References Reference List 1. de SS, Diaz M, Castellsague X, Clifford G, Bruni L, Munoz N, et al.
