Overview of the TrustWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/228 1.1 Chairman and Chief Executive's Introduction 2021 - 2022 has been yet another extraordinary year for Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals. It has, however, been very different to 2020 - 2021, and this is thanks, almost exclusively, to the highly effective, national COVID-19 vaccination programme, in which we have played our part. Further successive waves of COVID-19, including the most recent wave of Omicron, have had a progressively less severe impact, and whilst not at all an insignificant burden of demand, we have become increasingly adept at managing it. A key theme for our annual report this year, therefore, reflects the full restoration and recovery of all our services alongside living with, and working with, COVID-19 in the new operating environment in which we find ourselves. The pattern of demand remains high, with simultaneous pressures on both the unplanned care and planned care pathways. Urgent care attendances have also increased concurrently, as we have been trying to reduce our backlog waiting lists. And all of this sits within the context of escalation bed capacity needing to be kept open, and considerably higher than usual staff sickness absence as a result of COVID-19. Notwithstanding, WHH has responded with vigour and agility despite the relentless nature of the pressure. And, in this respect, we would very much wish to pay tribute to the 4,700 staff across our hospitals who have repeatedly risen to the challenges presented to them, working together as a team, with great kindness and good humour. Whilst our plans for the year have needed to remain responsive to the situation we faced, we have maintained a constant focus on quality, people and sustainability in line with our strategic objectives. We would very much wish to pay tribute to the 4,700 staff across our hospitals who have repeatedly risen to the challenges presented to them Steve McGuirk CBE DL QFSM, ChairmanProfessor Simon Constable FRCP, Chief ExecutiveWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/229 Investment in our estate, facilities and equipment has been a prominent feature of our quality strategy over the last year. The autumn of 2021 was especially busy for several different schemes. Firstly, we invested over \u00a35.5m in radiology services, including a new MRI Centre and scanner plus a refurbished CT Scanning Suite. This investment has helped reduce the waiting time backlog, supported the delivery of more and better diagnostic services for patients, as well as increased our research and teaching capabilities. We were also proud to unveil the grand re-opening of Ward B18 as our new Acute Respiratory Unit (ARU) in October 2021. The enhanced care area is based upon the Respiratory Support Unit model referenced in recent national guidance and will provide a safe and effective environment to manage complex respiratory illnesses. However, the real value of the new unit lies in its flexibility, with the ability to escalate up to 14 enhanced care beds to cope with further pandemic or winter surges. The B18 ARU is the culmination of incredibly close working between our critical care and respiratory teams through the COVID-19 pandemic and supports the development of common shared pathways, bids for equipment, staff training and a whole lot more. Thirdly, we started work on the two-storey, \u00a36.3m 1,170sqm Emergency Department expansion which is on track for a summer 2022 handover. The expansion will enable the creation of a new Same Day Emergency Care unit offering urgent 'hot' clinics and assessment areas for ambulatory care in an expanded and redesigned space. It will also increase capacity to deliver acute care for patients when the existing Emergency Department footprint regularly sees double the number of patients than for which it was designed. Our teams are to be commended for maintaining high standards despite the restrictions of the current estate. Finally, we are very proud of both our sites and consequently we have continued to improve the range of services at Halton Hospital, which, in fact, has come in to its own as a result of around \u00a33 million investment and is now starting to thrive as a centre for elective care. Towards the end of 2021 we held an official opening of our new Breast Care Centre at the Captain Sir Tom Moore building (CSTM) and the new Pre-Treatment Centre adjacent to the CSTM. The Breast Care Centre offers a superior location for women in Halton, Knowsley, St Helens and Warrington to choose to attend for their routine breast screening mammograms. It also provides comprehensive diagnostics and support to patients that have anomalies on routine breast screening or those who have noticed breast changes or found lumps that are referred in via their GP. In creating this centre, we have relocated our assessment and symptomatic clinics from the Victorian Kendrick Wing at Warrington Hospital, supported by an extensive public consultation. Our clinical research offer has gone from strength to strength. As many as 30 studies are open to recruitment at any one time including those for services such as critical care, gastroenterology, maternity, paediatrics, and rheumatology. A significant proportion of the team work at the Halton Clinical Research Unit, one of the only dedicated research units opened in a district general hospital in England. Since its opening in March 2021, this fantastic space has hosted three COVID-19 vaccine studies, and we intend to open more studies covering a wider range of conditions and investigative products. The end result of that kind of global research is plain to see. WHH has administered over 70,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines, of which over 10,000 were boosters. An initiative between ourselves and North West Ambulance Service has resulted in significant reductions in the amount of time it takes to transfer a patient from an ambulance to the care of our Emergency Department Team. Since implementing a dedicated ambulance reception process, we are now delivering handover times of 15 minutes or less on a much more frequent basis. Indeed Warrington Hospital has not only achieved the best overall ambulance handover times in the region, but also one of the region's most improved performances. Although a small change, by speeding up the handover time, we are not only improving the patient experience, but we are enabling the ambulance crews to reduce their time at Warrington - giving them more time to respond to other urgent calls, which is so important for patients waiting at home. Quality We will always put our patients first, delivering safe and effective care and an excellent patient experience. WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2210 Looking after, and developing, our staff has always been a central tenet of our COVID-19 response. Our 'people professionals' are on the front line helping us adapt, stay safe and maintain our own health and wellbeing whilst responding to the challenges of an ever-changing workplace; and at the same time, having to adapt to different circumstances and ways of working ourselves. Moreover, we have continued to develop our leadership and enhance our health and wellbeing offer. In terms of recruitment and retention, in yet another extraordinary year for global nursing, we have further embraced the opportunity of international nurse recruitment and by the end of 2021 we had welcomed 90 overseas nurses, including refugees. We were also very pleased to see the opening of the Habab Clinical Education Centre, in Kendrick Wing, in memory of our very own Jo Habab, lost to COVID-19 in May 2020. In pursuit of ever more meaningful engagement, diversity and inclusion, our four staff networks have made real progress, embracing change and driving innovation in equal measure. The We delivered the financial position agreed with our regulator, recording an adjusted surplus position of \u00a30.2m at the close of the year which was slightly better than the breakeven plan we had previously agreed. COVID-19 expenditure was \u00a37.8m and the final Capital spend for the year was \u00a319m; yet another busy year for our capital programme as noted in the descriptions above. Importantly, our cash balance has continued to allow the prompt payment of our suppliers. We are especially aware of the importance of the part we play in the social and economic wellbeing of the communities we serve as an anchor institution and this is very much shaping the way we continue to evolve our services for the future, including a commitment to Net Zero Carbon and our Green Plan.networks are keen to amplify the voices of staff and use their influence to shape the workplace. In addition, the staff networks are already acting as advocates to support staff and function as key change agents to meet the needs of staff and patients. Our newly formed Veterans Staff Network had been incredibly busy constructing the beautiful poppy fields and rivers at both Halton and Warrington, in time for our inaugural Armistice Day service in November. Our Disability Awareness Network led initiatives to broaden the awareness and understanding of hidden disabilities. Recognising excellence and the display of all our values has also been a key feature of this year. In the summer of 2021, we introduced the new 'You Made a Difference' Awards, replacing the team/employee of the month awards suspended during the first 18 months of the pandemic. These awards highlight the amazing ways Team WHH go the extra mile to really make a difference to people's lives, day in and day out. December also saw the annual Thank You Awards with 326 nominations - smashing last year's record of 215. People Sustainability We will work in partnership with others to achieve social and economic wellbeing in our communities.We will be the best place to work with a diverse and engaged workforce that is fit for now and the future.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2211 Looking ahead WHH has an exciting year ahead, with several developments planned for some time finally coming to fruition. We will see the handover and opening of our Same Day Emergency Care Unit, as well as new facilities for paediatric outpatients, urology investigation and cardiac catheterisation. There will be further development of Halton Hospital as a diagnostic and treatment centre. We will also spread beyond our traditional 'hospital walls' to work with partners in delivering healthcare in different settings, with the provision of ophthalmology, audiology and dietetics services in Runcorn Shopping City, the first hospital in the country to provide services in a shopping centre. We will see a new \u00a33m health and wellbeing hub in Warrington Town Centre, as well as a \u00a31m health and social care academy in Warrington. All of these are further enhancing our role and responsibility as an anchor institution to deliver social value and support regeneration in the towns for which we care.These investments in our estate will support the Trust to maintain services until such time as we are able to secure a new hospital for Warrington, as well as redevelop and enhance our Halton site in a way that is complementary. At present, we are simply making the best use of what we have; we remain committed to making the most of our ageing estate and facilities to ensure the people of Warrington and Halton can access the very best care and support when they need it. We have submitted a proposal to secure one of the last remaining eight places in HM Government's national new hospitals programme which will provide grant funding totalling \u00a33.7billion. A final decision on the funding of successful bids is expected later in 2022. The town of Warrington has simply outgrown its hospital, its aging buildings and facilities. 2022-23 is looking very challenging financially with current plans showing a deficit and \u00a314m efficiency savings to be made. Targets for activity recovery will be a challenge on our resources, both workforce and financially. An absolute attention to effectiveness and efficiency is key to the delivery of all the above, but WHH is nothing if not a self-confident organisation with talented and committed teams, all ready, willing and able to rise to the challenges emerging as we stand up to face the 'new normal' and as we look forward to being at the centre of our local place partnerships as well as playing a central role in the new Integrated Care System.Steve McGuirk CBE DL QFSM, Chairman Professor Simon Constable Executive May 2022Signed:WE LOVE OUR NHS WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2212 The Trust comprises two acute (secondary) care hospitals across two sites in the boroughs of Warrington and Halton. The principal purpose of the Trust is the provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England. The Trust does not fulfil its principal purpose unless, in each financial year, its total income from the provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England is greater than its total income from the provision of goods and services for any other purposes. The Trust may provide goods and services for any purposes related to: 1. The provision of services provided to individuals for or in connection with the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness, and 2. The promotion and protection of public health. The Trust may also carry out activities other than those mentioned above for the purpose of making additional income available in order better to carry on its principal purpose. The purpose of this Performance Overview is to give the reader a short summary that provides them with sufficient information to understand the organisation, its purpose, the key risks to the achievement of its objectives and how it has performed during the year. The Trust and its place in the Wider Health Economy The Trust is part of the Cheshire and Merseyside Health and Care Partnership for Cheshire and Merseyside - the second largest in the country - and which will become the C&M Integrated Care System during 2022. Locally, straddling two boroughs, the Trust is a core part of the 'place' level health and social care systems - Warrington Together and One Halton. The purpose of this Performance Overview is to give the reader a short summary that provides them with sufficient information to understand the organisation, its purpose, the key risks to the achievement of its objectives and how it has performed during the year. The Trust Warrington Hospital (the 'hot' site) is home to all urgent, emergency and medical care, some complex surgical and critical care, specialist medical care for stroke and in-patient dementia, maternity, women's and children's care. Halton Hospital is located in Runcorn and as the 'cold' site is where the majority of elective and diagnostics programmes are delivered. The Runcorn Urgent Treatment Centre is also located here. Halton Hospital comprises two distinct buildings, the Captain Sir Tom Moore (formerly known as Cheshire and Merseyside Treatment Centre) and Nightingale (formerly known as Halton General) buildings. Although each site focuses on particular aspects of care, outpatient clinics for all specialties and diagnostic services are provided at both Warrington and Halton hospitals so patients can access their appointments closer to home wherever possible. Some outpatient services are also delivered in the local community. The hospital sites are eight miles apart and are easily accessible being very close to the North-West motorway networks.1.2 About the Trust WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2213 Services provided at Warrington Hospital include: Accident and Emergency, surgical services, general medicine, children's services (paediatrics), cardiac care and cardiac catheter lab, stroke care, cancer care, elderly care, maternity, gynaecology, neonatal, orthopaedic trauma, critical care and ophthalmology.

Warrington General Hospital was created from the workhouse in 1898. In 1929 it was renamed Warrington Borough Hospital and to this day is referred to as the Borough by many people. There were two other hospitals on the site; Aikin Street (an infectious diseases hospital) and Whitecross Hospital, which was run by the military. In 1973 a decision was taken to merge all three hospitals into Warrington District General Hospital. The current hospital has grown in four stages since then. Aikin Street was demolished in the 1970s to make way for Appleton Wing of the current hospital (where the A&E, medical wards and theatres are located) which was phase A of the new General. Burtonwood Wing opened in 1988 with the stroke, elderly care and children's wards. The main building of Whitecross Hospital was demolished in the late 1980s to make way for the Croft Wing which opened in 1994 and houses maternity and women's services. The Daresbury Wing opened in 1998 and was a surgical unit with single rooms. In 1993 the government decided to separate the role of health authorities and hospitals and the hospital was handed over from Warrington Health Authority to the newly formed Warrington Hospital NHS Trust. North Cheshire Hospitals NHS Trust was formed by the merger of Warrington Hospital NHS Trust and Halton General Hospital NHS Trust in 2001. The hospital has undergone significant development over recent years with a rebuilt accident and emergency and coronary care unit and refurbishment of most of the wards. A new critical care unit costing \u00a36.25 million opened in February 2009 and in late 2010 new endoscopy and eye surgery units opened in the Appleton Wing.In September 1976, Halton General Hospital was opened in Runcorn. It was a newly built 70-inpatient- bed hospital, next door to Shopping City Runcorn and part of the development of Runcorn New Town. Halton Health Authority passed control of the hospital to the newly formed Halton General Hospitals NHS Trust in 1993. In 2001 North Cheshire Hospital NHS Trust was formed by the merger of Halton General Hospital NHS Trust and Warrington Hospital NHS Trust. In 2006 a reconfiguration of services saw the Trust's emergency and acute medical care work centralised at Warrington Hospital and planned surgical work move to Halton General. Although Halton has never had a full accident and emergency department it is now home to a state-of-the-art Urgent Care Centre where nurse- led care is available for minor injuries and ailments. A new operating theatre opened at the hospital in 2007 to provide extra surgical services. In 2008 new step- down care wards, a renal dialysis unit and an expanded chemotherapy centre opened. The Trust took ownership of the neighbouring Cheshire and Merseyside Treatment Centre in July 2012. The centre was previously home to a private healthcare provider. It has four operating theatres, 44 inpatient beds and a range of clinic, physio and scanning facilities and the Trust's orthopaedic surgery services are based there - moving from Warrington Hospital in Autumn 2012. The Trust achieved Teaching Hospital status in November 2019 and Halton General Hospital was renamed Halton Hospital with two distinct renamed buildings - The Nightingale Building (formerly the general hospital) and The Captain Sir Tom Moore Centre (formerly the Cheshire and Merseyside Treatment Centre) in 2020 in recognition of the Captain's exceptional contribution to and support of the NHS during the pandemic and recognising Florence Nightingale's unique service to the very earliest in safe, organised patient care. The Trust became a Foundation Trust in 2008 and has circa 15K members. It was inspected and rated 'GOOD' by the Care Quality Commission in 2019, with critical care achieving an 'Outstanding' rating for care.1.3 A brief history of the Trust and its statutory backgroundWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2218 In year, the Trust submitted a proposal to secure one of the last remaining eight places in the Government's national new hospitals programme which will provide grant funding totalling \u00a33.7billion - a decision is expected in the Spring 2022. The new hospitals programme will create two co-dependent acute hospitals with services targeted to local needs addressing deficits in life expectancy. The plan includes a new purpose-built hospital in Warrington for emergency and unplanned care and women's and children's services and a state-of-the-art planned care centre in Runcorn, Halton. The Trust is ideally placed to make these changes with a rare, dedicated 'hot' and 'cold' site, but its estate is aged and, in some instances, not fit for purpose. A medium sized investment of \u00a3335m will deliver sizeable return on investment of \u00a35 for every \u00a31 spent since maintenance costs, just to stand still, are in the tens of millions and growing every year. The Trust believes its scheme is unique in that it will support the regeneration of the towns of Warrington and Runcorn, tackling health inequalities, deprivation and supporting new growth, development and prosperity of the local communities. With this new infrastructure, the Trust will be able to compete on a level playing field for scarce clinical staff, many of whom choose newer, purpose-built facilities in the nearby Liverpool and Manchester cities. The programme offers more opportunities for education, employment and immigration of skilled workers - ultimately creating wealth in their communities. The commitment to reducing harmful pollution and carbon emissions - to the tune of 11K tonnes per year - is central to planned infrastructure development.While a decision is awaited, the Trust remains committed to making the most of its ageing estate and facilities to ensure the people of Warrington and Halton can access the very best care and support when they need it. The Vision for the Future Warrington Hospital: To create a new and future- proofed hospital as a focal point of a wider health and wellbeing campus, replacing aging and outdated facilities with a modern, sustainable, compliant estate which reflects the town's population growth (4th biggest population increase in the Northwest since 2001). This will require the redesign of facilities, building in aspirations for providing the patient population with exceptional unplanned and emergency care. Halton Hospital: Halton will be an outstanding, dedicated centre for elective care, taking advantage of its location and accessibility to host services for its patient population and for the wider Cheshire and Merseyside Region. Building on its existing green surroundings a campus environment will support improving outcomes for patients and addressing wider inequalities. This will involve replacing the dated General Hospital building with a new wing adjacent to the flagship Captain Sir Tom Moore building. Released land will enable creation of a wellbeing campus, supporting the regeneration of Halton Lea - one of the most deprived wards in England. This development would see the Trust working in partnership with the local authority, commissioners, housing associations and other partners to maximise use of the released land to provide complementary facilities such as a leisure facility, rehabilitation and up to 200 new homes. New hospitals and facilities at both Warrington and Halton, and health hubs in accessible locations throughout the communities, are vital whichever funding mechanism becomes available to: Address health inequalities Provi de high quality clinical facilities to meet growing demands Level up communities by providing equal access to a dedicated diagnostic and elective centre for Cheshire and Merseyside Future proof estate, facilities and services Deliver a green and sustainable future1.4 The future of the Trust - vision WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2219 The key issues and risks that could affect the Trust in delivering its objectives are as below. These risks are recorded on the Board Assurance Framework and are scrutinised bi-monthly by the Board and at each of the Quality Assurance Committee and the Audit Committee meetings. These risks vary on an ongoing basis and are downgraded or upgraded as a result of changing circumstances and the implementation of mitigations. These risks are valid at 31st March 2022. The organisation has identified the following strategic risks (Red risks rated at 15 and above) and details of the full Board Assurance Framework including mitigations can be found in the Trust Board papers here: Board Meetings and Papers :: Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Trust (whh.nhs.uk)1.5 Principle Risks Risk ID Risk DescriptionCurrent RatingTarget Rating 224Failure to meet the four-hour emergency access standard and incur recordable 12-hour Decision to Admit (DTA) breaches, caused by capacity constraints in the Local Authority, Private Provider and Primary Care capacity resulting in potential risks to the quality of care and safety to patient, staff health and wellbeing, Trust reputation, financial impact and below expected patient experience.25 (5x5) 8 (2x4) 1215Failure to deliver the capacity required caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and potential environmental constraints resulting in delayed appointments, treatments and potential harm25 (5x5) 6 (3x2) 1273Failure to provide timely patient discharge caused by system-wide COVID-19 pressures, resulting in potential reduced capacity to admit patients safely.25 (5x5) 5 (5x1) 115Failure to provide minimal staffing levels in some wards and departments.

For this reason, the directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the accounts, following the definition of going concern in the public sector adopted by HM Treasury's Financial Reporting Manual.1.6 Going Concern Disclosure WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2222 Performance Analysis2.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2223 The Performance Assurance Framework (PAF) outlines how the Trust develops and maintains effective systems and processes for monitoring, managing and improving performance across the organisation. The PAF is reviewed and refreshed at least annually. The Performance Assurance Framework sets out the approach the Trust undertakes in ensuring there are effective systems in place to monitor, manage and improve performance. Prompt reviews will be undertaken where performance is deteriorating, and appropriate actions will be implemented to bring performance back to an acceptable level. The Performance Assurance Framework: 1. Sets out clear lines of accountability and responsibility for delivery of performance from Ward to Board. 2. Ensures performance objectives are agreed and transparent measurements are set to monitor performance against these standards, targets and plans. 3. Ensure performance delivery is focused and is seen as a continual process which is embedded in all aspects of organisational activity. 4. Provides assurance to the Board, Governors, Stakeholders and the Public that the organisation has strong systems in place to deliver the highest standards of patient care. 5. Supports the achievement of the Trust objectives. 6. Supports the delivery of the requirements of the Trust Foundation Licence, NHS Improvement Oversight Framework and the NHS Standard Contract. 7. Provides focus on and assurance of best value for money ensuring that services meet the needs of the local population and local health economy. 8. Support the delivery of an engaged and motivated workforce with the right skills and capacity to provide consistent, good quality care. 9. Recognise good performance and improvement and share good practice. 10. Sets out the process for managing performance risks/issues with a balance between challenge and support.The Trust Board meets bi-monthly and receives the Integrated Performance Report (IPR) which is presented with explanation from the Executive Directors. The Trust Board may request one or more performance improvement actions where there is a concern with any area of performance. KPIs within the Board IPR are reviewed and agreed annually by Board Committees with approval from the Trust Board. KPIs may be changed in year with the support of the appropriate Board Committee and the approval of the Trust Board. The IPR Dashboard contains the following elements which are designed to provide the Trust Board with assurance around the performance of the Trust against the KPIs and to highlight areas of improvement and good practice: 1. Exception Report - the front section of the document is an exception report which highlights KPIs which have been RAG rated Red as well as any movements in KPIs month to month. 2. RAG-rated Movements - this section shows a rolling 12-month RAG rating and the movement in performance against each KPI. 3. High Level Summary - the IPR is split into 4 key areas: Quality, Access & Performance, Workforce and Finance. A high-level summary is provided for each of these areas. 4. Dashboard - The dashboard details current and historic levels of performance, reasons for under performance and/or performance deterioration and detail of actions and investigations underway to improve performance against the KPI. The dashboard contains Statistical Process Control charts which look at data over time to determine if a process is within control or not. These charts are used alongside traditional RAG ratings to identify areas of focus. There is an annual rolling programme of auditing of KPIs to ensure there is assurance around the quality of the data and reporting processes which is facilitated by the Trust's internal auditors MIAA.2.1 Performance measures, KPIs, links to risk and uncertaintiesWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2224 Trust Strategic Objectives The Performance Assurance Framework tracks the key performance indicators required to achieve the Trust's Strategic Objectives: Quality, People and Sustainability To achieve our vision, we believe we need to focus on the QUALITY of our services, on the PEOPL E who deliver them and on ensuring our organisation's SUSTAINABILITY , within the wider health economies in which we operate.

Information relating to ethnicity, deprivation and other protected characteristics is accessible as part of the Key Performance Indicator dashboards. Further developments are planned with the aim of being able to review and monitor disparities in waiting lists/times/DNAs between different patient groups. Summary Activity (Data vs 2019-20 as being most representative year pre-COVID-19 pandemic) The delivery of the four-hour urgent care standard was impacted across the year by the ongoing pandemic conditions, delivering a performance similar to the previous 12 months. In some months attendances to the Emergency Department rose c15% higher than pre-pandemic levels. When performance is benchmarked against regional and national peers, Warrington is consistently ranked in the middle of the national league tables. Performance was impacted by a high number of delayed transfers from hospital into social care, again, due to impact of the pandemic. The Trust continues to work closely with community and local authority partners to overcome these challenges as well as increasing bed capacity to meet the increased demand for services. Despite the challenges, the Urgent Care Service maintained good delivery throughout the year and worked collaboratively with North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) to make sustained reductions to ambulance handover waiting times. Improvements were also made to the Paediatric Emergency Department with a full refurbishment and increased capacity to see and treat more patients.

For a significant number of radiological modalities performance is now meeting the less than 1% standard. Challenges remain for Cardiorespiratory and Endoscopy but are on an improving trajectory. The Trust did not achieve the 18-week Referral to Treatment standard in 2021-22 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the beginning of the pandemic the RTT waiting list has grown by circa 6K patients. Throughout the year the Trust has complied with all national elective restoration and recovery guidance and participated in the National Clinical Validation programme, completing the programme of work within the expected timescales. The Trust continues to undertake a recovery elective programme with:1. Urgent cancer and elective activity being prioritised along with all patients being clinically reviewed in conjunction with guidance released for the management of vulnerable patients. 2. Prioritisation of patients who should not wait greater than 4, 52 and 104 week (Priority 2 - P2) breaches for scheduling into capacity. 3. 2022-23 planning submission in line with national guidance for reduction of waiting lists has been completed. 4. Harm assurance piece being undertaken on all 52-week breaches to identify any risk of harm for patients who have waited a long time during the pandemic.

There is a continued policy requirement that Health and Social Care systems will build upon this work referenced in the revised guidance; Hospital Discharge and Community Support Guidance published on 31 March 2022. (This policy replaces the Delayed Transfers of Care/DTOC.) The policy requires Trusts to adopt the discharge- to-assess model where full assessment of need, especially long-term need, takes place in a more appropriate setting outside hospital delivering: 1. A red uction the length of stay for people in acute care 2. Improvements in people's outcomes following a period of rehabilitation and recovery 3. A minimised need for long-term care at the end of a person's rehabilitation Central to the approach is the stratification of patients' needs firstly into their right to reside and then onto simplified pathways (pathway 1 for home, pathway 2 for rehabilitation and pathway 3 for care homes) and the establishment of a transfer hub to oversee the initial assessment of need and co-ordination of discharge. The policy and new operating model sets an ambition that people with no criteria to reside are discharged within two hours of being determined not to have a criterion to reside. Achieving the ambitions for people, ensuring system flow and supporting our system vision to support people to live well and independently at home requires investment in the hospital discharge team function and additional community service capacity so people can be discharged to the right destination.The Warrington and Halton system strategy of developing integrated care aims to help support people to: 1. Receive the right care in the right location at the right time 2. A 'home first' focus wherever possible 3. Ensure that stays in acute settings are for the right length of time, and that people move from an acute setting, to continue their recuperation most appropriate to their needs 4. Ensures system capacity is optimised for those who need the care most. The vital role that the Hospital Discharge Team, Intermediate Care at Home Team (ICAHT) and domiciliary care plays is largely acknowledged however there are significant challenges with the current staffing model within the team. Investment proposals have been approved that will build on current good practice and deliver: 1. Change the discharge model to a 'pull' model - the team actively seeks out patients with no criteria to reside and plans their transfer 2. Diversify the skill mix within the team, creating case manager roles as single points of contact for wards and families for discharge planning and co-ordination 3. Build on the transfer hub established to optimise resources towards ensuring the right amount of care is provided in the right place and enhancing from a 5 to a 7-day service 4. Enhancement of the staffing establishment in ICAHT and domiciliary care to promote independence and optimise flow achieving a next day discharge for 80% of patients. Delayed transfers of care (DTOC) occur when a patient that is medically fit to be discharged from hospital is unable to do so. In the year extensive partnership working across the health and social care economy ensured that patients were supported to return home or on to more appropriate care settings once their acute care was complete, thus ensuring that beds remained available for incoming patients. The successful discharge of frail, older patients following emergency admission to hospital relies on effective joint working between NHS, social care partners and the independent sector. Early assessment and review using the most appropriate multi- disciplinary team at the point of entry to urgent and acute services was essential for frail older patients to ensure a timely and appropriate diagnosis is made, and then a plan for discharge can be implemented. WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2229 The table below shows the number of delayed patients in our hospital beds on the last Thursday of every month, which is the current measure all Trusts use and report to NHS England. It also shows the number of days the patients remain delayed in a hospital bed awaiting ongoing care. Cancer waiting time and Regulatory Requirements Throughout the year the Trust made good progress in reducing the numbers of patients waiting over 104 and 62 days back to pre-pandemic levels in line with Cheshire and Merseyside Cancer Alliance trajectories. Performance against all key national indicators remained challenging throughout the year, with the exception of the 31-day standard which was achieved each month. Despite an increase in cancer referrals above pre-pandemic levels over this period, in line with the national trend, performance improvements continue to be made. The Trust continues to implement all guidance in relation to the restoration and recovery of cancer services and waiting times.

Financial and quality governance arrangements incorporate benchmarking activities and an internal audit function to ensure the economic, efficient and effective use of resources, including value for money. Financial performance is reported into the non- executive led Finance and Sustainability Committee, which meets monthly. Standing items on the agenda includes the monthly financial position, CIP position and COVID-19 expenditure report to ensure regular review of any financial challenges and implementation of recovery measures. The Trust has a Use of Resources Group, which is led by the Chief Finance Officer and Deputy Chief Executive. Use of Resources supports the Trust's programme of \"Moving to Outstanding\" CQC rating. Progress is reported to the Quality Assurance Committee which is a sub-committee of the Trust Board. The Trust has a policy and governance framework in place to guide staff on the appropriate use of resources through its Standing Orders, Standing Financial Instructions and Scheme of Delegation. In addition, there is a robust system for developing and routinely reviewing policies and procedures and staff are appropriately updated and guided or trained on their application. Independent assurance is provided through the Trust's internal audit programme and the work undertaken by counter fraud. Reports are presented to the Audit Committee in each meeting. In addition, further assurance on the use of resources is obtained from external agencies, including the external auditors and the regulators. The Trust recorded an adjusted surplus of \u00a30.2m which is slightly better than the breakeven plan. This adjusted surplus is the value which NHSE/I monitors the Trust against and was achieved. The annual capital programme was \u00a319.2m (including \u00a30.15m donated assets) and the actual spend for the year was \u00a317.6m on property, plant and equipment, \u00a31.4m on intangible assets and the Trust also received \u00a30.15m donated assets, delivering an underspend of \u00a30.05m. The cash balance at the end of the year was \u00a344.7m which will be utilised to fund the annual leave accrual, new EPCMS and delayed capital creditors. (For detailed report please see the accounts section). WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2233 As a public sector organisation, the Trust ensures it provides equality of access to its patients, workforce and members of the public. It is committed to furthering equality, diversity, inclusion and human rights and works in partnership with a variety of external partners and advocacy groups. This allows for a greater understanding of the local population, health needs and barriers to accessing health care which leads to addressing potential health inequalities. The Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy's objectives for 2019-2022 describe the approach to delivering the organisation's Public Sector Equality Duty expectations: 1. Better Health Outcomes for All 2. Improved Patient Access and Experience 3. Empowered, Engaged and Well Supported Staff 4. Inclusive Leadership at all Levels The Equality Duty Assurance Report (EDAR) is published annually and provides evidence on meeting the \"Duty\". The EDAR outlines the equality governance framework which underpins equality and human rights activity across all functions, policies and services within the organisation. The Workforce Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Sub- Committee (WEDISC) and Patient Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Sub-Committee (PEDISC) are each chaired by the Chief People Officer and Chief Nurse who in turn ensure reports are made to the Board of Directors. The EDI sub-committees have internal and external stakeholder membership, with active involvement from patient representatives and members of third sector bodies. The Trust complies with the Equality Delivery System reporting which is in place for both patients and service users and workforce. Grading is completed on an annual basis and is graded in collaboration with community partners, key stakeholders and the wider public. This is published annually.As a commitment to ensuring 'due regard' has been undertaken Equality Impact Assessment tools are used to ensure the recording of decision making, policies, procedures, and strategic and operational decisions so they are inclusive and don't disadvantage individuals or groups protected under the Equality Act 2010. The Trust is confident in securing the views of patients and their families and this is evidenced by the following: 1. Trust Friends and Family Test Scores - Inpatient, Emergency Department, Maternity and Outpatients 2. National Patient Survey Results 3. Patient feedback reported through Patient Experience and Inclusion Team and local Community Partners and Healthwatch Scores and data collated from the Friends and Family Test, survey results and subsequent action plans and key themes identified through engagement with the public and community partners are reported monthly to the Patient Experience sub-committee. The Trust assesses feedback from the Friends and Family Test and National Surveys by protected characteristic to review if there are any disproportionate impact on patients' experience. Learnings from patient feedback and results are presented to the Patient Experience sub-committee and used in patient stories, enabling continued learning across the Trust. Strong emphasis on engagement is evident in equality action plans to ensure equality of access in services, facilitating 'autonomy, accountability and democratic legitimacy'.2.4 How equality of service delivery to different groups has been promoted through the organisationWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2234 The report received by Quality Health\u00ae provides a benchmark for scored questions between this Trust and the other 25 Trusts who commissioned Quality Health to complete the Adult Inpatient Survey. This benchmark is split into three segments:Of the 46 questions scored, WHH had 3 questions RAG rated as 'Red', 33 questions rated as 'Amber' and 10 questions rated as 'Green'. The table below provides a breakdown of each section and individual scored question when benchmarked against other Trusts. The individual responses are converted into scores on a scale from 0% to 100%. A score of 100% represents the best possible response and a score of 0% the worst. The higher the score for each question, the better the Trust is performing.

Quality: We will always put our patients first delivering safe and effective care and an excellent patient experience 2. People: We will be the best place to work with a diverse and engaged workforce that is fit for now and the future 3. Sustainability: We will work in partnership with other to achieve social and economic wellbeing in our communities The Trust recognises the scale of the issue that climate change presents for our community. As a healthcare provider it acknowledges its responsibility to minimise contributions to climate change and integrate sustainability into the organisation, reducing the potential risks for the local population. WHH's Green Plan outlines the commitments to embedding sustainability throughout its entire operation. The Trust opened the year with 21 strategic risks it felt could affect the achievement of its objectives. Seven of these risks were rated at a score of 25 which is the highest score on the on Trust's adopted risk grading method. A further five risks were rated 20, three rated 16, four rated 15, one rated 12 and one rated 1. The Trust closed the financial year with 18 strategic risks it felt could affect the Trust in achieving its objectives. Three of these risks scored 25, eight were rated 20, five rated 16, one rated 15 and one rated 12. The existing risks described in the Annual Governance Statement continue to be acknowledged as the principal risks to the Trust with likely new risks emerging in the coming year. This Green Plan will serve as an organisation-wide strategy that establishes strategic objectives and targets for delivering sustainable healthcare within the Trust over the next five years. The Plan will highlight some of the key successes to date and build upon these actions with targets and ambitions for the future. It will stand as the central document to guide the Trust's sustainable development over the next five years. It will be the guide to reducing the environmental impact including carbon emissions, waste and air pollution, reducing costs and building social value in the community.2.6 Risk profile 2.7 Environment WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2239 The Modern Slavery Bill was introduced into Parliament on 10th June 2014 and passed into UK law on 26th March 2015. The Modern Slavery Act is an Act to make provision about slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour and about human trafficking, including the provision for the protection of victims. A person commits an offence if 1. The person holds another person in slavery or servitude and the circumstances are such that the person knows or ought to know that the other person is held in slavery or servitude 2. The person requires another person to perform forced or compulsory labour and the circumstance are such that the person knows or ought to know that the other person is being required to perform forced or compulsory labour. The Trust is fully aware of the responsibilities it bears towards patients, employees and the local community and as such, has a strict set of ethical values that we use as guidance with regard to our commercial activities. We therefore expect that all suppliers to the Trust adhere to the same ethical principles. The Trust has a non-pay budget of \u00a377m of which over \u00a358m per annum is spent on goods and services. Over 90% of the \u00a358m is spent with the Trust's top 250 suppliers. It is important to ensure that suppliers to the Trust have in place robust systems to ensure that their own staff, and organisations within their own supply chain are fully compliant with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. In compliance with the consolidation of offences relating to trafficking and slavery within the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Trust has an ongoing process of reviewing its supply chains with a view to confirming that such behaviour is not taking place. The Trust's Procurement Team has contacted each of its top 250 suppliers to request confirmation that they are compliant with the Act. As part of this work Procurement also issued the Supplier Code of Conduct to all suppliers used across the organisation inclusive of pharmaceutical suppliers. Suppliers have been advised that as part of the Trust's commitment to ensuring that we do not trade with organisations who do not meet the requirements of the Act, they will be required to provide a copy of their annual Modern Slavery Action Statutory Statement detailing actions undertaken to ensure they meet and enforce the requirements of the Act. This will only apply to suppliers defined as a \"commercial organisation\" in accordance with the Act: Supplies goods and services Has a turnover of not less than \u00a336m. The Trust's Procurement team is committed to raising awareness with all suppliers by ensuring that all suppliers the Trust trades with are aware of our commitment to ensure compliance with the Act. As part of the Trust's ongoing procurement processes, when trading with new suppliers, and prior to establishing the supplier on Trust systems, the supplier will be requested to confirm in writing that they are compliant with the Act. All potential new suppliers will be issued with the Supplier Code prior to setting them up on our systems. The Act is referred to in all tendering activity undertaken by the Trust's Procurement Team. All tendering for goods and services is managed centrally by the procurement team. A copy of the Act will be sent to all organisations involved in the tendering process along with a short statement from the trust reminding bidders of their obligations under the Act. All suppliers will be requested to issue a statement as part of their tender response regarding their compliance with the Act. The Trust employs over 4,800 staff comprising 52 nationalities. Most of these staff are employed and paid under national pay arrangements established under Agenda for Change or Medical and Dental provisions. A small number of staff, which comprises the Trust Board and very senior managers, are employed under local pay and terms and conditions of service which are established by the Remuneration Committee of the Board. 2.8 Information about social, community, anti-bribery and human rights issuesWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2240 All staff are appointed subject to meeting the NHS Standards on Employment Checks which includes references, health Checks, DBS checks, immigration checks and identity checks. In addition the Trust has developed a number of values and behaviours which are fully embedded into the organisation. The Trust expects its existing staff to comply with these standards and all future appointments will be expected to demonstrate these attributes as part of the appointment process. This ensures that the Trust can be confident, before staff commence with the Trust, that we know some background about our staff and that they have a legal right to work for the Trust. By adopting the national pay, terms and conditions of service, the Trust has the assurance that all staff will be treated fairly and will comply with the various legislation. This includes the assurance that staff receive at least, the National Living Wage. The Trust has various employment policies and procedures in place designed to provide guidance and advice to staff and managers but to also comply with employment legislation. Every policy is impact assessed from an Equality and Diversity perspective. The Trust does have specific policies in place to deal with the Safeguarding of Children and Vulnerable Adults but does not have a specific policy on the Modern Slavery Act and does not feel the need to develop one. However, should the Trust become aware of any issue covered under the Modern Slavery Act, it would immediately report the matter to the Police.The Trust has an extensive training and development programme which is based on a minimum requirement to complete all statutory and mandatory training and other ad-hoc training which staff are required to undertake for their various roles. Training needs are identified through Individual Performance Development Reviews and a Personal Development Plan produced. The Trust employs an Equality and Diversity Specialist who will take the lead on the Modern Slavery Act and where possible the Trust does support awareness raising events both locally and nationally on such matters as the disabled, Gay and Lesbians and Honour Crime and Forced Marriages. In relation to fraud risks to the organisation, the Trust agrees an annual counter fraud plan using a nominated and nationally Accredited Local Counter Fraud Specialist (LCFS) via its Internal Audit provider Mersey Internal Audit Agency (MIAA). The MIAA counter fraud specialist provided services in line with the agreed work plan which is approved at the April 2020 Audit committee. The plan was in accordance with the requirements of the NHS Counter Fraud Authority (NHS CFA) and the new government functional standards GovS 013. This approach is supplemented by a local risk assessment that examines local fraud vulnerabilities. Regular monitoring of counter fraud activity is undertaken via the Trust's audit committee on a regular basis via progress reports and an annual report of counter fraud activity. This monitoring process includes the identification of any fraudulent activity against the Trust. During 21/22 MIAA commenced investigations into two potential fraud issues, of which both cases were closed. There were also two cases carried forward from the previous years of which both remain open. There were no events after the reporting period that require disclosure. 2.9 Any important events since year end Professor Simon Constable FRCP, Chief Executive Date:Signed:WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2241 Accountability Report3.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2242 3.1 Directors' Report Board of Directors Between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022, there were six ordinary meetings of the Board of Directors.

The Audit Committee is responsible on behalf of the Board for independently reviewing the systems of integrated governance, risk management, assurance and internal control. The Committee's activities cover the whole of the Trust's governance agenda, not just the finances, and is in support of the achievement of the Trust's objectives. During the reporting period, the Committee has been composed of at least three Non-Executive Directors with a quorum of two. During the year the Committee met five times. Non-Executive Ian Jones was Chair of the Audit Committee (since 1st December 2014) for the initial three meetings prior to the end of his term of office. Non-Executive Michael O'Connor (with effect from 1st November 2022) has become the Chair of the Audit Committee. The required relevant and recent financial experience and background necessary for the membership of the Audit Committee is met by members of the Committee. Regular attendees at the Committee Meetings were the Trust's external auditors Grant Thornton (External Auditors from January 2017), Mersey Internal Audit Agency (MIAA - Internal Audit and Counter-Fraud Services), the Chief Finance Officer & Deputy Chief Executive, the Director of Integrated Governance and Quality and the Trust Secretary.In year the significant issues that the committee considered in relation to financial statements, operations and compliance were as below, they were addressed through inclusion in the Internal Audit work plan and assurance sought for each element. 1.

It also fully appraised its key strategic risks and refreshed its Board Assurance Framework which is fully reviewed by the Board at each of its meetings and the Quality Assurance Committee on a monthly basis. In year, there was further alignment of the relevant elements of the Board Assurance Framework to the Committees of the Board. The Audit Committee monitored and tracked all material governance activity during the reporting period to ensure that the system of internal control, risk management and governance is fit for purpose and compliant with regulatory requirements, aligned to best practice where appropriate and provides a solid foundation to support a Substantial Assurance rating from the Head of Internal Audit (HOIA). System of Internal Control The Trust's Governance Structure aligns the Trust's various governance groups to the Trust Board committees. The Board Assurance Framework provides an overview of the internal control environment and evidence of the effectiveness of the controls that manage the risks to the Trust in achieving its strategic objectives as identified in the annual plan. The Audit Committee is charged by the Board in reviewing and evaluating the system of internal control through the delivery of the internal audit plan. The Chair of the Audit Committee provides an annual report of the work of the Committee to the Board as well as periodic escalation reports following each meeting. Internal Audit Activities MIAA acted as Internal Auditors for the Trust during the year. Internal Audit is an independent and objective appraisal service which has no executive responsibilities within the line management structure. It pays particular attention to any aspects of risk management, control or governance affected by material changes to the Trust's risk environment, subject to Audit Committee approval. A detailed programme of work is discussed with the Executive Team via the Chief Finance Officer and Deputy Chief Executive and set out for each year in advance and then carried out along with any additional activity that may be required during the year. In approving the internal audit work programme, the Committee uses a three-cycle planning and mapping framework to ensure all areas are reviewed at the appropriate frequency. Detailed reports, including follow-up reviews to ensure remedial actions have been completed, are presented regularly to the Committee by Internal Audit throughout the year. All such information and reports are fully recorded in the minutes and papers prepared for each Audit Committee meeting. External Audit Grant Thornton commenced its initial three-year term as Auditors to the Trust in January 2017. The company then commenced a two-year term in October 2020, following a competitive procurement exercise and recommendation by the Council of Governors. The contract contains the option to extend for one year in the third and fourth years. During the year the Auditors reported on the 2021- 22 Financial Statements. No material or significant issues were raised in respect of these Statements and Accounts. Technical support has been provided on an ongoing basis to the Committee and the Trust and representatives of Grant Thornton attended each Audit Committee. Grant Thornton have since audited these 2021-22 Financial Statements and their report and opinion is enclosed herein. Anti-Fraud Activity The Committee and the Trust are supported in carrying out Anti-Fraud activity by MIAA's Anti-Fraud Service (AFS) working to a programme agreed with the Audit Committee. The role of AFS is to assist in creating an anti-fraud culture within the Trust: deterring, preventing and detecting fraud, investigating suspicions that arise, seeking to apply appropriate sanctions and redress in respect of monies obtained through fraud. Where such cases are substantiated, the Trust will take appropriate disciplinary measures. Pro-active work has also included induction and awareness training along with ensuring Trust policies and procedures incorporate, where applicable, anti- fraud measures including the Anti-Fraud, Bribery and Corruption Policy. The Audit Committee received regular progress reports from the AFS and also received an annual report. No significant cases or issues of Anti-Fraud took place or were identified during the year.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2252 The Foundation Trust Governors and Membership following elections November 2021 The Council of Governors is made up of the following representative constituencies: 19 P ublic Governors - elected by the Trust's public membership who represent the local community. 5 Staff Governors - elected by the Trust's staff members, whom they represent 6 Partner Governors - nominated by partner organisations who work closely with the Trust Governor Elections Public and Staff Governor elections were held between 21st October - 25th November 2021, to appoint or renew governor terms in 10 constituencies. Appointments were made in seven constituencies with three remaining vacant. Understanding the views of the governors, members and the public The Board recognises the value and importance of engaging with governors in order that the governors may properly fulfil their role as a conduit between the Board and the Trust's members, the public and stakeholders.The Board and Council of Governors meet regularly and enjoy a strong and working relationship. Each is kept advised of the other's progress through the chair and includes standing items at both the Board meeting and council of governors meeting for the chair to share any views or issues raised by directors, governors and members. Any disputes or disagreements between the Board and the Council of Governors is set out in the Trust's Constitution section 9: Resolution of Disputes with Board of Directors. Members of the Board are invited to attend all Council of Governors meetings (four per year) and some Governor committees to provide input and support. Each committee of the Council is supported by relevant Executive Directors and senior managers from the Trust who report openly and collaboratively on the activities and performance of the Trust. The Governors Nominations and Remuneration Committee (GNARC) met to appoint two new non- executive directors, three associate non-executive directors and supported the extension to terms of two non-executive directors, appointment of the Senior Independent Director (SID) and supported the Chairman's appraisal. The Chairman's appraisal is a 360-evaluation comprising Governors, Non-Executive and Executive Directors and is reported formally by the Lead Governor to the Council of Governors. The role of this committee is outlined in more detail in the Remuneration Report. The Council of Governors receive copies of all Board meeting agenda and minutes in accordance with the requirements of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and the Trust's Constitution. All governors (and members of the public) are able to observe the meeting of the Board held in public in order to understand the issues raised at the Trust Board. Governors are encouraged to attend the Board meetings in order to observe the non-executive directors' performance at the meetings in challenging and scrutinising reports presented by the executive directors. Governors also attend Board Committees as observers which helps the Governors to discharge their duty in holding the non-executive directors, individually and collectively, to account for the performance of the Board. They provide a formal written report to the Council of Governors with their views about the manner in which the respective Non-executive Director chaired the meeting. The Chair provides informal briefings to governors through a monthly informal question and answer session for governors to raise matters outside of the formal council meeting. WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2253 At governors' meetings there is a standing item for public and staff governors to feedback any issues from constituency members. Issues raised at constituency meetings and through communications from members to governors is discussed at governor meeting.

As per Article 45 'Amendment to the Constitution' the Trust may make amendments to its constitution if more than half of the members of the Board of Directors of the Trust voting approve the request. In year, two amendments were made to the Trust's Constitution: 1. Following discussions at the Governor Working Parties and approval at the Council of Governors on 12th August 2021, and subsequent approval at the Trust Board on 29th September 2021, an amendment was made to the description of the role of Lead Governor and the role of a Deputy Lead Governor was also added. 2. Followi ng discussions at the Governor Working Party in October 2021, and approval at the Council of Governors and Trust Board in November 2021, it was agreed to amend the current description of Governors' roles and responsibilities to encourage engagement, attendance and cohesive working amongst Governors. The key changes were: Governors must attend at least two Governors constituency meetings in any financial year. Governors must attend at least two constituency meetings in any financial year. Governors must attend at least one observation visit in any financial year. The ad dition of the expectation for Governors to use social media responsibly to reflect Trust Values.The Foundation Trust Membership As an NHS Foundation Trust, Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals has a membership scheme that means that members of the public (aged 16 and over) and staff can become members of the Trust. Members play a key role in the hospitals, providing input into what services they want their hospitals to provide. They do this by electing Public and Staff Governors who represent the membership's views and therefore that of the local community. The Foundation Trust membership comprises public and staff members: There are two constituencies of membership of the Foundation Trust - the public constituency and the staff constituency. The public constituency comprises those members that live in one of the public constituencies. The staff constituency is divided into five classes, staff automatically become Staff Members unless they choose to opt-out of the membership: 1. Medical 2. Nursing and Midwifery 3. Support 4. Clinical Scientist or Allied Health Professional 5. Estates, Administrative and Managerial A register of interests for the Council of Governors is available on request at the address below.

This resulted in a new, wholly joint Well-Led Framework structured around eight key lines of enquiry introduced in 2017/18. 1. Is there the leadership capacity and capability to deliver high quality sustainable care? 2. Is there a clear vision and credible strategy to deliver high quality sustainable care to people and robust plans to deliver? 3. Is there a culture of high quality sustainable care? 4. Are there clear responsibilities, roles and systems of accountability to support good governance and management? 5. Are there clear and effective processes for managing risks, issues and performance? 6. Is appropriate and accurate information that is being effectively processed, challenged and acted upon? 7. Are the people who use services, public, staff and external partners are being engaged and involved to support high quality sustainable services? 8. Are there robust systems and processes for learning, continuous improvement and innovation. The CQC carried out a Well-Led Assessment between 30 April - 2 May 2019. They rated the Trust GOOD for Well-Led because: 1. Leaders had the integrity, skills and abilities to run the service. They were visible and approachable in the services for patients and staff. 2.

Leaders operated effective governance processes, throughout the service and with partner organisations 5. Leaders and teams used systems to manage performance effectively. They identified and escalated relevant risks and issues and identified actions to reduce their impact. The trust had made improvements to its risk management since the last inspection 6. The Trust collected reliable data and analysed it. The Trust had a good range of reports and dashboards for staff to understand performance, make decisions and improvements 7. Leaders and staff actively and openly engaged with patients, staff, equality groups, the public and local organisations to plan and manage services.

WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2260 Development of services involving other local services/agencies and involvement in local initiatives As part of its documented, strategic intention to play a more significant role as an Anchor Institution within the boroughs of Halton and Warrington, the Trust is leading a number of key strategic projects at 'place' level designed to enhance social value, reduce the organisation's carbon footprint and address identified health inequalities within local communities. For example, it has commenced work to refurbish vacant retail space in the local shopping centre in Halton Lea, Runcorn from which a range of outpatient services will be delivered to improve access to services as well as supporting the regeneration of one of the most deprived areas of Halton. The project has been partially funded through Liverpool City Region development funding and services are expected to be operational from this new location in the autumn of 2022. The Trust is working in close partnership with a wide group of stakeholders to develop two new Health and Wellbeing/Education Hubs in Warrington and Runcorn town centres. The Warrington Hub is due to open in the Spring of 2023 with the Runcorn Hub following in Spring 2024. Both Hub projects will be funded from national 'Levelling up' Towns' Fund initiative. Following significant levels of engagement and discussion with partners, patient representatives and patients the Hubs will create physical spaces designed to help the public get easier access to services to support early intervention and ill-health prevention. They will deliver targeted services from a range of providers to support the integration of physical and mental health with social care, wellbeing, voluntary and third-sector services and education. It is anticipated that this will lead to improvements in the management of demand for primary, secondary and social care.Consultation with large groups and organisations, including the overview and scrutiny committees of local authorities covering the membership areas In year, the Trust completed the first phase of the reconfiguration of Breast Care services across Halton, Knowsley, St Helen's and Warrington. This saw the relocation of the breast assessment and breast symptomatic services to a newly created Breast Care Centre at the Captain Sir Tom Moore building at Halton Hospital. This was made possible following extensive and positive pre-consultation engagement and formal public consultation exercises, in partnership with a number of statutory bodies and health scrutiny committees. Similarly, a formal public consultation exercise was carried out relating to the relocation of some outpatient services (ophthalmology, audiology, dietetics) from Halton Hospital to the Runcorn Shopping City. Specific themes which emerged from the engagement and consultation have been incorporated into the Equality Impact Assessment and contributed to alterations in the final design where appropriate. The Trust's commitment to becoming an Anchor organisation requires it to listen to and understand the experiences of its populations. This takes place in a diverse range of accessible, inclusive formats from informal engagement to formal public consultation and is operated through the patient and public participation and involvement programme as well as the strategy development programme.3.7 Stakeholder Relations WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2261 Descriptions of significant partnerships and alliances entered into by the NHS foundation trust to facilitate the delivery of improved healthcare The Trust has established strong and positive partnerships with many organisations and institutions at national level, regional - Cheshire and Merseyside - level and more locally at 'place' level - Halton and Warrington boroughs. Active partnerships at 'place' level include all local acute healthcare providers, local authorities, CCGs, Bridgewater Community Healthcare, Mersey Care, local colleges and universities and local third sector organisations. The Trust is committed to using the system and partnership approaches that have emerged over the past few years to support its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and future direction. The Trust has a history of being innovative and working in partnership with others to maximise opportunities to improve patient care and has committed to working together with other acute and specialist trusts across Cheshire and Merseyside to improve the quality of care delivered to patients. This is beginning to deliver benefits for Warrington and Halton patients, as well as patients in surrounding areas. For example, work is underway with the Cheshire and Merseyside Pathology Network to maximise the benefits of delivering pathology services at scale across a wider footprint. The Trust is also working in partnership with Liverpool University Hospitals NHS FT and the Clinical Research Network Northwest Coast (CRN NWC) to enhance clinical research and improve participation in research trials across Warrington and Halton. Evidence shows that patients that choose to take part in research become more engaged with their own health and care and often require fewer clinical appointments. The Halton Clinical Research Unit (HCRU) is a large, open ward space with room for beds across three bays with an additional two private rooms. The unit is staffed by a multi-disciplinary team of research practitioners including doctors, research nurses, pharmacy, microbiology and pathology, and administrators to deliver trials to the people of Warrington and Halton. The HCRU opened its doors to research participants in March 2021, launching with a COVID-19 vaccine study. The unit has since delivered two further vaccine studies with another on the way. Partnership working extends beyond healthcare organisations, enabling the Trust to truly address health inequalities in the broadest sense across a range of areas. The Trust recognises the role it can play in preventing illness and as such continues to expand and explore further opportunities to support the prevention agenda. This is evident is the work of the Cardiology Team who have developed the award-winning 'Smart Heart' Programme delivered at local primary schools which seeks to educate young people about the dangers of smoking, whilst focusing on eating well and exercising. Through these interactive sessions, children are supported to understand the important of healthy choices. The Trust is one of the first acute trusts in the country to introduce shared reading as part of a patient experience initiative. Working with The Reader organisation reading as a means of improving both the mental and physical health of patients has been introduced. Initially on the intermediate care ward at Halton Hospital and dementia and stroke wards at Warrington Hospital, weekly shared reading groups bring patients and staff together to read aloud, share thoughts, reflections and memories sparked by the literature. This approach embraces a different way to connect with patients and improve their experience of care whilst in hospital and brings patient benefits not typically leveraged in an acute setting.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2262 The New Hospitals Programme The Trust, its commissioners, local government, educators - including the University of Chester -social care, the third sector and four MPs are united in support for a new hospital for Warrington and a redevelopment of the Halton Hospital site. Similarly, patients and members are supportive of the new hospitals plans. By working together, the Trust is reimagining what a new health care estate can deliver such as the growth, diversification and prosperity of the town centre in Warrington. As well as the new job opportunities associated with construction; multi- professional education, training and employment and a focus on health and wellbeing will be realised. This collective work culminated in a proposal to the Health Infrastructure Programme for capital investment in year. A decision is expected in the Spring of 2022. Maximising infrastructure to support the improved delivery of healthcare has been a key focus for the Trust over the last year. Enabled through \u00a342k of funding secured from the national One Public Estate Programme, a piece of work has been undertaken in collaboration with partners to review the public estate across Warrington. The Trust has worked with local public sector bodies such as Warrington Borough Council and GPs, alongside partners such as the University of Chester, The Peace Centre and The Gateway to collaborate around public service delivery strategies and estate needs. The intention is to re- purpose surplus public estate for housing, regeneration, and other locally determined use, whist at the same time maximising the configuration and occupancy of estate to better serve patients by ensuring care is delivering in the right location, at the right time, to meet patient needs. Other examples of positive partnership working include: The development of the Health & Social Care Academy by Warrington & Vale Royal College as a sister project to the Health and Wellbeing Hub. The Trust is supporting the college with the development of the curriculum and the identification of new training opportunities for emerging roles across health and social care. The Integrated Discharge Team which brings together professionals from WHH discharge team and the social care teams from the local authorities to work as a single team with a single purpose. Working with local hospices within Warrington and Halton to identify areas for joint working to drive improvements in quality of end-of-life services, workforce development, recruitment and retention and financial sustainability. Development of a joint strategy and delivery plan for improved collaboration with local universities to strengthen the local healthcare education offer and create new pathways into healthcare professions. Professor Simon Constable FRCP, Chief Executive Date:Signed:WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22 63 Remuneration Report4.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2264 Statement from the Chair of the Nominations & Remuneration Committee The Board of Directors delegates the responsibility to a Board Nominations and Remuneration Committee (NARC) to make decisions regarding the nomination, appointment, remuneration and conditions of service for Executive Directors including the Chief Executive. This Committee also has general oversight of the Trust's pay policies, but only determines the reward package for directors and staff not covered by Agenda for Change. The vast majority of staff remuneration, including the first layer of management below Board level, is covered by the NHS Agenda for Change pay structure. The membership of the Committee consists of the Trust Chair and all Non-Executive Directors. The Chief Executive, Trust Secretary and Chief People Officer also attend as appropriate. During the period 2021/2022, the Committee met on three occasions.Nominations In year the Committee considered and approved the following: Process for the appointment of the Executive Medical Director The substantive appointment of joint Deputy Chief Executive roles Appointment of Executive Medical Director Remuneration In year the Committee considered and approved the following: Remuneration of substantive joint Deputy Chief Executive roles Member Attendance (Actual v Max) Steve McGuirk, Chairman Non Executive Director + Chair3/3 Ian Jones, Non-Executive Director 2/3 Margaret Bamforth, Non-Executive Director3/3 Terry Atherton, Non-Executive Director2/3 Anita Wainwright, Non-Executive Director2/3 Cliff Richards, Non-Executive Director (wef 10.06.2019)3/3 Simon Constable, Chief Executive 3/34.1 Annual Statement on remuneration WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2265 On 2nd June 2015, the Secretary of State for Health wrote formally to all Chairs of all NHS Provider Trusts, NHS Foundation Trust and Clinical Commissioning Groups in relation to the pay for very senior managers (defined as Chief Executives and Executive Directors) and the need to ensure that executive pay remains proportionate and justifiable. The Trust does not consult with employees when preparing the senior managers remuneration policy. However, the pay and conditions of all employees are taken into account when setting the remuneration policy for senior managers to ensure the executive pay structure is competitive and reflective of the level of autonomy, skills and experience required when compared to the pay and conditions of all employees. The Trust's executive pay structure is very simple and only includes basic pay and enhancements for the Chief Executive Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer roles. All pay is taxed at source and there are no bonus payments. Salaries are benchmarked against the NHS Providers national report and similar Trust in the Cheshire and Merseyside and wider Northwest region. All new appointments are sourced at the benchmark level and adjustments are made only if the market rate or existing salary indicates this is necessary. Where salaries of very senior managers exceed \u00a3150K per annum, these have been reviewed and found to be appropriate to match market rate, maintain relativities with other very senior manager posts and to match pay in the jobs from which individuals were recruited. Performance Appraisal Performance of the Executive Directors is assessed and managed through regular appraisal against predetermined objectives along with one to one reviews with the Chief Executive. Similarly, the Chairman conducts both one-to-one's and a formal appraisal with the Chief Executive. Any deficit in performance is identified during these regular meetings. Serious performance issues are managed via our organisational performance capability management policy. Performance of the Non-Executive Directors is assessed and managed through regular appraisal by the Chairman against predetermined objectives along with regular one to one reviews with each NED. Any deficit in performance is identified during these regular meetings along with opportunities for regular professional development. The Chairman is formally appraised by the Senior Independent Director taking in to account an objective 360 degree feedback process to which all members of the Board and Council of Governors contribute. That appraisal is formally signed off by the full Council of Governors annually. Appraisals led by the Chairman - for the Chief Executive and Non-Executive Directors - are also used as an opportunity to identify continuing professional development needs. No performance payment element has been paid to any of the Trust's Executive Directors during the year. Equally, there have been no payments to both Executive and Non-Executive Directors for loss of office. Provisions for Termination of Contract There are no special contractual compensation provisions for early termination of Executive Directors' contracts. Early termination by reason of redundancy is subject to the normal provisions of the Agenda for Change (AfC): NHS Terms and Conditions of Service Handbook (Section 16). For those above the minimum retirement age, early termination by reason of redundancy is in accordance with the NHS Pension Scheme. Employees above the minimum retirement age who themselves request termination by reason of early retirement are subject to the normal provisions of the NHS Pension Scheme. The principles for determining how payments for loss of office will be approached, including: how each component will be calculated and whether, and if so how, the circumstances of the loss of office and the senior manager's performance are relevant to any exercise of discretion would all be considered on a case by case basis by the Nominations and Remuneration Committee and would be approved by NHS Improvement in advance. The Trust is required to report what constitutes the senior managers' Remuneration Policy in tabular format set out on the next page. At the date of completion of this Annual Report there have been no changes to this policy and no future changes are anticipated.4.2 Senior Manager Remuneration PolicyWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2266 Annual report on Directors Remuneration - Year ended 31 March 2022 (and comparison year ended 31 March 2021) (Audited) The following table includes salary, benefits-in-kind and all pension related benefits received (whether in cash or otherwise) by each Director during the year under review. Pension related benefits included here are the annual increase (expressed in \u00a32,500 bands) in pension entitlement less any contributions paid by employees. The value of pension benefits accrued during the year is calculated as the real increase in pension multiplied by 20, less the contributions made by the individual. The real increase excludes increases due to inflation or any increase or decrease due to a transfer of pension rights. This value derived does not represent an amount that will be received by the individual. It is a calculation that is intended to provide an estimation of the benefit being a member of the pension scheme could provide. The pension benefit table provides further information on the pension benefits accruing to the individual.4.3 Annual Report on remunerationComponents of Remuneration Package of Executive and Non- Executive DirectorsBasic pay in accordance with their contract of employment (Executive) and letters of appointment (non-executive) Components of Remuneration that is relevant to the short and long term Strategic Objectives of the TrustThe Directors do not receive any remuneration tailored towards the achievement of Strategic Objectives. Explanation of how the Components of Remuneration operateBasic pay of the Executive Directors is determined by the Board Nominations and Remuneration Committee, taking into account past performance, future objectives, market conditions and comparable remuneration information from Trusts within the locality. Basic pay of the non- executive directors is determined by the Governor Nominations and Remuneration Committee. Maximum amount that could be paid in respect of the componentMaximum payable is the Director's annual salaries as determined by the relevant Nominations and Remuneration Committee. Payment for loss of officeNotice periods are included in all Directors' contracts and is currently set at six months. Payments in lieu of notice are contained within the contract of employment and are subject to tax and national insurance deductions. Payments made other than through notice periods are set out in the Organisational Change policy i.e. through redundancy/mutually agreed severance schemes. All payments to any staff member outside contractual terms are scrutinised by the Board's Nominations and Remuneration Committee. Explanation of any provisions for recoveryIf an individual is overpaid in error, there is a contracted right to recover the overpayment. Diversity & Inclusion The Trust utilises its Equality Diversity and Inclusion Strategy (ED&I) 2019-2022 and its Equality Diversity and Inclusion policy as the reference for diversity and inclusion. The ED&I strategy workforce objectives include completion of an Equality impact assessment on all relevant policies therefore this will be relevant to all pertaining to remuneration i.e. Organisation Change policy. The ED&I strategy objectives i.e. reviewing the Trusts approach to attraction recruitment and retention to ensure processes are fair and equitable and to promote diversity, will be a consideration for the Nominations and Remuneration Committee in its decision making and subsequent completion of an Equality Impact assessment on Committee papers. The Trust completes annual gender pay gap reporting that is reviewed at the operational and strategic people committees. All progress relating to objectives of the EDI Strategy and Policy are reported to the Equality and Diversity Subcommittee and Strategic People committee for assurance.

Non-Executive Directors are also reimbursed reasonable expenses relating to their work as Directors of the Trust. Expenses paid to Governors are made in accordance with the Trust's constitution and related to the work as Governors of the Trust. Governors do not receive any other payments from the Trust. All Governors have a responsibility to ensure that they incur only reasonable expenses, which includes travel costs for attendance at, for example, Council of Governors and committee meetings held at the Trust or for attendance at training courses and conferences and that the cost to the Trust is kept as low as possible. The table below states the total amount of expenses reimbursed to Directors and Governors for 2021/22 and comparative figures for 2020/21. 4.4 Remuneration report Number in Office Number claiming expenses during the yearTotal expenses Claimed Number in Office Number claiming expenses 3 500 16 7 1,300 Governors 27 1 26 25 0 0 NHS foundation trusts are required to disclose the relationship between the remuneration of the highest- paid director in their organisation and the lower quartile, median and upper quartile remuneration of the organisation's workforce. The banded remuneration of the highest-paid director in the organisation in the financial year 2021-22 was \u00a3187,500 (2020-21, \u00a3187,500*). This is a change between years of 0%. Total remuneration includes salary, non-consolidated performance-related pay, benefits-in-kind, but not severance payments. It does not include employer pension contributions and the cash equivalent transfer value of pensions. For employees of the Trust as a whole, the range of remuneration in 2021-22 was from \u00a36,000 to \u00a3278,964 (2020-21 \u00a37,816 to \u00a3275,662**). The percentage change in average employee remuneration (based on total for all employees on an annualised basis divided by full time equivalent number of employees) between years is -0.34%. 30 employees received remuneration in excess of the highest-paid director in 2021-22. The remuneration of the employee at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile is set out below.

By harnessing the talents of the workforce and creating the conditions for staff to provide excellent care, the organisation believes it will be recognised as an outstanding organisation - somewhere where people want to be cared for and somewhere where people want to work. The workforce is at the heart of everything, and in recovering from the pandemic the Trust recognises the importance of looking after the health and wellbeing of its staff. Individuals are being supported to recover and recuperate so they can continue to contribute to the delivery of outstanding patient care. People Strategy The Trust's People Strategy 2018-2021 has been of prime focus; the delivery plan of which was aligned to the NHS People Plan 2020/21, published in late July 2021, thus creating an overarching Strategic People Delivery plan 2020/21. The integrated people objectives are: 1. We will create the conditions to promote wellbeing and enable an engaged workforce to improve patient and staff experience 2. We will attract and retain a diverse workforce aligned to our culture and values, to ensure that we have the staff with the skills to deliver excellent patient care 3. We will develop a collaborative, compassionate and inclusive culture of collective leadership and organisational learning Throughout the pandemic, and as the organisation transitions into its recovery phase, the Trust has continued to deliver against its people objectives, recognising their importance in supporting the workforce. Successes to date include: -Extending the in-house mental wellbeing support provision in partnership with Rugby League Cares -The Brathay Trust and Talk It Out -Development and implementation of ' Supporting Attendance ' policy to focus on wellbeing and keeping people well at work -Implementation of Leadership Circles to provide peer support to leaders in challenging times -Providing pastoral support and coordination of international recruitment -Introduction of a video to support managers to recruit through an equality, diversity and inclusion lens -Development of line manager framework aligned to new organisational values to support managers to be able to support their teams -Implementation of Affina team development to enable a robust evidence-based intervention to continue to support our workforce. The refreshed People Strategy for 2022-2025, aligned to the NHS People Plan, NHS People Promise and the Future of HR&OD NHS Report will launch in April 2022. The integrated people objectives are: Looking After WHH People: We will prioritise the safety, health and wellbeing of our people to ensure work has a positive impact through the recognition and appreciation of our people, and by providing the best patient and staff experience Innovating the Way we Work: We will embrace new ways of working to attract and retain an engaged, responsive, diverse and flexible workforce to care for our patients Growing our WHH Workforce for the Future: We will support personal and professional development, ensuring equal access to opportunities, and will nurture, grow and develop diverse teams with a shared purpose to care for our patients Belonging in WHH: We will enable staff to have a voice, through the development of a just and learning culture which values diversity, inclusion, compassionate leadership and equity for all. We continue to strive to be the best place to work with a diverse, engaged workforce that is fit for the future. This is reflected across a range of metrics, including our health and wellbeing and equality, diversity and inclusion score results from the 2021 staff survey. The Trust's workforce performance metrics are published on a monthly basis, available on the extranet as an interactive dashboard and discussed in several forums. Employees are encouraged to review them, and leaders are expected to develop actions to improve performance, through an inclusive approach.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2274 5.1 Analysis of staff costs levy 772 772 contributions to NHS Pensions)18,429 18,429 17,453 17,453 Pension costs (other) 88 88 67 67 Pension costs (employer contribu- tions paid by NHSE on Provider's behalf (6.3%)8,117 8,117 7,674 7,674 Termination benefits 46 46 71 71 Temporary staff - external bank 21,829 21,829 23,559 \u00a3656k (\u00a3631k in 2020/21) which have been capitalised as part of the Trust's capital programme.

Supporting Attendance The Trust has a clear and robust framework within which managers are able to address the issues of attendance and sickness absence with a consistent, supportive and fair approach through the newly developed Supporting Attendance policy. There is a strong focus on workforce health and wellbeing across the organisation, as set out within our People Strategy. The pandemic created its own challenges with regards to attendance management; the Trust strictly followed guidance as set out by NHS Employers, sticking to the overarching principle that no individual should continue to suffer a detriment if the absence is COVID related. For information in respect of sickness absence, please use the following link: https://digital.nhs.uk/ data-and-information/publications/statistical/ nhs-sickness-absence-ratesStaff Turnover Improving staff turnover and retention is a fundamental part of the People Strategy and NHS People Plan. However, during the pandemic, the Trust's priority was the pandemic response and therefore engaged large numbers of individuals able to work, often those returning to the NHS or students whose studies had been put on hold. Due to the nature of these engagements, they were often short term. They had a positive impact on the Trust's patient care, however as a consequence of the short- term nature of the contracts, a detrimental impact on staff turnover and retention.

We aim to be a leading organisation, which is recognised locally, regionally and nationally, for promoting equality, diversity and inclusion. The Trust's Equality Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Strategy 2019-2022, provides our basis for creating a culture of inclusion encompassing our patients, communities and workforce. Following the NHS People Plan 2020/21 being published, the Trust integrated the People Strategy Delivery Plan and EDI Strategy Delivery Plan to create an overarching Strategic People Delivery plan 2020/21. The integrated objectives are: 1. We will build and maintain a diverse and representative workforce that is empowered, engaged and supported to demonstrate inclusive behaviours. 2. We will work to ensure that the Trust has inclusive and diverse leadership across all levels of the workforce. The Trust continues to undertake a strategic review of equality, diversity and inclusion practice within the organisation which has resulted in the implementation of Equality Impact Analysis training at senior levels within the organisation to ensure cascading of information through operational teams. This approach will enable the organisation to demonstrate the importance of thinking of equality, diversity and inclusion at the outset of any policy, programme, project and as part of the review process. The development of staff voice throughout the pandemic has continued and membership has steadily increased across the organisation. The organisation has thriving staff networks in the following areas: Armed Forces Network - Those who have served in the Armed Forces BAME - Building A Multi-Ethnic environment Disability - Physical, sensory, hidden disabilities and allies LGBTQA+ - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Questioning, Ally Our Staff Network members have had the opportunity to participate in the implementation of a reciprocal mentoring scheme where senior leaders across the organisation have the opportunity to mentor and be mentored by our Staff Network members to understand what it is like to be part of our WHH team. Staff Network members have also had the opportunity to participate in a career development programme developed in partnership with the Staff Network and implemented as a result of the findings in both the statutory Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) and Workforce Disability Equality Standard (WDES). Our organisation's commitment and approach to Equality, Diversity and Inclusion has resulted in participation in a Disability Confident Leader pilot in partnership with NHSE/I as well as an application to achieve Navajo charter mark status which focuses on the experience of our LGBT workforce. Through collating our data for the EDS2 report we have engaged across our workforce to evaluate how we are progressing within the areas addressed this year. We identified areas of good practice to celebrate and development priorities. The Trust has met all of its statutory reporting requirements throughout 2021/22 and all reports are published on the Trust website (available here: ht tps:// whh.nhs.uk/about-us/corporate-publications-and- statutory-information/equality-diversity-and-human- rights). The outputs of these publications continue to direct our engagement with our patients, our workforce and our communities, and have fed into our Strategy. Actions taken in the financial year to provide employees systematically with information on matters of concern to them as employees: We have continued to communicate with our staff through a variety of methods. We make use of a variety of media platforms such as the monthly team brief, the emailed weekly update and daily safety briefing arising from the daily safety huddle. Our communication with our staff remains of great importance and continue to utilise our monthly team brief, weekly update from our communication teams and daily safety huddle updates. The primary method of this communication is via email however our People Champions ensure that this is accessible to all staff through printing out this information and displaying it across the Trust. The safety huddle outcomes are also used as part of our clinical areas' daily face to face huddle/handover which has been cited as best practice by the Good Governance Institute. In addition, the Staff engagement and wellbeing team visit all clinical and non-clinical areas across the organisation to deliver any key messages or information on campaigns that will be of interest to the workforce. WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2279 There is also an expectation that all team members who were unable to attend the monthly team brief sessions have this information provided to them as part of their team meetings. Team Brief continues to be an open invite to all our staff. It continues to be presented by our Chief Executive on both Trust sites, based around our Quality, People and Sustainability framework and is delivered during the day and also early evening to facilitate our night and weekend staff to participate. Our social media profile continues to grow utilising this opportunity to communicate via Twitter, Facebook and Instagram ensuring a wide reach for our communications. Our Executive Directors continue to be a visible presence within the Trust engaging with staff and seeking opinion and feedback. Actions taken in the financial year to consult employees or their representatives on a regular basis so that the views of employees can be taken into account in making decisions which are likely to affect their interests: The strong culture of partnership working with Staff Side colleagues and the Trust continues with the ongoing Joint Negotiating and Consultative Committee (JNCC) meetings providing a forum for communication and collaborative working. The group meets every two months as a forum for consultation and negotiation on a range of issues that are of common interest to managers and employees. There is also a monthly Local Negotiating Committee, which feeds into JNCC, relating to medical staff. In addition to the formal partnership working structures, there are a range of informal 'touch points' each month between the HR and OD Team and staff side colleagues. Employee voice is heard through the Staff Survey and the national People Pulse survey. In addition to formal surveys, the development of Staff Networks provide another channel to promote collaborative working and ensure that the employee voice is heard and acted upon. Our Staff Engagement and Wellbeing team continue to seek engagement from all areas of our workforce in bringing ideas to life to improve our patient care and staff experience. Information on health and safety performance and occupational health: Our Workplace Health and Wellbeing Team deliver our Occupational Health service and have responsibility for supporting staff health and Wellbeing. The Department is a SEQOSH accredited nurse led unit, with a team of fully qualified occupational health nurses. The department provides employment clearance, vaccination, flu campaigns, well-being and health support, physiotherapy and counselling. For the period 2021-22, the Occupational Health and Wellbeing team also provided a bespoke COVID-19 workforce response service which included contact tracing aligned with Public Health England guidelines, providing advice, information and support for Clinically Vulnerable and Clinically Extremely Vulnerable members of staff, coordination of staff testing and responding to outbreaks with provision onsite. The team consists of nurses, physiotherapists, on site counsellors, administrators and external doctor provisions offering a robust integrated OH service, supporting Commissioning for Quality Innovation (CQUIN) targets and our People Strategy. Key highlights of the year include: COVID-19 Workforce Response The Occupational Health and Wellbeing team continued to support a seven-day service to support the workforce during the pandemic. The team have taken over 12,000 calls to deliver a personalised service based on the needs of the workforce from the coordination of testing through to the delivery of risk assessments in order to enable shielding and clinically extremely vulnerable members of staff to safely return to the workplace. Flu Campaign 1. The Trust achieved the vaccination rate of 71.4% of front-line staff 2. The CQUIN target was achieved Musculoskeletal (MSK) The physiotherapists have provided a hybrid service in line with COVID-19 restrictions during 2021-2022 with both telephone advice and face-to-face appointments available for our workforce. The team continue to offer a fast- track referral system for the workforce. WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2280 Trade Union Facilities Time The Trust's statistics relating to our Trade Union facility time for the period ending 31 March 2022 (published in July 2021) are as follows:Mental Health and Wellbeing There continues to be significant investment in mental health and wellbeing over the past 12 months, responding to the needs of the workforce and supporting them through workforce recovery as the organisation transitions through the pandemic. The mental health and wellbeing offer for the workforce was scaled up during the COVID-19 pandemic response and has resulted in a series of bespoke interventions to support individuals and teams most impacted by the pandemic through a pilot project with The Brathay Trust in the Lake District as well as ongoing wellbeing support in partnership with Rugby League Cares. The mental wellbeing hub on-site during 2021-22 has provided 3,254 1:1 and group interventions to support the workforce, delivered over 150 workshops and supported over 40 areas or departments. The team has enabled the workforce to have access to a range of interventions such as 1:1 or group counselling, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), resilience training, mediation, relaxation sessions, mindfulness and therapeutic debriefing for distressing incidents. The offers available to the workforce are fully equality impact assessed and respond to the needs of the workforce and the latest evidence. The organisation continues to invest in the provision of Mental Health First Aid including Psychological First Aid and has a network of over 50 members of staff who can support individuals and signpost to additional support where necessary. In addition, the organisation has developed dedicated extranet pages for staff to access a range of support topics such as financial wellbeing, healthy lifestyles, relationship breakdown and legal issues. Gender Pay Gap The Trust is committed to furthering equality, diversity and human rights and reducing inequalities in the workplace. Warrington and Halton Hospitals address equality and fair access to career pathways and progression in its Equality Strategy 2018-2021. Under the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties and Public Authorities) Regulations 2017 and with reference to the Cabinet Office website ( ht tps:// gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/ ), WHH are required to report annually on their gender pay gap which can be found using the following link: Statutory information :: Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Trust (whh.nhs.uk ) 5.6 Trade Union Facility Time WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2281 Paid trade union activities Percentage of time spent on facility timeTotal cost of facility time No employees who were relevant union officialsFull time equivalent employee number 25 24.4 % Paid TU activity time as a percentage of paid facility time5.2Percentage No of individuals 0% 0 1 - 50% 23 51 - 99 % 0 100 % 2Total cost of facility time \u00a340,438 Total pay bill (2019 - 20) \u00a3186,960,000 % Total pay bill spent on facility time2% 5.7 Reporting high paid off-payroll engagements Table 1: Highly-paid off-payroll worker engagements as at 31 March 2022 earning \u00a3245 per day or greater Number of existing engagements as of 31 March 2022 22 Of which...

The Board of Directors considers the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for patients, regulators and other stakeholders to assess the NHS Foundation Trust's performance, business model and strategy. Principles and standards of clinical and corporate governance are set and overseen by standing committees of the Board. The Trust has established policies and processes that reflect the principles of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance. These include: 1. Standing Orders of the Board of Directors 2.

Going Concern statement.6.1 Disclosure set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2285 Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has applied the principles of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance on a 'comply or explain' basis. The NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, most recently revised in July 2014, is based on the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 2012. It declares there is one item that the Trust departed from: 1. Provision B6.2 which states: 'BoD evaluation should be externally facilitated at least every 3 years. The evaluation needs to be carried out against the board leadership and governance framework set out by Monitor. The external facilitator should be identified in the annual report and a statement made as to whether they have any other connection to the trust' The Board last commissioned an independent evaluation against the Monitor framework in 2017, and therefore compliance with this provision, required a further review in 2020. A review was to be planned for the latter part of the year; however, after escalation of the coronavirus pandemic, this was not viable option. Towards the end of 2021/22 the Trust commissioned a further independent evaluation to take place in the first half of 2022/23.The NHS reforms and development of Integrated Care Systems place a new emphasis a on the Well Led Framework and therefore the Board will await further clarity on legislative change and the development of new local systems and governance structures, before investing in a comprehensive independent well led review based upon the Monitor Framework. As a result of the global pandemic, the Board reprioritised its 2021/22 Board development plan and brought in external expertise to advise on matters such as staff resilience, equality and inclusion, the positioning of the Trust in relation to Integrated Care Systems Development. In summary, whilst the Board has not comprehensively re-evaluated against Monitor's leadership and governance framework, it has made use of external assurances and commissioned independent advice where it has deemed this to offer most value in delivering improvement for the benefit of patients and staff in line with the Trust's Vision, values, strategy and to support it in leading its emergency response to the pandemic. WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2286 In 2021/22, NHS England & Improvement launched the NHS System Oversight Framework (replacing the NHS Oversight Framework) with an emphasis on collaboration and performance as a system. The framework is built on five national themes in additional to a local theme to be agreed by the system. The five national themes are: Quality of Care, Access & Outcomes Finance & Use of Resources Preventing Ill Health & Reducing Inequalities Leadership and capability PeopleNHS England & Improvement have allocated Trusts and ICSs to one of four 'segments\". A segmentation decision indicates the scale and general nature of support needs, from no specific support needs (segment 1) to a requirement for a recovery support programme (segment 4). Segmentation On 31st March 2022, the Trust is assigned to segment 2. Current segmentation of NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts is published on the NHS England website. 6.2 NHS England and NHS Improvement's NHS System Oversight Framework WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2287 Statement of the Chief Executive's responsibilities as the accounting officer of Warrington & Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The NHS Act 2006 states that the Chief Executive is the accounting officer of the NHS foundation trust. The relevant responsibilities of the accounting officer, including their responsibility for the propriety and regularity of public finances for which they are answerable, and for the keeping of proper accounts, are set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum issued by NHS Improvement. NHS Improvement, in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor by the NHS Act 2006, has given Accounts Directions which require Warrington & Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS foundation trust to prepare for each financial year a statement of accounts in the form and on the basis required by those Directions. The accounts are prepared on an accruals basis and must give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Warrington & Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS foundation trust and of its income and expenditure, other items of comprehensive income and cash flows for the financial year. In preparing the accounts and overseeing the use of public funds, the Accounting Officer is required to comply with the requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual and in particular to: 1. Observe the Accounts Direction issued by NHS Improvement, including the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis 2. Make judgements and estimates on a reasonable basis 3. State whether applicable accounting standards as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual (and the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual) have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures in the financial statements4. Ensure that the use of public funds complies with the relevant legislation, delegated authorities and guidance 5. Confirm that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for patients, regulators and stakeholders to assess the NHS foundation trust's performance, business model and strategy and 6. Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis and disclose any material uncertainties over going concern. The accounting officer is responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the NHS foundation trust and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above-mentioned Act. The Accounting Officer is also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the NHS foundation trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. As far as I am aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the foundation trust's auditors are unaware, and I have taken all the steps that I ought to have taken to make myself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the entity's auditors are aware of that information. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have properly discharged the responsibilities set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum.6.3 Statement of Accounting Officer's responsibilities as the accounting officer of Warrington & Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Signed: Chief Executive Date: WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2288 Scope of responsibility As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS foundation trust's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum. The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2022 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. Capacity to handle risk As Accounting Officer, supported by the Board Members, I have responsibility for the overall direction of the risk management systems and processes within the Trust. I have delegated the Executive Lead for risk management to the Chief Nurse & Deputy Chief Executive who in turn is supported by the Director of Integrated Governance & Quality who manages the risk team. The Quality Assurance Committee is the delegated committee of the Board of Directors to oversee the strategic risk register. Strategic risks are discussed at each meeting. It approves amendments to the strategic risk register / board assurance framework for ratification by the Board of Directors. The Finance and Sustainability Committee oversees financial and digital risks on behalf of the Trust and report on any additional risk/controls/assurances which will be recorded on the appropriate risk register. The Strategic People Committee oversees workforce risk on behalf of the Trust and report on any additional risk/controls/assurances which will be recorded on the appropriate risk register. The Risk Review Group reports to Trust Quality Assurance Committee and oversees the Corporate Risk Register and CBU risk registers on a rolling programme making recommendations to the Quality Assurance Committee regarding new strategic risks, review of existing strategic risks and assurance review of the Corporate Risk Register and CBU risk registers. The Audit Committee oversees the entire risk management system. It commissions an annual audit of the board assurance framework and strategic risk register, as part of the internal audit plan, to satisfy itself that the system of internal control is effective. It examines the assurances on the effectiveness of controls for all strategic risks received from the Chair of the Quality Committee, and from internal and external auditors. Risk Training Staff are trained and equipped to manage risk in a way appropriate to their authority and duties. All new staff receive information as part of the local induction programme organised by line managers. Monthly risk assessment training is in place for all staff who are required to undertake risk assessments as part of their role. All senior managers are required to complete Risk Management training. 6.4 Annual Governance StatementWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2289 Further education is provided with cyclical mandatory training undertaken by both clinical and non-clinical staff; the content for this programme is continually reviewed in light of any changes. There is a robust appraisal process which facilitates the identification of individual staff training needs. These are reviewed as part of the member of staff's annual performance and development appraisal. All relevant risk policies are available to staff via the Trust's document management system including: 1. Risk Manage ment Strategy 2. Risk Assessment Policy 3. Incident Reporting & Investigation Policy (Including Serious Incident Framework & Duty of Candour) 4. Com plaints & Concerns Policy The Trust is committed to quality improvement and recognises the benefits gained from shared learning which helps to minimise future risk and to improve the care that the Trust provides. To achieve this, the Trust uses a range of mechanisms including clinical supervision, reflective practice, individual and peer reviews, performance management, continuing professional development, clinical audit and the application of evidence-based practice. The revalidation process that a number of health professionals now undertake further supports learning and development. Lessons learned and good practice is shared throughout the Trust, for example via the Trust-wide Safety Huddle, daily Safety Briefings, Quality Assurance Committee, Patient Safety & Clinical Effectiveness Sub Committee, Complaints Quality Assurance Group and the Clinical Claims Group. Furthermore, the Trust publishes the Learning to Improve Newsletters quarterly. The Clinical Business Units (CBUs) also have a robust governance process for feedback. The Trust has invested in external training for senior key leads within the organisation. This will be facilitated by Amber Wing. The risk and control framework During the year the Trust continued to develop and enhance its governance and risk management systems and processes. It also fully appraised its key strategic risks and refreshed its Board Assurance Framework which is reviewed by the Board at each of its meetings and the Quality Assurance Committee on a monthly basis. In year, there was further alignment of the relevant elements of the Board Assurance Framework to the committees of the board. The Risk Management Strategy provides a framework for managing risk across the Trust. The Strategy describes the process for managing risks and the roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors, its Committees and that of all staff and provides a clear, structured and systematic approach to the management of risk to ensure that risk assessment is an integral part of clinical, managerial and financial processes across the Trust. Local risk registers are monitored and maintained locally within the Clinical Business Units (CBU) which enables risk management decision-making to occur as near as practicable to the risk source. For those risks that cannot be managed locally these are escalated to the Corporate Risk Register and Strategic Risk Register where required. Risks are scored by the competent person undertaking the risk assessment and validated by a manager according to the residual risk score: 1. 8 or below (low, and very low) are verified by the ward or department manager. 2. 9-12 (moderate) are verified by CBU Managers, Corporate Heads of Service, Lead Nurse, Matron 3. 15 (significant) are verified at Executive level. They are reviewed at the Risk Review Group which is chaired by the Chief Nurse & Deputy Chief Executive and attended by the Director of Integrated Governance & Quality, Chief Operating Officer, Medical Director, Trust Secretary and Head of Safety and Risk. CBU Managers, Lead Nurses and Heads of Service also attend on a rotational basis. This group will review the risk for inclusion onto the Board Assurance Framework. The recommendation will then be reviewed and ratified by the Trust Quality Assurance Committee. The Trust employs a number of systems to ensure that risk management is embedded within the organisation including business planning, performance management frameworks and clinical information systems. Regular reports are also available to the various committees responsible for aspects of risk management. There are corporate policies and procedures in place to support risk management, covering the management of incidents, risk assessment and consent and general risk management arrangements. Risk appetite levels will depend on circumstances; for example the Trust will have a low tolerance to taking risks which may impact on patient or staff safety, but a greater appetite for opportunity risks such as major service developments which present significant challenges, but will ultimately bring benefits to the organisation. Expressing risk appetite can therefore enable an organisation to take decisions based on an understanding of the risks involved. It can also be a useful method of communicating expectations for risk-taking to managers and improve oversight of risk by the Board. WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2290 In 2021/2022 the management of risk continued to have significant focus around the COVID-19 pandemic with a specific Covid risk register feeding into the existing risk management structure. Restoration and Recovery also featured heavily in the management of risk in 2021/22. Learning and improvement from incidents, complaints and claims has continued to be a focus for the Trust to help to improve internal controls impacting patient experience and patient safety. Risk KPIs are reported through the Quality Assurance Committee, its sub- committees, CBU-level reports; and shared with the lead Commissioners as part of the Quality Contract. Lessons for learning are also disseminated to staff using a variety of methods including Trust Wide Safety Huddle, which convenes on each weekday, the subsequent Safety Briefings and regular safety alerts. Learning is further supported by meetings that include the Complaint Quality Assurance Group chaired by the Chair of the Trust, the Clinical Claims Group, Policy Review Group and Mortality Review Group. Furthermore, each quarter a Learning from Experience Report and a Learning from Deaths report is compiled and submitted to the Quality Assurance Committee and the Trust Board. This includes aggregated analysis of Incidents, Complaints, Claims, Health & Safety incidents and Inquests. The report contains trend data and through qualitative and quantitative data analysis, provides assurance of lessons learned from past harms together with the changes to clinical practice that have subsequently been put in place.Risk appetites are determined by the Trust Board. A Patient Safety Summit meeting takes place weekly, within the Governance Department, to ensure there is oversight of all SI's and to ensure the triangulation of incidents, complaints and risk. The Trust encourages stakeholder and partner organisations' participation and has developed an active Patient Experience Committee. Partners and Governors are encouraged to raise issues, be involved in determining solutions and input to all aspects of risk management. The Trust has a Board Assurance Framework in place which is reviewed by the Board of Directors and includes: the identification of the key risks to the achievement of the Trust strategic objectives and the systems in place to manage/mitigate these risks; the control systems in place to manage the key risks; the identification of sources of internal and external assurances evidencing the management of risk; and evidence of compliance with equality, diversity and human rights legislation. The Board Assurance Framework is reviewed by the Board of Directors at each of their meetings and the Audit Committee, and monthly by the Quality Assurance Committee, which provides additional challenge and scrutiny of the risks identified. The NHS Digital Data Security and Protection Toolkit, an online tool that enables organisations to measure compliance against data security and information governance requirements, was introduced in June 2018. The Trust receives assurance from the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) on reporting performance. This data forms part of the CQC Insight Report which incorporates data indicators that align to key lines of enquiry, brings together information from users of the Trust's services, knowledge from inspections of the Trust and data from our partners. Furthermore, the report indicates where the greatest risk to quality of care lies, points to services where the quality may be improving and monitors change over time for each measure. Incidents, complaints, claims, Coroners' Inquests, and patient feedback are routinely analysed to identify lessons for learning and improve internal control. To enhance learning and improve governance, the Trust actively pursues external peer review of all serious incidents should this be necessary. WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2291 The table below details the top three risks identified at the end of 2021/22 and these continue to be risks to the strategic objectives pertinent to 2022/23.

The Foundation Trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission. The CQC inspected Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust from 29th March to 2nd May 2019 and the final report was received in July 2019. During the visit the CQC looked at the quality and safety of the care provided, based on whether the service is: Safe, Effective, Caring, Responsive and Well-led. Included within the remit of the inspection was the Well-Led Inspection and NHSI Use of Resources review. The Trust was rated as 'Good' overall with an 'Outstanding' rating for Caring in Critical Care. A robust and comprehensive action plan was developed, and this has recently been signed off by the 'Moving to Outstanding' Steering Group which reports on progress to the Quality Assurance Committee and the Trust Board. The Trust is currently enhancing the specific work-streams developed to drive improvement actions, whilst identifying training, development, infrastructure and capital investment needs. The Foundation Trust Code of Governance The Foundation Trust governance structure ensures that the Board has an overarching responsibility through its leadership and, to ensure and be assured that the organisation operates with openness, transparency, and candour particularly in relation to its patients, the wider community and its staff. The Board holds itself to account including with a wide range of stakeholders. The Governors play a significant role in holding the Board, and in particular the Non-Executive Directors, to account in a challenging but constructive way within a unitary board. A Governor observes each Board Committee and provides feedback to the Council of Governors. The Council of Governors meets quarterly as well as a quarterly Governor Engagement Group and regular Governor Working Party meetings. The Board has developed a culture across the organisation which supports open dialogue and includes Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors visiting Wards and Departments to personally listen to feedback from staff, patients, their carers and relatives when possible.The Board of Directors have throughout the year reviewed the relationship and responsibilities of the Board committees and sub-committees to ensure appropriate delegation of authority and that the appropriate assurance and oversight is maintained on behalf of the Trust Board. All the committees, which comprise of the Quality Assurance Committee, the Finance and Sustainability Committee, the Strategic People Committee and the time limited Clinical Recovery Oversight Committee, have Non- Executive Director (NED) membership and Chairs. The Complaints Quality Assurance Group is also chaired by the Chair of the Trust. The Audit Committee is a significant statutory committee of the Board that is chaired by a Non-Executive Director. The Board receives Chair's Committee Assurance Reports from each of the committees which provide timely and accurate information and highlight areas of escalation. This facilitates an overarching and durable framework that allows the Board to make sense of the effective use of the information and data to gain further assurance of good practice in governance and provides confidence that the organisation provides patient centred care or provides alerts to where further investigation and monitoring may be required. To further support the Board, each of the committees receive regular updates and High-Level Briefings from the operational groups which are chaired by the Executive Directors. There is an opportunity at each meeting for the relevant operational group minutes to be questioned and where needed, further details requested and clarified. The Board and its committees demonstrate leadership and the rigour of oversight of the Trust's performance by having formulated an effective strategy for the organisation, ensuring accountability by robustly challenging the control systems in place and where appropriate seeking further intelligence on the current trend analysis with the Trust's performance indicators to further understand the wider community's health needs. The Trust is able to assure itself of the validity of its Corporate Governance Statement, required under NHS foundation Trust condition 4(8)(b) through its Annual Governance Statement (this document), its Code of Governance self-assessment evidence and its Head of Internal Audit Opinion, which reported substantial assurance for the period 1st April 2021 to 31st March 2022.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2293 People & Organisational Development The Trust's People Strategy delivery plan has been mapped against the NHS People Plan, NHS People Promise and the Future of HR&OD NHS Report to produce a cohesive strategic workforce delivery plan. Workforce recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has also been integrated into the plan, based on a robust review of the evidence base available. Operational delivery of the plan continues to be overseen by the Operational People Committee, chaired by the Chief People Officer. A Workforce Recovery Steering Group has been established to oversee the development, delivery and prioritisation of workforce recovery across the Trust. Strategic People Committee, which is a Sub- Committee of the Board, chaired by a Non-Executive Director, has strategic oversight of the plan, and provides assurance to Board. Developing Workforce Safeguards support WHH to deliver high quality care through safe and efficient staffing. The National Quality Boards (NQBs) guidance in relation to safe staffing states that providers: 1. Must deploy sufficient suitably qualified, competent, skilled, and experienced staff to meet care and treatment needs safely and effectively 2. Should have a systematic approach to determining the number of staff and range of skills required to meet the needs of people using the service and keep them safe at all times 3. Must use an approach that reflects current legislation and guidance where it is available The development of the WHH Annual Workforce Plan, which contributes to the Cheshire and Merseyside overall Workforce Plan, enables the identification of skill gaps and supports a system wide approach to addressing these gaps, enabling WHH to continue to deliver high quality care through safe and efficient staffing. Scrutiny and operational oversight on systems and processes to support safer staffing, is provided from within the Trust's current governance structure. Strategic People Committee and Trust Board receive regular updates on safe staffing, staff development and key work developments such as the systematic approach to skill mixes or the introduction of new roles to support personal and professional development that will nurture, grow, and develop sufficiently competent diverse teams with a shared purpose to care for patients. In addition, formal audits are undertaken into staffing processes such as recruitment and payroll, which are reported to the Trust Audit Committee. The Safer Staffing Report is provided to Quality Assurance Committee and presented bi-monthly to Trust Board. This identified areas of acuity, safe nursing staffing numbers and any incidents associated with staffing are brought to the attention of the Committee and the Board for assurance. Board oversight of staffing processes is also achieved via the workforce elements of the Integrated Performance Report, which include key operational indicators such as absence, turnover and training compliance. Register of Interests The foundation trust has published on its website an up-to-date register of interests, including gifts and hospitality, for decision-making staff (as defined by the Trust with reference to the guidance) within the past twelve months as required by the Managing Conflicts of Interest in the NHS guidance. NHS Pension Scheme As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the Regulations. Equality, Diversity and Human Rights Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. Delivering a Net Zero Health Service The foundation trust has undertaken risk assessments and has plans in place which take account of the 'Delivering a Net Zero Health Service' report under the Greener NHS programme. The Trust ensures that its obligations under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are complied with.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2294 Review of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources The Trust has performance management processes in place that review the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources. The Chief Finance Officer & Deputy Chief Executive chairs the monthly Finance Resource Group (FRG) which reviews financial performance of all CBUs and Corporate Areas and reports into the non-executive led Finance and Sustainability Committee (FSC). Part of the remit of the FSC, which meets monthly, is to support the Trust Board in gaining assurances on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the use of resources. Standing items on the agenda include the monthly financial position report, pay report) and COVID-19 expenditure report to ensure regular review of any financial challenges and implementation of recovery measures. The Executive Team reviews and monitors the operational performance of the Trust. The Trust has a Use of Resources Group, which is led by the Chief Finance Officer & Deputy Chief Executive. Use of Resources is a workstream supporting the Trust's programme of 'Moving to Outstanding' CQC rating. Progress is reported to the Trust Board via a Use of Resources report. The Board at each meeting is provided with an Integrated Performance Report that sets out performance against an agreed framework of performance measures for Quality, People and Sustainability. The Chief Finance Officer & Deputy Chief Executive reports to the Quality Committee the Cost Improvement Plan (CIP) Quality Impact Assessments to provide assurance that CIPs have not had a detrimental impact to the quality of services. The Trust has a policy and governance framework in place to guide staff on the appropriate use of resources through its Standing Orders, Standing Financial Instructions and Scheme of Reservation and Delegation. In addition, there is a robust system for developing and routinely reviewing policies and procedures and staff are appropriately updated and guided or trained on their application. Independent assurance is provided through the Trust's internal audit programme and the work undertaken by counter fraud. Reports are presented to the Audit Committee in each meeting. In addition, further assurance on the use of resources is obtained from external agencies, including the external auditors and the regulators.Financial Governance The Trust recorded an adjusted surplus of \u00a30.2m which is slightly better than the breakeven plan. This adjusted surplus is the value which NHSE/I monitors the Trust against and was achieved. The annual capital programme was \u00a319.2m (including \u00a30.15m donated assets) and the actual spend for the year was \u00a317.6m on property, plant and equipment, \u00a31.4m on intangible assets and the Trust also received \u00a30.15m donated assets, delivering an underspend of \u00a30.05m. The cash balance at the end of the year was \u00a344.7m which will be utilised to fund the annual leave accrual, new EPCMS and delayed capital creditors. There were no failures in financial governance during the year. The Finance and Sustainability Committee reviewed and scrutinised the financial position and performance of the Trust closely throughout the year and escalated any relevant items to the Board in the Chair's exception report. Furthermore, the Board reviewed the position and challenged forecast outturns and mitigations on a regular basis. Capital has been monitored through the year via Capital Planning Group and Finance and Sustainability Committee, with particular focus on schemes over \u00a30.5m. Over the last 12 months the Trust has continued to have regular meetings with NHSE/I where the financial position, forecast and capital have been discussed, reviewed, and challenged.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2295 Information governance Organisations that have access to NHS patient information must provide assurances that best practice data security and protection mechanisms are in place. The Trust is contractually obliged to undertake assessments against the NHS Digital Data Security and Protection Toolkit on an annual basis. The Trust's most recent Data Security and Protection Toolkit assessment was produced by Mersey Internal Audit Agency in July 2021 as part of the Trust's annual audit programme. Two assurance levels were included within the DSPT Assessment report. The veracity of the Trust's assessment of its DSPT position was awarded substantial assurance. Overall assurance against all ten domains within the DSPT was calculated as moderate assurance. In the 2021/22 financial year the Trust reported nine data loss incidents via the NHS Digital Data Security and Protection Toolkit reporting tool which were escalated to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). After investigating the circumstances surrounding each of the nine reported incidents the ICO ruled that further action against the Trust was not necessary in relation to seven of the incidents. As of April 2022, a decision on the remaining two incidents is still pending. Details of incidents reported to the ICO during the 2021/22 financial year are included in the table below. NHS Digital ReferenceDate ReportedDetail Information Commissioner's Office Decision 23885 05/05/2021 A staff member posted a picture taken on a mobile phone on the Trust's premises on Facebook. The image contained a name, a partial address and the name of some generic medication relating to a service user.No further action deemed necessary by the ICO. 25171 16/08/21 A District Nurse referral letter was sent to an incorrect recipient. The letter contained clinical detail and identifiable material (name, address, DOB telephone number) relating to a Urology patient at the Trust.No further action deemed necessary by the ICO. 25233 20/08/21 Child attended urgent care setting with a minor finger injury following 111 call. Incorrect patient pulled from national spine and demographics then incorrectly edited nationally therefore editing GP details. Information then sent to GP of incorrect patient regarding attendance.No further action deemed necessary by the ICO. 26796 25/01/2022 A child attended accident and emergency in care of its father. A restraining order is in place preventing the father from having contact with the mother and/or knowing the mother's address. The father was shown the mother's address by accident and emergency department staff when asked to confirm the address as there were two on the system, the mother's address, and the father's address. This has led to the father now being aware of the mother's address.No further action deemed necessary by the ICO. 26882 01/02/2022 As part of a subject access request response a patient has been sent the notes of another data subject.Awaiting ICO response. 27081 17/02/2022 Received a telephone call from a patient's mother to say that she had also received a copy of another child's letter along with hers.No further action deemed necessary by the ICO. 27083 17/02/2022 A lady booked with the Trust's maternity department online and completed a form and provided her correct address. The Trust's ultrasound department then sent her dating scan appointment letter to the mother's former partner's house.No further action deemed necessary by the ICO. 27253 03/03/2022 Patient sent another patient's details and contacted the patient in question directly to alert her.Awaiting ICO response. 27345 10/03/2022 Inappropriate access was made by a doctor to records held in the national summary care record system.ICO concluded that the Trust was not the data controller of information in this system. No further action taken.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2296 Under the Network and Information Systems (NIS) Regulations 2018 the Trust is required to have adequate data and cyber security measures in place to protect against the increasing cyber threat. As an operator of essential services, we are required to report network and information systems incidents which have significantly affected the continuity of services. The Trust has recorded no such incidents in the 2021/22 financial year. As required by the Data Protection Act 2018 the Trust conducts Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) on projects that involve new types of data processing. A summary of DPIAs conducted will be made publicly available on the Trust's website. No high-risk data processing issues which would require escalation to the ICO were identified in the impact assessments completed during 2021/22 financial year. The Trust uses the Data Security and Protection Toolkit in conjunction with the Datix Risk Management system to inform the work of its Information Governance and Corporate Records Sub-Committee. The Information Governance and Records Sub-Committee is accountable to the Quality Assurance Committee which is a sub-committee of the Trust board. The Trust's Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) chairs the Information Governance and Records Sub-Committee which is also attended by the Trust's Caldicott Guardian. The SIRO (Chief Information Officer) acts as the Board level lead for information risk within the Trust. Any areas of weakness in relation to the management of information risk which are identified, or are highlighted by internal audit review, are targeted with action plans to ensure that we continue to strive to be information governance assured. Data Quality and Governance A Data Quality and Assurance Group is established as a sub-group of the Information Governance & Corporate Records Sub-Committee and is chaired by the Associate Director of Information. The membership of the group includes the following as core members: Information Governance; Digital Analytics; Coding; Finance; Clinical Audit; Referral to Treatment, with subject experts from operational teams co-opted as and when required. The standard agenda includes the following items: 1. SUS (Secondary User Service) Data Quality Report. 2. Systems Data Quality corrections. 3. NHS Digital Information Standards Notifications tracking. 4. Data Security and Protection Toolkit update.5. Documents for Review/Approval. 6. Data Quality Policy. 7. Finance update including NHS England Compliance report for financial data quality. 8. Coding update. 9. Contracts/Model Hospital updates. 10. Workforce update. 11. ePR/(PAS) Patient Administration System update. 12. RTT update. The Trust Data Quality policy is available via the Trust's policy HUB for ease of access. All staff including clinicians and administrative staff who collect and record data, both manually and on the Trust clinical information systems, are responsible for ensuring adherence to the relevant data standards and for ensuring good data quality. In order to achieve this, they must: 1. Ensure the timely, accurate and complete recording of data in the appropriate Trust information systems or record. 2. Ensure they have the appropriate level of knowledge and skills for using the information systems required to do their role 3. Undertake regular validation checks of data collection and input to confirm that the patient demographic data and Personally Identifiable Data for our patients is accurate and up to date. 4. Update any inaccuracies and / or missing data in server user records. 5. Address any data quality issues as soon as possible and escalate appropriately. Reporting any concerns to the appropriate Information Asset Owner (IAO) or Information Asset Administrator (IAA). 6. Have an awareness of and comply with national legislation, Trust level and local procedures. 7. Ensure that they meet the Trust's Data Quality Standards where agreed for their area. 8. Monitor their own competencies and access training where necessary both for clinical information systems and record keeping/data quality. 9. Ensure all data is process in a secure and confidential way to comply with General Data Protection Regulation standards. WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2297 Ensuring that data is accurate, valid, reliable, timely, relevant and complete will help the Trust and its partners to assess the quality of our data and take action to address potential weaknesses. Internal Trust-wide Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are created, reviewed and maintained to ensure the consistency with data collection and adherence to standards. SOPs are used by clinical and non-clinical teams and are also available on the Trust's policy HUB for ease of access. A dedicated Referral to Treatment (RTT) team supported by the operational teams validate all clinical specialties focussing on inpatients, outpatients, Diagnostics and Cancer as part of the RTT pathways with the latter two also validated by the relevant teams. The team also follow up on issues, e.g. tests not ordered or patients not added to waiting lists to ensure the patient pathway is progress in a timely manner and avoiding any further delays to treatment. As a result of the pandemic the increase in waiting lists has also increased the challenges for the RTT team and on data quality. To address this increase in workload and to provide assurance that the waiting list is transparent and clean the Trust approved a business case to improve the size and structure of the RTT Team enabling them to complete this work in a timely manner, so the operational team are listing the most appropriate patients for treatment based on clinical need. Review of effectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS Foundation Trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the board, the audit committee, the Quality Assurance Committee and the Risk Review Group; and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. Board of Directors: The Board Assurance Framework provides an overview of the internal control environment and evidence of the effectiveness of the controls that manage the risks to the Trust in achieving its strategic objectives as identified in the annual plan.Audit Committee: The Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of internal control through the delivery of the internal audit plan. Clinical Audit: Clinical Audit is an integral part of the Trust's internal control framework. An annual programme of clinical audit is developed involving all clinical business units. Clinical audit priorities are aligned to the Trust's clinical risk profile, compliance requirements under the provisions of the Health & Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2010, and national clinical audit priorities or service reviews. The Trust has adopted the Health Research Authority (HRA) procedures which moved the emphasis towards acceptance of HRA assessment within the framework of research governance, strict legislation and recognised good clinical practice and local assessment of capability and capacity to run a study. Internal Audit: MIAA acted as Internal Auditors for the Trust during the year. Internal Audit is an independent and objective appraisal service which has no executive responsibilities within the line management structure. It pays particular attention to any aspects of risk management, control or governance affected by material changes to the Trust's risk environment, subject to Audit Committee approval. A detailed programme of work is discussed with the Executive Team via the Chief Finance Officer & Deputy Chief Executive and set out for each year in advance and then carried out along with any additional activity that may be required during the year. In approving the internal audit work programme, the Committee uses a three-cycle planning and mapping framework to ensure all areas are reviewed at the appropriate frequency. Detailed reports, including follow-up reviews to ensure remedial actions have been completed, are presented regularly to the Committee by Internal Audit throughout the year. All such information and reports are fully recorded in the minutes and papers prepared for each Audit Committee meeting. The Head of Internal Audit issued an overall opinion for 2021-22 of Substantial Assurance noting that there is a good system of internal control designed to meet the organisation's objectives. The HOIA confirmed continued compliance with the definition of internal audit (as set out in the Trust's Internal Audit Charter), code of ethics and professional standards. The HOIA also confirmed organisational independence of the audit activity and that this has been free from interference in respect of scoping, delivery and reporting.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/2298 External Audit: External audit provides independent assurance on the Accounts, Annual Report, Annual Governance Statement and on the Annual Quality Report. The assurance framework itself provides me with evidence that the effectiveness of controls that manage the risks to the organisation achieving its principal objectives have been reviewed. My review is also informed by the work of internal and external audit, the external review processes for the clinical negligence scheme for Trusts along with NHS Resolution and the Care Quality Commission. The BAF itself provides me with evidence that the effectiveness of controls that manage the risks to the organisation achieving its principal objectives have been reviewed. The effectiveness of the system of internal control is maintained and reviewed by the Board of Directors via its Committees and individual management responsibilities at Director and senior manager level. Regular reports have been reviewed by the Committees of the Board and individuals in relation to all key risks. Clinical governance and processes to ensure quality of patient care are overseen by the Quality Committee under the leadership of the Medical Director. Minutes of this Committee were received by the Board of Directors together with ad hoc reports, as required, and an annual report summarises the most significant issues in this area. The Chief Nurse and Deputy Chief Executive has delegated lead responsibility for risk management across the Trust. Individual Directors and senior manager are empowered to review and manage risks within their own areas of responsibility, linking closely with wider Trust processes. Significant support has provided via training, advice, and guidance documentation to enable senior staff to effectively fulfil their functions. An analysis of controls and assurance in relation to key organisational risks has been undertaken via the assurance framework.Conclusion In preparing this statement I have considered the corporate, quality and clinical governance infrastructure, functionality and effectiveness in place at the Trust. The Board of Directors remain committed to continuous improvements and enhancement of the systems of internal control. In line with the guidance on the definition of the significant control issues I have no significant internal controls issues to declare within this year's statement. My review confirms that Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has a generally good sound system of governance and stewardship that supports the achievement of its policies, aims and objectives.

We work flexiblyThe organisation has a dedicated staff engagement function based within the HR and OD directorate tasked with ensuring that all members of the workforce feel valued, included, supported and developed irrespective of staff group or protected characteristic. There are formal and informal mechanisms in place to support and facilitate effective staff engagement across the whole organisation. Formal mechanisms include the People Champion network, our Trade Unions and also Staff Networks such as the LGBTQA+, Multi Ethnic Staff Network (MESN), Disability Awareness Network and Military Veterans Network. Informal mechanisms include monthly visibility of the staff engagement teams within clinical and non-clinical areas to disseminate information, share best practice and also highlight opportunities for staff voices to be heard and to facilitate staff participation. The organisation achieved a response rate of 40.2%, 1744 from 4,341 staff. Despite the organisational pressures due to COVID-19 the organisation continued to encourage a response from our entire workforce. The percentage is higher than 2020, which was 36%. We use the outcomes of our survey to direct future organisational change for example developing guidance and training for line managers to improve relationships between line managers and their staff. We are particularly proud that we scored better than the Acute Trust average score in seven out of the nine themes as illustrated in the below table: The survey is sent out to all eligible members of the workforce with a blended approach of paper and online questionnaires.

The Modern Slavery Act is an Act to make provision about slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labour and about human trafficking, including the provision for the protection of victims. A person commits an offence if 1. The person holds another person in slavery or servitude and the circumstances are such that the person knows or ought to know that the other person is held in slavery or servitude 2. The person requires another person to perform forced or compulsory labour and the circumstance are such that the person knows or ought to know that the other person is being required to perform forced or compulsory labour The Trust is fully aware of the responsibilities it bears towards patients, employees and the local community and as such, has a strict set of ethical values that we use as guidance with regard to our commercial activities. We therefore expect that all suppliers to the Trust adhere to the same ethical principles. The Trust has a non-pay budget of \u00a377m of which over \u00a358m per annum is spent on goods and services. Over 90% of the \u00a358m is spent with the Trust's top 250 suppliers. Our Supply Chain It is important to ensure that suppliers to the Trust have in place robust systems to ensure that their own staff, and organisations within their own supply chain are fully compliant with the requirements of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. In compliance with the consolidation of offences relating to trafficking and slavery within the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Trust has an ongoing process of reviewing its supply chains with a view to confirming that such behaviour is not taking place.The Trust's Procurement Team has contacted each of its top 250 suppliers to request confirmation that they are compliant with the Act. As part of this work Procurement also issued the Supplier Code of Conduct to all suppliers used across the organisation inclusive of pharmaceutical suppliers. Suppliers have been advised that as part of the Trust's commitment to ensuring that we do not trade with organisations who do not meet the requirements of the Act, they will be required to provide a copy of their annual Modern Slavery Action Statutory Statement detailing actions undertaken to ensure they meet and enforce the requirements of the Act. This will only apply to suppliers defined as a \"commercial organisation\" in accordance with the Act: Supplies goods and services Has a turnover of not less than \u00a336m The Trust's Procurement team is committed to raising awareness with all suppliers by ensuring that all suppliers the Trust trades with are aware of our commitment to ensure compliance with the Act. As part of the Trust's ongoing procurement processes, when trading with new suppliers, and prior to establishing the supplier on Trust systems, the supplier will be requested to confirm in writing that they are compliant with the Act. All potential new suppliers will be issued with the Supplier Code prior to setting them up on our systems. The Act is referred to in all tendering activity undertaken by the Trust's Procurement Team. All tendering for goods and services is managed centrally by the procurement team. A copy of the Act will be sent to all organisations involved in the tendering process along with a short statement from the trust reminding bidders of their obligations under the Act. All suppliers will be requested to issue a statement as part of their tender response regarding their compliance with the Act. 7.4 Modern SlaveryWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22108 The Trust employs over 4,800 staff comprising 52 nationalities. Most of these staff are employed and paid under national pay arrangements established under Agenda for Change or Medical and Dental provisions. A small number of staff, which comprises the Trust Board and very senior managers, are employed under local pay and terms and conditions of service which are established by the Remuneration Committee of the Board. All staff are appointed subject to meeting the NHS Standards on Employment checks which includes references, health Checks, DBS checks, immigration checks and Identity checks. In addition the Trust has developed a number of values and behaviours which are fully embedded into the organisation. The Trust expects its existing staff to comply with these standards and all future appointments will be expected to demonstrate these attributes as part of the appointment process. This ensures that the Trust can be confident, before staff commence with the Trust, that we know some background about our staff and that they have a legal right to work for the Trust. By adopting the national pay, terms and conditions of service, the Trust has the assurance that all staff will be treated fairly and will comply with the various legislation. This includes the assurance that staff receive at least, the National Living Wage. The Trust has various employment policies and procedures in place designed to provide guidance and advice to staff and managers but to also comply with employment legislation. Every policy is impact assessed from an Equality and Diversity perspective. The Trust does have specific policies in place to deal with the Safeguarding of Children and Vulnerable Adults but does not have a specific policy on the Modern Slavery Act and does not feel the need to develop one. However, should the Trust become aware of any issue covered under the Modern Slavery Act, it would immediately report the matter to the Police. The Trust has an extensive training and development programme which is based on a minimum requirement to complete all statutory and mandatory training and other ad-hoc training which staff are required to undertake for their various roles. Training needs are identified through Individual Performance Development Reviews and a Personal Development Plan produced. The Trust employs an Equality and Diversity Specialist who will take the lead on the Modern Slavery Act and where possible the Trust does support awareness raising events both locally and nationally on such matters as the disabled, Gay and Lesbians and Honour Crime and Forced Marriages. 7.5 The TrustWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22 109 Annual Accounts 2021/228.WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22110 Independent auditor's report to the Council of Governors of Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements Opinion on financial statements We have audited the financial statements of Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (the 'Trust') for the year ended 31 March 2022, which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Changes in Taxpayers Equity, the Statement of Cash Flows and Notes to the Accounts, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Accounts Directions issued under Schedule 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006, as interpreted and adapted by the Department of Health and Social Care Group accounting manual 2021 to 2022. In our opinion, the financial statements: Give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Trust as at 31 March 2022 and of its expenditure and income for the year then ended; Have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting standards as interpreted and adapted by the Department of Health and Social Care Group accounting manual 2021 to 2022; and Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Health Service Act 2006. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law, as required by the Code of Audit Practice (2020) (\"the Code of Audit Practice\") approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report.We are independent of the Trust in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Conclusions relating to going concern We are responsible for concluding on the appropriateness of the Accounting Officer's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify the auditor's opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Trust to cease to continue as a going concern. In our evaluation of the Accounting Officer's' conclusions, and in accordance with the expectation set out within the Department of Health and Social Care Group accounting manual 2021 to 2022 that the Trust's financial statements shall be prepared on a going concern basis, we considered the inherent risks associated with the continuation of services provided by the Trust. In doing so we had regard to the guidance provided in Practice Note 10 Audit of financial statements and regularity of public sector bodies in the United Kingdom (Revised 2020) on the application of ISA (UK) 570 Going Concern to public sector entities. We assessed the reasonableness of the basis of preparation used by the Trust and the Trust's disclosures over the going concern period. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.8.1 Auditor's ReportWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22111 In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Accounting Officer's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. The responsibilities of the Accounting Officer with respect to going concern are described in the 'Responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and Those Charged with Governance for the financial statements' section of this report. Other information The Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Other information we are required to report on by exception under the Code of Audit Practice Under the Code of Audit Practice published by the National Audit Office in April 2020 on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General (the Code of Audit Practice) we are required to consider whether the Annual Governance Statement does not comply with the disclosure requirements set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2021/22 or is misleading or inconsistent with the information of which we are aware from our audit. We are not required to consider whether the Annual Governance Statement addresses all risks and controls or that risks are satisfactorily addressed by internal controls. We have nothing to report in this regard.Opinion on other matters required by the Code of Audit Practice In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: The parts of the Remuneration Report and the Staff Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Accounts Directions issued under Schedule 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006; and Based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and our knowledge of the Trust, the other information published together with the financial statements in the annual report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements. Matters on which we are required to report by exception Under the Code of Audit Practice, we are required to report to you if: We issue a report in the public interest under Schedule 10 (3) of the National Health Service Act 2006 in the course of, or at the conclusion of the audit; or We refer a matter to the regulator under Schedule 10 (6) of the National Health Service Act 2006 because we have reason to believe that the Trust, or an officer of the Trust, is about to make, or has made, a decision which involves or would involve the incurring of unlawful expenditure, or is about to take, or has begun to take a course of action which, if followed to its conclusion, would be unlawful and likely to cause a loss or deficiency. We have nothing to report in respect of the above matters. Responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and Those Charged with Governance for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of the Chief Executive's responsibilities as the accounting officer of Warrington & Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust the Chief Executive, as Accounting Officer, is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in the form and on the basis set out in the Accounts Directions included in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting manual 2021/22, for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Accounting Officer determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22112 The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below: We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Trust and determined that the most significant which are directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those related to the reporting frameworks (international accounting standards and the National Health Service Act 2006, as interpreted and adapted by the Department of Health and Social Care Group accounting manual 2021 to 2022). We enquired of management and the Audit Committee, concerning the Trust's policies and procedures relating to: -the identification, evaluation and compliance with laws and regulations; -the detection and response to the risks of fraud; and -the establishment of internal controls to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations. We enquired of management, and the Audit Committee, whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations; and we enquired of management, internal audit and the Audit Committee, whether they had any knowledge of actual, suspected or alleged fraud. We assessed the susceptibility of the Trust's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, evaluating management's incentives and opportunities for manipulation of the financial statements. This included the evaluation of the risk of management override of controls and the risk of fraud in revenue and expenditure recognition. We determined that the principal risks were in relation to: -Large and unusual manual journals; those manual journals at the end of the financial year with a direct impact on the financial performance of the Trust; and those manual journals where no apparent segregation of duty was in place i.e those which had been raised and approved by the same officer -Potential management bias in determining accounting estimates, especially in relation to the calculation of variable income and operating expenditure accruals, depreciation, and in the valuation of the Trust's land and buildings Our audit procedures involved: -evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls that management has in place to prevent and detect fraud;statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Accounting Officer has been informed by the relevant national body of the intention to dissolve the Trust without the transfer of its services to another public sector entity. The Audit Committee is Those Charged with Governance. Those Charged with Governance are responsible for overseeing the Trust's financial reporting process. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org. uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report. Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non- compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that material misstatements in the financial statements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with the ISAs (UK).WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22113 of transactions, account balances, expected financial statement disclosures and business risks that may result in risks of material misstatement. -The Trust's control environment, including the policies and procedures implemented by the Trust to ensure compliance with the requirements of the financial reporting framework. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements - the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources Matter on which we are required to report by exception - the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources Under the Code of Audit Practice, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources for the year ended 31 March 2022. Our work on the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources is not yet complete. The outcome of our work will be reported in our commentary on the Trust's arrangements in our Auditor's Annual Report. If we identify any significant weaknesses in these arrangements, they will be reported by exception in a further auditor's report. We are satisfied that this work does not have a material effect on our opinion on the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022. Responsibilities of the Accounting Officer The Chief Executive, as Accounting Officer, is responsible for putting in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of the Trust's resources. Auditor's responsibilities for the review of the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources We are required under paragraph 1 of Schedule 10 of the National Health Service Act 2006 to be satisfied that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources. We are not required to consider, nor -journal entry testing with a particular focus on: large and unusual manual journals; manual journals at the end of the financial year with a direct impact on the financial performance of the Trust; and those manual journals where no apparent segregation of duty was in place i.e those which had been raised and approved by the same officer; -challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in its significant accounting estimates in relation to the calculation of variable income and operating expenditure accruals, depreciation, and in the valuation of the Trust's land and buildings; -assessing the extent of compliance with the relevant laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement item. These audit procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error and detecting irregularities that result from fraud is inherently more difficult than detecting those that result from error, as fraud may involve collusion, deliberate concealment, forgery or intentional misrepresentations. Also, the further removed non- compliance with laws and regulations is from events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. The team communications in respect of potential non-compliance with relevant laws and regulations, including the potential for fraud in revenue and/ or expenditure recognition, and the significant accounting estimates related to land and building valuations; depreciation; and variable income and operating expenditure accruals, Our assessment of the appropriateness of the collective competence and capabilities of the engagement team included consideration of the engagement team's: -understanding of, and practical experience with audit engagements of a similar nature and complexity through appropriate training and participation -knowledge of the health sector and economy in which the Trust operates -understanding of the legal and regulatory requirements specific to the Trust including: -the provisions of the applicable legislation -NHS England's rules and related guidance -the applicable statutory provisions. In assessing the potential risks of material misstatement, we obtained an understanding of: -The Trust's operations, including the nature of its income and expenditure and its services and of its objectives and strategies to understand the classes WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22114 We are satisfied that this work does not have a material effect on the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022.

We undertake our review in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice, having regard to the guidance issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General in December 2021. This guidance sets out the arrangements that fall within the scope of 'proper arrangements'. When reporting on these arrangements, the Code of Audit Practice requires auditors to structure their commentary on arrangements under three specified reporting criteria: Financial sustainability: how the Trust plans and manages its resources to ensure it can continue to deliver its services; Governance: how the Trust ensures that it makes informed decisions and properly manages its risks; and Improving economy, efficiency and effectiveness: how the Trust uses information about its costs and performance to improve the way it manages and delivers its services. We document our understanding of the arrangements the Trust has in place for each of these three specified reporting criteria, gathering sufficient evidence to support our risk assessment and commentary in our Auditor's Annual Report. In undertaking our work, we consider whether there is evidence to suggest that there are significant weaknesses in arrangements.

During 2020/21 existing DHSC interim revenue and capital loans as at 31 March 2020 were extinguished and replaced with the issue of Public Dividend Capital (PDC) to allow the repayment. WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22122 Note 1 Accounting policies and other information Note 1.1 Basis of preparation NHS Improvement, in exercising the statutory functions conferred on Monitor, has directed that the financial statements of the Trust shall meet the accounting requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) Group Accounting Manual (GAM), which shall be agreed with HM Treasury. Consequently, the following financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the GAM 2021/22 issued by the DHSC. The accounting policies contained in the GAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to the NHS, as determined by HM Treasury, which is advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. Where the GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judged to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Trust for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adopted are described below. These have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the accounts. Note 1.1.1 Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. Note 1.2 Going concern After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the services provided by the NHS foundation trust will continue to be provided by the public sector for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the accounts, following the definition of going concern in the public sector adopted by HM Treasury's Financial Reporting Manual. Note 1.3 Key sources of judgement and estimation uncertainty In the application of the Trust's accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from those estimates and the estimates and underlying assumptions are continually reviewed. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The following are the judgements that management have made in the process of applying the Trust's accounting policies, together with the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Provisions The Trust recognises a provision where it has a present legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; for which it is probable that there will be a future outflow of cash or other resources; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. The amount recognised in the SoFP is the best estimate of the resources required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is significant, the estimated risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using the discount rates published and mandated by HM Treasury. The pension provision relating to former employees, including directors, has been calculated using the life expectancy estimates from the Government's actuarial tables. The legal claims provision relates to employer and public liability claims and expected costs are advised by NHS Resolution. The Trust accepts financial liability for the value of each claim up to the excess defined within the policy. Allowances for credit losses (previously provision for impairment of receivables) An allowance for credit losses has been made for amounts which are uncertain to be received from NHS and non-NHS organisations as at 31 March 2022. The allowance includes 23.76% (22.79% for 2020/21) of accrued Injury Cost Recovery (ICR) income to reflect the average value of claims withdrawn as advised by the Department of Health's Compensation Recovery Unit (CRU). 8.4 Notes to the AccountsWHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22123 Asset valuations and lives The val ue and remaining useful lives of land and building assets are estimated by Cushman & Wakefield who provide professional valuation services. The valuations are carried out in accordance with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Appraisal and Valuation Manual insofar as these terms are consistent with the agreed requirements of the DHSC and HM Treasury. Valuations are carried out primarily on the basis of Depreciated Replacement Cost based on the Modern Equivalent for specialised operational property (property rarely sold on the open market) and Current Value in Existing Use for non-specialised operational property. A full asset valuation is undertaken every five years with an annual 'desk top' valuation being undertaken in the intervening years. Any increase in valuation which reverses a previous impairment has been credited to other operating income, to the extent of what has been charged there already relating to the asset. Any remaining balance has been credited to the revaluation reserve. The valuation exercise was carried out in March 2022 with a valuation date of 31 March 2022. In applying the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation Global Standards 2020 ('Red Book'), the valuer has declared that the valuation is not reported as being subject to 'material valuation uncertainty'. This is due to property markets functioning again despite COVID-19. However the opening balance for the prior year include values in 2019/20 which did included material uncertainty. The values in the report have been used to inform the measurement of property assets at valuation in these financial statements. The valuer has continued to exercise professional judgement in providing the valuation and this remains the best information available to the Trust. The lives of equipment assets are estimated on historical experience of similar equipment lives with reference to national guidance and consideration of the pace of technological change. Operational equipment is carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Where assets are of low value and / or have short useful economic lives, these are carried at depreciated historical cost as a proxy for current value. Software licences are amortised over their expected useful economic lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Note 1.4 Income Where income is derived from contracts with customers, it is accounted for under IFRS 15. The GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which enables an entity to receive cash or another financial asset that is not classified as a tax by the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Revenue in respect of goods/services provided is recognised when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring promised goods/services to the customer and is measured at the amount of the transaction price allocated to those performance obligations. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to performance obligations satisfied in that year. Where the Trust's entitlement to consideration for those goods or services is unconditional a contract receivable will be recognised. Where entitlement to consideration is conditional on a further factor other than the passage of time, a contract asset will be recognised. Where consideration received or receivable relates to a performance obligation that is to be satisfied in a future period, the income is deferred and recognised as a contract liability. Revenue from NHS contracts The accounting policies for revenue recognition and the application of IFRS 15 are consistently applied. The contracting arrangements in the NHS changed between 2019/20 and 2021/22 affecting the application of the accounting policy under IFRS 15. This difference in application is explained below. The main source of income for the Trust is contracts with commissioners for health care services. In 2021/22, the majority of the Trust's income from NHS commissioners was in the form of block contract arrangements. In addition to this block funding, the Trust received performance related additional payments via the Elective Recovery Fund (ERF) in accordance with the relevant achievement criteria. In the comparative period (2020/21) the Trust received top ups from NHSE from months 1 to 6 and then from Liverpool CCG from months 7 to 12, agreed at an Integrated Care System level. The related performance obligation is the delivery of healthcare and related services during the period, with the Trust's entitlement to consideration not varying based on the levels of activity performed (with the exception of ERF). NHS injury cost recovery scheme The Trust receives income under the NHS injury cost recovery scheme, designed to reclaim the cost of treating injured individuals to whom personal injury compensation has subsequently been paid, for instance by an insurer. The Trust recognises the income when it receives notification from the Department of Work and Pension's Compensation Recovery Unit, WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22124 found on the NHS Pensions website at www.nhsbsa. nhs.uk/pensions. Both are unfunded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in England and Wales. They are not designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the NHS body of participating in each scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. In order that the defined benefit obligations recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from those that would be determined at the reporting date by a formal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that \"the period between formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years\". An outline of these follows: a) Accounting valuation A valuation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary (currently the Government Actuary's Department) as at the end of the reporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period in conjunction with updated membership and financial data for the current reporting period, and is accepted as providing suitably robust figures for financial reporting purposes. The valuation of the scheme liability as at 31 March 2022, is based on valuation data as 31 March 2021, updated to 31 March 2022 with summary global member and accounting data. In undertaking this actuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed in IAS 19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. The latest assessment of the liabilities of the scheme is contained in the report of the scheme actuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Office. b) Full actuarial (funding) valuation The pu rpose of this valuation is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the schemes (taking into account recent demographic experience), and to recommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. The latest actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed as at 31 March 2016. The results of this valuation set the employer contribution rate payable from April 2019 to 20.6% of pensionable pay. The 2016 funding valuation also has completed the NHS2 form and confirmed there are no discrepancies with the treatment. The income is measured at the agreed tariff for the treatments provided to the injured individual, less an allowance for unsuccessful compensation claims and doubtful debts in line with IFRS 9 requirements of measuring expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. Note 1.4.1 Revenue grants and other contributions to expenditure Government grants are grants from government bodies other than income from commissioners or Trusts for the provision of services. Where a grant is used to fund revenue expenditure it is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income (SoCI) to match that expenditure. The value of the benefit received when accessing funds from the Government's Apprenticeship service is recognised as income at the point of receipt of the training service. Where these funds are paid directly to an accredited training provider, the corresponding notional expense is also recognised at the point of recognition for the benefit. Where income is received for a specific activity that is to be delivered in a future financial year that income is deferred. Income from the sale of non-current assets is recognised only when all material conditions of sale have been met and is measured as the sums due under the sale contract. The main sources of other operating income are from the DHSC, Health Education England, NHS Trusts, NHS Foundation Trusts and Local Authorities. Note 1.5 Expenditure on employee benefits Short-term employee benefits Salaries, wages and employment related payments such as social security costs and the apprenticeship levy are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees. The cost of annual leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at the end of the period is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that employees are permitted to carry-forward leave into the following period. Pension costs Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the two NHS Pension Schemes. Details of the benefits payable and rules of the Schemes can be WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22125 it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequently intangible assets are measured at current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are valued at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and the value in use where the asset is income generating. Revaluations gains and losses and impairments are treated in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. An intangible asset which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at fair value where there are no restrictions on sale at the reporting date and where they do not meet the definitions of investment properties or assets held for sale. Intangible assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or 'fair value less costs to sell'. Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Note 1.8 Property, plant and equipment Note 1.8.1 Recognition Property, plant and equipment is capitalised where: It is h eld for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes; It is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential will be provided to, the Trust; It is expected to be used for more than one financial year; The cost of the item can be measured reliably; and The item has a cost of at least \u00a35,000; or collectively, a number of items which have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 and individually have a cost of more than \u00a3250, where the assets are functionally interdependent, had broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have simultaneous disposal dates and are under single managerial control; or Items form part of the initial equipping and setting-up cost of a new building, ward or unit, irrespective of their individual or collective cost. The whole of a site is designated as the property asset with the land, the separate buildings upon it and the external works being the main components with significantly different asset lives, the components are treated as separate assets and depreciated over their own useful economic lives. tested the cost of the Scheme relative to the employer cost cap that was set following the 2012 valuation. There was initially a pause to the cost control element of the 2016 valuations, due to the uncertainty around member benefits caused by the discrimination ruling relating to the McCloud case. HMT published valuation directions dated 7 October 2021 (see Amending Directions 2021) that set out the technical detail of how the costs of remedy are included in the 2016 valuation process. Following these directions, the scheme actuary has completed the cost control element of the 2016 valuation for the NHS Pension Scheme, which concludes no changes to benefits or member contributions are required. The 2016 valuation reports can be found on the NHS Pensions website at https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs- pension-scheme-accounts-and-valuation-reports. Note 1.6 Expenditure on goods and services Expenditure on goods and services is recognised when, and to the extent that they have been received, and is measured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure is recognised in operating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non-current asset such as an intangible asset or an item of property, plant and equipment. Note 1.7 Intangible assets Note 1.7.1 Recognition Intangible assets are non-monetary assets without physical substance which are capable of sale separately from the rest of the Trust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust; where the cost of the asset can be measured reliably; and where the cost is at least \u00a35,000. Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at fair value. Software that is integral to the operating of hardware, for example an operating system, is capitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software that is not integral to the operation of hardware, for example application software, is capitalised as an intangible asset, if it meets the above conditions. Note 1.7.2 Measurement Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost, comprising all directly attributable costs needed to create, produce and prepare the asset to the point that WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22126 that additional future economic benefits or service potential deriving from the cost incurred to replace a component of such item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be determined reliably. Where a component of an asset is replaced, the cost of the replacement is capitalised if it meets the criteria for recognition above. The carrying amount of the part replaced is de-recognised. Other expenditure that does not generate additional future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance, is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income (SoCI) in the period in which it is incurred. Depreciation Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their remaining useful lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Freehold land is considered to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment which has been reclassified as 'held for sale' ceases to be depreciated upon the reclassification. Assets in the course of construction and residual interests in off-SoFP PFI contract assets are not depreciated until the asset is brought into use or reverts to the Trust, respectively. Revaluation gains and losses Revaluation gains are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease that has previously been recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating expenses. Revaluation losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is an available balance for the asset concerned, and thereafter are charged to operating expenses. Gains and losses recognised in the revaluation reserve are reported in the SoCI as an item of 'other comprehensive income / expenses'. Impairments At the end of the financial year the Trust reviews whether there is any indication that any of its assets have suffered an impairment loss. If there is an indication of an impairment loss, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine whether there has been a loss and, if so, its amount. In accordance with the GAM, impairments that are due to a loss of economic benefits or service potential in the asset are charged to operating expenses. A compensating transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amount equal to the lower of (i) the impairment charged Note 1.8.2 Measurement Valuation All property, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost, representing the cost directly attributable to acquiring or constructing the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Land and buildings used for the Trust's services or for administrative purposes are stated in the SoFP at their revalued amounts, being the current value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. HM Treasury has adopted a standard approach to depreciated replacement cost valuations based on modern equivalent assets and where it would meet the location requirements of the service being provided an alternative site valuation can be used. The Trust has used alternative site valuation from 2017/18 onwards. The Trust commissioned Cushman & Wakefield to undertake a 'desk top' valuation as at 31 March 2022. Revaluations are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that carrying amounts are not materially different from those that would be determined at the SoFP date. Current values are determined as follows: Land and non specialised buildings - market value for existing use. Specialised buildings - depreciated replacement cost. Equipment - depreciated historical cost. Properties in the course of construction for service or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees but not borrowing costs, which are recognised as expenses immediately, as allowed by IAS 23 for assets held at current value. Assets are revalued and depreciation commences when they are brought into use. IT equipment, transport equipment, furniture and fittings and plant and machinery that are held for operational use are valued at depreciated historic cost where these assets have short useful lives or low values or both, as this is not considered to be materially different from current value in existing use. An item of property, plant and equipment which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at current value under IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 or IFRS 5. Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22127 line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease incentives received are added to the lease rentals and charged to operating expenses over the life of the lease. Contingent rents are recognised in operating expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Leases of land and build ings Where a lease is for land and buildings, the land component is separated from the building component and the classification for each is assessed separately. Note 1.9.2 The Trust as lessor Finance leases Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Trust's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Trust''s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases. Operating leases Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Note 1.10 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the first-in first-out cost formula, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation to fair value due to the high turnover of stocks. In 2021/22 and 2020/21, the Trust received inventories including personal protective equipment from the Department of Health and Social Care at nil cost. In line with the GAM and applying the principles of the IFRS Conceptual Framework, the Trust has accounted for the receipt of these inventories at a deemed cost, reflecting the best available approximation of an imputed market value for the transaction based on the cost of acquisition by the Department. Note 1.11 Cash and cash equivalents Cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits with any financial institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are investments that mature in 3 months or less from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. Interest earned on bank accounts to operating expenses, and (ii) the balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that asset before the impairment. An impairment arising from a clear consumption of economic benefit or of service potential is reversed when, and to the extent that, the circumstances that gave rise to the loss are reversed. Reversals are recognised in operating expenditure to the extent that the asset is restored to the carrying amount it would have had if the impairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal is recognised in the revaluation reserve, where at the time of the original impairment, a transfer was made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount is transferred back to the revaluation reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. Other impairments, such as unforeseen obsolescence, are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of 'other impairments' are treated as revaluation gains and classed as 'other operating income'. Note 1.9 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Note 1.9.1 The Trust as lessee Finance leases Where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset are borne by the Trust, the asset is recorded as property, plant and equipment and a corresponding liability is recorded. The value at which both are recognised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The asset and liability are recognised at the commencement of the lease. Thereafter the asset is accounted for as an item of property, plant and equipment. The annual rental charge is split between the repayment of the liability and a finance cost so as to achieve a constant rate of finance over the life of the lease. The annual finance cost is charged to finance costs in the SoCI. The lease liability is de-recognised when the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Operating leases Other leases are regarded as operating leases and the rentals are charged to operating expenses on a straight WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22128 obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Note 1.14 Value added tax (VAT) Most of the activities of the Trust are outside the scope of VAT and in general, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases is not recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of fixed assets. Where output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. Note 1.15 Corporation tax Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is a Health Service Body within the meaning of s519A ICTA 1988 and accordingly is temporarily exempt from taxation in respect of income and capital gains within categories covered by this. There is a power for the Treasury to dis-apply the exemption in relation to the specified activities of a Foundation Trust (s519A (3) to (8) ICTA). Accordingly, the Trust will become within the scope of Corporation Tax in respect of activities which are not related to, or ancillary to, the provision of healthcare and where the profits exceed \u00a350,000 per annum. However, there is no tax liability in respect of the current financial year (\u00a3nil in 2020/21). Note 1.16 Third party assets Assets belonging to third parties (such as money held on behalf of patients) are not recognised in the accounts since the Trust has no beneficial interest in them. However, they are disclosed in a separate note to the accounts in accordance with requirements of HM Treasury's FReM (Note 17). Note 1.17 Public dividend capital (PDC) and PDC dividend PDC is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS Trust. HM Treasury has determined that PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. The Secretary of State can issue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the Trust. PDC is recorded at the value received. A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the Trust, is payable as public dividend capital dividend. The charge is calculated at the rate set by HM Treasury (currently 3.5%) on the average relevant net assets of the Trust during the financial year. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value is recorded as interest receivable in the periods to which it relates. Balances exclude monies held in bank accounts belonging to patients (Note 17). Note 1.12 Provisions The Trust recognises a provision where it has a present legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount, for which it is probable that there will be a future outflow of cash or other resources, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. The amount recognised in the SoFP is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is significant, the estimated risk adjusted cash flows are discounted using HM Treasury's discount rates. Early retirement provisions and injury benefit provisions have both been discounted using the HM Treasury's pension discount rate of -1.30% (-0.95% in 2020/21) in real terms. Clinical negligence costs NHS Resolution operates a risk pooling scheme under which the Trust pays an annual contribution (Note 4) to NHS Resolution which in return settles all clinical negligence claims. The contribution is charged to operating expenses. Although NHS Resolution is administratively responsible for all clinical negligence cases the legal liability remains with the Trust. The total value of clinical negligence provisions carried by NHS Resolution on behalf of the Trust is not recognised in the Trust's accounts (Note 22). Non-clinical risk pooling The Trust participates in the Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities to Third Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to the NHS Resolution and, in return, receives assistance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions and any excesses payable in respect of successful claims are charged to operating expenses as and when the liability arises. Note 1.13 Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognised, but are disclosed in note 23, unless the probability of a transfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are defined as: Possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity's control; or Present obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probable that a transfer of economic benefits will arise or for which the amount of the WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22129 with the main Trust Accounts in 2021/22 because they are immaterial. This will be reviewed each year for appropriateness. Note 1.20 Financial assets and financial liabilities Note 1.20.1 Recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities arise where the Trust is party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument, and as a result has a legal right to receive or a legal obligation to pay cash or another financial instrument. The GAM expands the definition of a contract to include legislation and regulations which give rise to arrangements that in all other respects would be a financial instrument and do not give rise to transactions classified as a tax by ONS. This includes the purchase or sale of non-financial items (such as goods or services), which are entered into in accordance with the Trust's normal purchase, sale or usage requirements and are recognised when, and to the extent which, performance occurs, i.e. on receipt or delivery of the goods or services. Note 1.20.2 Classification and measurement Financial assets or financial liabilities in respect of assets acquired or disposed of through finance leases are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy for leases described below. Financial assets and liabilities are classified and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost Financial assets and financial liabilities at amortised cost are those held with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows and where cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. This includes cash equivalents, contract and other receivables, trade and other payables, rights and obligations under lease arrangements and loans receivable and payable. After initial recognition, these financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment (for financial assets). The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. Interest revenue or expense is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or amortised cost of a financial of all liabilities, with certain additions and deductions as defined in the PDC dividend policy issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. This policy is available at:- https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance- on-financing-available-to-nhs-trusts-and-foundation- trusts In accordance with the requirements laid down by the DHSC (as the issuer of PDC), the dividend for the year is calculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the unaudited version of the annual accounts. The dividend calculated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result of the audit of the annual accounts. Note 1.18 Losses and special payments Losses and special payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to special control procedures compared with the generality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged to the relevant functional headings in operating expenses on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had the Trust not been bearing its own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal revenue expenditure). However, the note on losses and special payments is compiled directly from the losses and compensations register which reports amounts on an accruals basis with the exception of provisions for future losses. Note 1.19 Consolidation The Trust is the corporate Trustee to Warrington & Halton Teaching Hospitals NHS FT Charitable Fund. The Trust has assessed its relationship to the charitable fund and determined it to be subsidiary because the Trust is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns and other benefits for itself, patients and staff from its involvement with the charitable fund and has the ability to effect those returns and other benefits through its power over the fund. The Charitable Fund's statutory accounts are prepared to 31 March in accordance with the UK Charities Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) which is based on UK Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102. The Trust has opted not to consolidate charitable funds WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22130 can issue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the trust. PDC is recorded at the value received. Note 1.21.2 Revaluation reserve Increases in asset values arising from revaluations are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse impairments previously recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are also recognised in operating expenses. Subsequent downward movements in asset valuations are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain was recognised unless the downward movement represents a clear consumption of economic benefit or a reduction in service potential. Note 1.21.3 Income and expenditure reserve The balance of this reserve is the accumulated surpluses and deficits of the Trust. Note 1.22 Segmental reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The Trust's chief operating decision maker, responsible for providing strategic direction and decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, is the Board of Directors. Note 1.23 Early adoption of standards, amendments and interpretations No new accounting standards or revisions to existing standards have been early adopted in 2021/22. Note 1.24 Accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted IFRS 16 (Leases) IFRS 16 Leases will replace IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease and other interpretations and is applicable in the public sector for periods beginning 1 April 2022. The standard provides a single accounting model for lessees, recognising a right of use asset and obligation in the statement of financial position for most leases: some leases are exempt through application of practical expedients explained below. For those recognised in the statement of financial position the standard also requires the remeasurement of lease liabilities in specific circumstances after the commencement of the lease term. For lessors, the distinction between operating and finance leases will remain and the accounting will be largely unchanged. IFRS 16 changes the definition of a lease compared to liability and recognised in the SoCI and a financing income or expense. In the case of loans held from the DHSC, the effective interest rate is the nominal rate of interest charged on the loan. Impairment of financial assets For all financial assets measured at amortised cost including lease receivables, contract receivables and contract assets or assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the Trust recognises an allowance for expected credit losses. The Trust adopts the simplified approach to impairment for contract and other receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, measuring expected losses as at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses. In determining the classification of financial assets the Trust has considered both the business model and associated cash flows for the collection of contractual income that are solely payments of principal and interest. Financial assets are measured at amortised cost. Contract receivables will initially be measured at their transaction price, as defined by IFRS 15 adjusted for any allowance for expected credit losses using a general approach. For financial assets that have become credit impaired since initial recognition (stage 3), expected credit losses at the reporting date are measured as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. Expected losses are charged to operating expenditure within the SoCI and reduce the net carrying value of the financial asset in the SoFP. Note 1.20.3 De-recognition All financial assets are de-recognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the Trust has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expired. Note 1.21 Reserves Note 1.21.1 Public dividend capital Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS organisation. HM Treasury has determined that. PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. The Secretary of State WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22131 IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The trust will apply this definition to new leases only and will grandfather its assessments made under the old standards of whether existing contracts contain a lease. On transition to IFRS 16 on 1 April 2022, the trust will apply the standard retrospectively without restatement and with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognised in the income and expenditure reserve at that date. For existing operating leases with a remaining lease term of more than 12 months and an underlying asset value of at least \u00a35,000, a lease liability will be recognised equal to the value of remaining lease payments discounted on transition at the trust's incremental borrowing rate. The trust's incremental borrowing rate will be defined by HM Treasury. For 2022, this rate is 0.95%. The related right of use asset will be measured equal to the lease liability adjusted for any prepaid or accrued lease payments. No adjustments will be made on 1 April 2022 for existing finance leases. For leases commencing in 2022/23, the trust will not recognise a right of use asset or lease liability for short term leases (less than or equal to 12 months) or for leases of low value assets (less than \u00a35,000). Right of use assets will be subsequently measured on a basis consistent with owned assets and depreciated over the length of the lease term. \u00a3000 Estimated impact on 1 April 2022 statement of financial position Additional right of use assets recognised for existing operating leases 11,457 Additional lease obligations recognised for existing operating leases (11,457) Changes to other statement of financial position line items - Net impact on net assets on 1 April 2022 - Estimated in-year impact in 2022/23 Additional depreciation on right of use assets (2,664) Additional finance costs on lease liabilities (157) Lease rentals no longer charged to operating expenditure 2,732 Other impact on income / expenditure - Estimated impact on surplus / (deficit) in 2022/23 (89) Estimated increase in capital additions for new leases commencing in 2022/23 - The trust has estimated the impact of applying IFRS 16 in 2022/23 on the opening statement of financial position and the in-year impact on the statement of comprehensive income and capital additions as follows: WHH NHS Foundation Trust Annual Report & Accounts 2021/22132 Note 2. Operating segments The Trust has considered segmental reporting and the Chief Executive and the Board receive sufficient and appropriate high level information to enable the business to be managed effectively and to monitor and manage the strategic aims of the Trust. Sufficiently detailed information is used by middle and lower management to ensure effective management at an operational level. Neither of these are sufficiently discrete to profile operating segments, as defined by IFRS 8, that would enable a user of these financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business activities that this Trust undertakes. Therefore, the Trust has decided that it has one operating segment for healthcare.

Any increase in valuation which reverses a previous impairment has been credited to other operating income, to the extent of what has been charged there already relating to the asset. Any remaining balance has been credited to the revaluation reserve. In applying the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation Global Standards 2020 ('Red Book'), the valuer has declared that the valuation is not reported as being subject to 'material valuation uncertainty'. This is due to property markets functioning again despite COVID-19. However the opening balance for the prior year include values in 2019/20 which did included material uncertainty. The values in the report have been used to inform the measurement of property assets at valuation in these financial statements. The valuer has continued to exercise professional judgement in providing the valuation and this remains the best information available to the Trust.Note 10.

Financial instruments Note 22.1 Financial risk management Liquidity risk The Trust's net operating costs are incurred under annual service level agreements / contracts with commissioners which are financed from resources voted annually by Parliament. The Trust receives such income for the activity delivered in that year in accordance with national and locally agreed tariffs. Monthly payments are received from Commissioners based on the annual contract values, this arrangement reduces liquidity risk. The Trust actively mitigates liquidity risk by daily cash management procedures and by keeping all cash balances in an appropriately liquid form. Interest rate risk All of the Trust's financial assets and financial liabilities carry nil or fixed rates of interest and the Trust is not therefore exposed to significant interest rate risk. Credit risk The main source of income for the Trust is from Clinical Commissioning Groups in respect of healthcare services provided under contract and Service Level Agreements. The credit risk associated with such customers is negligible. The Trust has minimal exposure to credit risk as all cash balances are held within the Government Banking Services (GBS) account which generates additional cash through an applied interest rate. The Trust does not hold cash in any other investment institution on a short or long term basis. Before entering into new contracts with non NHS customers, checks are made regarding creditworthiness. The Trust also regularly reviews debtor balances and has a comprehensive system in place for pursuing past due debt. Non NHS customers represent a small proportion of income and the Trust is not exposed to significant credit risk in this regard. There are no amounts held as collateral against these balances. The movement in the allowances for credit losses for contract receivables / assets during the year is disclosed in Note 15. Of those assets which require an allowance for credit losses none are impaired financial assets (none in 2019/20). There are no financial assets that would otherwise be past due date or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated (none in 2020/21). Currency risk The Trust is principally a domestic organisation with the majority of transactions, assets and liabilities being in the UK and sterling based. The Trust has no overseas operations and therefore has low exposure to currency rate fluctuations. All financial assets and liabilities are held in sterling and are shown at book value, which is not significantly different from fair value.
