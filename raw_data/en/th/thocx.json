Once the detoxification process is complete, your treatment program can begin. During detox, comfort and compassion are crucial. Our trusted detox partners are dedicated to making sure our guests are safe and that their needs \u2014 emotional, physical, and psychological \u2014 are tended to by an expert, compassionate team of medical professionals and support staff. What Is Detox? Detox is the process of allowing the body to rid itself of alcohol or other drugs while managing the symptoms of withdrawal in a medically supervised setting. The length of detox is determined by the amount of substance being used and the period of time a person has been using that substance. It is assessed on a case to case basis. Other factors include a person's age and health. The Benefits of Detox Medically supervised detox in one of Alina Lodge's satellite detox programs is usually the first step on the road to recovery. It is followed by our residential addiction treatment at our New Jersey facility, where patients participate in a broad range of therapeutic interventions, including cutting-edge one-on-one therapy practices and group therapy. In this portion of your recovery, you will learn about the root causes of your substance use issues, and you will learn to establish healthy mental and physical routines and develop strategies for avoiding triggers once you have left our facility. Detox must take place under medical supervision. As many of our students have discovered, attempting self-detox or going \"cold turkey\" is a recipe for relapse. Furthermore, each substance has different withdrawal symptoms and leaves the body at different rates. Opiate detox looks very different from alcohol detox, which is different from methamphetamine detox. For this reason, detoxing without medical staff available can be dangerous or even deadly. This does not mean that detox is easy or fun, even in detox centers and under medical supervision. But medically supervised detox offers several benefits. Among these are: - Medical detox thoroughly removes the substances to which you are addicted to from the body. This allows you to concentrate on what matters most: the psychological and emotional aspects of your recovery. - Detox ensures that you are ready for long-term recovery. - When medically supervised, medical staff can often ensure that the intensity of your withdrawal symptoms is reduced. - Medically supervised detox gives you the focus and peace of mind you need to move forward in your recovery. - Although not a guarantee, medically supervised detox often allows you to avoid immediate relapse. The detox centers affiliated with Alina Lodge continually monitor patients medically to ensure that they are as safe and comfortable as they can be.
