Usually a scripted story is developed and spoken aloud or listened to on a recording. This procedure creates a sense of peace either for specific physical or mental stressors and or in anticipation of a stressor like surgery or anticipated stressful event. Guided imagery has been found helpful even for patients planning surgical procedures, improving recovery time and decreasing amounts of expected pain killers. I loved the bodywork component that went into the Japanese style of acupuncture that Dr. Trowbridge practices. Dr. Trowbridge is a great balance of integrative medicine, with her MD education and holistic care background and personal lifestyle. Highly recommend! Very knowledgeable and intuitive in offering acupuncture. Cozy and inviting space. After just a few visits my arthritis pain has become manageable. I am very pleased. "}
