As I now sit in front of my computer in early April and reflect on the staggering spread of COVID-19 and the re- sulting unheard of soci- etal adjustments, I am pleasantly surprised by the positive response to this pandemic. Sure, there have been cases of people fighting over toilet paper or gouging their neighbors by reselling medical supplies at ridiculous markups. But these are exceptions. I have been impressed by how the majority of people are reacting. There are numerous reports of individuals reaching out to the vulnerable in their communities by picking up their groceries, prescriptions, and other necessities. Others are trying to ease the social isolation many elderly are experiencing by sharing music and conver- sation. Groups that aren't using their personal A conversation from sometime in the future protective equipment (PPE), such as dental offices, have been sharing with those who need them. All manner of organizations in unrelated fields have asked what they could produce and are now manufacturing gowns, masks, gloves, face shields, and more. Some companies are even designing and look-ing to make ventilators if need be. I have been touched to my core by the 7:00 p.m. shout-out to health care workers and first respond- ers. The banging of pots and clapping of hands brings a tear to my eye every time. Restaurants that might be forced to close due to a drastic reduction in their business have been selflessly providing much-needed meals to health care workers at local hospitals. The outpouring of support and gratitude has been truly amazing during this difficult time. People's creativity has also been on display. Window decorations with hearts and positive messages adorn many neighborhoods. Colorful decorated rocks now line pedestrian paths and walkways. Social media is providing a constant stream of funny memes to lighten the load and share joy as we navigate this pandemic.The people of BC have been asked to physi- cally distance themselves, self-isolate, and avoid gatherings. I have been beyond impressed by the general response to these measures, despite the significant financial and social losses incurred. The general population is being respectful yet kind while doing their part to flatten the curve. My spirits have been lifted, as has my belief in the basic goodness of people. Despite fear of physical illness and financial ruin, so many are reaching out to others less fortunate than themselves. I am confident we will get through this pandemic together with perhaps a kinder and gentler world waiting on the other side. n \u2014David R.

But our focus on the tragedy would leave us mis- taken in our answer. In truth, in the US, about 7500 people die each day, so the vast majority of people who died on 9/11 did so in the more usual way. That day, approximately 100 people likely died in motor vehicle accidents and 31 in firearm incidents. In Canada, approximately 600 people were likely diagnosed with cancer and 22 died by suicide. It's easy to lose track when everything is focused on one huge event. COVID-19 is a new disease, a novel virus, a puzzle with unpredictable and cruelly shaped pieces that we are trying to assemble in the dark. Living through the effects of physical-distanc- ing guidelines, watching the news, and seeing the economic consequences, we may forget that most of the usual medical statistics are still tick - ing along. Front-line health care workers are not all looking after COVID patients; the majority in many centres are looking after the ordinary illnesses, injuries, and complications. Kids will get leukemia, women will get breast cancer, elderly people will break their hips. Caring for these issues is always challenging, but doing so during a serious pandemic is many degrees more Is there a new, better normal? Can we take this time to think about ways to encourage a new, perhaps better, normal? Could safe shopping be the standard? Do we need to have 10 000 whateverologists fly to attend a national meeting, or can we have adequate knowledge transfer and social interaction in a different, safer way? How much business has to be conducted in person, versus over a 30-minute Zoom meeting? Do we need to have thousands of people crowd together for football, basketball, and soccer games? Maybe there is a way to maintain the enjoyment and fellow- ship while reducing public risk. Can we appreciate the performing arts in a safer way without sacrificing the power of artistic immediacy? Will necessity give birth to ideas that would previously have been over- powered by the status quo? Can our patients, and communication of their issues, be treated more effectively in the ways we are using now? Life may not go back to the way it was. It shouldn't. But as we have done already with airline security, electronic ID tags, recycling and composting, smart phones, and electric vehicles, we change when things need to change, and we can handle it. COVID news is updated, and some days\u2014 sometimes hourly\u2014contradicts its previous it- erations. By the time this editorial is published, we may have a new set of rules in place. There are likely to be active protocols affecting life for many months. But we will at some point have to reprioritize the more ordinary things that will need to be done in our practices. We likely will have to do this during a time of se- rious economic consequences and a scarred, overrun system. I hope open minds, kindness, team playing, and long-term vision will lead our way. n \u2014Cynthia Verchere, MDdifficult. Most patients are not allowed to have family members with them in hospital\u2014when they are vulnerable or unable to advocate for their own needs. Most face-to-face and hand- to-hand interaction is limited or distracted by the protections needed. Appointments are limited and less timely. Rounds, education, meetings, communication, students, and residents all have a weakened or dis- tracted presence, and some may bear the scars long term. Learners graduat- ing during this time may not have the same experi- ence or rigor of evaluation in their fields. Studies are being fast-tracked into the public domain and being interpreted and dispersed prior to full peer review. Funding for research is devastated by economic predictions. International fellow- ships may be practically impossible for the time being. Technology is being used more than ever as we slowly distill what is important and what is possible, and accept that not all things fit well. This pandemic will have implications for medi- cine, practitioners, education, and non-COVID patient outcomes quite possibly for years. We will eventually become a physically closer community again. Elective surgeries will again be slated, people will see their more usual lives, illnesses, and injuries somewhat prioritized again. But even with the possibility of an ef- fective vaccine or scientifically supported treat- ment for COVID-19, it is more likely than not that there will be another SARS, or MERS, or Spanish flu on the horizon. Hopefully things will have changed so we can respond effectively with less drastic reactions, or maybe even have reduced risks for our population. We in health care, who hold many of the stakes directly and on behalf of our patients, may have to be the ones to spearhead changes during our return, even if economic benefactors of the status quo push in other directions.Will necessity give birth to ideas that would previously have been overpowered by the status quo?

Together, we worked with our partners to ensure we were as ready as we could be to treat the most ill patients as they needed hospitalization and ventilation. The speed with which we mobilized and col- laborated across all sectors was unprecedented. Our professional organization led the charge to ensure the most up-to-date information was accessible in the most convenient ways. Grass- roots divisions of family practice and medical staff associations banded together to facilitate optimal patient care and physician protection. Truly inspiring work has been done by an un-told number of people to pull this all together. Now we wait. Physical distancing and the provincial health officer's plea to \"just stay home\" have certainly made a difference to case numbers to date. At this point, it is still too early to know for sure if our curve is flattening. Added to this, we have patients who need health care outside of COVID-19, and we are successfully rising to this challenge. A truly critical piece of that success has been the widespread adoption of virtual medicine across medical practices in both primary and consultant care. We have never seen such a rap- id and violent shake-up in the way we deliver health care in Canada. Admittedly, the advent of electronic medical records allowing instant search and visualization of data in a patient's chart was definitely a revolution in care, just not as rapid or as widespread as what we are living through right now. The majority of our medical training is grounded in honing clinical skills while we see patients in person. Our key triad includes listen- ing to our patients' concerns, watching them for important clues as they relate their history, and of course the incredible hands-on skills required to ascertain the main differential diagnoses. We are comfortable with our skills and can rely on our clinical judg- ment based on our visual, auditory, and tactile senses after years of practice and hands-on experiences. We can remember what an in- carcerated hernia feels like and what the subtle signs of heart failure sound like. Often what we smell will point us toward the diag- nosis, such as an infec- tion or C. difficile colitis. We know when a sick person in our presence is mildly or severely ill, often even before we examine them. Now enter the world of virtual health. In many ways, it is as if we have lost one or two of our senses. We can obtain the same history and ask the same important questions that often lead us to the differential diagnoses without an in-person exam. That said, hands-on, in-person, face-to-face clinical care is our gold standard. Times have changed in our virtual-care world. I stare at my patients on tiny screens. My patients stream themselves using cameras and Internet connections of varying quality as they discuss their issues. I feel blunted and perhaps harbor the nagging feeling that my as - sessment is incomplete. Patients seem to enjoy speaking to their doctors from the comfort of their homes, often with family around them. It feels less intrusive and several have commented that this type of health care is more \"fun\" than coming to the office. It is obvious that our health care system, along with many other aspects of our so- ciety, will be forever changed. We will refer to medical practice as \"pre-COVID-19\" and \"post-COVID-19\" in the years to come. There is no holding back the wave. Health care will need to continue to adapt. We will learn to work with more than one sense impaired and we will learn to know when we need that miss- ing sense to complete an exam. We know there is something uniquely spe- cial and healing in the face-to-face encounters with our patients that is not present over Skype. Yet, for now, this is very necessary to slow the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 and keep our patients and ourselves safe. I have every confidence that our profession will continue to meet the virtual care model with the same cohesion with which we have met the rest of this pandemic. We know with certainty that we can do this. We are not afraid of change. We were in fact, born to do this. \u2014Kathleen Ross, MD Doctors of BC PresidentI have every confidence that our profession will continue to meet the virtual care model with the same cohesion with which we have met the rest of this pandemic. 161 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 5 | june 2020161COvID-19 pharmacologic therapy guidance for BC To date (22 April 2020), there are no Health Canada-approved COVID-19 pharmacolog-ic treatments, yet there is intense interest and media coverage of potential pharmacological agents.1,2 In BC, we have had the benefit of a diverse group of experts (the BC COVID-19 Therapeutics Committee [CTC]) scanning and summarizing the emerging literature, as Letters to the editor We welcome original letters of less than 300 words; we may edit them for clarity and length.

This summary of evidence and rec-ommendations can be found on the BCCDC website. 3 The committee convened on 13 March 2020 and initially consisted of front-line clinicians at Vancouver General and St. Paul's Hospitals. As the need for a provincial-level group was acknowledged, the group quickly expanded to 37 members, with representation from all health authorities, the Ministry of Health Pharma- ceutical Services Division (MOH PSD), and university researchers. Clinical health profes- sion members include specialists from critical care, infectious diseases, medical microbiology, general internal medicine, emergency medicine, hematology, rheumatology, anesthesia, family practice, pharmacy, transplant medicine, and antimicrobial stewardship. The CTC developed its own terms of refer- ence that outline how material will be reviewed and how changes will be made to provincial recommendations as evidence evolves. Virtual meetings occur weekly to review new material and decide on changes to recommendations. There is also an active group on the videocon- ferencing platform Slack, where sharing and discussions can take place in preparation for the weekly conference. Each drug class/therapeutic intervention is assigned to a small subgroup of CTC members who ensure that the latest material is summarized weekly.

Independent of nicotine, expo- sure to particulates and flavorings in e-cigarette aerosols could also potentially impair lung func- tion.1 Meanwhile, the Forum of International Respiratory Societies, a collaborative of nine in- ternational professional organizations that was created to promote respiratory health world- wide, published a position statement in 2018 warning that exposure to e-cigarette aerosol in adolescence and early adulthood can result in pulmonary toxicity.2 With the growing evidence of potential risk factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the immediate health effects of e-cigarette vap- ing have become apparent and are alarming. Also, the new evidence suggests COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not only increase the risk of developing complications from the coronavirus but will increase chances of spreading it to others. Some American states are even issuing specific health advisories on vaping and COVID-19.3 The evolving knowl- edge is especially worrisome, and in light of this evidence, serious efforts should be made to increase public awareness of the harmful effect of e-cigarette use. Physicians should step up and redouble their cessation and counseling efforts. Smoking and vaping also seem to be asso- ciated with poor survival; therefore, we need to bring sensible policies to protect our young people from devastating effects of COVID-19. The American Academy of Family Physicians recently developed clinical guidance to high - light the well-known risk. People who smoke or use e-cigarettes have a significantly higher risk of contracting respiratory infections like the coronavirus, and people with decreased lung function caused by smoking or vaping are more likely to develop serious complications caused by infections. According to Dr Barbara Keber, president of the New York State Academy of Family Physicians, \"Now more than ever, it is critical for the State and medical community to take actions to prevent our youth from ever using these highly addictive, deadly products, and to help our patients to reduce their risks through FDA-approved cessation and tele - health during this pandemic.\"4 The Canadian Paediatric Society has de- veloped a COVID-19 resource for the health care community. The society encourages pe- diatricians and other health professionals who work with adolescents, youth, and families to communicate the message that smoking and vaping may increase the risk of acquiring the COVID-19 infection.5 According to scientific evidence, COVID-19 could be a serious threat to those who smoke e-cigarettes, combustible tobacco, or mari- juana. Moreover, smoking or vaping increases people's vulnerability to severe illness once in-fected, and anything that makes the lungs less healthy will weaken our survival chances against COVID-19. We strongly believe that the recent evi- dence needs to be appropriately reflected in COVID-19 prevention and control efforts. Fur- ther, this information should be widely circu- lated as an emerging clinical guideline in order to assist front-line physicians' informed clinical decision making efforts to treat COVID-19. \u2014Aki Nilanga Bandara, BSc Founding Chair, Global coalition to empower adolescent and youth on harmful therapeutic in-terventions to prevent combustible tobacco use Instructor, UBC Faculty of Land and Food BSc, and Ricky Jhauj, BKin Coordinators, Global coalition to empower adolescent and youth on harmful therapeutic in-terventions to prevent combustible tobacco use \u2014Vahid Mehrnoush, MD Senior Advisor, Global coalition to empower adolescent and youth on harmful therapeutic in-terventions to prevent combustible tobacco use Section of Trauma, Acute Care, and Global Sur-gery, Vancouver General Hospital, UBC references 1.

Corporatization of family medicine in BC Over the past decade there has been a remark- able change in the ownership of family medicine practices in BC. Large numbers are now owned and operated by private corporations, which are neither owned nor controlled by the physicians who work in them. This has occurred largely because family physicians are neither business people nor endowed with the upfront financial resources to invest in the start-up of increasingly large and complex office structures. These corporate structures often operate ef- ficiently and all are well equipped with modern electronic medical record systems. They give more freedom to the individual physicians who have no financial obligations to the practice. They have definitely filled a void in medical care in BC, but the question arises whether they will have a net benefit to the people of the province. After all, it is the people of BC who pay for them through taxation and fees paid to these corporations through physicians' billings. So, one must first ask: Why would private corporate entities want to invest in primary care delivery? All private companies exist to make money for the owners of those companies. In health care this is no different. The answer is that private companies have seen the void in the organization of primary care in BC and identified it as a business op- portunity. The owners of these companies all want financial compensation for their invest- ment. If this compensation can be attained by driving efficiencies in primary care and saving money globally, then the corporations can be viewed as a net benefit for the people of BC and also for the physicians who work for them. If, however, these private companies exces- sively control the behavior of the physicians who work in them, and demand excessive profits for their efforts, then they will be viewed through a different lens. It must also be understood that these private companies control the electronic health records of the patients registered with them. While it can be argued that the medi - cal records belong to both the patient and the physician, there have been instances in BC where conflicts have arisen between private clinic owners and physicians working in those clinics. These conflicts have resulted in physi- cians being physically locked out of the pri- vate premises and being denied access to their patients' medical records. This is a dangerous situation for the people of BC. As well, private corporate structures can terminate the contracts of physicians who work on their premises. If this happens, these physi- cians are at the mercy of the corporations when it comes to supplying them with their patients' electronic medical records. And not having im - mediate access to patients' electronic medical records makes practising medicine very difficult, if not impossible. I think it is both prudent and necessary for the Ministry of Health and Doctors of BC to review the status of primary care in BC as it re- lates to private ownership of medical clinics. The corporatization of primary care in BC reminds me of the corporatization of all medicine in the US. I practised in the US for nearly a decade, and I have intimate knowledge of the abuse of corporate medicine. Currently in the US, over 65% of all family physicians work in privately OUT NOW! \"The Doctor is In: Recommendations for expanding in-person care in community-based physician practices\" A one-stop source of information to support physicians in the gradual re-opening of oces and clinics.

These corporate structures use something called \"economic cre- dentialing\" when they review the usefulness of the physicians who are contracted to work in the clinics. If physicians don't make enough money for the private corporations, they are let go. Conversely, if the physicians make more money for the corporations, they are rewarded financially. This means that these family physi- cians end up working for the benefit of the cor- porations, not for the benefit of their patients. This is one of the many fundamental stumbling blocks in American health care. This letter is meant to serve as a warning for the possible storm on the horizon in BC. We do not want to have anything resembling the American health delivery system in Canada. The time to conduct this due diligence is now, before private corporations become any more power- ful in the ownership of family medicine in BC. \u2014Robert H. Brown, MD, CCFP North Saanich Search engine to identify the most affordable drug, coverage availability, and special authority resources Drugsearch.ca is a free search-engine website that shows the price of medications (brand and generic), whether a medication is covered by specific BC PharmaCare plans, and whether special authority is first needed for coverage. When special authority applies, links to the special authority criteria and application forms are provided. The search engine is refreshed monthly and syncs drug wholesaler pricing with the PharmaCare database. The website can also be accessed via the Pathways platform using \"drugsearch\" as a search term. I created this website, with the help of a local software developer, for several reasons. I once encountered a child with severe asthma whose parents had purchased only Ventolin, avoiding the steroid due to costs. I realized that if the prescriber had a rapid way to see which inhaled steroid was covered, the situation could have been averted. I am also frequently contacted by physician friends and colleagues asking for the prices of different medications because the PharmaCare formulary website does not show the full retail price, only how much the government would pay per dose. I have also found that most pharmacists and prescribers do not realize that costs only from covered medications count toward satisfying a patient's annual deductible, meaning that the increased prescribing of noncovered medica- tion actually hinders a patient from receiving PharmaCare assistance. Drugsearch.ca allows a prescriber to search for and compare medications by brand or ge- neric name, filter the search results by appli- cation (e.g., inhaled versus topical), and see the price that a patient would pay inclusive of pharmacy fees. The price takes into account whether the medication is covered by Phar- maCare and how much a patient would pay if it is covered. Drugsearch.ca results also show if a drug first requires special authority applica- tion to activate PharmaCare coverage, and has one-click links to the PharmaCare criteria page and application forms [Figure] . The need for a fast way to show pharmacists and prescribers special authority availability arose after I en- countered the case of an elderly pensioner who had paid nearly $2000 over a year for Entresto and did not receive PharmaCare assistance for his other medications. It was later found that the special authority had been missed by both pharmacists and prescribers, resulting in the Entresto drug costs not being applied toward his annual deductible, which needed to be met before PharmaCare coverage could begin. Un- fortunately, BC PharmaCare policy does not permit retroactive reimbursement to the patient in these situations. My hope is that patients, pharmacists, and prescribers can use drugsearch.ca to minimize patients' financial burdens and reduce the amount of paperwork faxed to pharmacies re-questing alternative covered medications. \u2014Anthony Chiam, RPh North Vancouver Disclosure: We are applying for a grant from the Ministry of Health for revenue to support the up - keep and cover host and server fees.

Cases through to the end of Febru- ary were among international travelers or close contacts of travelers to an area with community transmission. In early March 2020, the first case of community transmission in BC was reported, and the first two outbreaks of COVID-19 were identified (one at a conference, and one at a long-term care facility). This was followed by the increase in case counts. Cases related to travel slowed coincident with restrictions on non-essential travel, manda- tory quarantine upon return to BC, and border closures (3rd week of March 2020). A variety of public health measures were implemented, and lab testing capacity continued to be expanded, with testing initially focused on those most likely to transmit infection or who were part of clusters or outbreaks. The daily number of incident reported cases peaked in the 4th week of March at close to 100 new cases.1 Thereafter, there was a slow decline and leveling in the number of new cases identified daily through April. In late April, low-threshold testing began, and case numbers remained stable. Five weeks after the peak, most cases were acquired locally through contact with a known case or cluster with very little community transmission. All five regional health authorities reported cases of COVID-19; 84% of cases were from the two most populous health authorities, Epidemiology of COVID-19 in BC: The first 3 months 11 May 2020 This article is the opinion of the BC Centre for Disease Control and has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.Fraser Health and Vancouver Coastal Health.1 Lab-confirmed cases were evenly distributed by sex. Two-thirds of cases were among individu - als aged 30 to 69, and only 2% were pediatric (younger than 19 years). Approximately one in five cases was among health care workers. By 6 May 2020, 49 outbreaks had been declared, the majority (n = 41, 84%) in health care facilities, and eight in other settings (e.g., correctional facilities, workplaces). One in five British Columbians who tested positive for COVID-19 was hospitalized, and of those two in five required critical care. The crude case fatality rate was 5%, with age-specific rates ranging from 0.8% among individuals younger than 70 years, to 10% among indi- viduals aged 70 to 79, and 28% in individuals 80 years and older. The majority (> 60%) of deaths were among residents of long-term care facilities. Males were at 70% increased risk of death and were also more likely to be hospital- ized compared to females (25% for males, 15% females). The number of individuals requiring hospitalization and/or critical care peaked in the first week of April about 10 days after the peak in cases. At the peak, there were nearly 150 cases in hospital across the province; after the peak, the number steadily declined. Across Canada, every province has expe- rienced its own epidemic: a series of regional epidemics.2 While BC represents 14% of the Canadian population, it accounts for less than 4% of national COVID-19 cases and deaths so far.2 BC's epidemic curve was most similar to Saskatchewan's, both in terms of the magnitude relative to the population, as well as the overall trajectory. Internationally, BC fared favorably in the first 3 months of the pandemic compared with many other countries, mirroring Australia's epidemic curve.3 While the age and sex distri- bution of cases in BC was similar to what was observed across Canada, there were relatively fewer reported cases among youth and relatively more reported fatalities among individuals over 80 years old compared with global patterns. This is likely a reflection of variations in testing practices and because most COVID-19-related deaths in Canada have occurred in long-term care facilities. The observed sex difference in BC for severe COVID-19-related outcomes, with men more likely to be hospitalized, re- quire critical care, and die, is consistent with interna- tional statistics.4 As the restrictions and measures put in place to prevent community trans- mission in BC continue to ease over the coming weeks, the province will continue to monitor the dynamics and epide-miology of the pandemic. n \u2014Caren Rose, PhD BCCDC, PHSA School of Population and UBC \u2014BCCDC Surveillance Team BCCDC, PHSA \u2014Kate Smolina, PhD BC Observatory for Population and Public Health, BCCDC School of Population and Public Health, UBC references 1.

The MALT lymphoma was identified through a process that began with routine fecal immunochemical testing, which is recommended in BC for screening average- risk patients for colorectal cancer. The fecal immu- nochemical test (FIT) used for screening requires the patient to submit a stool sample collected at home using a simple kit. The sample is then ana- lyzed for the presence of blood. However, because bleeding can occur with benign pathologies such as hemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel disease, and vascular lesions, further investigation is required when certain pathologies are found on colonos- copy done in the colon screening program. In this David Sanders, MD, Hui-Min Yang, MD, S.

The results from all investigations eventually led to the detection of a rare gastric cancer. Despite the patient being from a part of the world with high rates of endemic Helicobacter pylori, the MALT lymphoma identified was not associated with H. pylori and was probably related to a systemic inflammatory disorder. Case data A 73-year-old female with average risk of co- lon cancer presented for routine fecal immu- nochemical testing. She had been screened in the past with the fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Her medical history was significant for a cerebrovascular accident, dyslipidemia, osteopo- rosis, and an inflammatory spondyloarthropahy with inflammatory sacroiliitis. Her medications included ASA, alendronate, and naproxen as needed. She was a nonsmoker with no alcohol consumption and had moved to Canada from Hong Kong. She had a second-degree relative diagnosed after age 60 with colorectal cancer. After having negative FIT results in 2014 and 2015, the patient had a positive FIT re - sult in July 2018 with a value of 171 ng/mL. When assessed prior to colonoscopy, she re- ported no hematochezia or melena and regular bowel movements with no change in her bowel habits. She had no early satiety, epigastric pain, nausea, or vomiting. Her weight was stable. She had no fevers, chills, or night sweats. Physical examination revealed no abdominal masses or peripheral lymphadenopathy. Her colonoscopy revealed a 1-cm pedun - culated polyp in the ascending colon and two 5-mm semi-pedunculated polyps in the trans- verse colon. Evidence of mild colitis was found in the rectosigmoid region and tissue was ob- tained for biopsy [Figure 1]. Retroflexion in the rectum revealed only internal hemorrhoids. The ascending colon polyp was a tubulovillous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia. The polyps were sessile serrated dysplasia and a infil- trate that had the replaced the glands [Figure 2]. Scattered lymphoepithelial lesions were identified. Im- munohistochemistry demonstrates an atypical B cell population positive for CD20 and negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, and CD43. A lambda light chain restriction was observed. The find- ings were consistent with low-grade B cell mucosa-associated lymphoid (MALT) lymphoma.

Ery-thema with an abnormal mucosal pattern was seen from the mid-gastric body extending into the antrum, pylorus, and first part of the duo-denum [Figure 3].

Other investigations revealed the patient's hemoglobin level was 117 g/L, her WBC was 3.5 x 109 /L, and her platelet count was 163 x 109 /L. The patient was also found to have a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of Her serum protein electrophoresis showed a monocloncal IgM lambda band in the beta 2 region. Helicobacter pylori, bacteria endemic in the patient's area of origin and typically associated with this lym- phoma, were not identified by biopsy or by a urea breath test. A bone marrow biopsy showed no bone involvement. A CT scan showed ab-normal wall thickening in the gastric antrum, proximal duodenum, and lower rectum [Figure 5]. There were prominent subcentimetre lymph nodes near the stomach and rectosigmoid. The patient was followed by her oncologist and a repeat EGD and colonoscopy were done at 6 months and found to show no endoscopic or histologic changes. Currently the patient remains on an active surveillance schedule and is receiving no therapy as she is asymptomatic and has a good performance status. Discussion Extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas are induced by chronic inflam- mation,1 with MALT lymphoma being the most common of marginal zone B cell lym- phomas.2 The prototypical infection for MALT involvement of the stomach is H. pylori. A study published in 2010 found the incidence of H. pylori-associated MALT lymphoma has de- clined3 compared with an earlier study that found H. pylori infection in 92% of all gastric MALT lymphomas considered.4 US data indicate that extranodal marginal zone lymphoma is rare, with 18.3 cases per 1 million person years, and that the median age at diagnosis is 66 years.5 The stomach is the most frequent site of involvement, but MALT can also involve the colon, salivary glands, ocu- lar adenexa, lungs, thyroid, breast, and liver.6 Symptoms can include reflux, epigastric pain, anorexia, weight loss, and gastrointestinal bleed- ing.7 is found in 27% patients.8 FIgUrE 5.

If blood is detected, follow-up procedures are ordered. This case is also interesting because the patient had multi- focal disease with involvement of the stomach, small bowel, and rectosigmoid, yet had no evi-dence of H. pylori infection. Besides H. pylori infection, autoimmune diseases such as sys- temic lupus erythematous, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, Hashimoto disease, and relapsing polychondri- tis have been associated with MALT.1,9,10 This patient had inflammatory spondyloarthropahy with inflammatory sacroiliitis. The mechanism postulated in cases such as this is that chronic inflammation leads to the local accumulation and proliferation of antigen-dependent B cells and T cells. B cell clones will remain that still depend on the antigen-stimulated immune re- sponse for growth and survival. With acquisi- tion of additional mutations, the tumor becomes antigen-independent and capable of systemic spread. 11 Historically, the Lugano staging system was used for gastrointestinal lymphomas, but mod- els such as the Paris Staging System12 can also be used. This patient was designated stage IV as she had disseminated extranodal involvement in multiple areas of the gastrointestinal tract. In H. pylori-associated cases, bacteria eradi- cation therapy should be prescribed regardless of disease stage.1,12 Eradiation of the bacteria should then be documented with a breath test.13 The decision to use rituximab, chemotherapy, or radiation is dependent on symptoms and disease distribution.12 Long-term follow-up with physical examinations, blood testing (in-cluding a CBC), cross-sectional imaging, and endoscopy should be implemented to monitor for progression and transformation. 12 Summary In the case described here a 73-year-old female was diagnosed with mucosa-associated lym- phoid tissue lymphoma after a process that be- gan with routine fecal immunochemical testing. A positive FIT result led to the patient undergo- ing colonoscopy, esophogastrodenoscopy, blood testing, and CT imaging. Although the patient was not found to have H. pylori-associated dis- ease, she did have inflammatory spondyloar- thropahy with inflammatory sacroiliitis. Her systemic inflammatory disorder may have been a factor in her MALT diagnosis, since extra- nodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lym- phomas are known to be induced by chronic inflammation. The stomach is the most common site af- fected, but MALT lymphoma can also involve the colon, salivary glands, ocular adenexa, lungs, thyroid, breast, and liver. Symptoms may include reflux, epigastric pain, anorexia, weight loss, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Once identified, treat- ment of MALT lymphoma may include H. pylori-eradication therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation. In this case, the patient is currently asymptomatic and remains on an active surveil- lance schedule without therapy. The patient was referred for a radiation oncology opinion for symptom management or to delay the need for systemic therapy. She was offered radiation to the gastric lesion, but declined treatment due to lack of symptoms and concern around the side effects of radiation. n Competing interests None declared. references 1.

Roger Y . Wong, MD, FRCPC, FACP , FCAHS Dr Wong is the executive associate dean, education, and a clinical professor in the Department of Medicine at the UBC Faculty of Medicine. This article has been peer reviewed.The impact of COVID-19 on medical education is unprecedented, far reach- ing, and presents unique challenges to medical schools.1-3 Mitigating strategies should be principle based, forward looking, and com- passionate. Lessons learned from the medical education adaptations during the pandemic can potentially be extrapolated to other cri- sis situations. This article outlines key lessons learned during COVID-19 at the UBC Faculty of Medicine, which is home to a provincially distributed medical undergraduate program that is composed of three regional medical cam- puses in addition to the main campus. For all educational adaptations during COVID-19, the foundational consideration is to embrace the safety and well-being of students in the context of providing patient-centred care. Effective communication is especially criti- cal during the pandemic. To ensure messaging is consistent, the task force develops key mes-sages regularly to add clarity to what students, faculty, and staff can expect. A multimodal com- munication approach is helpful, using email, YouTube video messages, and website postings. Also, early engagement of internal (university administration) and external (health authori- ties) stakeholders is crucial. During the pandemic, we are learning that medical curricular adaptations should be flex- ible in terms of delivery and administration, building on the existing pedagogical design. The governance structure of the curriculum should be maintained to ensure compliance with accreditation standards. With physical distancing required, all in-person classes (e.g., case-based learn- ing, lectures, discussion groups) transitioned to remote teaching via an online platform, literally within several days. Our approach has been to expand the video delivery platform that is already in place for our provincially distrib- uted medical education program. Case-based This cannot be overstated. We know that medi- cal students report feelings of uncertainty and anxiety3 about personal safety and continuity of learning experience. Many have questions on how the pandemic impacts their graduation timeline, financial liability, and housing inse- curity. The latter stressors, albeit nonacademic, must be adequately addressed through enhanced student advising services. To recommend and implement educational adaptations, we constructed two rapid-response teams at the outset. The first, the COVID-19 advisory working group, makes high-level steer- ing recommendations to the dean's office on educational adaptations as part of the medical school's response. The second, the undergradu- ate medical education COVID-19 task force, implements these recommendations. This task force, co-chaired by the undergraduate associate dean and a regional associate dean, comprises student representatives from all years and cam- puses, as well as multidisciplinary faculty mem- bers and administrative staff. This approach helps to empower students and faculty, who can serve as champions for change. 171 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 5 | june 2020171learning is delivered via videoconferencing, and the medical program uses YouTube teaching videos, mobile apps, and previously recorded di- dactic sessions. We recognize that emergency remote teaching may not contain all the best practices in effective online instruction,4 and we apply continuous quality improvement processes to enhance the learning experience. In the meantime, in the interest of student and patient safety, early clinical experiences (years 1 and 2) and clinical clerkship (core and elective rotations, years 3 and 4) have been placed on hold for all medical students. This is a uniform adaptation across all 17 medical schools in Canada and helps manage the fi- nite amount of personal protective equipment available. Close liaison with the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada is helpful. Adaptations made to replace in-person early clinical experiences (years 1 and 2) include on - line posting of clinical skills, development of new webinars, and videoconferencing delivery of family medicine teaching. For year 3 students, the module of clinical clerkship has been tem- porarily pulled out and replaced with flexible learning experience projects, which normally occur in year 4. The exact timing of clerkship re- instatement remains uncertain at this time and will depend on the rapidly evolving pandemic situation. We understand this can be a source of anxiety for students, and we are offering proac- tive academic advising and student counseling. Year 4 students have already completed the core curriculum, short of 2 weeks of electives, which have been now replaced by public health or re- search projects. These final-year students will graduate on time in May 2020, and will start residency training in July 2020, contributing to the physician workforce. Concurrently, we are empowering all medi- cal students to actively engage in a number of public health activities at the provincial level that do not involve physical patient contact, such as conducting COVID-19 contact trac- ing, staffing telephone hotlines and call centres in regional health authorities, and performing background literature searches for public health. The engagement of our students as part of the public health response demonstrates the social responsibility of the medical school, an approach that has been mirrored in other jurisdictions.5special feature Similar to the curricular adaptations, we have made parallel modifications to the as- sessment framework, preserving the over- all programmatic assessment approach while allowing flexibility by shifting the formative and summative components. Portfolio ses - sions have switched to online delivery, and workplace-based assessments have been de- ferred to after reinstatement of clinical clerk- ship. Multiple-choice examinations are now delivered online and made formative. We also delivered the first online objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) to the final year students and are deferring it for students in the remaining years. We have made adaptations to faculty devel- opment in preparing and supporting teachers via online, open-access resources.6 We have also launched a number of COVID-19-related webinars, free of charge, to support our teach-ers as part of the medical school's continuing professional development services. While it is important to act quickly when making adaptations during COVID-19, it is equally important to anticipate the long-term shifts that may become the new normal. Many adaptations, such as effective online instruction, are catalyzed by the urgency of the pandemic. We should begin to plan to sustain the adapta- tions as we refresh medical education.7 n Competing interests None declared.

Following the emergence of COVID-19, the website has become a communication hub connecting surgeons during the crisis. Hamish Hwang, MD, FACS Dr Hamish Hwang is a clinical associate professor at the University of British Columbia and associate head of the UBC Division of General Surgery. Dr Shiana Manoharan is a general surgery resident at UBC. Ms Taryn Zabolotniuk is a medical student at UBC. Dr S. Morad Hameed is an associate professor of surgery and critical care medicine at UBC and head of the UBC Division of General Surgery. This article has been peer reviewed.The UBC Reticulum website was launched in May 2019 to help con- nect general surgeons across British Columbia. The site's primary function was to connect surgeons based on their name, loca- tion, specialty area, and the procedures they carry out. Figures 1 and 2 show screenshots of the website's map function that displays where surgeons are located throughout the province. Other features included matching surgeons with mentors, a repository of proposed and completed research projects, a locum-matching function, and a message board dubbed \"Netter.\" The site (www.ubcreticulum.com) is restricted to general surgeons, residents, and associated administrators and researchers.such as Airbnb and MLS, UBC Reticulum uses tags to tailor the site to a user's interests. Users identify subspecialties and other interests, and corresponding tags were created to attach to applicable research projects and message posts. Users who list specific interests on their pro- file receive an email or text notification when another user posts something tagged with that interest. Examples of tags include subspecialty interests such as community surgery, colorectal surgery, gastric oncology, and critical care. Ex- amples of other interests include billing, global health, medicolegal issues, wellness, medical education, and telehealth. Netter topics include links to other websites, billing tips, resources for telehealth, information to share with patients, endoscopy algorithms, COVID-19 data resources, announcements about canceled conferences, government tax information, wellness resources, perioperative PPE protocols, alternative sourcing of PPE, advice on triaging office consults, impacts on residents and qualifying examinations, and invi- tations to webinars.

On 15 March 2020, a COVID-19 tag was created. By 25 March 2020 there were 31 feeder posts on Netter with 63 follow-up comments posted by 24 users from all five geographic regions of the province. After 10 days, more surgeons were engaged on the website than previously seen on any other topic. Over the following 4 weeks, there were 60 additional Netter posts, including a link to a daily Zoom update hosted by surgeons at Vancouver Gen-eral Hospital and attended by surgeons across the province. An additional 40 users signed up for the website, bringing the total to 232. On 6 April 2020, a new feature went live\u2014 the COVID-19 Surgical Oncology Transfer Network. This feature, pictured in Figure 4, allows an at-a-glance view of all the hospitals in the province and their capacity to perform urgent cancer surgery. Each site has a designated surgeon contact to facilitate urgent transfers of cancer patients; if cancer operations become no longer possible at one hospital patients could be transferred to another hospital in the network that still has access. The network is maintained by a volunteer UBC medical student. In the face of the unprecedented COVID- 19 crisis, general surgeons in BC have been able to use this new technology to connect and help each other in real time in a way never before seen. The potential for collaboration created by a networking website such as this was realized in an unpredictable circumstance. Opportunities to repurpose the network for other pandemics or disaster scenarios in the future are sure to be discovered. nFIgUrE 2. t he map function showing general surgeons in Greater vancouver.

Early clinical reports from China, Italy, and the US identified that age, hyperten- sion, cardiac disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with severe disease and death from infection with SARS-CoV-2.1-5 Obesity was demonstrated to be an important risk factor for severe infection from the influenza A H1N1 virus,6 and emerging evidence suggests that this is also the case for SARS-CoV2. Recent studies from China, France, and the US show that COVID-19 positive patients with a higher body mass index (BMI) have greater odds of experiencing disease requiring acute or critical care, and may be less likely to survive.7-9 The largest study to date, evaluating the as- sociation of BMI with SARS-CoV-2 infection was a retrospective analysis of 3615 COVID-19 positive symptomatic patients in a New York academic hospital.7 Among patients younger than 60 years, persons with a BMI between 30 and 34 kg/m2 were 2 times more likely to be ad- mitted to acute care and critical care. Similarly, patients younger than 60 years with a BMI 35 kg/m2, were 4 times more likely to be admitted to critical care. This study adjusted for age but not comorbid conditions. There are several biologically plausible mechanisms for the association between obesity This article is the opinion of the Nutrition Committee, a subcommittee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opinion of Doctors of BC.

Obesity is a state of chronic inflammation with high concentrations of pro-inflammatory cy- tokines, which causes reduced macrophage activation and blunted cytokine production con- tributing to impaired innate immunity.10 Leptin is a hormone made by fat cells and is a marker of the degree of adiposity. Leptin levels are high in patients with obesity and it has been shown to interfere with the body's ability to mount an effec- tive immune response to vaccination or infection. It is possibly the basis of the poor vaccination success rates in patients with obesity as well as their increased susceptibility to viral infections.11 Persons with obesity shed influenza A vi- rus for longer periods, increasing the chance of spread.12 This is important in determining self-isolation times. Furthermore, BMI cor- relates positively with the concentration of in- fectious virus in exhaled breath and evidence suggests that the obesity microenvironment contributes to greater disease virulence.13,14 Mounting evidence supports obesity as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease. Iso- lation of positive cases and physical distancing are currently the primary interventions. Per- sons with obesity should be especially careful to avoid infection. Physicians should also be aware of the psychological toll associated with obesity and the need to support our patients' physical and mental well-being amid the global pandemic. n \u2014Priya Manjoo, MD \u2014Katie Bowers, MPP references 1.

Ronsdale Press, 2019. Paperback. The achievements of physicians working in remote areas in the early days of this country are legendary. In his book Service on the Skee-na, Mynett does us great service by telling the story of one of those legendary pioneers. It is a fascinating story of Harold Wrinch, a man motivated by service, dedicated to the people of a remote region, working through tremendous challenges to provide care to Indigenous com- munities as well as to isolated and sometimes fractious settlers. A true generalist, Wrinch's name deserves wide recognition as one of the outstanding medical pioneers of the country. Horace Wrinch arrived with his wife in the Upper Skeena in 1900 to serve the people of the region and was responsible, as the only physi- cian, for providing care over hundreds of miles in every direction. In the days when churches in Canada took considerable responsibility for providing hospital care, Wrinch brought a deep faith as well as remarkable medical skill to his work. This doctor, with early training in agri- culture, not only provided essential medical services, but built two hospitals, established a nursing school, and created a farm that sup- plied the hospitals. He also provided an early practical example of medical insurance, years before it became a topic of wide concern, in News We welcome news items of less than 300 words; we may edit them for clarity and length.

This biography\u2014well researched and well written\u2014provides in-depth local history, wonderful stories of early medicine in the Up- per Skeena, and anecdotes of the challenges Wrinch faced. For instance, not long after ar- riving in the Upper Skeena, he was required to write examinations in order to qualify for a licence to practise in British Columbia. This involved a 125-mile winter hike from Hazelton to Stewart, boat travel to Victoria, and then a return journey, all of which took over a month. Mynett not only tells the story of Wrinch's remarkable medical achievements, including his lockdown of Northern BC during the Spanish flu epidemic, but also of his involvement in the famous Simon Gunanoot case. He also details Wrinch's work as a member of the provincial BC Family Physician of the Year Award The BC Family Physician of the Year Award recognizes a family physician who provides exemplary care to patients and takes part in activities that contribute to excellence in family medicine.Dr Tahmeena Ali Family Medicine Advocate Award The Family Medicine Advocate Award rec- ognizes a BCCFP member who has demon- strated a strong commitment to advocating for the value of family medicine.

The application was created to provide a community view of primary care data across BC, which had been unavailable until now. Dr Shirley Sze, chair of the HDC board of directors, points out that this tool creates the opportunity for family doctors to use data to learn about their individual and collective workloads and complexity of diseases, and begin to build strategies. HDC signed an adaptor development agreement with Intrahealth and Telus in 2018 to expand the original application, which previ- ously allowed sharing only by Medical Office Information System (MOIS) and OSCAR users. The Intrahealth adaptor has gone live and WELL Health has signed an agreement to ensure continuity for OSCAR EMR users. Now that all adaptors are complete, the majority of primary care physicians across the province can access HDC Discover. Contributing data to HDC is a sign of a doctor's professional commitment to improving clinical practice improvement and providing valuable data for the overall goal of resource planning. Pressures to improve the quality of services delivered to patients are increasing, and these pressures underscore the need for physi- cians and organizations to engage in measurable quality improvement processes. Using insights from the data results in a professionally satisfy- ing practice and leads to improved patient out- comes. Physicians can access this data through a secure, simple-to-use program that maintains patient and provider confidentiality. The application was recently certified by the Privacy by Design framework. This project is supported and funded by the General Practice Services Committee, a partnership of Doctors of BC and the Ministry of Health. HDC was established in April 2016 through a merger of two previous initiatives, Aggregated Metrics for Clinical Analytics and Research and the Physician's Data Collaborative, to support a network of physicians for the collaborative use of clinical data.

The website www.covidquestions.ca lists questions submit- ted by Canadians and answers sourced from reputable organizations, with the option for anyone to submit new questions that have not yet been addressed. BC PharmaCare CO vID-19 information for prescribers BC PharmaCare has developed online resources for issues related to COVID-19 about drug supply, anticoagulant/antiplatelet coverage and testing, special authority extensions, care for people who use drugs, and limited coverage inhalers for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.

During the pandemic, people living with arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and lupus, are more vulnerable to infection because of their arthritis and the medications used for their treatment. What is not known is how the pandemic has impacted people with arthritis and how to better support arthritis patients. Through surveys and interviews, the UNI- FIED study will ask people living with arthritis how COVID-19 has affected access to and use of their arthritis medications, and how it has impacted their mental health. The study will also assess patients' experiences with care and access to their physician. This includes tele- health, treatment decisions, and mental health checkups. Patient input is needed so decisions made by doctors and health care systems can be in- formed and optimized during the pandem- ic and beyond.

Radiologists, fellows, residents, and UBC medical students are collecting, analyzing, and labeling thousands of CT scans, and in some cases chest X-rays, from COVID-19 patients around the globe. Information gleaned from the scans will form the basis for an open source artificial-intelligence model to predict the pres- ence, severity, and complications of COVID-19 on CT scans. The model will integrate clinical data to help support and supplement existing tools to improve patient care. For example, it could help physicians determine whether in- dividuals are best treated at home or whether they may require hospitalization/ventilation. It will not replace current testing. The model will also assist in detecting similarities and differ-ences in variations of patterns across different cultural and ethnic groups, and help researchers understand early and late stages of patterns of disease. It could also help flag those who may ultimately develop permanent lung damage/ fibrosis. Researchers are confident this new tool will help them predict disease severity and its clinical impact in different patient populations. Once developed, the new artificial- intelligence model will be piloted at Vancouver General Hospital with an aim to embed it in 179 BC MediC al Journal vol. 62 no. 5 | june 2020179news routine diagnostic procedures to improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnostics.

Ontario researchers join global initiative to study loss of smell in CO vID-19 patients As part of an initiative called the Global Con- sortium for Chemosensory Research (GCCR), scientists at Lawson Health Research Institute and Western University are studying the sudden loss of smell (anosmia) in COVID-19 patients. They are asking individuals with confirmed or presumptive cases of COVID-19 worldwide to participate in a survey to better understand this symptom. A sudden loss of smell has been widely re- ported as a marker of COVID-19. More re- search is needed but emerging evidence suggests that more than 60% of COVID-19 patients experience anosmia and that it is often the first symptom of the disease. In the new study, patients with loss of smell will answer questions through a publicly ac- cessible survey. They will be asked about their experiences with COVID-19 and other respi- ratory illnesses. An immediate goal is to better understand the association between anosmia and COVID-19, and determine if loss of smell is the same in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The team also hopes to determine if loss of smell happens before other symptoms of COVID-19 as it could allow for earlier self-isolation advice. While there are existing therapies that can aid in regaining a sense of smell, it's cur-rently unknown whether they are effective for COVID-19 patients. The long-term conse - quences of anosmia in COVID-19 patients are also unknown. Researchers encourage any- one who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 or another respiratory illness to complete the survey if they are able. The survey is currently available in 10 languages at www.covidand smell.com. how to embed AI and digital technology into physicians' training and practices The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada's Task Force on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Emerging Digital Technologies un- veiled 12 foundational recommendations on how to prepare physicians for the technological changes coming to their practices. While not the focus of the report, the im- portance of AI and emerging digital tech- nologies for supporting and responding to unprecedented shifts in health care become even more pronounced as physicians adhere to expectations of physical distancing while treating patients (e.g., telehealth, robotics), and challenge organizations to rethink how they prepare residents and fellows for rapid deploy- ment of new and emerging AI technologies. Members of the task force include fellows of the Royal College and AI experts who con- sulted with stakeholders, interviewed experts, and reviewed survey responses from over 4000 fellows and resident affiliates to inform the find - ings. The recommendations aim to inform the future of care and physician training in Canada.

The Con- ference Board of Canada explores the use of this technology in a newly released report, \"Cool Ideas: Remote Surgery .\" This paper aims to spark a conversation on whether remote robotic surgery could reduce costs, expand access, and improve surgical services in the North, in the near term or distance future. Looking to remote robotic surgery to help residents in Canada's North and other remote regions access important surgical needs requires addressing many issues, including technologi- cal, cultural, logistical, and social concerns. But first, northerners need to determine if remote surgery is something they want to consider. \"Cool Ideas: Remote Surgery\" is the second report in the Cool Ideas series. This series aims to raise awareness about emerging opportuni- ties while weighing the costs and benefits of new systems against the risks and challenges. The first report of the series was titled \"Revo - lutionary Building for the North: 3D Printing Construction.\" Both reports are available from www.conferenceboard.ca/e-library.
