Preparing skin using antiseptic cleanser. Keeping everything sterile. Placing clean dressing. Changing the dressing at scheduled times or if it is loose or soiled.Contact Precautions Bacteria (germs) that are resistant to many antibiotics are called Multi- Drug Resistant Organisms (MDROs). These organisms can be found in the community and in healthcare facilities. Sometimes people may be carriers of these organisms and not have an actual infection.

Grammy winning singer and actress Michelle Williams was kind enough to make some time in her busy schedule to talk to us about TERI or the Training, Education & Research Institute. You may remember her from Destiny's Child, but Michdle has been working solo for the past few years and has had great success as both a singer and actress. When the opportunity arose for her to become the spokesperson for TERI, an organization that deals with issues close to her heart, she jumped at the opportunity. HealthUpdate: First off can you tell me what is TERI or the Training, Education & Research Institute? i ,- \", ;~, \"~!~-~,7: TERI is an amazing organization. They basically assist people with developmental disabilities and their families. They give them resources on how to live with disabilities such as autism etc. that we don't have a cure for yet. What I appreciate about TERI is thai since there is no cure yet for autism - you have so many organizations that exist to find a cure - this is an organization that helps people that are living with it. HU: And do they work all across the country? i' Well they definitely can work across the country, but they have some residences in the San Diego area, and I was privileged to visit one of the homes and the equestrian center. But there's a brand new equestrian and aquatic center that's being built as we speak. HU: How did you become interested in tixis organization? ~i\":: My godson, who's four years old, was diagnosed with autism, and I had a cousin who had a developmental disability. So they actually asked me to sing and participate in one of theirbenefits, but I was so touched that I didn't want to just be a celebrity that shows up and sings at the event and doesn't pay attention to the organization ever again. So it was starting up and they were looking for someone that could help spread the word, and I was excited that they asked me - well, I kind of just forced myself on them <laughs>. HU: So how can people get involved? ~,,a',7,': You can go to www.tetiinc.org to find out mote information on the organization. It will tell you about the aquatic center that's being built, how you can donate, and they can also give you information if you are affected or your family is somehow affected by the disease and you need help.HU: So they 'help people deal ~vith the issues that come along ~vith living with developmental disabilities? - ~::'.: Absolutely. I mean, can youimagine what a family must go through that has somebody that is developmentally disabled and the special services that they need? You'd think there would be a lot of information out there, but there's not, so they're there to help. HU: Can I ask on a personal level how your godson's developmental disabilities have affected you and your friends and family? i7' I :7i Well he's doing very well. He's in school and I saw him the other night. My nickname is \"Tee Tee\", and he said, \"Hi Tee Tee!\". And you can understand at first his parents were pretty concerned because his speech wasn't developing, but he's been in school adapting to people. Forhim to come up and give you a hug is a big deal, because he wasfft doing that at first - at least not to me. Now every time I see him, he gives me a hug, and he's just so bright and happy, and I'm so glad that maybe with him being in school and around other students, andgetting that therapy he needs, he really is enjoying things. HU: So does TERI work ~vith all age groups? i': '\" It's open to pretty much everyone that I know of. It is a house for adults, but it is open to all age groups. And with that aquatic center and equestrian center that's being built and with the theatre and arts program that they're trying to develop, they're going to have to include all age groups and I know that they will. HU: So on another note, what's going on with Michelle Williams? (', !\"' Well I'm currently touring the country in a play called What My Husband Doesn't Know, and we'll be wrapping up in about two weeks in Dallas, and then I'm going to start recording an album. And I'm really excited about recording a song on that album from which all the proceeds will go to TERI. HU: ts there anything else you'd like to add? i:, ....Well I'm just so glad to be the spokesperson for TERI and I really like talking about this organization and all the help it gives and all the lives it affects!

Every year in the United States, runners train for marathons, overworked executives hit the gym, thousands brave the winter weather to hit the slopes, and families hop on their bikes for a ride around the neighborhood. However, if you are one of the millions of Americans living with osteoarthritis, simple and mundane tasks such as climbing stairs and walking can be a challenge. Osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints. Inflammation, pain and loss offimctionality occur when the cartilage protecting the joint breaks down and the two bones rub together. The Centers for Disease Control reports that an estimated 46 million adults in the United States are told by a physician that they have some form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia. The most common form of arthritis is osteoarthritis, and in 2005, an estimated 27 miJlion adults were diagnosed with the disease. Arthritis and other rheumatic conditions (AORC) cost the United States billions of dollars each year. In fact, in 2003, reports showed that AORC cost the U.S. $127.8 billion dollars ($80.8 billion in medical care expenditures and $47.0 biJ~ion in lost earnings). As a former college wrestler and football player, an avid golfer, and a physician with over 30 years of experience in orthopaedicsurgery and sports medicine, I've seen first-hand the adverse affects of living with osteoarthritis. Many patients are told by their physicians that their only options for treatment are exercise, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hyaluronic acid injections or total knee ~eplacement surger~ ~That are the treatment options for osteoa~thrkis of the knee? Exercise is the number one recommended treatment for osteoarthtitis (OA) of the knee because k builds muscle mass which can help stabilize the knee. Further, with obesity contributing to the progression of OA due to the stress of added weight on the joints, exercise can also help with weight loss, thereby reducing pressure on the knee. Another treatment option for OA of the knee is non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs that reduce the inflammation of the joint. However, adverse side effects of pharmaceutical treatments include stomach irritation, possible stomach ulcers, elevated blood pressure, or aggravation of heart conditions. Viscosupplementation injections are given in a series of one to five shots over the course of several months (depending on the product used). These injections are effective in relieving the pain of osteoartMtic knees, but the results may vary from patient to patient. Total knee replacement surgery (TKR) is the most invasive of all treatment options.

Since the surfaces that were previously rubbing on each other have now been replaced and realigned, this reduces the patient's pain, but full range of motion after this surgery may not be possible if there were significant anatomical changes preceding surgical intervention. Total knee replacement surgery carries risks for patients such a blood clots in the leg or lung, infection, heart attack, stroke, and loosening of the artificial knee. Additionally, depending on wear and tear, the joint may need to be replaced at a later date if loosening becomes painful. Rehabilitation time to restore knee function can take several weeks to months. In May of 2009, I began prescribing \u00af VQ OrthoCare's OActivevM knee brace and BioniCare\u00ae System, the first non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical, non-surgical treatment option for osteoarthritis of the knee. The treatment delivers a low-level pulsed dectrical signal to the knee through two electrodes hdd in place on the inside of a joint unloading brace, developed specifically to treat osteoarthritis by mimicking the naturally occurring signal present in a healthy knee joint. The low-level pulsed electrical signal is not felt by the patient. Because not every patient is a good candidate for surgery, drugs or injections due to age and other risk factors, the OActive knee brace and BioniCare System alleviates risks associated with surgery, pharmaceuticals, and injections, while helping to alleviate pain and allow patients return to their normal, active lifestyles. As a prescribed treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee, the OActive knee brace and BioniCare System patients are under the care of a physician at all times. On average, patients using the OActive knee brace and HEALTHU PDATE.comBi\u00b0niCare System have reported.~,~Ji i :.[:' 'experiencing positive results after 750 hours. Unlike a standard knee brace, the BioniCare device isNews, 773s~ and Advice for a Healthier Life integrated into the OActive \"unloader\" knee brace to reduce the impact of body weight on the knee and reduce the patient's pain. The OActive Knee Brace is worn undetected under clothing and allows for optimal movement of the entire leg. Within the first year, I have seen a 70% improvement rate in pain, symptoms, and knee function with the OActive knee brace and BioniCaxe System. Ultimately, taking care of ourselves at every stage along the way is the best treatment to preventing disease and illness as we grow older. Tiffs begins with exercise and nutrition, and continues by educating ourselves on the best treatment options. Always consult with your physician and ask questions about the risks and results you can expect from every treatment option. Works Cited: Centers for Hospitals Publishing Group, int., 2050 Maxon Rd.

Health experts recognize that modest weight losses of 10% can result in significant health improvements. By focusing on four essential strategies, which I call the four directions, you can enjoy the health benefits of successful weight control. Direction 1: LOOK UP Karen's sleep apnea and knee pain restricted her activities and mobility, depleting her mood and self-esteem. Tired of being limited by health problems and determined to feel better, she decided that to live more effectively she had to synchronize behaviors and values. She began to use a food diary to plan her meals, and to swim laps three dines a week. After losing 40 pounds, she was sleeping better and was offpain medication. LOOKING UP involves knowing your priorities and linking them to actions. Direction 2: LOOK IN After a break-up, Vicky began eating to console hersel\u00a3 Food was safe and comforting, it became her best friend. After gaining weight, she recognized that she was using food and weight to seal herself off from others who might hurt her again. Her weight loss began by taking an inventory of needs, admitting that using food for love and soothing was only making matters worse. She decided to re-connect with friends and improve assertiveness skills, launching a successful weight loss that helped her get back into life. LOOKING 1N means uncovering feelings and needs and finding healthy ways to honor them.Direction 3: LOOK BACK Successful_ weight losers have the ability to do \"damage control,\" to learn from slips and go forward. After a weekend of excessive snacking, Sharon realized all her free time had been spent in obligations -- there was no fun and snacks became her rewaxd. She concluded she had to re-design her weekends to include pleasure and meaning; she signed up for dancing lessons and joined a garden club. In LOOKING BACKwe make relapses an opportunity to learn and grow. Direction 4: LOOK AHEAD Chris' 60-potmd weight loss was anchored in thoughtfi.d restaurant management: 1) Dofft look at menus, 2) No bread on the table, 3) Plan the meal before arriving, 4) Order two appetizers if no entr& fits the plan, 5) Stick to roast chicken or seafood, 6) Eat early before getdng too hungry; and 7) Order fruit and tea for dessert. By LOOII2NG ~, we anti@ate risk and design a plan that eliminates or manages the risk. Conclusion: You can add sttength and endurance to your weight control efforts by looking up, in, back and ahead.

Physical rehabilitation is an important part of the recovery process once treatment is over. Common issues, such as loss of strength, motion, overall fimess, pain and lymphedema concerns need to be addressed. Sibley's approach is a comprehensive one, addressing any and all of the follmving, as determined by the patient's needs and physician's recommendations. \u00afLymphedema prevention, education and management \u00afStrength, motion and fi_~nction restoration \u00afManual therapy for soft tissue mobility, joint mobility \u00afPosture education \u00afReturn to exercise and lifestyle guidelines \u00afSport-specific and activity-specific exercise programs Based on a thorough evaluation and discussion with the patient about his/her goals and needs, treatments include some combination of \u00afExercise for restoration of strength and motion \u00afI-Iands-on treatment to restore mobility of the tissues and joints affected by cancer treatment \u00afPosture and breathing-gnidelines \u00afFitness programs \u00afPatient educationLYMPHEDElVIA after cancer treatment is an accumulation of protein-rich fluid that may occur ~vhen the lymphatic system is compromised fi'om surgery and/or radia- tion treatment. This unique type of swelling can present at any time after cancer treatment and, while it continues to be an area with many unans~vered questions, there is a great deal that can be done to prevent and treat lymphedema. At Sibley, treatment of lymphedema includes some combination of manual lymphatic drainage, compression bandaging, exercise, and pos- ture and breathing guidelines, and patient education. Who Will Be Treating Me? The physical and occupational therapists dedicated to this program are certified in lymphedema treatment. An interdiscipli- nary approach is used with ongoing communication between therapist, patient and physician. All sessions are conducted in private treatment rooms. The primary goals of therapy include: reduction of swelling, patient education, exercise and improved quality of life. How Do I Get Referred?

It presents as an accumulation of fluid (swelling) in a region of the body when the lymphatic system is compromised and unable to manage the flow of lymphatic fluid. While it continues to be an area with many unanswered questions, there is a great deal that can be done to treat lymphedema. Causes Of Lyrnphedema \u00afPrimary b'mphedema is caused by a congenital malformation of the lymphatic system. It may be present at birth or develop later in life. Secondary lymphedema is more common and may result from surgery or radiation therapy in the treatment of cancer. Other causes include trauma or infection of the lymphatic system. Severe venous insufficiencies may also contribute to the onset of lymphedema. How Is L),mphederna Treated? At Sibley, an individualized treatment approach is developed based on the physician's prescription, a thorough evaluation, and discussion with the patient about his/her goals and needs. Treatment includes some combination of >-Manual Lymph Drainage: Gentle rhythmic massage to promote the flow of lymph fluid. Compression Bandaging: Application of layers of short-stretch bandages to help minimize swelling by providing resistance against the skin and muscles underneath.Exercise: Patients are instructed in specific flexibility, strengthening, posture, breathing and aerobic exercises designed to improve lymphatic flow and help control lymphedema. Patient Education: Many lifestyle modifications can impact lymphatic potential, and each patient's needs and questions will be addressed. Throughout the rehabilitation program, whether you need to be seen once or for ongoing treatments, we will be educating you so that you have the knowledge and skills to manage your particular needs independently. Who Will Be Treating Me? The physical and occupational therapists dedicated to this program are certified in lymphedema treatment. An interdisciplinary approach is used with ongoing communication between therapist, patient and physician. All sessions are conducted in private treatment rooms. The primary goals of therapy include: reduction of swelling, patient education, exercise and improved quality of life. How Do I Get Referred?

They are dedicated to ensuring that patients receive the best, safest, most efficient and personalized care during their hospital stay. \"Hospitalists are your personal doctors inside Sibley, coordinating an entire care team.\" --Mary Therese O'Donnell, M.D., M.P.H., director, Sibley Hospitalist Group This highly-experienced group provides a 24/7 physician presence to address issues quickly, communicate directlywith primary care physicians at all critic~[de~~o~,a ~,~ directly manage patient care:ai]d(:~ate specialists andservices. In fact, hospltahsts the New York Times reports they are the fa~tes~~ specialty in medicine. Ensuring personalized care, more frequent communication Since hospitalists have extensive experience with Sibley systems, services and staff, they help enable a more seamless, responsive experience for you and your family. Their presence allows patients to be examined and admitted more rapidly. Tests are ordered, reviewed and acted upon without delay. Appropriate treatment and medication can begin sooner. ConOnued on page 2 ONHealth SUMMER2012 I P.IHospitalists continued Collaboration. Communication. Coordination. Problems can be detected earlier. Complex conditions are monitored more effectively. Hospitalists are available in person, day and night, to keep patients and families updated, answer questions and respond to ~o, emergencies. Working closely with your own doctor One of the most valuable roles hospitalists play is to o facilitate communication ~ and manage the flow of information. \"Our relationship with referring physicians is based on trust and collaboration. Their phone numbers are programmed in our ceil phones,\" notes Mary Therese O'Donnel[, M.D., M.EH., director, Sibley Hospitalist Group. Since hospitalists are inside the hospital around the clock, they can often provide hours of one-on-one patient care before primary care doctors, specialists and surgeons are able to leave their offices and operating rooms.Hospitalists also communicate closely with one another, providing ful! briefings when shifts change. Improving your recovery and transition to home Sibley hospitalists meet with your discharge team in advance to prepare for life after you leave the hospital. Their goal is to enable a smooth transition by helping families access all necessary resources such as physical therapy and visiting nurses. Complete medical summaries are sent to the primary care doctor at discharge so care continues seamlessly. Playing an important physician leadership role , Hospitalists are an integral part of life at Sibley; participating in medical staff committees and task forces, ensuring patient safety and quality measures are met and providing a crucial resource in developing new services.

New procedures, made with only tiny incisions or no incisions at all, can accomplish what previously required major surgery--and in some cases allow treatment never before possible. By minimizing trauma to the body, these procedures substantially reduce blood loss, pain, time spent in the hospital, risk of infection and scarring. As a result, patients can recover faster and return to work and activities sooner.Minimally invasive techniques can also make surgery possible for older, overweight or very ill patients for whom major surgery poses too great a risk. Sibley has often been the area's first to invest in new technology, perform these advanced procedures and perfect techniques. Sibley consistently has one of the lowest complication rates and best outcomes in the entire area for minimally invasive procedures across a wide range of specialties. Continued on page 4 ONHealth SUMMER 2012 I P. 3Mimmoli hwasive Procedures neurosurgeons perform minimally invasive laminectomies, lumbar fusions and cervical procedures to treat herniated discs, spinal stenosis, arthritis, trauma and cancer. Degenerative scoliosis which once required extensive surgery and a nine-month recovery can now be l~erformed.with no blood loss or ICU stay, and many mq,,~las shorter recovery. Because the techniques are less t~a.tic, surgeons believe spines of these patients may re~n inherently more stable.

Minimally invasive tools also treat shoulder stiffness and certain fractures. Arthroscopic foot and ankle procedures, including Achilles tendon repair and reconstruction, allow patients to return to activities sooner with less pain. As a center of excellence in minimally invasive Anterior hip replacement, Sibley a~racts surgeons from across the country to learn the advanced procedure. \"Sibley patients want to get back to their lives as fast as they can, with the least amount of risk. These techniques can make that possible.\" --Joshua Ammerman, M.D., Sibley neurosurgeon Gynecology, Oncology, Urology Advanced robotic technology, requiring only a dime- sized incision, brings advanced surgical options to Sibley patients. Surgeons control the robot's every move, using its four steel arms, and magnified 3-D vision that translate hand movements into precise \"micro-movements\" to perform surgery for certain gynecological cancers, uterine fibroid removal, prostate cancer, kidney removal and more.Radiation Oncology Sibley is the only center in the Washington area offering prone radiation to treat breast cancer, an approach that can often dramatically decrease exposure of the lungs and heart to radiation and reduce side effects. Sibley also has Washington's only Tomotherapy machine, allowing stereotactic radiotherapy to deliver fewer, but far more powerful, pinpointed doses--even targeting around extremely complex shapes. By imaging every day, therapy constantly adapts to reflect changes in tumor size and location, spares surrounding tissue and organs and results in exceptional tumor control rates commonly with few, or no side effects. Besides delivering stereotactic radiotherapy to cancers in the brain, spine and lung, it is ideal for treating cancer of the prostate, esophagus, head and neck. General Surgery Laparoscopic procedures require only tiny keyhole incisions for gall bladder, hernia, colon, spleen and small intestine surgeries. Sibley's advanced operating rooms and high- definition monitors allow surgeons to view anatomic detail at the highest level and perform operations with absolute precision. Surgeons consistently work with the same specialized nursing team and equipment--delivering the depth of experience and teamwork essential for success in these highly complex procedures. Interventional Radiology Ultrasound, CT and fluoroscopy are used to guide minimally invasive procedures at Sibley to treat many conditions. Angioplasty opens clogged arteries by inserting and inflating a balloon-tipped catheter into the artery. If needed, a stent can be placed to hold the constricted area open. Vertebroplasty/Kyphoplasty treats compression fractures of the spine due to osteoporosis or metastasized cancer. Bone cement is injected into collapsed vertebra to form an \"internal cast\" that stabilizes and strengthens disintegrated bone, substantially reducing pain. Uterine artery embolization shrinks uterine fibroids by injecting tiny harmless particles into arteries to deprive fibroids of blood, reducing or eliminating synaptoms. Varicose and spider veins are eliminated using a procedure which \"closes\" painful blood vessels and dramatically reli6ves symptoms. P.4 I SIBLEY MEMORIAL HOSPITALBaHatHc Minimally invasive weight loss procedures, combined with significant lifestyle changes, can be powerful tools in losing weight and maintaining that loss long term. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass limits the amount of food that can be eaten and absorbed by permanently rearranging the gastrointestinal tract. Patients can lose 50 - 80 percent of their excess weight within one year. LAP-BAND surgery limits the amount of food that can be eaten and reduces appetite by placing an adjustable prosthetic device around the stomach. Periodic band adjustments customize the level of restriction, allowing patients to lose 40 - 60 percent of their excess weight over three to four years. Laparoscopicsleeve gastrectomy decreases stomach size, reduces appetite and limits the amount of food that can be eaten by removing most of the stomach's outer portion. Patients can lose 50 - 70 percent of their excess weight within one year.

When Jill Kalaris, Sibley operating room R.N., was selected to participate in the Frontline Nursing Leadership Academy, she began a year of specialized leadership training that included undertaking a project to improve safety and patient care. During this time, she was able to research, assess and launch an improved patient care procedure. As one of 50 Sibley nurses chosen to participate in 2011, Kalaris says she devised a way to improve dispensing medications to patients undergoing total joint procedures.\"After observing OR physicians mixing an intra-articular injection, I thought that patient safety and care could be improved b~, having the pharmacy prepare the mixture.\" Due to the generosity of philanthropists like the KBR Foundation and private family foundations, Sibley launched the Frontline Nursing Leadership Academy in 2010. \"It has already proven effective in identifying and developing the next generation of leaders to face the challenges of performance improvement, teamwork and accountability,\" says Arlene Snyder, president of Sibley Memorial Hospital Foundation. Sibley Memorial Hospital Foundation is grateful to the KBR Foundation and other supporters for their generous philanthropic support.

For Estela Prieto, director of Imaging, who worked at the hospital for 32 years, \"The reason Sibleyis wonderful, not only for patients but for people who work here, is Mr. Sloan's philosophy. There's a sense of family, belonging and ownership that flows from the top.\" Mr. Sloan's belief that patients should not have to leave their community to find topnotch care has frequently made Sibley first in the area to provide new technologies and treatments. \"He's always supported physicians' requests to invest in cutting edge technologies,\" says Peter E. Petrucci, M.D., Sibley's V.E for medical affairs, patient safety and quality. \"He lives the mission of Sibley in terms of putting patient care Continued on page 2 ONHealth SPRING 2012 I R Ifirst and challenging folks to do better every day,\" notes Stephen McDonnell, Sibley COO and CFO. Sister Carol Keehan, president/CEO of the Catholic Health Association of the United States is struck by his \"absolute insistence on double checks for patient safety and care. He doesn't just say let's try to be careful; he's built a safer system. Since his family means so much to him, he appreciates how much your family means to you and why it's so important that Sibley takes care of them well.\" \"Patient care and safety are his priorities. Making sure Sibley is here to serve this community for the next hundred years has always been his goal. \" -Joan Vincent, Sr. V.R, Patient Care Services and Chief Nursing Officer Mr. Sloan's strong work ethic and down-to-earth attitude were shaped by an Indiana boyhood filled with chores, blue-collar jobs, family and faith. It was while working his way through Olivet Nazarene College as an emergency room orderly that he first heard of \"hospital administration.\" After four years of distinguished service as a captain in the U.S. Army, including the command of a communications intercept detachment on the Thai/Cambodian border during the Vietnam War, he earned aTop: Mr. Sloan with DCHA President, Robert A.

Middle: Mr. Sioan with Everitt family and health care team, 2010 Bottom: Sibley celebrates 100 years, 1990 graduate degree from The George Washington University and began his career in hospital administration. His character reflects his small-town roots. He's famous for shaking hands, giving hugs, remembering names and taking a sincere interest in how things are going at home. Nurse Rosemary Trejo remembers the day he did rounds and happened into a room where she was caring for a patient. \"The patient in the other bed needed a bed pan. Mr. Sloan went and got one and helped the patient. Looking ahead, Ted Miller, chairman of the Board of Trustees, predicts, \"All the great qualities and culture he brought to this hospital are things that no one will compromise on after he's gone. They will continue no matter who sits in his chair. He leaves a big legacy.\" Bob Sloan plans to retire on July 5, 2012, after more than 27 years as Sibley's president and CEO.

Improving care for seniors is a real and growing need. About 50 percent of America's hospitalized patients are age 65 or older, with numbers rising each year. Sibley's average patient age is 77. In response, Sibley and Suburban Hospitals, both part of the Johns Hopkins Health System, participate in the NICHE program (Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystem Elders). \"NICHE can make a dramatic difference in how we view older patients,\" notes Sibley's associate chief nursingin the hospital and successful return \"Our goal is to restore older adults to the level of independence they had before getting sick. We care for them the way we would care for our own aging parents. \" --Susan Ohnmacht, Associate Chief Nursing Officer & Director of Critical Care officer, Susan Ohnmacht. \"If someone is confused, it may not be due to aging, but rather to underlying causes such as infection, dehydration or poor nutrition.\" Dianne McCarthy, Sibley's director of rehabilitation, says the intensive training and improvements the program requires \"show Sibley's commitment to using the most up-to-date tools and proven practices to raise the standard of care.\" R4I SIBLEY MEMORIAL HOSPITALFor seniors and their families, a hospital stay can be filled with questions and concerns. Here are some answers about how Sibley's new NICHE program is improving care, safety and outcomes for older adults. Q. What practical changes are being made? A. White straws are replaced with red-striped ones; telephones have large, illuminated buttons and numbers; menus use large type; contrasting paint colors differentiate walls, floors, bathrooms and hallways; picture boards help patients who can't communicate verbally and \"pocket talkers\" amplify sound for hearing-impair6d older adults. Q, Who's on the team? A. Nurses, physical and occupational therapists, physicians, dieticians and pharmacists collaborate to create individualized treatment plans that support each patient's physical, emotional and psychological well-being. Therapists advise nurses on the safest way to get patients up and moving without risk of falling, while pharmacists recognize that older adults metabolize medications differently. Nutritionists consider food choices and presentation that will be more appealing. Q. How does the rehabilitation team prepare seniors for a more successful return home? A, Sibley's certified geriatric physical therapists specialize in neurological changes that affect older adults balance and gait. Hospital gyms include a car, bathtub, stairs and other equipment, so patients and family members can train and practice safely accomplishing daily activities. Therapists also advise families on which equipment to buy, safety changes to make at home as well as outpatient rehabilitation and home health care options that help promote independent living. Carolyn Craig, PT, with palienl\"Sibley has made a real commitment to providing the tools and training we need to improve safety, increase comfort and maintain dignity for our seniors. \" --Dianne McCarthy,, Director of Rehabilitation Q. What special training does Sibley's staff receive,~ A. Caregivers experience challenges first-hand through eyeglasses that simulate cataracts, loss of visual fields and depth perception. To feel the limitations of arthritis and decreased sensation, staff wear gloves and then try to pour pills from medicine containers. How does it feel to suddenly trust equipment or caregivers to help you make every move? Stafffind out by using walkers and wheelchairs while wearing glasses that decrease visual acuity.

Selassie Chief, Certificate of Need Division State Health Planning and Development Agency District of Columbia Department of Health 899 North Capitol Street, NE Washington, DC 20002York Cancer Center August 21, 2012 Dear Mr. Selassie, WelISpan Health is excited about the opportunity to expand our Affiliation Agreement with Johns Hopkins and to provide our patients and clinicians with enhanced clinical services and translational research through the development of an Academic Proton Therapy Center by Johns Hopkins Medicine, on the campus of Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, DC. I am writing to express my support for this project. WellSpan is committed to the provision of patient centered, oncologic care using a multidisciplinary approach that includes surgical oncology, medical oncology and radiation oncology collaborations in clinical care and clinical trials research. Within the WellSpan Health System, we manage over 2,400 new cancer cases annually at our York Hospital, Gettysburg Hospital, and Cherry Tree Cancer Center campuses. Our providers diagnose and treat adult cancer patients across the spectrum of solid tumor disease sites with our highest volume of cancer cases being Breast, Lung, Prostate, and Gastrointestinal cancers. WellSpan and Johns Hopkins have an established Affiliation Agreement in Oncology. This Affiliation Agreement provides collaborations in clinical care, research and education. Our clinical care collaborations include jointly developed care management systems, such as the Johns Hopkins Hospital second opinion program for the diagnosis, treatment planning, and pathology services for York Hospital's cancer patients. Johns Hopkins Hospital is also established as a referral and transfer site of patients in need of tertiary/quaternary oncology care. Through our Affiliation, York Hospital is able to accrue and manage patients on Johns Hopkins initiated clinical trials, and our programs collaborate in continuing medical education for clinical providers and in community education through various outreach programs. With an established collaboration already in place, we are enthusiastic about broadening our Affiliation Agreement to include a partnership in Proton Therapy at Sibley Memorial Hospital. This will provide a significant opportunity for our patients, our clinicians, and our community to participate in enhanced cancer services and clinical research. The development of a Proton Therapy Center in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Region would be highly beneficial to our patients and an Academic Proton Center such as the one proposed by Johns Hopkins at Sibley would be ideal. The development of a proton center by Johns Hopkins would provide the following benefits to our cancer population: \u00afThe JHM Proton Center will provide a more convenient alternative for daily proton therapy services and will help our patients maintain their normal home and family support structure. \u00afJohns Hopkins has been a long standing leader in the provision of world class care to the oncology community while developing innovative cancer research and providin8 contemporary Affiliated with the Sidney Kimmei Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkinscancer education to future leaders in oncolosy. This project will make participation in innovative research protocols more accessible for our patients. The JHM Proton \u00a3enter offers the opportunity for WellSpan and Johns Hopkins to expand their collaboration to include the clinical care and the study of proton therapy for oncolol~y patients. WellSpan Health supports the development of the Johns Hopkins Academic Proton Therapy Center at Sibley because it will improve access for our patients to this powerful technolol~y, it will allow our clinicians to work with Hopkins to develop new personalized cancer therapies for our patients, and it provides the opportunity to build upon our long standing Affiliation and collaborate with our new partner, Sibley Memorial Hospital.
