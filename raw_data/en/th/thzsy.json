The Council has taken the following steps (1) to adopt a 5 year MTFP moving forward rather than a 1 year or 3 year model (2) to adopt a system of monthly financial reporting to DMT's, CMT, and Cabinet and Quarterly to Full Council, with monthly consideration of directorate level financial issues at each Scrutiny Committee. In addition the Council has introduced a system of detailed monitoring of they delivery of savings targets so that a view is published monthly in Cabinet reports. The Council also holds an annual review of fees and charges and has annual and ongoing programmes of work to identify and understand potential savings opportunities. The governance system of the Council - as unpacked in the Annual Governance Statement comprise a rigorous system of financial control. In acknowledgement of budget pressures and the choices that lie ahead on a successive basis to balance future budget shortfalls the Council has launched a Budget Consultation process to inform difficult budget choices moving forward. These are rehearsed in the panel to the left and include all aspects of the rigorous reporting framework that is described from directorate DMT's through to the monthly report at Scrutiny Committees of financial expenditure and attainment of savings taken into the budget.4 520 3 412 AThe Council is developing a multi year savings programme to deal with future challenges to inform the MTFP that will be reported to Full Council in Feb 2022David Northey/Paul LoobyBrendan Arnold 2 SCYPF2 ORR (OCYPF1) IRR COVID-19Children's Social CareFailure to meet statutory duties due to growing volume and complexity of demand for children's social care services 'Hidden harm' consequences of infection control measures and safe systems of work limitations add to existing pressures on service.

The Plymouth Standards Partnership Recovery & Improvement Plan: A key priority is work to support disadvantaged pupils. The work of the Plymouth Commission has been extended to focus on attainment for secondary aged pupils and school improvement. This has also focussed on the impact of the COVID-19 response arrangements, and a survey of all secondary schools has been undertaken to inform priorities for re-engaging pupils in September. Schools are expected to have the capacity to offer immediate remote education for classes or groups who are required to self-isolate for a short period of time, or where there are local restrictions requiring pupils to remain at home. Schools are being offered a catch up premium of \u00a380 per pupils for most schools, to assist with programmes of learning to support pupils who require additional support. At this time, it is intended that subject to some adjustments to content and activity, in the summer 2021 for GCSE, AS and A level are all teacher assessed.Ming Zhang Alison Botham Economic Developm ent 5 STS2 COVID-19 IRR ORROffice of the Director of Public HealthOngoing COVID-19 rates (with potential for further peaks) affect city's recovery / reset plans.

We are focussing, through Resurgam, on 6 areas to help our economy to recover, to protect local jobs and to support our communities. These are: Spend 4 Plymouth - A massive focus on local procurement for local jobs. Build 4 Plymouth - An ambitious capital programme and economic stimulus to support construction jobs, building a better and greener Plymouth. Skills 4 Plymouth - Extensive new support for young people and retraining our workforce for future jobs through our skills launch pad. City Centre Renaissance programme - support for our city centre and a regeneration plan. Resurgam Beacons - A focus on our future. We will seek to create new jobs in the Blue and green economy. That is our amazing marine sector and a new green deal for jobs. Sector Action Plans - a bespoke package of interventions lead by the private sector for our 11 key sectors, building on our Resurgam plans and innovating and collaborating together though our newly established Sector Hub. Supporting our sectors whether they are in critical shock, stable, or capable of high growth. These sectors are: o Construction and The Built Environment Ruth HarrellDavid Draffan 4 Insufficient economic performance to sustain the City's economy and growth plans. The risk to economic performance is a combination of the ongoing impacts of the coronavirus, Brexit, labour shortages, infrastructure challenges relating to material supply and general uncertainty in many sectors. Some of the long-term effects (especially without effective policy instruments) are likely to carry over in 2022 and beyond. Risk Category: DEVELOPMENT & REGENERATIONA cross department team remains mobilised harnessing the resources across the city to recover from economic shock. This is underpinned by evidence and partnership working This plan (Resurgam) is builds on existing projects alongside new initiatives. We are also harnessing national and regional support, so we can minimising impact and recovering quicker. The Resurgam approach is to build on the bedrock sectors (Health, Manufacturing, Defence and Tech/Digital ) support the sectors in critical shock to adapt and change (retail hospitality and leisure). Solutions need to think about people as well as places and how they are interlinked to have most impact. Future projects are still emerging but include flagships/pillars around Skills - includes careers advice and guidance, building Plymouth. Skills Launchpad Plymouth officially launched in Sept 2021. Marine and defence - includes future oceans institute Inclusive Growth and Spend for Plymouth - includes revised approach to procurement, harnessing the voluntary and community groups, social investment Sector plans 4 4 16 4 4 6 Failure to reduce Health Inequalities will mean our poorest residents continue to live shorter lives as well as more years in ill health. Mounting evidence that COVID-19 is having differential health impacts across communities, adding to existing health inequalities. This is through either the disease itself or the mitigations put in place. There is an ongoing impact of this due to the economic downturn. The primary role of the ODPH and the Public Health Team in particular is now to try to manage COVID-19 in the city therefore protecting most deprived communities from further negative impacts. Risk Category: COMPLIANCE, REGULATION & SAFEGUARDINGThe Thrive Plymouth framework was adopted by full Council in 2014 and links directly to the Plymouth Plan and Integrated Commissioning Strategies. It provides a good foundation to achieve prevention in all services and decision making processes. The focus of Thrive Plymouth in year one was on workplace health and wellbeing, in year two it was on schools and young people, in year three it was on localising the national 'One You' health improvement campaign. In year four was on mental wellbeing (focussing on the five ways to wellbeing) and in year five was on people connecting through food. The current year six focus is arts, culture, heritage and health and is using the Mayflower 400 commemorations as the vehicle for delivery. This was launched on 29 November 2019. It was intended that the focus of year seven (starting in November 2020) would be trauma informed. However the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic meant that the Public Health Team did not have the capacity to develop and deliver year seven as originally planned. However recruitment to vacant posts has meant that planning for the re-boot of the Thrive Plymouth Programme has now begun with Year Seven likely to focus on trauma informed. In addition to the Thrive Plymouth-related work, the Public Health Team has worked with an extensive network of internal and external partners to secure the opening of a number of Wellbeing Hubs across the city.4 4SED1 COVID-19 BREXIT Sarah Lees / Rob NelderSTS1 IRR COVID-19Office of the Director of Public HealthAAnthony Payne 16 4 416 APersistent action across the Council is required at many levels to tackle inequalities by addressing the wider detriments of health. The public health team and partners continue to work with employers (year one focus) and schools (year two focus) to influence healthier lifestyles. The team continues to embed and promote the national One You campaign across the city. The 'five ways to wellbeing' has been adopted across the City as the single approach to improving mental wellbeing. The work that started in year five on 'people connecting through food' is ongoing with a number of new initiatives developed. The focus on arts, culture, heritage and health (using the Mayflower 400 commemorations) continued throughout 2020 and 2021. The Thrive Plymouth Network will re-start and continue to meet on a quarterly basis to ensure delivery of the programme. Discussions are ongoing about Year Seven of the Programme which is likely to focus on Trauma Informed. Evidence has been provided to the Health and Wellbeing Board on the risk of widening health inequalities and partners are working together to try to mitigate. The local Care Partnership priorities are being refreshed and includes tackling inequalities. Both of these routes bring partners together to understand the issues and the steps needed to tackle health inequalities in the City. In addition to this, to support the work of the Council's cross-party Child Poverty Working Group, a high level review of the evidence of the impacts of the pandemic on the mental wellbeing of children and young people has been carried out. As already stated, the primary role of the ODPH and the Public Health Team in particular is now to minimise the impact of COVID-19 in the city therefore protecting most deprived communities from further negative impacts.OFFICIAL # OFFICIAL APPENDIX B PLYMOUTH CITY COUNCIL STRATEGIC RISK REGISTER OCTOBER 2021 ROW NO RISK REF DEPTDESCRIPTION OF RISK (Risk description should include cause / risk event / consequence and risk category)Policies and procedures Link to business plan Delegations of authority / Fraud checks Risk and control framework Performance Management Project Management reviewsRAG RATING /CHANG E IN RISK RATINGACTION PLAN / FUTURE MITIGATION / ASSURANCE PLANRESPONSIBLE OFFICER(S) DIRECTOR / ASSISTANT DIRECTOR P I P I CURRENT RESIDUAL RISK RATINGPREVIOUS RESIDUAL RISK RATING First Line of Defence (Operational management activity) Jun-21 Oct-21 10 SHR2 COVID-19 HSWCustomer & Corporate HRODThe Council not meeting its legal obligations regarding the health, safety and wellbeing of its workforce.

Trading standards impacts may be significant when full border operations commence - now delayed until January with sanctions to be applied until July. EU Settlement Scheme closed to new applicants in July predicted labour market shortage is now starting to show and are acute in some sectors including health and social care. No new business failures recorded locally since August may be difficult to disaggregate the impact of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement from COVID-19 impact. Ferry services have recommenced no operational problems arising from phase 1 and 2 of the Border Operating Model delivery of BCP delayed until November but ferry services will be suspended from October until March. Macro economic affects now starting to ramp up inflationary pressure are rising e.g. wage increases fuel to labour market supply problems and supply shortages leading to prices rises especially on fuel which feeds wider price increases, likely the MPC will react with interest rate increases and could also impact on currency rates. Unilateral UK changes in regulations could add additional unfunded burdens to LAs of radically impact on service delivery e.g. planning reforms. Risk Category: FINANCIALBrexit Organisational and City specific risk registers linked to corporate risk registers are no longer being updated. Economic and consequential finical risks impacts may be traced back to Brexit but there is limited political will to do so and they are largely now viewed simply as the new economic reality. As such they are probably best dealt with through mainstream council financial risk management. One exception sis in relation to labour market shortages which are likely to have direct impact on Council finances in staff recruitment and associated wage pressures especially in health and social care and indirect impact through potential business relocation where labour requirements cannot be met locally. Operational readiness needs to be maintained in relation to the evolving UK post brexit regulatory framework and in particular in relation to the border control issues that are likely to arise when the Uk finally implements the proposed border control model as this is likely to create a new set of supply chain related issues as well as an increased administrative burden at our port. 4 312 4 312 AContinued regional engagement to maintain strong influence.

Plymouth City Council declared a climate emergency in March 2019. The Plymouth Plan was revised in January 2021 to update the strategic objectives and policies to achieve this outcome. The corporate plan, when next revised, will do likewise. The activities of Plymouth City Council only contribute 1% of the total carbon emissions of the city. The environmental consequences of failing to meet the target are difficult to quantify, but a failure to address and minimise our carbon emissions would contribute to some extent to changes in our climate, which include, among others, increased risk of coastal flooding and changes to the weather patterns. Changes to the weather could in turn have financial consequences for the Council as we mitigate against increased flooding, and more frequent storms. Failure to meet corporate targets would impact our reputation and our ability to exercise leadership on this agenda, with, in turn, possibly more consequences on carbon emissions citywide.A governance structure is in place to ensure that the city and council climate emergency objectives are led, managed and delivered. Led by the Cabinet member for Environment and Street Services, all key decisions are made by Cabinet and Full Council. The Strategic Director for Place leads the Climate Emergency Board with oversight of the corporate objectives. Management and deliverables are led by the service director for strategic planning and infrastructure. Progress updates on the delivery of the plans are provided 6 monthly. Interim policies and performance monitoring arrangements are in place whilst we tackle the complex task of developing a methodology that will enable us to accurately measure and monitor carbon emissions. In future, the methodology being developed will help to identify any potential risks to achieving the target\" There are 3 key plans in place to deliver objectives. * The Plymouth Plan specifically Policy GRO7 \"Reducing carbon emissions and adapting to climate change\", Climate Emergency Action Plan(s) Year 1 and Year 2 (CEAP), Corporate Carbon Reduction Plan(s) Year 1 and Year 2 (CCRP)3 412 3 412 A Year 1 action plans have been completed for both CEAP and CCRP.

Whilst the Government have stated that Local Authorities will not bear the cost of the changes the implications for Plymouth specifically are significant with likely changes to collection frequencies; plant, vehicle and machinery requirements; a weekly food waste collection and likely impacts upon existing waste disposal contracts including the Energy from Waste PFI contract. Waste policies and strategy will need to be reviewed to ensure compliance and alongside working with residents, communities and businesses to help manage any changes. A key requirement will also be understanding any resulting waste infrastructure requirements and where possible including appropriate provisions alongside evidence as part of the next iteration of the Plymouth and South West Devon Joint Local Plan scheduled for mid 2022. The Government are required to set out Statutory Instruments detailing the Environmental Bill requirements by Autumn 2022 with an indicative timescale for implementation of requirements by 2023/24.
