I am so excited to be doing this series of interviews and what I'll be doing is, is asking all kinds of healthcare practitioners, doctors, healers of all types, to really share with all of you their experience, why they became healers, what called them what they think about this being a healer thing. Is it, a thing? Who's really healing in this, what they've experienced from their their interaction with clients and patients and what the takeaways and understanding of what the process of healing is all about and the process of life. So that's the essence of what I'm doing. I'm hoping that this will serve also for patients that have issues and are looking for different ways of approaching it. * De-Registered, revoked & retired after 30+ years of practice.

For the transcript and full story go to: https://www.drmanonbolliger.com/Annelise-Piers Highlights from today's episode include: Annelise Piers Yin, it somehow, it's a more passive practice, you hold a pose for about three minutes, sometimes five, but the good news is most of the poses are on the mat. So, it's not like you're standing up in the air you know engaging muscle that is not yin. Yin is focused on the deeper connective tissues. Annelise Piers What I like about a yin breath is that we're not forcing, we're not controlling, we're not counting, holding, none of the above. Yin is about allowing, it's about accepting. Annelise Piers So, you show up on your mat, your mat can be your chair, your mat can be you standing in the supermarket line. And just start with your breath. Even if you're just exhaling longer, if that's the biggest hack, I can give anybody.

For the transcript and full story go to: https://www.drmanonbolliger.com/kristen-blythe Highlights from today's episode include: Kristen Blythe And, you know, I had gone through all this really deep, intense work on my personal experience. And then when I started reflecting back on it, I realized that I wasn't the first in my ancestral lineage. I was the third generation that had experience this type of trauma. Kristen Blythe And this ancestral blueprint is an energetic template that anchors in all the patterning the programming, both ancestral blessings and ancestral burdens, which would be ancestral trauma, ancestral patterning programs, limiting beliefs, things like that, into our experience. Kristen Blythe So, you have to understand what exists, where it came from, how it's affecting you and how you want to change it, and then you give permission and that can be applied to so many different healing modalities. ABOUT KRISTEN BLYTHE: Kristen Blythe, founder of Rooted Wisdom Holistic Life Coaching, is an ancestral healing coach, intuitive energy healer, and mentor for healing professionals with over 20 years of experience in the field. She has a BA in History, is certified as a Life Coach, Reiki Master Teacher, Meditation Instructor, and has training in over a dozen healing modalities from around the world. Additionally, she has certifications in Integrative Somatic Trauma Therapy and Applied Polyvagal Theory in Therapeutic Yoga. Her career in the intuitive energy healing arts began as an in-person private practice healer and teacher. During this time she trained students from around the world in all Reiki levels, from Level I to Master Teacher level. In 2022 she formed a coaching business and transitioned to an online format with a focus on teaching clients and students to access their own inner wisdom and become their own most powerful healer. Kristen is a teacher for popular meditation apps InsightTimer and Aura, and her work has been published in Elephant Journal and The Mindful Word. Kristen's intuitive abilities have been her best guide in life and professionally. With the support of her spirit guides and intuition, she has successfully healed from PTSD and childhood trauma using the same techniques that she now uses with clients. She guides clients forward using meditative visualization, ancestral blueprint work, somatic parts work, limiting belief template work, energy healing, and intuitive insights. Her passion is guiding clients and students to their own inner wisdom to help them overcome limiting ancestral patterns and traumas that hold them back from a joyful, uplifting, and purposeful life. Core purpose/passion: My mission is empowering other people in their own healing journey and teaching them that they have all of the wisdom they need inside of themselves, and they are completely capable of healing when given the right tools and support. My passion is ancestral energy healing and helping individuals recognize the ancestral traumas, patterns, and limitations that show up in their lives that have been passed down through their lineage. Healing generational trauma and patterns is bigger than each individual doing the work. Ancestral healing positively impacts future generations, past generations, and truly all of humanity when we each work to overcome the ancestral burdens that we carry within ourselves.
