However, there isevidence that certain forms ofmeditation, such ascompassion training ormetta meditation (also referred toasloving-kindness meditation, which consists ofcultivat- ingattitudes such asfriendliness, gratitude, and benevolence towards others) themselves change people's behavior and motivation towards being more pro-social [44].

Three participants chose todoso.Allinterviewees were asked what their initial motivation formeditation practice was, and theanalysis below ismainly based on their responses tothisquestion. Major changes intheparticipants' meditation practice became atopic inmany interviews. Descriptions ofthereasons forthese were also included inthepres- entstudy. Some subjects hadexperiences with other forms ofmeditation before coming to Anthroposophy. Responses that were notrelated toAnthroposophic practice were included as well, since they might give anindication ofwhat kinds ofmotivations arerepresentative of people who become attracted toAnthroposophic meditation. Additional questions were asked about anypositive, negative, surprising orunexpected effects that thepractitioners hadexperi- enced, buttheresponses were only taken into analysis insofar asthey were deemed relevant tothequestion ofwhat motivated their practice.

The divergence were inpart due toexplanations theparticipants made oftheir own motivational shifts and inpart dueto when taking thebiographical development ofthepar- ticipants asitwasevidenced bytheinterviews into consideration.

In particular, thedistinction between internal and external motivations may becounterintuitive, since some (such as\u00aasuggestion byothers\u00ba).

The distinction between external and internal motivations drawn here based onthequalitative analysis issimilar tothetheoretical idea ofextrinsic and intrinsic motivation [51], and autonomous acts Aninternally motivated meditator ismore autonomous than someone who ismotivated externally. How- ever, external motivations canbecome internal, and certain motivations that seem internal can bedifferent forms ofintrojected motivations. Forexample, iscapable ofgiving reasons forthese norms. Whether someone really identifies with these reasons isanother question, and such anidentifi- cation i.e.introjected.

Again, care hasbeen taken nottospeculate about whether ofintro- jected duties While themes arenotmutually external and internal forms ofgenerally motivations are,although combinations possible. Itcanbenoted that meditation, participants ofthisstudy arelikely toknow oratleast know ofeach other because We expect more publications tocome from thisstudy and numbers areused, it could potentially bepossible toidentify participants bycoordinating numbers and quotations. 3.1External External motivations matters asneeds and longings that arenotclearly articu- lated asaspecific aim. External motivations also include duties that theparticipants donot identify with strongly, natural dispositions, and interests that theparticipants have notcon- sciously reflected about impose themselves onthesubject, though notnecessarily ina very forceful way. This isinneed ofsome clarification. Themes such as\u00aaduty\u00ba, orexpressible bythesubject that makes sense oftheaction. Such a framework potentially butrather something that oneisborn with orwhich simply presents itself (asa result ofcultural condition would make asan internal motivation. 3.1.1 Duty.

Pepping etal.found that some people that they started tomeditate because itwasrecommended tothem bysomeone else[33]. One such case wasfound among theAnthroposophic ofpractitioners investigated here. One subject reported longing tocome toaspace beyond thinking, oraplace reflected spontaneous, orsimply amatter ofcuriosity.

This cancreate adiscrepancy between what meditators learn about from external sources and what they areable toexperi- ence forthemselves. myself, and motivations concern what could becalled atension between faith and knowledge, of accepting orrejecting something based onwhether onehasseen orinvestigated matters for oneself. There isasense ofautonomy connected experiencing things foroneself andthe idea that oneshould follow acertain scientific procedure before committing toabelief. Itis worth mentioning that Steiner claimed that Anthroposophy exactly because italigns itself with ascientific attitude. Onseveral occasions subjects reported realiza- tion, that endeavor, ontheother, isoneofthemost central topics oftheinterviews. Subjects gave different accounts ofhow they dealt with it,and that thepractices work, normuch interest intreating that asa problematic issue that needs tobediscussed. Attimes they meet rejection from that very same community, sometimes they struggle togain recognition, orfind ways tojustify continued practice without aslight variation ofthis theme isacase where meditation ismotivated bydeveloping anotion ofscientific confirmation of spiritual beliefs. 3.2.2 Spiritual experience. Two subjects described that they wanted toreconnect toa spiritual experience orreligious sentiment from earlier intheir an account strong spiritual restraining and detaching emotions tobeing outinthecountry side, which then ledtoanintensified perception ofnature and other human beings, aform of perception that wastinged with animpression ofstarting tolearn something thesense that Icould empathize really intensely with things and phenomena and people, and that iswhy itissorich.\u00ba The state lasted forthree months, slowly dissipating.

Itcanalso be about aspiritual connection more generally. sense that meditation hassomething todowith who youaretoaclear intention of fully revealing what through meditation.

This isaclear example ofsomeone who seeks to establish that doing thepractice and within Anthroposophy, and cannot begiven anin-depth treatment here. Often initiation rituals have todowith atran- sition from childhood into adulthood [62]. Central issues aretransition and death, butalso gaining exclusive knowledge [63]. AsEliade describes it,someone who hasgone through an initiation is\u00aaendowed with atotally different being from that which hepossessed before his initiation; hehasbecometxnicer [64]. Eliade also states how thetribe came tobe,and indifferent ways identify with thespiritual beings that responsible forit.Additionally, Eliade states that ofapproaching thegate ofdeath [66] and consciously going through what [4].This leads tothebirth thespiritual origin etc.This isanissue that would require further elabo- point here issimply that themotivation Self-improvement. Three subjects either implicitly orexplicitly stated that they were motivated byimproving themselves, inthesense ofdeveloping their character and spiri- tual equanimity.

She made lists ofvirtues, without knowing, assheunderlines, anything about themonastic ofspecific virtues often understood tobedirectly connected tomeditative develop- ment, such asinBuddhist doctrine [68,69] and also inAnthroposophy [5].One could even argue that meditation inherently isabout developing virtues such asequanimity.

Aspiritual disposition could indeed be understood asadisposition Certainly, ifweunderstand spirituality tomean a sense ofconnection tothewhole outofwhich separate existence arises, then service could be understood asaway ofembodying ormanifesting spirituality. Again, there isoneclear overarching trajectory ofdevelopment that goes from external motivation, through internal, toamotivation ofservice. The subjects often oneneeds meditation orthat onehasaneed upan isestablished, themotivation canshift towards being about either realizing Anthroposophy, practically applying one's capacities, orservice totheworld and humanity such aswhen meditation aburden, but such aspects willhave tobetreated onanother occasion. Though external factors may bean important part oftheinitial motivation formeditation, thetendency isthat themotivation is meditation istheonly actthat really isfree within human life[72,73]. Hence there isatension here between how the actofmeditation issometimes initially approached and how itwasoriginally conceived. Fur- thermore, participants ofthisstudy have were extracted based onthedata and were organized within anoverarching framework consisting ofexternal, internal, and service motivations. Certain motivations seem tobespecific to Anthroposophy, especially when compared tomindfulness meditation. However, allforms of motivation identified byShapiro canalso thermore, there themotivation forAnthroposophic practice gradually spiritual, butinways that cannot befully accounted forbytheSR-SE-SL trajec- tory identified byShapiro. main reason tation understanding beginning.

In contrast, reasons such asdisposition, duty, suggestion from others, and curiosity donotfit neatly anywhere, though thetheme ofneed and discussed inPepping etal.2016 [33] mostly concern SR,which makes further comparisons with that study difficult.
