[Hide Full Content](#thirty-thousand-forty-one) [NCAHF Position Paper on Colonic Irrigation](https://quackwatch.org/ncahf/pp/colonic/) Colonic irrigation (CI) is a procedure in which very large quantities of liquids are infused into the colon via the rectum through a tube, a few pints at a time, in an effort to wash away and remove its contents. CI differs from an ordinary enema which involves infusing a lesser amount of liquid into the rectum only. A \"high colonic\" may involve the use of twenty or more gallons pumped by a machine or transmitted with an apparatus that relies upon gravity to achieve its purpose. Liquids used in colonics may include coffee, herbs, enzymes, wheat grass extract, or many other substances. Proponents of the procedure advertise that \"all disease and death begin in the colon,\" that colonics \"detoxifies\" the body, and that ... Colonic irrigation (CI) is a procedure in which very large quantities of liquids are infused into the colon via the rectum through a tube, a few pints at a time, in an effort to wash away and remove its contents. CI differs from an ordinary enema which involves infusing a lesser amount of liquid into the rectum only. A \"high colonic\" may involve the use of twenty or more gallons pumped by a machine or transmitted with an apparatus that relies upon gravity to achieve its purpose. Liquids used in colonics may include coffee, herbs, enzymes, wheat grass extract, or many other substances. Proponents of the procedure advertise that \"all disease and death begin in the colon,\" that colonics \"detoxifies\" the body, and that regular \"cleansing\" is necessary to maintain one's health. None of these claims are true. The idea that all disease and death begin in the colon is one of the oldest health misconceptions known to humankind. The ancient Egyptians associated feces with decay, and decay with death. This caused them to write in ancient papyri that decay began in the anus. The Egyptians were obsessed with preserving corpses. Embalmers observed the putrification by bacteria (a normal process within the intestines after death) and followed the practice of removing the stomach and intestines as part of the embalming process. One of seven medical papyri and 81 of 900 prescriptions referred only to the anus. The connection between food and fecal matter was easily made. Worry about decay governed daily life. Herodotus noted that \"for 3 consecutive days in every month they purge themselves, pursuing after health by means of emetics and drenches; for they think that it is from the food they eat that all sicknesses come to men.\" Although the more than 700 items in the ancient Egyptian pharmacopoeia were worthless by modern standards, it did contain many items that could induce diarrhea (Majno, The Healing Hand, Harvard, 1975) In the 19th Century, the intestinal toxicity theory became popular. The idea was that poisons from putrifying intestinal bacteria entered the body through the gut wall. Constipation was to be avoided. Numerous remedies were advocated by the health gurus of the day. Yogurt was said to create a friendlier form of bacteria. Bran was advocated for \"roughage\" to speed up the elimination process. The folk saying \"an apple a day keeps the doctor away\" is rooted in the idea of increasing roughage. Hydropaths advocated drinking large amounts of water to wash out the alimentary canal from above. John Harvey Kellogg performed surgery to reshape the colon for more rapid elimination. The laxative industry grew prosperous on the idea of bowel \"regularity.\" Today we understand more clearly the importance of dietary fiber, hydration, and so forth. Medical scientists also know that these have nothing to do with intestinal toxicity. Early in this century a medical researcher produced all of the symptoms of constipation (dry mouth, lethargy, etc.) by packing the rectum with sterile cotton. Studies done in the 1920s found that \"high colonic irrigations\" were useless and did not reach very high even when fairly long tubes were employed (Snyder, Americal Journal Roentgenol & Radiation Therapy, 1927; 17:27-43). Studies in the 1930s found that colonic irrigation was contraindicated for treating ulcerative colitis, an intestinal disorder which did permit bacterial contamination of body through the gut wall. In 1985, the Infectious Disease Branch of the California Department of Health Services stated that \"neither physicians nor chiropractors should be performing colonic irrigations. We are not aware of any scientifically proven health benefit of this procedure, yet we are well aware of its hazards.\" (Kizer, 1985) Hazards include illness and death by contamination of colonics equipment (Istre, 1982); death by electrolyte depletion (Eisele, 1980), 1981). In addition to the physiological upsets, the colonic apparatus can perforate the intestinal wall leading to septicemia (bacterial contamination of the blood), a very serious disorder. Colonics is popular as a health fetish. The ideas of \"cleansing\" and \"detoxification\" have no physiological significance, but these do have emotional meaning to people who believe themselves to be \"unclean\" or \"impure\" in some way. Just as the ancient Egyptians did, health neurotics may temporarily relieve their health anxieties by colonics, laxatives, and purges. Colonics also has erotic appeal to some. A substantial amount of colonic product marketing is aimed at male homosexuals. Colonics is often done in massage parlors that serve erotic desires. Colonics can be a kind of \"Dr. Feelgood quackery\" (i.e., a procedure that elicits a feeling in a patient which is interpreted as beneficial). A 1991 survey by the Wisconsin Board of Physician Quality Assurance found that colonic irrigation is poorly regulated. Thirty state boards of medical examiners and six boards of osteopathic medicine responded to a mail survey. Only 11 of the 36 considered colonic irrigation to be \"the practice of medicine\" meaning that they could regulate its practice as such. The others either had no position or made vague comments. Examining boards may discipline those they license for unprofessional conduct, and/or file charges against nonlicensed people who engage in the activities defined by law as within their governance. Some boards do not do the latter. They expect justice departments to prosecute imposture as fraud. The lack of attention often provides a gap within which practices such as colonic irrigation can flourish. NCAHF agrees with the assessment of the California Department of Health Services. Colonics has no real health benefits, but does have a number of serious hazards. Consumers should not use colonics, and should avoid patronizing practitioners who employ this procedure. Practitioners who use colonics are either too ignorant or misguided to be entrusted with delivering health services.

[Eisner C. [Americans took Prevagen for years\u2014as the FDA questioned its safety](https://www.wired.com/story/prevagen-made-millions-fda-questioned-safety/). Wired, Oct 21, 2020] In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [warned](https://quackwatch.org/cases/fdawarning/prod/fda-warning-letters-about-products-2012/quincy/) Wisconsin-based Quincy Bioscience that: (a) although Prevagen was labeled as a dietary supplement, therapeutic claims made for it established it as an unapproved drug in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and (b) the synthetically produced apoaquorin protein in Prevagen is not a legal dietary supplement ingredient. Nevertheless, Qunicy Bioscience has continued to aggressively advertise Prevagen as containing a protein originally found in jellyfish that can improve memory. The company also says that the product is the \"best-selling branded memory supplement in chain drug stores across the United States.\" The new report states: - An estimated 3 million people have purchased Prevagen. - Sales reached $165 million by mid-2015. - A month's supply of \"extra strength\" Prevagen sells for about $60 at Walgreen's, CVS, and Walmart. - Multiple FDA inspections found significant issues with Quincy's manufacturing processes, complaint handling, and quality-control testing. - In 2018, the FDA determined that Quincy Bioscience had addressed the violations in the 2012 warning letter and no further enforcement action has been taken. - Commercials for Prevagen describe the product as \"safe and effective.\" - Over 4,000 Prevagen users have complained to the FDA that they experienced health problems such as seizures, strokes, heart arrhythmias, chest pain, and dizziness while using the product, but such complaints, though concerning, are insufficient to establish that Prevagen is unsafe. - Quincy Bioscience has been sued multiple times over allegations of false advertising for Prevagen. The company reached a class-action [settlement](http://www.quincybiosciencesettlement.com/media/3041311/v5_quc_notice_082020.pdf)without admitting any wrongdoing to resolve seven of these lawsuits. People who purchased Prevagen in the U.S. before July 21, 2020 could receive a refunds of up to $70 by filing a claim by October 26, 2020. - The Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney general are pursuing a lawsuit alleging that Prevagen's marketers relied on \"false and unsubstantiated claims\" about its health benefits. - Quincy Bioscience was able to obtain GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status for apoaquorin by making it an additive in its Neuroshake food product and having three scientists affirm the ingredient's safety. - A [2010 U.S. Government Accountability Office report](https://www.gao.gov/assets/310/300743.pdf)stated: \"FDA's oversight process does not help ensure the safety of all new GRAS determinations.\" \"Immune boosting\" discourse on Instagram analyzed.

If the Hatch-Richardson bill is passed, it will represent the greatest setback to consumer protection law since the 1906 Pure Food & Drug Act. Some segments of the media seem to be catching on to the fact that this legislation represents major destruction to consumer rights. We believe that the longer this debate lasts, the better chance there is that the propaganda efforts of the health food industry can be neutralized.

AAP TAKES POSITION ON ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has taken the position that it \"cannot recommend or support any therapies or treatments for pediatric patients that are not clearly supported by conventional scientific research.\" AAP Media Alert, 10/18/93 THE DECEPTIVE PLACEBO Researchers evaluated five treatment modalities that seemed to work under clinical conditions but whose effects disappeared under controlled clinical trials. Under uncontrolled conditions the procedures all elicited reports of about 70% improvement (40% excellent, 30% good). Physicians as well as patients were fooled by the apparent benefits. The authors dub these clinical illusions \"the power of nonspecific effects in healing.\" Such are generally dubbed placebo effects (ie, beneficial responses due to the ACT of treatment rather than the treatment itself). The term \"nonspecific effects\" is good because it corrects the misconception of a single mechanism at work in placebos. The most common misconception is that the patient must believe in the procedure for the placebo effect to occur. This is not true. Other factors such as operant conditioning (previous experience wit h healing acts), suggestibility, expectation, and many more may be operating. In fact, more than 30 variables are known to affect placebo responses. This well-conceived study supports the need for double-blind studies, and helps explain why some health professionals fall into quackery. (Roberts, et al. Clinical Psychology Review, 1993;13:375-91) Comment: Its not enough to say, \"Who cares if it is just placebo, so long as it works.\" The problem is that the treatment may not have worked at all, and we need to know the difference between perception and reality. The reality is that aside from placebo effects, people feel better due to natural cycles in symptoms or normal healing with the passage of time. In some instances, patients have not improved, but clinic-ians following the old adage \"seek and ye shall find whether its there or not\" have reported illusory improvements based upon their expectations. FTC CHARGES AIDS CURE The Federal Trade Commission has charged the promoters of Immuno-Plex, an algae-based food supplement, with false claims. Mary Redhead of Yelm, Washington and Thelma Magno of Portland, Oregon have been named as principals of a business called Earthbound. The product has been sold by mail mostly through ads in gay-oriented newspapers-a month's supply going for $195. (FTC News, 10/5/93) REPORTING ADVERSE REACTIONS TO PILLS AND DEVICES Medical Abstracts points out that it took less than 4 months for the FDA to withdraw temafloxacin from the market, but 4 years to withdraw the guar gum product Calban. Both produced adverse effects including death. The difference was the presence of a functional reporting system for prescription drugs versus the slowness of reporting of the adverse effects of the over-the-counter products. An FDA survey indicates that 50% of all doctors aren't aware that they should report adverse drug and medical device reactions to the FDA. The FDA has introduced a program called MedWatch that is designed to speed up and increase adverse-event reporting by doctors, pharmacists, nurses and other health providers. The simpler one-page report form replaces 5 other forms and uses a single address: 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787; 1-800-FDA- 0178. Since reporting is voluntary, consumers may have to insist that adverse reactions be reported by the provider to whom they complain. NIH OFFICE OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAKES GRANTS The NIH Office of Alternative Medicine has funded a number of projects that will look into unusual methods of healing. Included among the grants are some real eyebrow- raisers. For instance, Lawrence Kushi will study macrobiotics and cancer. Curiously, Michio Kushi, the investigator's father, is the primary proponent of macrobiotics. A New Mexico physician will investigate intercessory prayer; a New Jersey MD will try Qi Gong (mystical hand waving?) on reflex sympathetic dystrophy; and a California PhD will investigate homeopathy and health. The grants are being criticized for their use of limited public funding on projects of dubious scientific value while those within mainstream science are denied. In addition to the value to science debate, it is reported that Frank Wiewel and Ralph Moss, both of whom built their notoriety by promoting dubious cancer therapies, have attempted to get Barrie Cassileth, PhD, ousted from the NIH panel because she is a member of the American Cancer Society's national Committee on Questionable Methods of Cancer Management. They charge that the ACS committee's function is to debunk questionable cancer procedures. Cassileth retorts that Moss and Wiewel are \"true believers\" who are trying to \"purify the panel of those who do not blindly accept the value of a product or practice simply because it is termed 'alternative'.\" (The Chronicle of Higher Education, 9/15/93, pp.A32-3) UNSOUND THEORIES & CLAIMS OF CHELATION THERAPY Saul Green describes the history, theories, and evidence regarding chelation therapy (CT) for vascular disorders in Nutrition Forum (Sept-Oct). This useful article covers the dubious safety of CT (proponents play down its risks), and rebuts each of four mechanisms of action by promoters to explain how CT supposedly works. The results of past and status of current studies are also presented. Comment: CT is one of the remedies NCAHF is most often asked about by people considering the procedure as an option to standard care. Dr. Green's article provides the most useful review we have seen on this important topic. HOW WILL NIH/OAM CONTROL PATHOLOGICAL SCIENCE? Pathological science encompasses fraud, crankism, and the more subtle wishful science in which true-believers use science to \"prove\" what they already are certain is true. Wishful scientists gather proof like an attorney, piling up positive data for their case, and while discarding and impugning any data that do not fit the paradigm. Students of pathological science know that it is nearly impossible to catch a cheat or to find where true believers have distorted the data. The gold standard of science that ultimately uncovers pathological science is the failure of attempts to replicate the studies. The question that must be asked about the NIH grants is who will validate these studies by attempting to reproduce them? Will people with no ideological interest be willing to devote the time and effort to a dubious method that has alleged to have been proved of value by a true believer whose results are just what an outside observer would expect? Hopefully, there will be competent researchers willing to undertake such tasks, but the chances are slim since good researchers usually have a full agenda and are not inclined to do research in unfamiliar areas. Our fear is that the research will gain NIH's status and be used to promote quackery. SUSAN POWTER Susan Powter, a spectacle of a woman with a bleached crew-cut and manic activity level, is the latest exercise and health guru attracting media attention. Connie Chung featured Powter on Eye To Eye (10/18). Powter, who is known for her high amplification, mixes her messages to women about taking charge of their lives by doing something drastic about the man who is messing them up, exercising vigorously, and eating a high volume, very low-fat diet. Looking like Twiggy on steroids, she is a screeching dynamo in the style of the Juiceman. Powter makes her ignorance a virtue by proclaiming that she is not a doctor, nutritionist or dietitian and doesn't wanna-be. She spouts nutrition nonsense about food \"chemicals,\" advocates vegetarian extremism, and other nonsense. Available from NCAHF is The American Dietetic Association's review of Powter's Stop the Insanity program pointing out its positive and negative aspects. SASE +$1. SEN. HATCH GROWS BOLDER AS HE HAWKS HIS LEGISLATION Senator Orrin Hatch attempted to justify his legislation that would permit a largely unregulated marketplace for supplement hucksters on CBS Morning News on Oct 19. Hatch charged that the FDA wanted to prevent people from getting beneficial supplements, specifically, folic acid for neural tube defects and vitamin E for heart disease, plus, he alleged that his bill would help reduce national health care costs. This has no basis. A 1992 study of 10,758 Americans found no longevity benefit and questioned the cost-effectiveness of supplement taking [1]. His complaint that the FDA does not allow health claims for folic acid to prevent neural tube defects does not justify his bill that would create a snake-oil marketplace for supplements. Hatch's praise of vitamin E reflects recent vitamin-sellers hype, not the established value of vitamin E, and like other vitamin salespeople, he ignores its risks [2]. Incredibily, Hatch is huckstering for the very industry that government studies have revealed is a big part of the nation's multibillion dollar quackery problem. His self-interest is obvious and blatant. Not only does he have a personal financial interest in the industry, but now the health food industry is raising campaign funds for him [3]. Hatch may not realize that he is ingloriously writing himself into the history of quackery in America. [Citations:(1) Kim, et al. AJPH, 1993;83:546-50; (2) Roberts.

Customers had to first buy a cow at $2,500 and then pay up to $35 a bottle for its milk. Saunders reportedly injects a sample of a patient's blood into the cow's udder; and, theoretically, the cow forms antibodies which become part of its colostrum. This theory is said to have been tested by the Univ. of Minnesota in the 1950s with inconclusive results. Saunders defends his actions with familiar arguments; testimonials, his sincerity, and the hope it offers. (Minneapolis Star Tribune, 9/22/93) IMMUNOAUGMENTATIVE THERAPY EXPOSED Saul Green, PhD, has come up with another penetrating, insightful critique of so-called \"Immunoaugmentative Therapy\" (IAT) a dubious cancer treatment created by the late zoologist, Lawrence Burton, PhD, which Victor Herbert, MD, has described as neither \"immuno- augmentative\" nor \"therapy.\" Green details the history of its proponent's theory and how it came to be available in the Bahamas as a treatment. Burton's original work was disclaimed by his collaborator. The chemistry of IAT materials does not make sense, and some were found to have HIV contamination. The facts presented not only discredit IAT, but cast great doubt upon its underlying hypothesis that the immune system plays a major role in cancer's etiology. This article is a splendid piece that will take its place among classical refutations of pathological science and pseudo-medicine. (JAMA, 1993;270:1719-23) Dr. Green is a biochemist who did cancer research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for 23 years. He consults on scientific methodology and has a special interest in questionable medical procedures. Green is a member of the NCAHF Board of Directors. RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF SPINAL MANIPULATION The risk/benefit of spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) was analyzed on the basis of 140 case reports by researchers at the Department of Neuroscience, Division of Neurosurgery, University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria. Six risk factors (misdiagnosis, failure to recognize the onset or progression of neurological signs and symptoms, improper technique, SMT performed in the presence of contraindications, and manipulation of the cervical spine) are identified. The review notes that despite flawed designs, SMT demonstrates consistent value for acute low-back pain, and coupled with low risk, is acceptable as a treatment. However, the risk/benefit ratio was judged as unacceptably high for patients with nerve root symptoms or signs associated with prolapsed discs and neck pain. Potential complications and unknown benefits indicate that SMT should not be used for children. (Neurosurgery, 1993;33:73-79) CHEMICAL SENSITIVITIES Multiple chemical sensitivities has been proposed as a new disease in which the victim has adverse reactions when exposed to various substances under ordinary circumstances which do not affect the general population. The hypothesis has generated a cadre of fringe practitioners calling themselves clinical ecologists, a following of patients, and a genre of attorneys and expert witnesses who have managed to hit several industries for some large deep pocket lawsuits. The media's attention on the environment, the strident claims of environmental activists, and the general concern for the environment taught by schools, public broadcasting, and so forth, have created a psychosocial setting that plays to a kind of mass hysteria one might label environmental anxiety disorder. This is not meant to poke fun at sufferers whose symptoms are very real, and must be taken seriously. In a report titled \"Immuno-logic, psychological, and neuropsycho-logical factors in multiple chemical sensitivity,\" (Annals Intern Med, 1993;19: 97-103) researchers say that immunologic testing did not differentiate patients with chemical sensitivities from controls, but such patients did exhibit a higher prevalence of current anxiety or depressive disorder (44 v 15%). These disorders did not appear to precede the onset of chemical sensitivity, and 25% of patients showed no current psychological disturbance. 25% of cases (no controls) satisfied criteria for somatization disorder. Researchers conclude that psychological symptoms, though not causal, are a central component of chemical sensitivity. Comment: It is interesting that a substantial portion of sufferers do not exhibit psychological disorders. For some insight into what behavioral factors may be at work in such patients see \"Allergy-related quackery\" (NY State J Med, 1993; 93:100-04) which describes how the power of the imagination, operant conditioning, and practitioner influence can reinforce imaginary sensitivities. CORRECTION July-August, 1993 we reported that a lawsuit, filed by two UC Berkeley cultologists against the American Psychological Association and the American Sociological Association alleging that several top executives had attempted to destroy their careers through various improper actions, had been settled. We have learned that the case remains unsettled. PROSTATA Full-page ads that appear to have been torn out of a newspaper (page numbers \"D14\" and \"D15\" appear along with the date \"Thursday, April 22, 1993,\" but the top corner where the newspaper's name would appear is cut off) are hawking Prostata, a product that claims to prevent or treat prostate disorders and act as an aphrodisiac. The product contains zinc and pyridoxine; the herbs: serenoa (aka, saw palmetto and alanine and glutamic acid; bee pollen, and silica. Familiar names and faces dot the ad. \"Dr. KW Donsbach\" is quoted as reporting on a double-blind study. A mug shot of \"Dr.\" Earl Mindell appears. Also Dr. Hans Kugler (PhD[?]) who's been hawking anti- aging products for years in such publications as the Health Freedom News (ie, the \"hang on to your wallet\" news). Prostata, a product of Life Force, Inc, (Cheyenne, WY) is listed in the FDA's publication Unsub-stantiated Claims and Documented Health Hazards in the Dietary Supplement Marketplace, July, 1993, that \"demonstrates the pervasiveness of the problem posed by dietary supplements.\" *Diuretics can create an illusion of effectiveness by increasing urination frequency or irritation. CHIROS TREATING CHILDREN In July, 1993, Paul E. Brown, MD, did a phone survey of 100 chiropractic offices in the Minneapolis- St.Paul area. Posing as a parent with a 4-yr-old child with ear problems, he asked five questions to office personnel or available chiros: Do you treat children? (99% yes) Do you treat ear infections? (80% yes) Do you treat allergies? (69% yes) Do you sell vitamin supplements from your office? (78% yes) Do you do applied kinesiology (21% yes) Some chiros told him that the first cervical vertebra is often out of place and that this affects nerves and blood so that ear problems occur. Others said that dietary practices such as using cow's milk leads to excessive mucous which contributes to the problem.

The 12-page document provides information of substance for anyone desiring details on why the Hatch-Richardson legislation should be defeated. NYC CONSUMER AFFAIRS CHARGES DIET- PILL COMPANIES Acting Commissioner Richard Schrader announced on October 27 that the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs was charging seven diet-pill companies with \"telling fat lies in magazine and newspaper ads.\" Among the phone claims were: \"the power to block the absorption of calories and the guarantee of effortless weight loss even while continuing to consume a diet rich in fat and calories.\" Six of the seven ads were found in national women's magazines, one was in a supplement to the Daily News. The companies and products charged were: - Hanover Labs, Inc.

OF COLORADO BOARD OF REGENTS TO SCRUTINIZE THERAPEUTIC TOUCH The University of Colorado Board of Regents has announced that it will conduct an inquiry into the teaching of Therapeutic Touch (TT) by its School of Nursing. TT has been under public scrutiny by the Rocky Mountain Skeptics (RMS), a nonprofit group, for the past two years. RMS is concerned about the make-up of the board of inquiry because several TT proponents have been included on the board of inquiry. RMS fears that proponent's influence may dilute or stymie efforts to hold nursing education to a scientific standard in this matter. The board's findings could establish a landmark in the standards of quality assurance in health care. RMS failed to stop the acceptance of TT course work for continuing nursing education by the Colorado Board of Nursing in 1992, but succeeded in focusing public attention on this dubious practice.

In order to be taken seriously by the scam artists, Freeh said that the FBI would have to double its present number (249) of agents dedicated to health fraud. Sen.

RETURN OF A PANACEA - CAPSICUM PEPPERS An old-time remedy has reappeared\u2014capsicum peppers. Capsicum was first described by a physician who accompanied Columbus to the West Indies. Capsicum contains an irritating oleoresin, the major component of which is capsaicin (cap-say-sun), a very pungent phenolic chemical that tabasco peppers, paprika and others). Capsaicin is what makes pepper spray work as a self-defensive weapon. Capsaicin's flavor can be detected as low as 1 part in 11 million. Cayenne pepper has a rich history in folk medicine and quackery. Samuel Thomson, leader of the antiphysician movement of the early 1800s, used it liberally. Nature's Sunshine, a Utah-based multilevel marketing company that NCAHF has strongly criticized (see Jan-Feb, 1990 NCAHF Newsletter) began by selling capsules of cayenne pepper as panaceas. Cayenne is made to order for quackery. Research has shown that people who experience physiological responses from something they regard as medicine are dependent upon an interpretation by someone they regard as knowledgeable (Mechanic. New Engl J Med 1972;286:1132-40). Ingestion produces a feeling of warmth and fools the body into responding by perspiration and a watering of the eyes and nose. These responses can pass as relief of colds, allergies, arthritis, or other problems. The power of capsaicin can be felt again upon defecation making it seem useful for hemorrhoids and other lower GI or rectal problems. Topical applications produce an irritating effect which makes the substance useful as a counter-irritant. Compounds are marketed which can be put in socks to warm the feet in cold weather. Tyler warns that these must be handled with care lest one put their capsicum tainted hands on their eyes (Honest Herbal, 1993) Capsaicin is making its major reappearance as a salve. A number of salves 25% capsaicin. Another Arthur Itis, is being promoted as a \"medical miracle\" in newspaper advertising. Despite the fact that Arthur Itis also contains .025% capsaicin, it is selling for 2-6 times the amounts of its competitors. Capsaicin has the ability to reduce the flare response (redness) of histamine, and reduce pain by depleting substance P, a vasoactive compound involved in the transmission of pain from the periphery to the spinal cord (Lawrence Review of Natural Products, 7/93). Capsaicin-containing salves are approved by the FDA for pain relief. They are useful for shingles, trigeminal neuralgia, and stump pain following amputation. They will not alter the course of arthritis, but can help relieve its pain. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BOARDS OF PHARMACY PASSES RESOLUTION ON HOMEOPATHY On May 3, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) passed the following resolution at its annual meeting in Dallas, Texas: Whereas, there has been an increase in the number of homeopathic products manufactured by U.S. and foreign companies that are available to the American public; and Whereas, not all of these products are approved by the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States; and Whereas, NABP believes that homeopathic products should meet the efficacy standards as determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Homeopathic Pharmacopeial Convention of the United States; Therefore be it resolved that NABP urge state boards of pharmacy not to recognize as a standard of practice the use of those homeopathic products whic h have not been determined to be safe and effective by the FDA and the Homeopathic Pharmacopeial Convention of the United States. The NABP is a not-for-profit organization whose members represent 63 boards of pharmacy in the United States, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Britis h Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec, and the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales. The NABP's mission is to: (1) provide for the interstate transfer of pharmaceutical licensure in the U.S. based upon uniform educational and legislative standards; and (2) improve the standards of pharmaceutical education, licensure, and practice by cooperating with those state, national, and international agencies and associations holding similar objectives. Comment: The NABP has done what the British Pharmacy Conference was unable to do in 1992, namely, pass a resolution that put science and consumer protection above business considerations (see NCAHC Bulletin Board, July-August, 1994). Pharmacists occupy a difficult position between science-based professionalism and the open marketplace. A poll has shown that they are the health professionals most trusted by the public. NCAHF regards what they do as a bellwether of consumer health trends. WHY RPHS SHOULD NOT SELL HOMEOPATHIC REMEDIES Stephen Barrett, MD and pharmacognosist Varro Tyler, PhD teamed up to explain to pharmacists why they should no sell homeopathic remedies in the American Journal of Health System Pharmacists (1995;52:1004-6). They explain that the basis for inclusion of the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia is not scientific testing but \"homeopathic provings\" conducted during the late 1800s and early 1900s. ANTI-IMMUNIZATION GROUPS THREATEN PUBLIC HEALTH Health Watch Newsletter (May, 1995) says fears that anti-immunization campaigners could wreck attempts to eradicate, or at least minimize diseases, were highlighted recently at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Atlanta. Dr. Robert Chen of the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention said that immunization programs are victims of their own success. As a greater proportion of children are immunized, the risk of a disease goes down in relationship to the risks of side-effects of the vaccine. This can lead more and more people to avoid immunization relying upon the immunity of the herd (ie, if 80% of the susceptible population is immunized, the disease is not communicated) for protection. He cited the example of pertussis where the vaccine coverage dropped to the 30% level and the disease reappeared. Another problem is that the side-effects of immunization are hard to monitor. Thus, any problems that occur within a reasonable time of the immunization are likely to be blamed on the vaccine. [Ed. This is why the Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for injuries and deat h related to DTP, MMR and polio vaccines as a no-fault program in which injured parties need only show by \"preponderance of evidence\" that the injury was vaccine-related.] Anti-immunizers are more active in the UK than the USA at present because here they apparently consider it politically unwise to attack immunization during a time when increased attention is being given to \"alternative\" medicine. [HealthWatch is published by NCAHF's United Kingdom affiliate.] ATTITUDES OF CHIROPRACTORS ON IMMUNIZATION A survey of American chiropractors found that one-third agreed that \"there is no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease; that vaccinations cause more disease than they prevent; and, that contracting an infectious disease is safer than immunization. Most (81%) feel that immunization should be voluntary, and 46% support an official policy opposing the American Public Healt h Association's policy promoting immunization. [J Manipulat Physiolog Therapeut 1994;17:584-90] UK HOMEOPATHS ENDORSE IMMUNIZATION In 1990 the Council of the Faculty of Homeopathy wrote to the Dept of Health in the UK stating its support for conventional vaccination. Other homeopaths have made similar statements acknowledging that they have no evidence that homeopathic treatment produces satisfactory antibody levels. (The Lancet 1994;344:1168) Comment: It is curious that the most common reason for refusal of childhood vaccination given in a British Medical Asso Journal study (see NCAHF Newsletter Mar-Apr, 1995) was diversion by a homeopath. TEXAS AG TAKES ACTION AGAINST FORMULA ONE The Sept-Oct, 1994 NCAHF Newsletter reported the death of a Texas woman that was associated with use of Nature's Nutrition Formula One manufactured by Alliance USA of Richardson. It was reported that a legal technicality had prevented the Texas Department of Health (THD) from restricting the product despite its apparent dangers. At the time of this writing, the TDH still has not reached the end of its efforts to restrict the sales of products containing more than naturally occurring amounts of ephedrine. [150 members of Citizens For Health, a lobbying group for the health food industry, attended a TDH hearing on Ma Huang held 4/28/95 and signed a petition against TDH's proposal. CFH is led by Alexander Schauss, \"PhD\" (unaccredited).] The Texas Attorney General has taken its own action against Alliance USA and its supplier The Chemins Company of Denver, Colorado, as an unapproved drug and for misbranding, false advertising, and adulteration. The origin action was filed by the AG on 5/12/94. The adulteration charge was added on 1/1/95 after the AG's investigation uncovered the adulteration of Formula One with synthetic ephedrine hydrochloride and synthetic caffeine. Company employees gave sworn statements that they had been directed to conceal the fact that these substances were being added to the product. [Civil Action #3:94cv1002J] As part of the judgment the defendants must pay $400,000 to cover attorney's fees and investigative costs. The judgment requires the defendants to: 1) warn consumers that Formula One contains ephedrine which may pose a health risk to certain individuals with medical conditions; 2) notify the TDH within 10 days of any adverse reactions reported by consumers; 3) refrain from adulterating Formula One with synthetic ephedrine or caffeine; 4) notify all distributors that products manufactured before 6/1/94 have been recalled.

CHILDREN'S HEALTH THREATENED BY DUBIOUS FOOD ALLERGY \"TREATMENTS\" A serious condition in children, \"failure to thrive\" (FTT), can result from elimination diets used to treat food allergies that are both real or imagined. The authors of a report in the Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine (1994:148:1150-5) evaluated 700 children referred for food allergies. Eleven children, 4 to 33 months old, were found to have FTT. No cause other that caloric restriction was found. Most parents said their child was allergic to 5 to 10 foods (avg 8.4), yet skin puncture tests failed to detect allergies in seven, and double-blind. placebo-controlled food challenges wit h foods producing positive skin findings yielded responses in only two. The majority of parents who believed their child had a food allergy were apparently mistaken. Some families that persist in potentially harmful feeding practices may be affected by psychological factors that could be addressed by counseling. [Journal Watch 12/5/94, p.93] HEALTH FOODS INDUSTRY INFLUENCES NATUROPATHIC EDUCATION Bastyr University, a naturopathic college in Seattle has added several board members who are associated with the natural products industry. Included are Past President of the National Nutritional Foods Association Martie Whittekin, Sandy Gooch founder of Mrs. Gooch's Natural Foods Markets, Michael Murray, ND, Director of Research and Product Development at Enzymatic Therapy, and Jerry Schlesser, ND,DC, President and CEO of IsoChem Corporation. [Natural Health Advocate Winter, 1995 (a publication of Bastyr University as \"an update for the natural products industry.\")] Comment: The symbiotic relationship between naturopathic education and the health food industry (natural foods, herbal remedies, dietary supplements, and homeopathic remedies) is scandalous. If drug companies were wielding comparable influence on a medical school there would be a national outcry. It makes naturopathic education appear to be a conspiracy between the health food industry and pseudomedicine. NCAHF POSITION PAPER ON OVER-THE-COUNTER HERBAL REMEDIES The over-the-counter (OTC) herbal remedies business is reported to be well over $1.5 billion in current sales with an estimated annual growth rate of 15%. In 1994, $813.8 million of the healt h food store's $4.815 billion in sales (17%) were from herbal remedies. Herbal product vendors benefit from society's romanticized view that equates \"natural\" with \"safe.\" Unfortunately, the assumption that natural products are safe is false. It is precisely because herbs are a source of potent drugs that responsible people are concerned about the manner in which herbal remedies are being marketed. Consumers are being denied the most fundamental information and assurances of quality. By law, drug labels must provide essential information, but herbal remedies are being marketed as \"dietary supplements\" with little of the type of information needed to enable people to use these remedies properly. The herbal industry blames current regulatory policies for some of these problems. They say that FDA regulations prevent them from supplying drug information because their products are regulated as dietary supplements. Herbal remedies cannot be profitably marketed if they have to meet the full requirements of drug approval. Reformers argue for herbal remedies to be given special regulatory consideration. The FDA is bound by the law to regulate products that make medical claims as drugs. NCAHF finds the present situation untenable, but believes that there is room for regulatory adaptation without sacrificing consumer protection principles. Recommendations are directed at legislators and regulators, manufacturers and marketers, physicians, and consumers. NCAHF RECOMMENDATIONS: To Legislators and Regulators: Establish a special category of OTC medicines called \"Traditional Herbal Remedies\" (THRs) regulated as follows: - Labels must alert consumers to the fact that herbal remedies are held to a lower standard than that applied to standard medicines. Suggested wording: - This product is regulated as a Traditional Herbal Remedy, a special category of medicines not required to meet the full stipulations of the U.S. Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act applied to standard medicines. - Limit THR products to those with properties sufficiently documented in the pharmacognosy literature to assure an acceptable measure of safety and efficacy. - Limit herbal remedy products to those known not to have lethal or damaging side-effects when taken in overdose, or over an extended time period. - Limit THRs to the treatment of nonserious, self-limiting ailments. - Require THRs remedies to meet the same labeling standards for all drug products. - Require plant sources to be identified by their scientific names. - Require that all active ingredients (items that cause an effect) be quantitatively and qualitatively identified on the label. - Require herbal remedy products to contain sufficient amounts of pharmacologically active substances for the product to perform as expected. Only those expectations that can be supported by science should be permitted on labels. The FDA should develop a set of acceptable claims just as it has done with health claims for foods. - Require labels to inform consumers about what effects they should expect . Suggested wording (e.g., valerian): \"The active ingredient in this product is valerian. Traditional folk medicinal uses for this substance include: as a sleep aid, and a relaxant. Valerian has been shown to depress the central nervous system at the doses indicated.\" - Require a highly visible, easily accessible postmarketing surveillance system for tracking unanticipated adverse reactions. The system must enable consumers as well as health professionals to report, and regulators to gather and disseminate information on adverse effects. A good candidate for the agency to receive reports is the U.S. Pharmacopeia Practitioner Reporting System which passes reports on to the FDA and Poison Control Centers. Suggested wording: \"Adverse reactions associated with the use of this products should be reported to 1-800-638-6725.\" - Require manufacturers to mark product batches for identification, testing, and tracking. - Require warnings about dangers of self-treatment on labels and/or package inserts. Suggested wording: \"Caution: Self-treatment may delay proper health care. See a medical doctor if health problems persist.\" - Require substantial representation from outside of the herbal industry to assure sufficient skepticism in herbal regulation. - Impose strong penalties for adulterating herbal products with potentially dangerous substances. To Herbal Remedy Product Manufacturers and Marketers. - NCAHF believes that herbal remedy producers would be wise to take a long range approach to marketing. Just as compliance with food and drug regulations has enabled the American pharmaceutical industry to establish itself as the standard of quality, by adopting high standards, herbal marketers will assure themselves a superior competitive position and longevity. - Adopt the most scientific standards as are practical in your manufacturing and promotions, including the rejection of pseudoscientific herbal products such as homeopathic concoctions. - Conduct ongoing consumer education warning consumers that: - Information found in traditional herbal books is not necessarily reliable as a guide to self-treatment. - The designations \"herbologist,\" \"herbalist,\" \"Master Herbalist,\" and similar terms, have no legal or scientific meaning, and may be indicative of quackery. - Likewise, sources issuing credentials in \"herbology,\" \"herbalism,\" and the like, are usually \"diploma mills.\" To Physicians: - Routinely ask patients about their use of herbal products. - Report adverse effects utilizing either the U.S. Pharmacopeia Practitioner Reporting System or FDA's MedWatch Form 3500, or fax to 1-800-FDA-0178. - Write up and submit for publication case reports in whic h patients have experienced adverse effects from herbal product use. Include information on how the patient learned of the product and how its use was discovered. - Physicians may obtain information on herbal drugs and drug interactions from Registered Pharmacists at hospital pharmacies or from Poison Control Centers. Information on some herbal drugs, interactions, or synergistic effects may be obscure or unavailable. These are among the additional risks that those who choose to use medicinal herbal products currently face. To Consumers: - Do not assume that herbal remedies are safe simply because they are natural. Herbal remedies contain substances that can have powerful effects upon the mind and/or body. Use even greater cautions than when taking standard medications. - Be cautious about taking medicinal herbs if you are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant. - Be cautious about taking medicinal herbs if you are breast feeding a baby; herbal drugs in the body may be transferred to breast milk. - Do not give herbs to infants or children. - Do not take large quantities of any herbal preparation. - Do not take any medicinal herb on a prolonged daily basis. - Buy only preparations that identify plants on the label and state contraindications for use. - Become familiar with the names of potentially dangerous herbs and be cautious about their use. - If you are taking medications, do not use medicinal herbs without checking with your doctor. - Do not trust your health to unqualified practitioners who use unregulated titles such as \"herbalist,\" \"herb doctor,\" \"Master Herbalist,\" \"herbologist,\" \"Natural Health Counselor,\" or the like. - Beware of exaggerated claims for the benefits of herbal remedies. - Insist that herbal marketers meet basic consumer protection standards of labeling, safety and efficacy.

Officials hope to restore the program to financial stability by the beginning of next year. University officials plan to ask the state legislature for about a million dollars of support next year. There is optimism that legislators who personally favor CAM will come to the rescue. NATUROTHERAPIST TOLD DIABETIC TO STOP INSULIN From the sad but true department: Louise Lortie, a \"naturotherapist,\" was sentenced by a judge in Hull, Quebec to three years in prison for the death of a 12-year-old diabetic girl. The judge found Lortie guilty of criminal neglect after she recommended that her patient rely on a combination of salt baths and herbal remedies instead of insulin to treat her diabetes. Three days later the Lisanne Manseau girl died in a diabetic coma. Crown prosecutor Martin Cote noted in an interview outside the courtroom, \"The message that had to be sent to the community had to be clear and, as I told the judge, when you have someone who has access to the media and who indicates that she's not responsible for her actions, that it's someone else's fault, it's important that the judge takes that into consideration and sends a very loud and clear message that that's not to be repeated.\" [Christopher Guly, The Ottawa Citizen, c.February, 2000] RISKS TO SURGICAL PATIENTS USING ALT-COMP MEDICINES Carol Norred, a Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA), researcher and PhD candidate at the UCHSC Department of Anesthesiology and School of Nursing, recently published a study in the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) stating that patients who use complementary and alternative medicines within two weeks of surgery may experience adverse side effects. The study, titled \"Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicines by Surgical Patients,\" appears in the February issue of the AANA Journal. She studied 500 patients having elective surgery and found evidence of likely side effects from the use of unconventional medicines taken up to two weeks before surgery. The study goes on to categorize complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) according to potential \"adverse effects\" with drugs used during surgery. The study concluded that some supplements can increase bleeding and prolong coagulation time during surgery. These include alfalfa, chamomile, some Chinese herbs, garlic, ginkgo, kava, licorice, vitamin E and fish oil. Supplements such as Black Cohosh, used to treat menopause, menstrual cramps and osteoporosis, tend to lower a patient's blood pressure during surgery. Conversely St. John's Wort, used to control depression, was found to raise blood pressure as well as cause confusion, agitation and drowsiness in surgical patients. Norred believes that more scientific research is needed to safely integrate CAM into the management of surgical patients. As always, an \"open dialogue between patients and providers can prevent complications related to the use of unconventional medicines.\" The AANA advises full disclosure of herb, vitamin supplement use before any surgical operation. [Park Ridge, IL, BW HealthWire, 3/14/00 via NewsEdge 10-year-old girl suffocated during a \"rebirthing\" process. Candace Newmaker of North Carolina, was wrapped tightly in a blanket and pillows to simulate a womb. Therapists would push on the \"womb\" to simulate uterine contractions. Candace, an adopted child, had not bonded with her parents-a condition termed \"attachment disorder.\" Therapists theorize that re-enacting the birth experience may enable the patient to relive early developmental phases that were missed. A video tape of the session revealed that the girl told her therapists seven times that she could not breathe. The therapists urged her to push her way out of the blanket through a twisted end.

[Reuters, 5/18/00; and 5/23/00] NORTH AMERICAN GINSENG LOSING POPULARITY Chai-Na-Ta Corp, the world's largest producer of North American ginseng, filed for creditors' protection under the federal Companies Creditors Arrangement Act in the British Columbia Supreme Court. It seems the market prices for North American ginseng has fallen drastically in recent years. As recently as 1996, the suburban Langley, BC-based firm was among the Toronto Stock Exchange's Composite Index 300. But it has fallen on tough financial times as the international price for ginseng root plummeted in recent years. According to Chai-Na-Ta president Gerry Gill, the entire industry is under pressure as prices continue to decline. \"Market prices for North American ginseng continue to be depressed, putting the entire industry under pressure,\" Chai-Na-Ta's stock price on the TSE hit close to $26 in March 1994. However, on November 12, 1999, the stock closed at 27 cents. The company has been trying to refinance its debt with it's principle lenders. Gill believes that market conditions will improve as the ginseng supply declines. Currently, 99% of Chai-Na-Ta's ginseng harvest is exported through Hong Kong to China and southeast Asia. It's widely used there for its medicinal qualities. According to Gill, Chai-Na-Ta expects to present its restructuring proposal to creditors in the next 30 days. [Wyng Chow Vancouver (CP) 11/13/99] LINK BETWEEN FAITH AND HEALING Does deep religious faith help the healing process? A number of recent studies seem to point in that direction. This seems especially true with the increasing popularity of fundamentalist Christianity, New Age beliefs, and alternative medicine. So is there really a link between spirituality and the healing process? But a couple of studies coming out of Columbia University suggest otherwise. Dr. Richard Sloan and colleagues at Columbia University in New York City contend that the link spirituality, and health is \" weak and inconsistent\". After all, common sense tells us that people of faith tend to lead healthier lives, i.e. non-use of tobacco and alcohol products. Sloan goes on to say,\" Avoidance of these risks may influence their overall health to a much greater extent than simple religious belief. Their review appears in the February 20 issue of The Lancet. Although the Columbia University team also produced a study that found regular churchgoers did indeed have a lower risk of illness and death than non- churchgoers, they reported a flaw in their own study, i.e the fact that ill health may prevent many individuals from attending church in the first place. Based on that, the Columbia University team concludes \"doctors should remain cautious when 'recommending' faith as a possible aid to physical recovery\".. While a link between faith and healing remains unproved, \"respectful attention must be paid to the impact of religion on the patient's decisions about health care,\" they conclude.

[Columbia, SC, 2/17/00, PRNewswire via NewsEdge Corporation] NEVADA HOMEOPATHS SCRAP RETRY AT EXPANDING SCOPE OF PRACTICE Another short chapter has been written in the saga of one state's flirtation and struggle with quackery. First, some background information. In 1983, the influence of a powerful state political leader led to the establishment of a Homeopathic medical licensing board in Nevada. The state quickly became a magnet for troubled and delicensed medical renegades who practiced a grab-bag of quackery. Most popular were galvanic devices used as part of so-called \"energy medicine.\" The \"energy\" was alleged to be of the cosmic, metaphysical kind dubbed chi, prana, vital energy, and the like, by healing systems rooted in ancient superstitions. Few, if any, of the licensees were actually practicing traditional homeopathy. It was an incredible situation in which a fake system (homeopathy) was being faked, so that consumers could be exploited with another fake system (energy medicine). The devices are boons to quackery because they enable practitioners to create the illusion of diagnosing, treating or prescribing for phantom diseases. This places them in full control of the clinical situation. It also provides a defense against other physicians who testify as medical experts because they know nothing of these allegedly specialized devices which influences juries to favor the innovative defendant. In 1987, the legislature became aware that it had been snookered by the energy medicine merchants. The result was a new homeopathic practice act that specifically limited licensees to the homeopathic substances prepared according to the \"methods of Hahnemannian dilutions and succussion, magnetically energized geometric pattern as defined in the official homeopathic pharmacopoeia of the United States.\" Wow! what language. This was a classic example of the institutionalization of pseudomedical gibberish by scientifically illiterate lawmakers! Well, the medical renegades didn't like it much either, and have plotted to undo the limitations of the practice act ever since. The most recent attempt was to expand its licensee's scope of practice by instituting its own new regulations to include virtually any type of alternative medicine as long as patients consented. However, opposition by the Nevada State Medical Association and the Board of Medical Examiners, plus the vow by Reno pathologist W.J. Diamond to sue the homeopathic board if it adopted its self-imposed practice expansion, caused homeopathic board chairman, Dr. Fuller Royal, to drop the proposal. [Las Vegas Review-Journal. 4/30/00] Comment. Royal refers to the resistance of standard medicine to the expanded scope as \"a turf war,\" and vows to try again in the future. Of course, it isn't a true turf war in which equivalently competent practitioners are competing for the privilege of delivering legitimate health services. This is an issue of the legalization of buccaneer medical entrepreneurialism versus accountable evidence-based medicine, with consumers caught in the middle. The lesson to be learned here is that opposition by standard medicine can still be an effective way to thwart the advancement of quackery. Too many in leadership positions have given up fighting for the tenets of professionalism and consumer protection. CHIROPRACTIC CLINICS RAIDED Officers looking for information on past patient accounts seized 9 computers from the Sacramento billing office of the chiropractic offices of a chain known previously as the California Back & Neck Pain Specialists. Charges include false billing and workers' comp fraud. The chain and its former owner, Lester Simmons, DC, have been under investigation since 1996 according to the chain's new owner chiropractor Craig Elder. Elder has renamed the business America's Back & Neck Pain Specialists. [Sacramento Bee, 11/13/99] ACUPUNCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE EVENTS Sometimes it may work, and it seems harmless enough, so why not try acupuncture for what ails you. While admitting that the procedure is usually harmless, researchers Vickers and Zollman, found that, when a systemic infection does occur, it can be devastating. In a published review of acupuncture, the single reported fatality from acupuncture was due to streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. The case involved a 41-year-old man receiving acupuncture for shoulder pain. He collapsed three days later with the skin of his shoulder succumbing to a rapidly spreading erythematous and necrotic condition. Despite immediate extensive antibiotic treatment, he died within twenty-four hours. Although life threatening complications involving acupuncture is rare, the literature reports 11 such cases in 1998. Although several other cases of infection that were severe enough to require intensive treatment were also found, there were frequent delays in accurate diagnosis because patients were hesitant to tell their doctors they had tried the procedure. Two cases of angina from electroacupuncture have been reported. Both cases were confirmed when symptoms recurred during re-exposure. This is the first such finding. The survey concluded that acupuncture does occasionally have serious adverse events and even the rare fatality. Most of these outcomes were negligence related. It should be obvious that all concerned with setting standards, delivering training and maintaining competence in acupuncture be familiar with the lessons taught by these events. [BMJ 19 February 2000;320:513] ASSESSING THE QUALITY OF BOTANICAL PREPARATIONS The passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) stimulated 5 years of unprecedented growth of the herbal and nutritional supplement industry. While it seems growth is slowing, US consumers are using increasing amounts of herbal and nutritional products, along with, or instead of conventional medicine. Physicians and pharmacists seek answers to consumer questions out of concern about the safety and efficacy of these substances. In trying to answer these questions, authors McDermott and Motyka take a look at issues in regard to product quality and standardization of the botanical preparations, and present an outline of issues for healthcare professionals to consider when making recommendations regarding botanical products. They begin by defining the problem as it exists since the passage of DSHEA, the act that allowed the large array of herbal and nutritional supplements to enter the marketplace. As is well known, these products are produced and marketed outside the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is up to manufacturers to ensure the safety of supplements. Authors state that problems related to the quality of herbal supplements can be found throughout the lay and professional literature. They place reports into four categories: intentional addition of an active drug causing for therapeutic or adverse effects; unintentional substitution of the herbal with a toxic species; environmental contamination of the herb with a chemical or pathogen; and suboptimal or varying amounts of active ingredient within a formulation. They go on to give specific examples of each category as found in the literature. [Medscape, 2000, Inc] HUMANA TO SETTLE ALLEGED DECEPTION FOR $800,000 Here's one for the citizens of Florida. Due to deceptive practices Humana Health Plan Inc. will refund a total of $800,000 to about 2,100 Florida Medicare beneficiaries. It seems they were allegedly enticed to join the plan with a deceptive hearing aid offer. According to Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, Humana admitted no wrong doing but agreed to revise its marketing practices. According to Butterworth, Humana promised consumers who joined its Gold Plus Plan a free set of hearing aids or a $700 discount on more expensive models. But members who opted for the high-end models paid a higher base price for them than people not covered by the plan, offsetting the so-called discount, he explained. \"Such practices are reprehensible under any circumstance, but the fact that many of the victims were elderly people on fixed incomes makes them even more so,\" Butterworth said. Members who chose the more expensive hearing aids will be refunded the amount they were overcharged. [Reuters Health, 2/17/2000] RESEARCHERS FIND LESS GRAY MATTER IN SOCIOPATHS According to a report in Archives of General Psychiatry researchers have found the first evidence that people suffering from antisocial personality disorder (APD) have less gray matter in the front part of their brains than healthy people. Gray matter is the thinking part of the brain. Researchers caution, however, less gray matter isn't the only factor in the making of a sociopath. Societal factors such as drug or alcohol abuse, as well as upbringing also contribute to the problem. Other physical traits like high levels of the male hormone testosterone, birth complications or a breakdown in other parts of the brain can all contribute to antisocial behavior.In collecting data researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the prefrontal cortex gray and white matter of 21 men with APD. Then they compared the measurements to 34 healthy men and 26 men who had abused drugs. Findings revealed that the volume of gray matter was 11% less in the sociopaths when compared to healthy men.

The prosecutors said the eight had died over a two week period, in summer 1998, after Pimentel applied a solution containing pesticides to their skin. He claimed to have his own cancer cures as well as cures for other serious diseases. Pimentel, who had been treating patients with his own remedies for 20 years on the far-flung Azores islands of Pico, Faial and Sao Jorge, was also charged with 21 cases of attempted murder and 21 cases of fraud. Pimentel, who faces 25 years in jail if found guilty, denies murder and says the people died because they failed to tell him they were also suffering from other illnesses, such as diabetes. [Lisbon, Reuters, 2/23/00] CONGRESS OKAYS HALF-TRUTHS (LIES) AS HEALTH CLAIMS There is no such thing as a \"half-truth.\" Something is either true or untrue. Granted, the term \"misleading\" is used for the clever lies hucksters use to label and advertise their wares, but such are ultimately judged to be false. Your and my representatives have again showed us where their hearts are. As if it weren't enough for dietary supplements hucksters to be given free reign as to what they may bottle and sell, now they may legally make misleading claims as to the value of their nostrums. Section 201.(g)(2) of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act defines a drug as: articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; and articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or any other animals. This sensible, scientifically accurate definition has been dismembered by the shyster lawyers now serving as legislators in our congress. Hucksters may not mention specific diseases in their marketing claims, but they are permitted to pretend to alter the structure and function of the body-something that is factually inseparable from diseases and disorders. For instance, the quacks cannot say that their pills and potions treat or cure arthritis, but they may say \"helps support healthy joints.\" They cannot say that the dietary supplement prevents, treats or cures \"heart disease,\" but they can say that it \"keeps your arteries clean,\" or \"... from being narrowed.\" They cannot mention Alzheimer's disease but can say that a supplement \"helps mental functioning or memory.\" Consumers clearly cannot distinguish between these carefully-worded phrases. Comment. If members of Congress don't understand this they are stupid. If they realize how deceptive this is but do it anyway they are crooks. In either case, they are unqualified to be public representatives. The media should be screaming about this travesty. Is the money they earn by advertising dietary supplements sealing their lips, or do they too hold strong beliefs about the power of special foods, herbs, and vitamins to prevent disease and produce a kind of superhealth?

MAGNET PROMOTER WARNEDOn April 17, 1996, the FDA's Buffalo, NY, regional office sent a warning letter to William W. Lampard, MD, of Lakewood, NY, notifying him that the magnetic products he was distributing, \"including Magsteps and Kenkopillow\" (Nikken) are medical devices, and that they are considered by the FDA to be \"adulterated\" and \"misbranded.\" Lampard was told that it was his responsibility to meet the requirements of the law, and to take prompt action to correct the violations by his firm. In NCAHF's view it is high time that the FDA took action against Nikken distributors. NCAHF has been receiving consumer inquiries about the alleged health and healing properties of Nikken magnets for over five years. In 1990, NCAHF alerted the FDA, FTC, and California food & drug anti-fraud officials of the Nikken company's magnetic healing promotions, but this is the first action against these products that we have heard about. On October 8, 1991, the California Board of Chiropractic Examiners sent a letter to all of its licensees notifying them that magnets (among other types of devices), were consid ered by the State Dept. of Health Services , to be \"new devices,\" and that to represent them as safe and effective as an inducement for sale, or for administration, violated California law. The lack of regulatory actions seems to be partially responsible for a proliferation of magnetic healing products. A Canadian dentist is promoting a magnet pad that claims to \"produce a Pure Negative Magnetic Field equivalent to that of the earth 4,000 years ago.\" A Kentucky chiropractor has his own line of magnets which he uses for diagnosis, prescription and therapy. An Oklahoma MD hawks his line of magnets for pain, losing weight, at least a dozen specific diseases, food & chemical reactions, and \"general systemtic treatment.\" BLAME FOR ABUSE OF OTA REPORT'S DUBIOUS \"ONLY 10-20% OF MEDICAL PROCEDURES ARE PROVED\"In the Nov-Dec 1995, issue we reported that Kerr L. White, MD, had revealed that he was the likely source of the state ment in the 1978 OTA report that \"only 10 to 20 percent of procedures currently used in medical practice have been shown to be efficacious by controlled clinical trial.\" White told NCAHF that the figure was used heuristically to stimulate the search for more accurate information. White says that he had no control over the fact that the OTA used his armchair estimate in its final report, and that neither he nor the OTA can be blamed for the abuse of the statement by quacks and the enemies of standard medicine. Neither he nor the OTA could anticipate how the statement was going to be abused by the enemies of science-based medicine. The intent of the OTA report was clearly to improve the scientific aspects of medical care, not to advocate an open door to unproven alternative and complementary medicine. After hearing White's side of the story, it is clear that he should not be blamed for either creating the myth that only 10-20% of standard medicine is scientifically proved, or for any of its fallout. White has always worked to strengthen the former students are leadi ng in the fields of health services research and evidence-based medicine. NCAHF regrets having placed this burden on White, and is pleased to know that no advocate of nonscientific medicine will find comfort in pursuing this statement to its source.

Lawrence Taylor, MD and William Stacey, who ran the Taylor-Stacey Center for Advanced Medicine in San Diego, manufactured, prescribed, and distributed Immunostim claiming that its intravenous infusion would cure AIDS. The substance was similar to disinfectants, toilet bowl cleaners and automatic dishwashers detergents. Patients actually experienced inflammation of their veins, painful swellings, and eventually complete closure of the veins used for infusion. Taylor lost his medical license, and Stacey was sent to prison for four years. Lawrence Taylor lost his medical license, and Stacey was sent to prison for four years. Lawrence Taylor is a self-styled homeopath who was involved in the \"alternative\" treatment of Yuri Owens, a boy suffering from bone cancer in 1991. A Provo, Utah orthopedic surgeon testified that Yuri had a chance of a cure a month earlier, but that the delay of proper treatme nt had allowed the diseas e to progress. [The Herald, 3/20/91] HOLISTIC HARMQuackery causes holistic harm. Physically: injury death; emotionally: psychological trauma, self-deprecation, depression, and despair; socially: lost faith in the system, stigmatization; economically: lost money, sometimes unable to work. NCAHF tries to help victims get redress, but obtaining justice can be difficult. Most victims want to at least warn others about what can happen when someone decides to choose alternative or complementary medicine. Case Report A woman went to a homeopath. He was a DO who had lost his license in another state. He went to a state with a homeopathic licensing board which was run by maverick physicians who had either lost their licenses in other states or left with unsettled charges of unprofessional conduct. She had a stiff neck. The homeopath's assistant, who claimed to be a \"neurolinguistic programmer\" manipulated her neck. She immediately became dizzy and disoriented. She had suffered a stroke. The homeopath suggested that her symptoms were toxicity and wanted to cleanse her colon. The woman filed a complaint with the homeopathic licensing board which issued a nonpublic rerimand, but refused to take any other action. The state medical board could do nothing because it does not regulate homeopathy. She saw an attorney about a malpractice lawsuit, but this course of action was thwarted when it was found that the homeopath did not have insurance. Attorneys know that it is nearly impossible to collect damages from an unethical individual. THE SECOND COMING OF SHARK CARTILAGEWilliam Lane has written a sequel to Sharks Don't Get Cancer (Avery, 1992) entitled Sharks Still Don't Get Cancer (Avery, 1996). The foreword of the second book is written by chiropractor \"Dr. David Williams\" (see NCAHF Newsletter, March-April , 1995). Lane contradicts his own title on page 25 by admitting that some sharks do get cancer, just as he did in book #1-but, he contends that they don't get it very often. He says that Almost No Sharks Get Cancer would have been a rotten book title. If Lane were more a scientist, and less a salesman, he would have to admit that the data on shark cancers is obscure. Trout, for instance, are raised in fish hatcheries by biologists who study them thoroughly. By contrast, sharks are not. Further, the fact that reports about chondromas (tumors of the cartilage) appear in the sparse literature on shark pathology, blows a pretty big hole in Lane's basic premise. Of course, the fact that Lane promotes orally-ingested cartilage supplements as a viable way to attain the inhibition of blood vessel formation tumors that he theorizes is a big hole in the whole idea that cancer patients can benefit from shark cartilage. He acknowledges this problem in book #2, but tackles it by trying to persuade the reader that shark cartil age can pass to the blood intact. Whether the blood-vessel inhibiting fator(s) can find their way to the right spot \u2014 and avoid inhibiting blood vessel formation in vital organs where it would be undesirable are not adequately answered. Book #2 is a travelogue through Lane's experiences with shark cartilage. He tells stories about patients who appear to have benefitted from the pills. His \"seeing is believing\" approach recalls an insightful statement by cancer researcher Emil Freirereich: \"The quack or the uneducated or inexperienced physician or biologist is generally woefully lacking in the knowledge or understanding of the disease process for which he is giving treatment.\" [1] Anyone who treats a large number of cancer patients will see some unusual outcomes. It is easy to believe that the treatment had something to do with these when they are beneficial. Hippocrates warned physicians about the logical fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc (\"after it, therefore, be cause of it\") in patient care over 2,000 years ago. Further, double-blind clinical trials have become essential because even honest, competent physicians can be fooled by clinical observations. Lane is not trained in medicine, so he can be excussed to a degree. Lane's views are colored by his financial interest in shark cartilage, and worse yet, Lane is caught in an ego-trap. The old saying, \"they laughed at Columbus\" is tempered by the fact that they also laughed at Bozo the Clown. In each case, they laughed! Only those who can fulfill the old saw, \"he who laughs last, laughs best\" can survive with their egos intact. Lane's own words are the strongest evidence that he is engaged in wishful thinking and selling hope. He ends his book by stating: Hope raises the human spirit... If I have provided hope for anyone who was without it, I am grateful... I don't know where my journey will take me, but I have hope for myself, for those wit h cancer, and, yes, even for my critics. This recalls another insightful statement: In the face of the great leveler, Death, we are all children, listening fearfully for the footsteps of doom-relieved only by the whisperings of hope; the quack is the peddler of hope [2]. Lane comes across more as a true believer than as a charlatan. Unfortunately, he has aligned himself with some notorious promoters of quackery listing several of them as referrals for finding alternative medicine.

DHEA STILL A PUZZLECornell University's Marc Weksler (Division of Geriatrics & Gerontology) provides insight into what is known about the risks and benefits of DHEA. Placebo controlled studies report that orally ingested DHEA in older adults: (1) increases blood levels to those found in young adults; (2) In men, increased androstendiol, but not testosterone or dihydrotestosterone-while all three increased in women; (3) increased serum concentration of insulin-like growth factor by 10% in men & women (lean body mass improved in a study using higher doses; (4) elicited positive feelings (i.e., improved sleep, greater energy, increased ability to handle stress) in 82% of women an d 67% of men ; (5) increased number and activity of natural killer cells. No changes in libido were found. People with a family or personal history of breast or prostate cancer are warned against using DHEA. [British Med J. 1996; 312:859-60] Watch out for health food products containing plant sterols (Mexican yam) alleged to be \"building blocks of DHEA.\" Dr. Charles Dollum of the Aeron LifeCycles Laboratory in San Leandro, California, tel ls the readers of the Townsend Letter for Doctors & Patients (a pro-alternative-complementary medicine publication) that they could not detect any difference in the progesterone or DHEA levels of people taking yam products and non-users (October, 1996 issue, p. 104). The bottom line is that a lot of people will feel better if they take real DHEA supplements. However, they are taking them at their own risk. The UCB Wellness Letter (1/96) mentioned an animal study that found liver cancer greatly increased by DHEA. Buyer beware. Comment: The topic of hormone replacement therapy for men remains alive. Medical Abstracts [July, 1996] says that a new testosterone patch for men with proven hormonal deficiencies is available. Our guess is that this device will join the list of potential rejuvenators. Unfortunately, any hormonal replacement product carries potent risks, and needs to be medically justifiable and monitored.

REDUXRedux (dexfenfluramine) increases the levels of brain serotonin which induces feelings of fullness and satisfaction making it easier to comply with a reduced-calorie diet. Redux is not new or revolutionary. Quite a lot is known about it, but what is still a question is its long term safety, and what is going to happen to people who use it in a manner contrary to recommendations (it's for people 20% or more overweight, not for the slightly overweight who are cosmetically inclined). Consumer Reports (August '96) provides insight into the new drug plus some useful information on weight control.

MELATONIN ALERT!The Canadian government has banned the sale of melatonin because it has not been proved safe. It is worth remembering that Canadians were saved from the disastrous effects of L-tryptophan supplements because Canada banned its sale on the same basis. QUACKERY AND THE MEDIAQuackophiles* traditionally blame \"the AMA and the big drug companies\" for the passage of laws restricting the sale of unproven medicines. In fact, none of society's academic-scientific elite have been the moving force behind historic consumer protection legal reforms. It was the power of the press that generated the public outrage that motivated congress to pass consumer protection laws. Two books were largely responsible for causing Congress to pass the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act: Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, and Samuel Hopkins Adams' The Great American Fraud. Sinclair's book was a novel about a Lithuanian family whose members worked in a meat packing plant. Sinclair fabricated accounts of filthy working conditions, and horrors such as workers falling into sausage grinders and ending up on people's dinner tables. Sinclair did not pretend to be accurately reporting on conditions in meat-packing plants. Sinclair was America's most outspoken socialist reformer whose concern was about the plig ht of immigrant laborers. He lamented that he had aimed for t he nation's heart, but hit it in the stomach! [1] Adams' factual book exposed the fraud being perpetrated on the public by the patent medicine industry with the cooperation of the press. In the days before radio, newspapers were the major source of information. Newspapers molded public opinion and determined the political agenda. Patent medicine promoters bought lots of advertising space. To increase their leverage, rather than simply buying advertising space for a week or two, patent medicine companies would enter into long term contracts (eg, instead of $10 each week, a 3-year contract worth $1,500) raising them to amounts that editors could not ignore. The contracts included a clause printed in red ink so it could not be overlooked. The clause stated that in the event that a law were passed restricting the sale of patent medicine within the jurisdiction covered by the newspaper, the contract would become void. These \"red letter clauses\" made political allies of the editors who were happy to report human interest stories with testimonials on the benefits of patent medicines, and were reluctant to publish reports of harm. They also editorialized against regulating the marketplace. Although the red letter clauses are history, today's media is still more beholden to advertisers than audiences. Marilyn Larkin quotes Gloria Steinhem as stating that \"85% of women's magazine copy is really 'unmarked advertorial\" (combined advertising and editorial). The world of women's magazines is to provide a nice environment of advertisers [2]. The media is dependent upon the income from its advertisers for its sustenance. The audience's main value is its size-the larger the audience, the higher is the price which can be charged for advertsing. The power of the advertising dollar still distorts media editorials. A 1988-90 survey of 20 major U.S. magazines (selected because they regularly report on a wide variety of health topics) by the American Council on Science and Health found a significant inverse correlation (r=.445, P<=0.05) between how much money a magazine received from cigarette advertising and the amount of coverage it gave to the health risks associated with smoking [3]. Diversification has given tobacco companies enormous leverage over the media because they can now punish a media outlet by withholding advertising of its non-tobacco products as well. <=0.05) between how much money a magazine received from cigarette advertising and the amount of coverage it gave to the health risks associated with smoking.# Diversification has given tobacco companies enormous leverage over the media because they can now punish a media outlet by withholding advertising of its non-tobacco products as well. It was the outrage generated by the book, One-Hundred Million Guinea Pigs (Consumers Research, 1929) that caused Congress to pass the 1938 Drug & Cosmetic Act. One hundred million was the population of the USA at the time. The point of the book was that medicines and cosmetics were marketed without having been adequately tested for safety. These were withdrawn only after consumer injuries and deaths occurred-in effect, making the public \"guinea pigs\" for the promoters of such products. Publicity on the deaths of over 100 people in 33 states from Elixir Sulfanilamide which contained diethylene glycol (antifreeze) shocked congress into enacting the bill then under consideration. Although publicists have played the pivotal role in creating the public outrage needed to bring about consumer protection reforms, they have also played an even greater role in helping quackery to flourish. If media people have an ethical code, it is not apparent even when it comes to public health and safety. The media takes no responsibility for the effects of its reporting of questionable health practices. Reporters know that coverage gives status and credibilit y to their subject. They also know (or ought to know) that desperate people are likely to pursue hopeful remedies, but they will still go forward with \"human interest\" stories that put quack procedures in a positive light. They will publish claims at face value without adequately checking on their veracity. NCAHF knows from experience that claims are difficult to verify. Rather than making it clear to the audience that claims are unverified, and that they may be self-serving, reporters often fall back on a journalistic ploy: tell both sides and let the public decide. The problem with this thinking is that the public cannot decide without having the information the reporter failed to provide. Stories with good outcomes are like Monday morning football stores \u2014 whatever was done now seems right! Not only are the missing facts needed to evaluate the case at hand, but some guidance in the principles involved, and especially how people might be misled by appearances. The result is health misinformation and misguidance done in the disguise of news reporting. The media commonly treats offbeat medicine stories as entertainment. A case in point was the NBC special Cured! which aired in July, 1994. Skits were presented in which individuals were cured by alternative medicine. An investigation by Forbes MediaCritic found that the presentations were fabrications -mostly composites of unverified anecdotes taken from pro-quackery sources. The producer of Cured! did not try to defend the show as factual. In fact, he told MediaCritic that he thought that some of the therapies discussed on Cured! are \"sh_t\", but that they weren't doing an educational program, we were doing it as entertainment.\" Roz Weinman, vice-president of standards and practices at NBC, shared this understanding. In an interview, she appeared irritated that the program should be scrutinized in terms of commonly accepted standards. Weinman didn't think the accounts had to be factual because they were not about conventional medicine [4]. Although media officials pass off criticisms of their pro-quackery stories as entertainment, they provide no evidence that the public considers such stories to be entertainment. As bad as it is for the mainstream media to be purveyors of health misinformation, reporters become advocates when they tell their audience how to obtain the off-beat health methods they have touted. The most noncritical articles are also the most likely to provide their audiences with information about how to get in touch with the providers of the off-beat procedures they have just touted. Such practices transform pro-quackery reports into infomercials. Whether this is empty-mindedness (ie, a failure to learn from quackery's history) or an indicator that the reporter is a true-believer abusing his role as a journalist is hard to ascertain. NCAHF would like to see the media adopt a policy of not providing information on obtaining products or services except in paid advertising-and that ads be clearly marked as such to put audiences on their guard against self-serving claims and statements.

ESTIMATE: FOR SCIENCE, 328; FOR QUACKERY, 749,672!We've seen a plethora of romanticized articles about the secret medicines hiding in the rain forests. The idea of secret remedies hiding in exotic natural settings is as old as the mythical Chinese Islands of Immortality, Shangri La, and the Garden of Eden's Tree of Life. There was even a movie made about this, The Medicine Man , with Hollywood's top actor, Sean Connery, in the leading role. Environmentalists use the idea of hidden cures as a selfish reason for saving rain forests from destruction. Anthropologists use the idea to venerate the shamans who allegedly possess secrets of nature (this is a near perfect parallel to the past use of native American medicine men to hawk patent medicines from old time medicine wagons). Politicos from undeveloped countries are using the idea as another way of extorting money from the wealthy nations-they want royalties for the native people whose ancestors traditionally used the botanical remedies. The reality is that scientists have not ignored the rain forest as a source of medicines. In 1955, the National Cancer Institute inaugurated the Cancer Drug Development Program. Dr. Jerry Lewis writes: By the early 1980s this rigorous and scientifically sound review process had been used to screen nearly three quarters of a millio potentially active agents, including chemical synthetics, products of fermentation, plant derivatives, marine animal products, and biological response modifiers. Each of the agents tested held some hope when review began, yet fewer than 70 made it to market [1]. Yale University economist Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, and Dr. Michael Balick, director of the Institute for Economic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden estimate that there are at least 328 new drugs that could be developed from the tropical rain forests. They say that there are about 750,000 potential extracts obtainable from the 125,000 flowering plant species of the tropical forests. They say that 375 million tests on these are possible, and that conservatively, one in a million tests results in a pharmaceutical suitable for commerce; therefore, the rain forest is estimated to contain 375 useful medicines. Forty-seven of these have already been found leaving 328 undiscovered [2]. What these economic botanists forgot to consider was that the dietary supplement industry can legally package and sell the 749,672 worthless extracts as herbal remedies! Even the poisonous substances could be diluted homeopathically to make them non-toxic. Come to think about it, all the homeopaths need are the names of these plant extracts. After all, if you're going to dilute to 1024 so that none of the original molecules remain, does it really matter if you didn't have the molecules in the first place? Its not hard to imagine the sales pitch: \"ancient remedy f rom the tropical rain forest frees millions from pain and debility! Get yours while the supply lasts!\" Citations: (1) Lewis. \"Clinical studies with make-believe drugs,\" Western J Med 1992;157:677-8.

Congress has bought into organized quackery's main ploy, which is to disguise its promotions in a cloak of consumer freedom of choice. A proposed bill is: To permit an individual to be treated by a health care practitioner with any method of medical treatment such individual requests... The law would require the individual to be warned that: this food, drug, or device has not been declared to be safe and effective by the Federal Government, and any individual who uses such food, drug, or device, does so at his or her own risk. It is obvious that the only freedom that this act would confer is to health care providers who traffic in dubious alternative / complementary medicine. In the first place, people do not want to be cheated, nor do they want to be harmed. The only reason an individual would want to be treated by an unapproved procedure is that someone has convinced them that it IS safe and effective. Desperate patients are willing to try most anything that a health care provider suggests might help. Alienation also plays a powerful role in patient behavior. Deviant providers often convince their patients that an oppressive and corrupted bureaucracy is keeping the treatment off the market. Even the language \"declared...by the Federal Government\" rather than \"determined on the basis of evidence\" is prejudicial. This bill is a charlatan's dream because it entices patients to sign away their rights. By fulfilling the duty to warn, quacks will be getting the same kind of protection the tobacco industry got with warning labels. After a consumer realizes he has been harmed, he has little chance of redress because of having been warned. Comment: Quackery has perverted medicine by law. The 1994 dietary supplements act, the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine, organic foods certification, widening the public purse to chiropractors (see \"New Law Will End Systematic Medicare Fraud and Abuse...,\") and the proposed access to medical treatment all pervert consumer protection! And don't be fooled-the people who write, introduce, and pass these bills are lawyers! It is time to for Americans to be alerted to the fact that lawmakers are in league with consumer exploiters, and are dismantling laws of consumer protection and redress. MISINFORMATION FROM THE NIH OAM The Practice and Policy Guidelines Panel of the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) published its findings in the Archives of Family Medicine in the March/April issue (1997;6:149-154). The article continues the misinformation upon which much of the attention being given alternative medicine rests, ie, that it is in popular demand. The abstract opens by stating: An estimated 1 of 3 Americans uses some form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), such as acupuncture, homeopathy, or herbal medicine. ... Eisenberg, et al (NEJM, 1993;328:246-52) is cited for this statistic. In fact, the use of acupuncture was reported at less than 1%, homeopathy was 1% with only a third of respondents seeing a provider (2/3s bought OTC remedies), and herbal medicine use was 3% with only 1 of 10 seeing a provider (90% bought an OTC herbal remedy). The total use of the three types of CAM used by \"Americans\" was a maximum of 1-in-20 with 1.33%, or about 1-in-75 seeing a provider. The text of the article also lists \"relaxation techniques, and various other practices and therapies,\" but merely tacks them on after again listing these three. By inflating the use of acupuncture, homeopathy and herbal medicine by a factor of 25, the panel condemns itself as guilty of either sloppy scholarship or a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts. The article reflected the impasse that will always exist between true believers in CAM and those who believe in reliable evidence for any healing technique. If one follows the thinking of the OAM panel, CAM should be widely adopted so it can be studied (which of course it cannot, be using \"reductionist\" science). From here it looks like OAM is going nowhere fast scientifically, but is the gateway for ideologically-driven, dubious CAM into standard health care. The OAM deserves a national \"no confidence\" vote. FIXING THE OFFICE OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE The idea of having a government-sponsored program for testing unusual medical methods is highly desirable. Unfortunately, the present approach of having a separate NIH Office of Alternative Medicine has not worked. The OAM has become a public relations boon for quackery and has yet to yield a single benefit to health care. The proposal of creating an independent Center for Alternative Medicine is even worse than what is happening now. A solution that should receive careful study is to establish programs within each of the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which offer free counsel and advice, opportunities for on-site testing, and research grants for conditions covered by the various agencies. This would focus the procedures on the diseases, conditions, and disorders rather than on the methods and procedures as is already done in the National Cancer Institute (NCI). It was determined very early that NCI didn't need the OAM. It already had its own Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program in the Division of Cancer Treatment which tests all sorts of ideas. The main problem is one of visibility. Such programs should be easily accessible. Serious minded people who wish to test promising ideas should not be frustrated by red tape and other obstacles. By the same token, quacks who now present themselves as having been shut out by the establishment would have no excuse for not having their methods tested. SHOULD DI'S PSYCHIC BE SUED FOR MALPRACTICE FOR FAILING TO WARN HER? Please, do not think that we are poking fun at Di's tragic death. Princess Diana was highly admirable for setting aside her privileged life and becoming a nanny, a kindergarten teacher, and a crusader for underdog causes. She was a revolutionary when it comes to changing the perspective of the Royal Family-both from above and below. Unfortunately, she also had an irrational side which led her to visibly practice, and tacitly endorse, certain forms of quackery. The most serious was her reliance upon the advice of psychics. The world has been playing a \"blame game\" in Di's death. The paparazzi, the tabloid-buying public, the driver, her body guard, and the Royal Family have all been named as sharing guilt. Add one more to the list: her psychic who failed to forewarn of the accident that took Di's life. Think about it-had the psychic warned her, three people would still be alive, several news photographers would be out of legal difficulty, and millions of us would have been spared from our terrible grief. Di's astrologer stated in a television interview that she had \"sensed\" that Di would have a short life and a tragic end because of two dreams. However, she stated that she had never mentioned this to Di because she did not want to upset her! Comment: Wow, what chutzpa! Psychics are notorious for claiming credit for having predicted big events after they have occurred, but to claim that life or death information was withheld for fear of upsetting the client is the lamest excuse by a psychic caught in failure that we've ever heard. No one seems to take psychics seriously when the chips are down. When things are going well, they get publicity for their horoscopes, channeling, fortune telling, Nostradamus interpretations, numerology, and so forth. Many common folks patronize the Psychic Hotline because rich and famous people like Di are known to rely upon psychics. Di may have been a wonderful role model for the self-centered rich and famous to learn how to give of themselves, but she also misled people by lending credibility to the idea that psychics are valid. Perhaps the fact that Di's alleged psychic blew the biggest call of her life, her tragic death can demonstrate the reality that there are no genuine psychics-only opportunists who exploit fear of the uncertain future. Psychic advisers engage in a form of mental health quackery: Mental Health Quackery The practice and promotion for gain of methods and procedures, which are not subjected to thorough systematic objective testing for reliability and validity, that are used: (1) to assess or alter personality (aka, character), aptitude, intellect; (2) as a basis for personal, family, or career counseling or advisement (these usually involve health, money, or human relationships); (3) to exploit the uncertainty of the future (ie, predict an individual's future, or future events that will impact an individual's life); (4) to exploit the fear of death, or personal loss caused by death; (5) to exploit personal weaknesses or feelings of inadequacy (ie, loneliness, spiritual emptiness, low self-esteem, personal failure); (6) to diagnose or treat behavioral disorders. LESSON ON PSYCHICS First, understand that it is redundant to say \"phoney psychics.\" True psychic ability has never been demonstrated under scientifically controlled conditions. The James Randi Educational Foundation offers over $1 million for anyone who can do so. Also, understand that there are two general categories of psychics. Type I are con artists-conscienceless scoundrels who prey upon the emotionally vulnerable. They are schooled in the art of deception. Outwitting people is their forte, and the more prominent their prey is, the more satisfying it is to the con man. Type II are delusional people who really believe in their psychic powers. For instance, one believes that by concentrating on traffic lights she can make them change from red to green; another says that she can guess who is on the telephone before she answers it; another has premonitions that always makes sense to her after the fact. These people confuse coincidence with cause, and work backward from effect to cause. They are fantasy-prone in their personalities and find a deeper reason behind even the most mundane events. It is sometimes difficult to determine whether a psychic caught in deception is a Type I or II. Some Type II psychics use deception either because their \"powers do not always work\" and they do no want to disappoint their clients; or, because they believe that it is more important to reinforce the client's belief in metaphysical powers than it is to actually perform them (ie, mind-power is ultimate power, and it must be exercised for it to be strengthened). MARKETING ANALYSIS OF HERBAL SUPPLEMENT BUYERS Leonard Wood is President of Multi-sponsor Surveys, Inc., in Princeton, NJ. He has over 25 years' experience in assessing public behavior and attitudes concerning food and nutrition. His company conducts the Gallup syndicated surveys in food and nutrition under contract. Wood says that the late 1970s and early 1980s were dominated by \"avoidance behavior,\" (ie, not eating preservatives, food colorings, possible carcinogens, etc.). The late 1980s and early 1990s saw consumers becoming more knowledgeable about the relationship between diet and health. Aging baby-boomers are coming to terms with their own mortality, and are influenced by publicity about the potential benefits of antioxidants to prevent cancer and heart disease, and slow the aging process. Consumers are more proactive, taking action now and willing to sort out the details later. The sorting out of the details by consumers does not bode well for herbal supplements. Marketers are not off to a good start. The 1996 survey of herbal supplement users found that most of the growth was coming from \"first time tryers\" who, compared to more traditional users, were: - more likely to have purchased in a supermarket or drug store than a health food store; - more likely to be light users of herbal supplements and less likely to also be taking vitamins (64% of users also take vitamins); - less knowledgeable about the herbs they used; - more concerned about the safety and efficacy of supplements they were trying. Wood warns that new users can easily be disappointed if near-term results do not live up to expectations and claims. The need for \"education\"* by herbal marketers is emphasized. He also states that the high cost of herbal supplements is discouraging to consumers. [Wood L. \"Today's proactive consumer and herbal supplements,\" HerbalGram #40, Summer, 1997, pp.50-1] * \"Education\" by the health food and supplement industry usually means indoctrination with misinformation through books, magazines, and other media wherein the purveyors are protected by the First Amendment. SPORT PERFORMANCE AIDS Stephen Barrett reviews the history of hype behind today's popular products used by athletes and body builders in an attempt to enhance their performance in the May/June Nutrition Forum. Bob Hoffman and Joe Wieder played key roles in selling the myth of \"ergogenic aids,\" and both were enriched by the market they helped create. Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw played a role in expanding the market as well. Barrett provides the straight facts on muscles and protein. He describes the work of NCAHF's David Lightsey who has probably done more investigations of company claims than anyone. It is clear that this invalid industry thrives on the basis of misinformation promoted by the industry and inaction by the regulators. ST. JOHN'S WORT The hot herb today is St. John's Wort (SJW) which is being used to treat depression. Unlike many herbal remedies, the UCB Wellness Letter (9/97) says that there is clinical evidence of the effectiveness of one of its active ingredients, hypericin, on mild depression. The herb does have side-effects. Because it may work by increasing serotonin levels, the Pharmacist's Letter (9/97) advises against using it in combination with Prozac or other antidepressants. The Lawrence Review of Natural Products (1/95) says that SJW is a powerful monoamine oxidase inhibitor which provides a pharmalogical reason for its activity. COULD THE MARKETPLACE DETERMINE THE VALUE OF ALTERNATIVE/COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH CARE? Free market ideologists are fond of the idea of letting the marketplace decide the relative value of alternative/complementary medicine (ACM) vs standard care. The primary reason that the libertarian approach of having a completely unregulated health marketplace is unworkable is because alternativists traditionally engage in unfair competition by making claims of benefit without substantiation while standard medicine builds upon evidence. Health insurance data might be used to test ACM vs standard medicine in the marketplace. An insurance policy is strictly a contract between a consumer and provider. Insuring an item does not validate its worth scientifically. Policies could be written to cover only either standard medicine or alternative medicine. If a person desires both, he or she would simply need two policies. Some flexibility could be allowed for alternative medicine, such as a checklist of what products and services one wished to have covered. Those who abhor standard medicine would not have to pay for it and vice versa. People who want to cover all of the possibilities could do so by purchasing both kinds. Insurance companies are generally regulated like a public utility. They are permitted to charge premiums that pay their costs of operation and show a reasonable profit for investors. Having separate insurance policies would offer several advantages. Actuarial data is often used to make public policy. Such a plan could soon produce outcomes data on cost-effectiveness. After all, there is an argument that can be made for the \"end of science\"a in health care. To wit: Most of the real progress in survival and longevity that is reflected in life expectancy (LEb) is due to public health environmental factors, rather than clinical medicine per se. Granted, the fact that the United States has the best life expectancy for people over 80c is said to be due to its superior medical care. However, recalling the sage observation that \"all desire to live a long life, but none wish to be old,\" the idea of extending old age is not an attractive idea. So, let us theorize that those who opt not to use standard health care would end up with 2 to 3 years lower LE-say, 72 instead of 75 at birth, and 3 or 4 at age 80. Having information on the cost-effectiveness of various standard versus ACM methods would provide a rational basis for deciding to either do nothing, employ useless-but pleasing-ACM, or go for all one can be and take on the benefit-risk of standard care. aEnd of science refers to the point at which science has provided all of the useful information that it can. This evokes Jahoda's dictum of the psychology of superstition: where chance and circumstances are not fully controlled by knowledge, man is more likely to resort to magic. bLE = the average number of years an individual is expected to live at any stated age based upon death rates for all age-groups. In 1992, the US white LE was 76.5 yrs at birth; however, while the years left to live diminishes over time, the expected terminal age rises; eg, in 1992 a 65 yr-old's LE = 17.6 yrs w/terminal age = 82.6; a 75 yr-old LE = 11.2 w/terminal age = 86.2. cUS News & World Report, 11/13/95:28. A VERY SPECIAL BOOK FOR OUR TIME: AFRAID TO EAT: CHILDREN & TEENS IN WEIGHT CRISIS, by Frances M. Berg Healthy weight expert Frances M. Berg has taken on one of the most important health problems of our time: Many of today's children are afraid to eat! Berg says that it's a fear that consumes them, shatters their lives, and even kills. It's an obsession that dims children's joy, curiosity, energy, and sense of what is normal. Berg discusses: (1) why teenage girls \"hate\" their bodies; (2) how eating disorders destroy lives; (3) why one in five teenagers is overweight; (4) how daily humiliation persecutes kids; (5) why 1 in 12 girls vomit or take laxatives to lose weight; and, (6) takes on the challenge of promoting wellness and wholeness in every child of every size. Berg tackles some of the toughest issues plaguing our society: The role models used in advertising and entertainment media who create unattainable image goals for our girls and women. Berg addresses size prejudice, which is one of the last strongholds of socially-accepted discrimination. She also tackles the animal rights zealots and their anti-animal food agenda while telling how lifestyle choices increase problems. Best of all, Berg provides many practical solutions to the problems she addresses. This is more than a penetrating analysis of a major public health problem; it is also a \"how to\" book of solutions. This a book on healthy living that goes beyond the physical to mental and social health. People interested in eating disorders will love this book. It is must reading for people who don't know about eating disorders, but do have daughters or know other young women they are concerned about.

NEW LAW WILL END SYSTEMATIC MEDICARE FRAUD & ABUSE BY CHIROPRACTORS, BUT MAKE THEM EVEN RICHER! When President Clinton signed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, among other things, he eliminated the requirement that chiropractors submit an x-ray showing a \"subluxation\" in order to be reimbursed by Medicare. The new policy will not take effect until 1/1/2000, but when it does it will end more than 20 years of intentional, systematic Medicare fraud designed by nonchiropractors but committed by DCs. Background Chiropractic is built upon the theory that \"subluxationsa,\" ie, minor deviations in vertebral alignment, are the fundamental cause of most diseases of the body. DCs do not diagnose disease as do physicians, rather, they \"analyze\" the spine for \"subluxations\" and \"correct\" these by manipulative therapy. State practice acts reflect this theory in their descriptions of what chiropractic is, and what DCs do. Dubious X-rays DCs have never been able to pass a test in which they are challenged to identify the subluxations alleged to exist on an x-ray submitted by other DCs, such as the test conducted by the National Association of Letter Carriers in the 1960s: At our invitation, representatives of both the American Chiropractic Association (ACA) and International Chiropractic Association (ICA) met in our office with one of the most reputable radiologists in the area, whom we had engaged on a temporary consultant basis. Our doctor (medical) presented 20 sets of x-rays that had been submitted by chiropractors. Each film was purported to show a subluxation; in several instances, four to six subluxations had been diagnosed on a single x-ray. One after another, each film was placed in the view box. The chiropractic representatives, including a radiologist of their own selection, were invited to point out the subluxations. Not a single one was identified. Nor did the chiropractic representatives offer a solitary comment. Medicare Inclusion In 1972, Congress caved in to political pressure to include chiropractic in Medicare, but it stipulated the x-ray provision described above. The time period coincided with the time when NCAHF president William Jarvis was doing his doctoral dissertation on chiropractic. The Dean of the Faculty of Western States Chiropractic College told Jarvis at the time that he believed the x-ray provision to be a trap laid for DCs by the same people who had embarrassed the chiropractic profession in the Letter Carriers union test. The 1972 Houston Conference To avoid the trap, in a matter of days after President Nixon signed the law authorizing payment for: the Chiropractor's manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation (demonstrated by x-rays to exist) which has resulted in a neuromusculoskeletal condition for which such manipulation is appropriate treatment. ... The Houston Conference of November, 1972 took place. Representatives from 8 chiropractic colleges, the American College on Chiropractic Roentgenology, the Council on Chiropractic Orthopedics, and others agreed upon a classification of subluxation, particularly the radiological manifestations, \"to be uniformly used in Medicare reporting.\" The conferees stated that: The advent of chiropractic inclusion in Medicare has brought the absolute necessity of a uniform method of describing, documenting, and reporting spinal subluxation so that those who will administer the law will not be confused by the present lack of uniformity and differences in reporting terminology, to our detriment. Standard medical terminology defines a subluxation as an \"incomplete or partial dislocation,\" but does not recognize the chiropractic version of the concept. In what can easily be construed as a conspiracy to deceive Medicare, the conference developed a set of diagrams to be used to report alleged \"subluxations.\" Review by the HHS Inspector General In 1986, the Inspector General of the Department of Health & Human Services reviewed chiropractic. The report stated: Because chiropractic theory regarding illness differed so greatly from mainstream medicine, the x-ray requirement was written into the benefit as an attempt to \"control program costs by insuring that a subluxation actually exists\" (from a 1978 GAO review of Medicare coverage of chiropractic). The consensus, from the chiropractic community as well as representatives of the health care field, is that the x-ray requirement has not served this purpose. ..Medicare expenditures for chiropractic services have increased at an annual rate of 18.7% between 1975 and 1984. The responses in the telephone survey (supported by information gathered during the field visits) brought into question some of the other basic assumptions inherent in the coverage. There was no clear consensus as to what a subluxation is; furthermore, in the telephone survey: - - The majority (81%) stated that, on an older person's x-ray, more \"wear and tear\" osteoarthritis and osteoporosis will show up, and not subluxations per se. - The majority of respondents (84%) said that there are subluxations that do not show up on x-rays. - Nearly half stated that, when billing Medicare, they \"could always find something\" (by x-ray or physical examination) to justify the diagnosis, or actually \"tailored\" the diagnosis to obtain reimbursement. - Many respondents ... volunteered that the majority of their Medicare patients had chronic conditions that would never be corrected, and were receiving what was essentially palliative or maintenance care for those conditions. These responses raise serious questions as to the extent that Medicare is paying for conditions that do not meet the original intent of the law. From the foregoing, it is easy to conclude the likelihood that nearly all of the money paid to DCs by Medicare since 1972 has been based upon fraud and abuse. We challenge the U.S. Justice Department to test the validity of a random sample of the x-rays that have been submitted for Medicare reimbursement under blinded conditions. NCAHF wonders if the submission of invalid x-rays by DCs over the past 20+ years is the basis of a Qui Tam lawsuitb to recover taxpayers' money taken under false pretenses. (Qui tam stands for a Latin phrase meaning \"he who brings an action for the king as well as for himself.\" It is an application of the False Claims Act passed in 1863 at the urging of President Lincoln to stop war profiteers from defrauding the Union by such practices as selling crates filled with sawdust instead of muskets, and reselling the same cavalry horses two and three times.) Effect of the new policy The up-side of the new policy is that patients may be somewhat less likely to be exposed to ionizing radiation now that DCs do not have to submit x-rays. This is uncertain because many DCs use x-rays as a way of increasing income (see The Health Robbers, pp.93-6). Always alert to the public relations angle, at the request of the ACA, the House and Senate conferees also inserted language stating: Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as legislative indication that x-ray findings are not important and can serve a purpose in the practice of chiropractic. In other words, DCs can still abuse x-rays \u2014 and be paid for them; they just are no longer mandatory. The major down-side is that DCs will have greater access to the public purse. White House budget estimators projected that the new policy would increase chiropractic reimbursement by more than $200 million over the next 5 years. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposal would cost more than $900 million. Nevertheless, grass roots lobbying and Rep. Phil Crane (R-IL) pushed the bill through the House. The Senate estimated that the new policy would increase chiropractic reimbursement by $2 billion and nearly killed the bill. However, aggressive support from Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Charles Grassley (R-IA) got it passed. Don't be surprised if the new policy costs even more. Experience has shown that DCs are experts at milking the money cow.

Of this, NCAHF president William Jarvis says, \"Pinch me, I must be dreaming!\" Since when does the NNFA worry about unproved safety or efficacy? NNFA was a driving force behind the passage of the Hatch Bill forbidding the FDA from regulating dietary supplements on the basis of safety or efficacy. Most NNFA members live off of the selling of health products that are unproved. \"Let's hope that this new-found concern over public health and safety extends itself to other health food products,\" Jarvis says. In addition to the NNFA criticism, a consumer named Rosemary Jacobs of Derby Line, Vermont, has filed a citizen's petition with the FDA asking that all orally-administered products containing colloidal silver be required to carry a warning label. Jacobs asked the FDA to consider banning all ingestible products containing silver unless the manufacturers can prove that they are effective. (Food Chemical News, 10/14/96) YAM PRODUCTS Taking hormone supplements is a current fad. People are ingesting melatonin, DHEA, human growth hormone, testosterone, etc, with a startling lack of fear. Among the popular items on the growing list are Mexican yam supplements that are alleged to become the building blocks for DHEA or progesterone. By way of background, in the not-too-distant past the main source of steroid hormones was animal glands. This was not efficient because the amounts were very small-it took 625 kg of ovaries from 50,000 sows to produce 20 mg of pure crystalline progesterone. In 1943, it was found that Mexican yams (Dioscorea species) were rich in steroidal sapogenins that could be converted to progesterone. This hormone and the process used to prepare it were the foundation stones of the Syntex Company (Pharmacognosy, 1988, p.175). Mexican yam became the principle raw material from which birth control pills (ie, \"the pill\") are made. Now the health food industry is peddling Mexican yam supplements as a \"natural\" way for women to avoid post menopausal estrogen therapy, and for others to provide their bodies with the building blocks of DHEA. People do not stop to think that any substance that actually has a hormonal effect upon the body is potentially dangerous and must be carefully monitored. The difference is that the legitimate drug companies are fulfilling their duty to warn users of their products of potential adverse effects while the health food promoters are not. Worse, they make \"natural\" seem to be synonymous with \"safe\" when it is not. Now comes a report from Aeron LifeCycles Laboratory which says that Mexican yam-containing products do not contain, nor act as precursors to, progesterone, progestin, or DHEA. (Townsend Letter, 10/96, p.104) This is good news on the safety front, but still leaves users as victims of another dietary supplement hoax. NEBRASKA OUTLAWS EPHEDRA DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS In July, the Nebraska State Legislature enacted a law that categorizes products containing ephedra as prescription only. Exempted are FDA-approved over-the-counter products. The Nebraska law is a reaction to the irresponsible 1994 Dietary Supplements Health & Education Act (DSHEA) which stripped consumers of protection from hazardous dietary supplements. It only deals with one dangerous substance being hawked by the health food industry, but it shows how states can undo the folly of bad laws passed by Congress. Obviously, what is needed is a total repeal of the DSHEA, but with the industry willing to throw big money at our lawmakers, the chance of getting the right thing done is slim. The industry is reported to have given $2.5 million to lawmakers \"to get its message across.\" GNC REMOVES EPHEDRINE PRODUCTS General Nutrition Centers has removed products containing ephedrine from its 2,700 stores due to the bad publicity the substance has been receiving in the press, which had led to a 20% drop in the value of GNC stock. Ephedra products make up about 6% of GNC's business. GNC is asking its manufacturers to reformulate products. Although a company spokesman declared that GNC was \"erring on the side of safety by removing ephedrine,\" NCAHF suspects that the fact that several states have banned ephedrine products following many deaths that have been linked to the substance is a major factor in GNC's decision. As a national chain it is important to have standard products that can be marketed in all states. (FDA Hotline, October, 1996) Comment: In some products ephedrine is being replaced with phenylalanine. According to Graedon's Best Medicine, (Bantam, 1991) \"There may be a risk of hypertension with l-phenylalanine, so this amino acid should not be taken unless under a physician's supervision.\" Graedon says that l-phenylalanine also carries a possible risk of malignant melanoma, which is no small matter to sun-loving health enthusiasts who make up an important segment of consumers of such products. Many products continue to contain caffeine in substantially higher doses than a cup of coffee. CHIROPRACTIC CENTER AT NIH On September 30, President Clinton signed into law the 1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act which includes nearly $1 million for the continuation of the \"chiropractic demonstration grants program.\" Under the 4-year-old program, chiropractic colleges conduct collaborative demonstration projects with DCs and MDs working together to diagnose and treat spinal and lower back conditions. The bill also establishes a Chiropractic Center within the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine. The primary political support for these developments came from Senators Arlen Spector (R-PA) and Tom Harkin (D-IA). Both states have chiropractic colleges. (Dynamic Chiropractic, 11/18/96) Comment: Up to now chiropractic had been largely left out of the discussion on \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" medicine at NIH. Having a designated center now catapults it ahead of some of the other guilds. This is an important, and possibly constructive development. The American Medical Associations 1997 edition of Physician's Current Procedural Terminology now includes an identification code for \"chiropractic manipulative treatment\" to \"influence joint and neurophysiological function.\" Although some may view this development as another example of the degradation of evidence-based medicine, there is some reason for optimism. The more association chiropractic has with standard health care, the more limited it becomes in its scope of practice. Chiropractic's future lies in treating low back pain, less neck rotation (because of the unjustifiable risk/benefit ratio), and an abandonment of the subluxation concept. In isolation, chiropractic got crazier. In association with standard medicine, it will become more sound. PATIENTS CAN HELP DETECT HEALTH INSURANCE FRAUD Fraudulent pharmacy practices, such as short counting prescriptions, can steal millions from Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance companies. Patients should count the number of pills in a bottle carefully to be sure they are getting the prescribed amount. If a pharmacy does not provide the full prescription and asks you to return for the remainder, be sure to do it and check the count. Always ask your doctor for the total number of pills being prescribed and match it with the number from the pharmacy. If the prescription is marked for refills, be sure to get them when the time is due. Ointments and creams should be checked for size. For example, the patient may receive a 15 g tube while the company is billed for a larger size. Medicaid and Medicare are said to be the most vulnerable to such fraudulent practices. This is the type of fraud that is least likely to attract attention of the anti-fraud agencies. It is small time stuff to them but costs the nation many millions. Only alert consumers can police such practices. RAND FINDS LITTLE JUSTIFICATION FOR NECK MANIPULATION The Rand Corporation conducted a review of the appropriateness of manipulation and mobilization of the cervical spine employing the same technique it had used to evaluate spinal manipulative therapy for back pain. A panel of nine judges (4 DCs, 4 MDs, and 1 MD/DC) rated cervical manipulation for appropriateness for specified clinical conditions. Each scenario was rated twice-once individually, and then again after a group discussion. A scale of 1 to 9 was used to judge appropriateness based upon the evaluator's opinion of its benefit-risk ratio. Only 11.1% of 736 indications for cervical manipulation were judged appropriate. The most important finding was the paucity of evidence for the benefit of these procedures. The risks of cervical spine manipulation are well documented. Estimates of risk run from as low as 1 in 40,000 manipulations for mild complications, to 1 in one million for serious complications. [Coulter, et al. The Appropriateness of Manipulation and Mobilization of the Cervical Spine. Santa Monica, CA, Rand Corp, 1996] Comment: Although the report discussed the differences between mobilization and manipulation (the latter is more forceful with extension and rotation), there was insufficient attention paid to differences in the risks of these procedures. NCAHF contends that, since neck stiffness and/or soreness are self-limited, and that there is no important medical benefit to neck manipulation, any risk of stroke or paralysis-no matter how small-is unacceptable. Even if the risk is 1 in one million, the thought of 50,000 chiros nationwide doing 20 to 40 manipulations each working day presents the nightmare of 1-2 patients a day experiencing completely avoidable strokes or paralysis. Given the history of chiropractic silence on its shortcomings, and an ideology that teaches that everyone will benefit from having his or her neck \"cracked,\" NCAHF can only repeat its strong warning against neck manipulation. KENNEY PICKS A BONE WITH THE ZONE The TV tabloid shows are gushing about the latest food fad in Hollywood: going for \"the zone\" as promoted in the book by the same title written by Barry Sears, PhD (biochemistry, Indiana University). \"The zone,\" Dr. Sears claims, is a \"nearly euphoric metabolic state\" in which athletes perform their best, those with weight problems lose their bulk, and all will reduce their risks of serious diseases. Sears recommends a 40% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 30% protein diet to live in the zone. Sears contends that the high complex carbohydrate, low fat diets recommended by Pritikin and Ornish, are dangerous. This has prompted NCAHF vice president, James Kenney, PhD (Rutgers), a nutritionist at the Pritikin Longevity Center, to respond in detail. Lest readers accuse Kenney of financial conflict of interest, please bear in mind that Sears not only is selling his book but also has a line of BioZone snack bars that will cost users about $40 per week if they follow the \"Spartacus Quick Start Plan.\" Kenney's critique fills the entire 8 pages of the Sept-Oct Nutrition & Health Forum (formerly Nutrition Forum). Bonnie Liebman didn't like The Zone either. Her 3-page critique appeared in the July-August, 1996 issue of Nutrition Action. Both give credit and criticism alike on similar points, but for dietitians and nutritionists who want the details, Kenney's critique has 56 references. CHROMIUM PICOLINATE PROMOTERS SETTLE FTC FALSE ADVERTISING CHARGES The Federal Trade Commission announced settlements with three California companies charged with making unsupported claims about weight loss and health benefits for chromium picolinate. The companies, Nutrition 21, Body Gold, and Universal Merchants, were unable to provide solid scientific evidence to back their claims. [FTC News Notes, 11/4/96] CAN STANDARD MEDICINE EMPLOY \"ALTERNATIVE\" & \"COMPLEMENTARY\" MEDICINE WITHOUT LIABILITY? Trial lawyers should be licking their chops as naive hospital administrators rush to market alternative medicine because it is a fad. The reason is that when things go badly standard medicine cannot be protected from legal liability in the same way nonstandard practitioners have in the past. An investigation of why the attorneys who have managed to make a good living off of medical malpractice cases haven't been able to make a dent in the problem of quackery uncovered some important reasons why patients this is so. Deep Pockets Lawyers pursue \"deep pockets,\" and off-beat practitioners avoid looking like good target. Many do not carry insurance, a fact that they inform patients about by posting signs in their offices (patients are not always warned but find out after the fact). In a sad case in which a woman was paralyzed from the neck down by a chiropractor, she found that he had no insurance whatever because he had crippled 2 others and could not buy insurance. Most of his assets were in his wife's name, and his worth was only about $50,000. No attorney was willing to do all of the necessary work for such a paltry collectible award. Differing standards of conduct Acupuncturists, chiropractors, naturopaths, etc, do not practice medicine; therefore, they cannot be held to medical standards. Case: An Oregon woman fell on her tail bone. She went to a chiropractor instead of a physician. He x-rayed her back, but didn't see the fracture. After some time, she developed chronic, severe back pain. A physician found that the failure to immobilize her fractured vertebra had caused bone spurs to develop. She sued but lost because, in the eyes of the law she had gotten what she had paid for-she had chosen the chiropractor \"at her own risk.\" Other chiropractors had testified that he had followed standard practice for chiropractors. This defense won't work when it can be shown that patients believed that they were chosing medicine, and that the provider knew-or ought to have known-that the safety of the \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" procedure was unproven which is inherent in the definitions of such procedures. Primum non nocere (\"above all, do no harm\") is the oldest consumer protection principle in history. Culpability For Referrals Even if patients are referred out, medical doctors or clinics referring patients to nonstandard practitioners carry a degree of responsibility if things go badly. Administrators should be alert to the fact that nonstandard practitioners generally employ a kind of \"heads I win, tails they lose\" psychology. When things go well they take the credit, but when things go badly they blame standard medicine. Alternative practitioners have traditionally substituted patient satisfaction for true clinical effectiveness. Their ability to convert patients to their way of thinking generally puts the patient on the side of the alternative practitioner when disputes arise. Barnum wisely advised, \"Never try to beat a man at his own game.\" A MOTHERING GROUND OF QUACKERY William T. Jarvis, Ph.D. During 25 years of studying quackery, I have been struck by the high proportion of major types of quackery that originated in a relatively small region of western Europe. Herbalisma, magnetic Gerson cancer therapyk, to name a few. I believe that the European tradition of alchemy which was embodied in the German alchemist, Paracelsus (1493-1541), seeker of medical remedies, is significant. Paracelsus, who was extreme in both mysticism and intelligent observation, is an icon who has inspired a devoted following of medical cranks and influential lay persons-among them Prince Charles [1]. Although already familiar with Paracelsus from my study of medical history, I had the opportunity to read Paracelsus's writings first hand while a witness in a case involving the starvation death of a 17-month-old Canadian child. The Germany-reared herbalist responsible for the tragedy was so devoted to Paracelsus that he had translated his books into English and used them as his source of authority. Medical historians give Paracelsus some credit for his views, but most of what he taught is very weird by any standard. Skrabanek said that \"Paracelsianism is fundamental to the credibility of holistic medicine, and that it is no coincidence that Paracelsus was resurrected by Nazi leaders in their promulgation of naturopathy.\" [1] Naturopathy began in the 19th century German water cure spas, and Germans today are said to be \"by far the world's leading spa-goers\" with more than 6 million going on a \"cure\" each year [2]. In Germany, 7 out of 10 general practitioners practice alternative medicine [3]. A dozen off-beat clinics in the region promote unproven cancer cures-most are in Germany. Use of unproven cancer remedies in the region are the highest ever reported: Germany (65.7%), Austria (59%), and Switzerland (52% & 70%). [4] Many of these bogus cancer remedies are available at Mexico border clinics. A large homeopathic medicine industry thrives in Europe-90,000 of the 126,000 medicines on the market in Germany are \"homeopathic and natural medicines.\" [5] The European Common (EC) Market situation forced pharmacists there to face up to the reality that homeopathy is a delusion. Even after a debate that acknowledged homeopathy's absurdities, pharmacists voted to continue selling irrational homeopathic remedies. Despite its name, the EC's European Medicines Evaluation Agency does not evaluate medicines but merely coordinates the evaluations of drugs made by EC member states [6]. Alderidge provides a description of nonstandard medicine in specific European countries [7]. It's not a pretty picture for those who believe in evidence-based medicine. The next time someone tells you about medicines that are available in Europe that our hard-nosed FDA won't allow into this country-remember its legacy of quackery. Citations.

NEW BOOK ON MAGNETISM PROVIDES TOOLS FOR DEBUNKING VITALISM Belief in vitalism, \"the doctrine that the functions of a living organism are due to a vital principle distinct from physicochemical forces\" (Webster's Dictionary); or, \"the theory that biological activities are directed by a supernatural force; opposed to mechanism\" (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary) provides the conceptual underpinnings that sustains the perpetual plague of quackery. Vitalistic of the \"physicochemical forces\" despised by vitalists embraces the physics of magnetism, an understanding of which is key to debunking vitalistic psychobabble. Dr. James Livingston makes the physics of magnetism clear in his marvelous book, Driving Force (Harvard, 1996). Livingston writes in a delightfully readable style. Readers will not only learn marvelous facts about lodestones, how the earth generates its own electromagnetic field, and the role of magnetism in nearly every modern technology, but they will also see how pseudosciences have exploited the mystery of magnetism for their purposes. Livingston provides useful information on how magnets are used to deceive people for entertainment by magicians, and how these same tricks have been used by phoney psychics, such as Uri Geller, to deceive the public. Kusche wisely stated that the less a person knows about a subject, the easier it is to make it into a mystery, in his debunking of the Bermuda Triangle myth (The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved, Warner, 1975). Livingston explains the lack of science and the appropriate skepticism that should be applied to magnet products that claim to treat pain and disease. Nikken, Oriental Medical Supplies, and other companies are discussed with the caveat that none of these products have proven value for anything medical. This is contrasted with understandable explanations about how the medical marvels like Magnetic Resonance Imagery, positron emission tomography, and computerized taxial tomography work. Carl Sagan has said that the appeal of pseudosciences is that they seem to provide insight into the construct of the universe and how things work. Sagan contends that the realities science uncovers are more wondrous than the fantasies of the mystics. Livingston has filled in the information we need to appreciate what Sagan was talking about. I have put Driving Force on my basic reading list for anyone who seeks the knowledge needed to attack pseudoscience and quackery at their foundations.

[Neurology, 1995;45:2284] BOOK EXPOSES NEW AGE THINKING FOUNDATIONS OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE The Death of Truth (Bethany House, 1996) is written by scientists and theologians from a Christian perspective, but the information that it contains is valuable to anyone who wants to understand the thinking behind much of today's \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" medicine. Donal P. O'Mathuna points out that people who are seeking health care advice from alternative medicine sources \"are receiving religious instruction.\" He says, that \"These therapies are spiritually based, and ought to be presented as such. It is unethical for these religious practices to promote themselves as medicine.\" O'Mathuna hits the nail right on its head when he points out that much of the objection to alternative and complementary medicine, from the perspective of consumer protection law, is that religious rituals are being falsely and misleadingly labeled and advertised as science-based therapies. The book presents alternativism as a combination of old-fashioned spiritualism and New Age postmodernism. The book lays bare many of the ideas that drive today's intellectual climate which is so friendly to antiscientism. Although the book is clearly directed to the Christian community, its message is important for all of society. Its content is scholarly and academically sound. The book is a project of the Xenos Christian Fellowship in Columbus, Ohio. Order from Bethany Books, Minneapolis, MN. VINEGAR REMEDY GONE, BUT NOT FOREVER A recent court order resulted in the destruction of 13,320 half-gallon bottles of Jogging in a Jug-a mixture of grape and apple juices, and vinegar-because the product became an unapproved new drug due to health claims made by promoters. Jack McWilliams, owner of Third Option Laboratories, Muscle Shoals, Alabama, claimed that his vinegar product had helped him conquer his own arthritis and heart disease, and could reduce the risk of cancer in the internal organs. McWilliams claimed that the reason women craved pickles during pregnancy was because they wanted acetic acid (vinegar). Despite the court- ordered destruction of these jugs, Third Option is still in business and is working with the FDA on ways to market the product legally. Company officials met with FDA in 1992 and agreed to stop making health claims, but complaints continued, resulting in action on May 19, 1994 that led to the court-ordered destruction. [FDA Consumer, Jan-Feb, 1996, pp.35-6] Last year Third Option paid the FTC $480,000 to settle charges of false advertising.[Consumer Reports, July, 1995] Comment: Apple cider vinegar has a long tradition as a folk remedy. In 1958, Vermont physician D.C. Jarvis (no relation to NCAHF's Jarvis) wrote Folk Medicine, a book which extolled apple cider vinegar and honey as remedies for just about everything, and even hunting dogs were said to perform better if given apple cider vinegar. Jarvis's book did not claim to be based upon science. It was folksy, anecdotal, and opinionated in its tone. Curiously, another health guru, John Harvey Kellogg, MD, taught that vinegar was a poison that belonged only in the laboratory. MANNATECH A new multilevel firm is promoting itself as a \"nutraceutical frontrunner\" (\"nutraceutical\" is a marketing term for foods that favorably alter the structure or function of the body beyond what normal foods can do). The company's lead product, Manapol, is simply aloe vera juice. Promoters acknowledge that many counterfeit products emerged during past aloe vera fads, but this juice is the real thing. The true story on aloe vera is that breaking off a leaf from a living plant and applying the juice to a burn is one of the best first aid measures one can use. Aloe vera juice is also used in burn wards to soothe, protect and moisten wounds. The problem with marketing the juice is that it doesn't keep well. Processing inactivates the ingredient that produces the desired effects. So, many aloe vera products contain processed juice that has lost the plant's helpful properties. According to Mannatech's own literature, aloe vera expert Ivan Danhof, PhD, MD, warned aloe promoters about making claims, and on the instability of beta-1,4-mannan molecules. Mannatech says that the \"future of aloe vera belongs to those who have the ability to stabilize and standardize (emphasis added) this labile polysaccharide,\" and that Manapol is the \"only commercially processed aloe vera product capable of achieving and make the claim for standardizing betamannans.\" Mannatech does not claim to be able to stabilize betamannans, which is what is needed for the substance to be effective. Mannatech's wording appears to be clever sleight-of-mouth deception. The whole matter hangs on the question of Manapol's effectiveness, which they also tend to weasel on. Although it is a separate company, Mannatech has a licensing agreement with Carrington Laboratories, an aloe processor. Carrington has a jaded history on Wall Street in connection with its product Carrisyn. Carrisyn was said to have an Investigational New Drug (IND) permit from the FDA as a topical gel for treating bedsores. Carrington announced that it had filed for patents in 43 countries for Carrisyn on the news that the drug might be useful for AIDS. AIDS is a buzzword that sends stocks flying. It turned out that there was more hype than reality there, and the FDA denied that it had issued an IND for Carrisyn. It had only assigned a number to Carrington's IND application. All of this produced quite a stink among investment watchdogs, which was detailed in two reports in Barron's (9/22/86 & 9/29/86). NCAHF believes that extreme caution is advised on Mannatech. IS THE CLAIM THAT NATURAL PRODUCTS CANNOT BE PATENTED TRUE? The oft-repeated retort as to why herbal companies cannot afford to properly test and market their remedies is that herbs are natural substances and, therefore, cannot be patented. They say without patents to protect their investment, no company can afford the research and development costs. There is something wrong with this argument. First, we notice in its advertisements that the shark cartilage (a natural substance) supplement Cartilade is patented. Second, vitamins cannot be patented, and yet the last estimate of sales we saw was $4 billion. Just about anyone who wants to can buy bulk vitamins, package and label them, and sell them to retail outlets (or directly by mail-order). It is catchy product names and creative marketing that makes these products sell. Why can't herbal companies do the same? Developers merely need to standardize their product and sell it in bulk to distributors. Whoever is first marketing ought to be able to corner the market, especially if they beat others to contract with the herb growers. NCAHF would like to hear from anyone who can provide reliable information on this. GROWTH HORMONE LIMITED IN VALUE FOR REJUVENATION Howard Turney has been promoting the use of human growth hormone replacement as a method of rejuvenation for older men through his company the El Dorado Rejuvenation & Longevity Institute. Turney organized a network of 38 physicians who supply the hormone on a referral basis. Julian Whitaker, MD is named as one of these. Turney also offers the substance at a clinic he set up in Cancun, Mexico. Human growth hormone is a legal, scientifically valid substance that is approved for correcting the growth of growth hormone-deficient children. It is marketed by Genentech, Inc. and Eli Lilly & Company. A Genentech spokesman told the Wall Street Journal (1/10/96) that \"At the dosage levels you have to go to get helpful anti-aging effects, it runs amok with side-effects.\" The idea that aging men might benefit from hormone replacement therapy of some sort is not far fetched. Just as post-menopausal women can maintain a somewhat younger frame and appearance, and feel a whole lot better, on hormone replacement therapy, so might men. A major difference between men and women is that women have the physiological landmark of menopause by which to gauge their bodily changes. Men can only estimate the point when their bodies make similar changes (such as observing their close male relatives to get an idea as to when they stopped looking relatively athletic and became \"grumpy old men\"). In the future doctors may be able to analyze a man's biochemistry and come up with a safe and effective hormone replacement cocktail, but right now men who want to get rolling again must play Russian roulette with people like Turney and his associates. We report on a recent study of the effects of human growth hormone on healthy men: 52 healthy men 70-85 years of age with well-preserved functional ability, but low baseline insulin-like growth factor 1 levels, were given 0.03 mg/kg doses of growth hormone or a placebo 3 times per week for 6 months. Body composition, knee and hand grip muscle strength, systemic endurance (VO2max during exercise cycle test), and cognitive function (4 different tests) were measured. The experimental group improved in lean body mass (the placebo group got worse); no differences were seen in knee or grip strength, or systemic endurance between the groups. T he hormone group improved on one functional test, did poorer on another, while there were no differences on the other two. 26 men in the hormone group had 48 incidents of side effects (26 placebo men had 14 side effect incidents). Dose reduction was required in 26% of the hormone subjects. [Papadakis. Annals of Internal Medicine,, 1996;124:708-16] USE OF ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE BY CANADIAN CHILDREN Pediatricians at the University of Montreal studied the use of alternative medicine (AM) by children attending the general outpatient clinic of Montreal University Hospital. The study covered a 4-month period (Jan-Apr '92). 1,911 questionnaires were analyzed. 208 (11%) children had used one or more forms of AM since birth. Despite the availability of more than 100 types of AM, 84% used only four kinds: chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy or acupuncture. The following information was presented on the considered to be poorly absorbed by the body. **Healing system based on the manipulation of bones or other body parts. (Note. Osteopathy has been reformed to a science-based profession in the United States The conditions for which children were treated by these practitioners by number use AM were: |Factor||Number||Percentage| |Word of attention||40||9| |Other reasons||22||5| 69% of parents of the children who used AM also used it on themselves. Only the child's age (>1 yr) and mother's education (better) were independently related to use (authors speculated that the fact that better educated mothers are more exposed to sources of information could explain this). 59% of parents noted an improvement in their child's condition following alternative treatment. When asked to compare their experience with regular and AM, 45% rated them equal. However, three times as many parents preferred AM who used it themselves. In Canada, healt h care for children is generally free of out-of-pocket fees, but not all AM is covered. 52% of the AM used in this study was paid for in whole or in part by the parents. 29% was paid for by private insurance, and 9% was given free. The authors admonish physicians to ask their patients about their use of AM, and to be vigilant about possible harmful effects of some forms of AM. [Spigelblatt, et al. \"The use of alternative medicine by children,\" Pediatrics, 1994;94:811-14] Comment: We have presented only some of the study's scope and findings. Readers who are interested in probing the psycho-social dynamics of AM use would do well to carefully examine the methodology of this well-conceived study. It provides the kind of information needed to analyze what is happening in this important behavior. RESEARCHERS SAY HARM BY FAITH HEALING IS GREATER THAN BY SATANIC RITUALS University of Chicago psychologist Bette Bottoms, et al, studied 3 types of child abuse: physical, sexual and medical neglect by religious authorities. The researchers surveyed over 19,000 mental health professionals to identify clinicians who had encountered relevant cases, followed by a detailed survey of 2,136 who reported at least one ritual or religion-related case of abuse; 37% responded. The researchers described \"in statistical detail cases involving the withholding of medical care for religious reasons, abuses related to attempts to rid a child of evil, and abuse perpetrated by persons with religious authority such as ministers and priests.\" The most frequent type of abuse involved sexual abuse by clergy. Male and female victims were about equally common. The psychological sequelae of sexual abuse are described, with depression being most common in all types of abuse. From the important perspective of consumer protection, researchers state: Perhaps our most disturbing finding is that cases involving medical neglect were unlikely to be prosecuted even in the face of compelling evidence and the extreme nature of the abuse. The authors' conclusion included a compelling bit of irony: Our study leads us to believe that there are more children actually being abused in the name of God than in the name of Satan. Ironically, while the public concerns itself with passing laws to punish satanic child abuse, laws remain established that protect parents whose particular variants of belief in God deny their children life-saving medical care. The freedom to choose religions and to practice them will, and should, be protected by our constitution. The freedom to abuse children in the course of those practices ought to be curtailed. In the long run, society should find ways to protect children from religion-related abuse and to help religions evolve in the direction of better treatment of children. An article describing the survey's findings and their ramifications is entitled, \"In the name of God: a profile of religion-related child abuse.\" It appeared in the Journal of Social Issues, 1995:51(2):85-111. ANTIFLUORIDATIONISTS, THE FLAT EARTH SOCIETY, HOLOCAUST DENIERS, AND THOSE WHO SAY WE NEVER LANDED ON THE MOON Times have changed. Antifluoridationism, which was once the leading bellwether of antiscience terrorism and proquackery sentiment, appears to now have taken its rightful place along side the flat earth society, holocaust deniers, and those who believe that we never actually landed on the moon. In 1977 a physician wanting to find out more about the laetrile movement went to a rally. To his surprise, instead of boosting laetrile they spent the night bashing fluoridation [1] A study of the prolaetrile movement by sociologists found that neither \"incidence of,\" or \"death from cancer in the immediate family\" were useful predictors of either \"participation in the or \"the of fluoridation\" was the strongest zero-order correlate of organizational participation in the Laetrile movement, and tied as second strongest factor in the use of Laetrile [2]. Fluoridation has been at the interface of quackery and public unrest because it was the whipping boy for government intrusion into our lives. In the 1950s fluoridation was said to be a Communist plot to poison America. This sounds silly today, especially since fluoridation is an American idea that has been adopted by many (formerly) Communist countries, but it was taken seriously by some people then. Today the battle over government intrusion is symbolized by abortion protests, Kevorkian-assisted suicides, Waco, Ruby Ridge, Oklahoma City, and the Freemen. In March the LLU School of Public Health staged a fluoridation confrontation as part of its annual homecoming convention. They had to dredge the bottom to find anyone to speak in opposition. They ended up with an \"orthomolecular psychiatrist,\" and a cranky physician from Canada who relied upon discredited antifluoridation propaganda. A clique of supporters in the audience seemed to be patients of the psychiatrist. Antifluoridation spokespersons seem to be an endangered species. No one knowledgeable about fluoride opposes fluoridation, and professional antifluoridationist John Yiamouyannis has lost all credibility. Since the 1996 California mandate to fluoridate, as expected, there have been a few attempts by the media to exploit the controversial nature of fluoridation by wanting to stage on-air debates. William Jarvis has taught public health dentistry at the LLU School of Dentistry for more than two decades, and is well able to speak publicly on the matter. Nevertheless, he has declined to participate in such events because he believes that the debate setting is inappropriate for addressing the safety or efficacy of fluoridation. These are scientific questions that can be settled only by evidence. Antis can spread more misinformation in five minutes than can be convincingly refuted in five hours \u2014 if ever. The only way a fair debate could be held would be in the presence of a referee who was so well-informed on the issues that he/she could immediately rule when one side or the other was misrepresenting the facts. Otherwise, factual data are quickly dismissed and mere opinion prevails. When asked to participate in such events, Jarvis challenges the media to be socially responsible in matters involving public health science. He points out that the debate setting is appropriate for the airing of social issues that are based on opinion, but not science. Debating scientific questions merely confuses the public and causes people to become more fearful of technology. A study of public attitudes on controversial issues (fluoridation and nuclear power) found that the mere quantity of coverage caused the public to become more conservative [3]. The power to frighten and stampede the public was demonstrated recently by the \"mad-cow disease\" panic in England. The media has the duty to report on issues of public interest, but they also have a duty to put their reports into proper perspective. Because of the inordinate amount of effort involved, they often settle for following formulas such as \"presenting both sides and letting the public decide.\" The problem is that the public doesn't have the skill or insight, and the result is more confusion, doubt, and conservatism. The time has come for the media to treat antifluoridationism in the manner that it deserves to be treated-as an aberration that has outlived its time.

A \"COLUMBUS AWARD\" TO EVAN SHUTE, MD AS EVIDENCE MOUNTS THAT VITAMIN E PROTECTS AGAINST HEART ATTACKS Professor William Jarvis has pursued the idea that \"Yesterday's quackery is going to be tomorrow's scientific medicine\" for more than 25 years. Nearly every quack invokes \"the Galileo ploy\" claiming to be an innovator ahead of the times. Jarvis studies the history of medical science as part of his teaching of research methodology and the epidemiology of quackery. He has searched for candidates for a \"Galileo Award,\" but none of the commonly cited examples (eg, Jenner, Semmelweis) can hold up to scrutiny as one-time quacks. But now, because of the accumulating scientific evidence that vitamin E may be protective against heart attacks, the late Evan Shute, MD, is emerging as a possible candidate for a \"Columbus Award.\" (Columbus was laughed at for claiming that the Earth was round. He turned out to be right. Most crank scientists claim to be in the same situation. Few have been. Carl Sagan has noted that they also laughed at Bozo the Clown, and there have been more Bozos than Columbuses.) Vitamin E was originally associated with the fertility of the Norwegian rat. For many years it was called \"a vitamin in search of a disease\" because so many attempts to link it to anything other than hemolytic anemia in newborns had failed. The vitamin gained some respectability as a weak antioxidant that may have some value in protecting against the effects of air pollution, but the effect had no practical significance. Some alarm was expressed when vitamin E was shown to affect fibrocystic breast disease in women. The ability of a substance to affect tissue believed to be more susceptible to becoming cancerous is no small matter. The ability of vitamin E to significantly alter hormonal function meant the nutrient in large amounts acts as a drug. More recently, vitamin E has been tested for its ability to inhibit the blood-clotting process, which is similar to the effects of aspirin. Vitamin E is more desirable for regular ingestion because it doesn't have the potential to cause stomach bleeding as does aspirin, although the amount of aspirin is small, and usually safe if taken with meals. Both substances increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Dr. Shute, an obstetrician and gynecologist, his brother Wilfred (a cardiologist), and Dr. Albert Vogelsang claimed in 1946 that large doses of vitamin E were beneficial in four major types of heart disease. Evan Shute's book The Heart and Vitamin E and Related Matters recommends vitamin E for the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure, gangrene, nephritis, angina pectoris, varicose veins, and other conditions. It also claims that vitamin E can heal wounds without leaving scars, and can prevent senility and stroke if taken from an early age. The Shute Institute, managed by the Shute Foundation for Medical Research, began publishing The Summary in 1949 to present the Shutes' ideas because of the admitted \"inability of the Shute Foundation to get its presentations published in North American medical journals.\" Shute's work was not up to standard because he considered controlled clinical trials to be \"unethical, illegal and immoral.\" Wilfred left the Institute in 1957, but Evan continued the fight until his death in 1978. Ironically, he died of heart disease. Such an award to Dr. Shute is limited by the fact that vitamin E hasn't turned out to be the panacea that he claimed, but it appears to have some definite benefit in preventing heart attacks, a claim that brought much criticism his way. Of course, he deserved criticism because he refused to use the scientific channels available to him. Nevertheless, Shute deserves some acknowledgment for a degree of validity in his premature views on vitamin E and heart problems.

SHARK CARTILAGE DEMAND SAID DECIMATING WILDLIFE According to a report from Costa Rica, the demand for shark cartilage, the dubious cancer remedy promoted on CBS's 60 Minutes in late February, has increased production more than 7-fold at Tecnologica del Tiburon, the processing plant at Puntarenas. Shark has become the most profitable catch for local fishermen. Much of the shark is caught in waters 300 miles from the processing plant in Puntarenas near pristine and protected Cocos Island-illegally within the 9-mile limit. Sharks may not be able to withstand the demand since most commercial species do not begin breeding until they are 10-12-years-old. Many produce just two offspring per breeding cycle. The factory is not worried about depletion. Its manager says that \"when there is a scarcity, we will import cartilage from Guatemala or El Salvador.\" The company also plans to open a factory at Bluefields, a small Nicaraguan Caribbean coastal town. The report points out that both the chief of oncology at Costa Rica's National Children's Hospital and a spokesperson for the National Cancer Institute consider shark cartilage for cancer a farce. The report says: If a Costa Rican enterprise is contributing both to medical fraud and ecological disaster, the country seems unconcerned. President Rafael Calderon presided over Tecnologica del Tiburon's inauguration. Last year, Costa Rico's Export Council awarded the factory its prize as the most original new export business. (Jimenez J. \"Disputed cancer 'cure' spells disaster for Tropical Conservation News-bureau, 4/26/93; contact 212-677-1900). Comment: This is not the first instance in which demand for bogus medicine has threatened wildlife.

CHILD ABUSE STEMMED FROM DC'S MEDICAL INCOMPETENCE We've been following a sad and bizarre court case at San Jose, California, in which a father is accused of beating his 11-year-old son with a belt, stick and wooden spoon because the boy refused to eat his own vomit! The father, 47-yr-old Stanford University accountant Dan Bloomquist, and his 50-yr-old wife, relied on the advice of chiropractor William \"Bud\" Keith. The boy was eventually diagnosed as suffering from Addison's disease, but was thought by Keith to be suffering from \"a mental block.\" The Bloomquists were devoted followers of Keith who based his teachings on health, nutrition and interpersonal relations on the scriptures. They are reported to have followed Keith's regimen of exercise, diet and supplements \"religiously.\" This sad case seems to have resulted primarily from Keith's inability to diagnose the boy's illness and his failure to refer the family to a medical doctor. Keith took the 5th Amendment when asked to testify in the case. The Bloomquists were described as \"loving parents.\" Curiously, the couple's 14-yr-old daughter, who suffered from similar symptoms, died of intestinal collapse on a family car trip to Arizona in 1985. (San Jose Mercury News, 5/93) CHINA CRACKS DOWN ON QUACKERY EXPORTS A Chicago Tribune report says that after looking the other way for years, Chinese authorities have decided to crack down on the sale of magic cures for ailments considered incurable in the rest of the world. Chinese promoters have been cashing in on the fame of China's ancient and mystical medical traditions. A new commission will examine the composition of the pastes, potions and pills being peddled to the desperate. The action may have been prompted by a huge street banner advertising Love Solution, a cream that could kill the AIDS virus \"within two minutes.\" Recently, the New China news agency announced that a Danish company had bought 40 tons of capsules alleged to prevent AIDS, paying $260 million. The same day the People's Daily announced that a Chinese doctor had cured AIDS in Tanzania using traditional Chinese medicine. There also is a toothpaste than claims to cure senility. MAGNETIC DEVICES SEIZED U.S. Marshals recently seized and destroyed $42,000 worth of Elekiban magnetic devices. Promoters claimed these would stimulate blood circulation and relieve stiffness in the shoulder, neck and waist. In addition to unsubstantiated claims, promoters falsely claimed that Elekiban had FDA approval. These products were manufactured in Japan and promoted by its Canadian partners and a New York based distributor. (FDA Consumer, 6/93) MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENT EDUCATION BOOK SUPERIOR Therapeutic Claims in Multiple Sclerosis 3rd ed. (1992) is a model resource that both informs and insulates patients against quackery. The book presents in brief, understandable terms the structure and function of the central nervous system (target of MS), how MS is diagnosed, who gets it, what is known about causes, a description of its natural course without treatment, and how its progress is measured. With this background, readers can understand the need for controlled studies to determine the validity of treatments. The book describes the history and rationale for treatments used to treat MS, how they have been arrived at, and continuing problems faced by clinicians and researchers. Individual treatments are described, their rationale presented, an evaluation given, risks/costs described, followed by a concluding statement of the current status of the procedure in the opinion of the IFMSS* Therapeutic Claims Committee. These summaries permit readers to understand the background of therapies and why they may not be still in use. Additional chapters cover methods used to prevent worsening of MS, symptomatic and general management, and miscellaneous empirical treatments. Included is a plethora of speculative interventions from dental amalgam removal to megadoses of vitamins. This book is truly the source for reliable information on therapies currently in use and a guide to what doesn't work for MS; it a must-have for anyone interested in MS patient education. As a model, this book has the advantage of only having to deal with a single disorder (for instance, scores of books would have to be written for cancer since different diseases and treatments are involved); however, it provides an example of how to provide patients with the information needed to judge medical procedures.

MYSTICAL DIETS: EXPOSES METAPHYSICAL NUTRITION BELIEFS AND PRACTICES Jack Raso, MS,RD, presents Mystical Diets (Prometheus, 1993, 291 pp) which exposes paranormal, spiritual, and occult nutrition beliefs and practices. Chapter one \"From believer to skeptic: my personal odyssey\" is worth the price of the book as Raso describes his past experiences as a supplement junkie, health food store \"nutritionist,\" health seeker, and his eventual acceptance of reality. Raso identifies the thread that runs through most of the healing systems covered by the book as a belief in a \"vital force\" (\"healing power\") that goes by many names* Included the mystical diets are: Macrobiotics, Natural Hygiene (naturopathy, TC Fry, Harvey Diamond), Cayce (A.R.E. Clinic), Ayurvedic Medicine, FAIM (Atkins, Huggins, Schachter, Wright, McGrady), Anthroposophical Medicine, Gerson cancer treatment, Matol Km, Nature's Sunshine, Nutripathy, mail order nutrition (a survey of products advertised in popular publications), chiropractic nutrition, nutrition diploma mills (\"nontraditional\" health education), and useful glossary to help sort out terms. The individuals, products and services named in this short review are only a sampling of what this book covers.

QUACKERY IN DRUG ADS After addressing a group of pharmaceutical industry scientists on quackery, my host stated that his company's marketing staff needed to hear my presentation because many of their practices fit the criteria of quackery. A recent report verifies what he said. A study of 109 full-page pharmaceutical ads from 10 leading medical journals in which 2 physician specialists and 1 academic clinical pharmacist, using FDA guidelines, judged their educational value and overall quality found: - The information on drug efficacy and side-effects was unbalanced in 40% of the ads (balanced in 49%). - 32% of the headlines were judged to be misleading as to efficacy. - In 44% of the cases, reviewers felt that the message would lead to improper prescribing if a physician had no other information than that supplied by the ad. - 57% of the ads were judged to have little or no educational value. - Overall the reviewers would not have recommended publication of 28% of the ads, and would have required major revisions of 34% before publication. - The reviewers felt that many ads had deficiencies in areas were the FDA has established explicit standards of quality, and that strategies are needed to ensure consumer protection. (Annals of Internal Medicine, 1992;116:951-2) This report recalls a statement by Dr. Kennet h Milstead, an FDA official, who was seeking to mark the border beyond which quackery lay: When an untrue or misleading health claim is ... made for a food, drug, device or cosmetic, this is quackery. ... It matters not whether the quackery is practiced by the witch doctor or the licensed medical practitioner; the Indian medicine man or the pharmacist; the proprietary drug manufacturer or the prescription drug manufacturer; ... the fly-by-night operator or some of our most respected food, drug, device and cosmetic manufacturers \u2014 it is still quackery. (In The Medical Messiahs, Princeton Univ Press, 1967, p.269) Overblown pharmaceutical ads may not be as dangerous as promotions of Mexico cancer clinics, but to make consumer protection laws enforceable, there has to been consistency in what is regarded as quackery. Drug marketers can help by setting a proper example. FACILITATED COMMUNICATION The parents of handicapped children are at high risk to fads. A recent addition to the list of unproven methods alleged to help deal with autism is facilitated communication (FC), an import from Australia. FC is communication by a person whose response is expressed through the use of equipment and is dependent upon the assistance of another. The problem is that the person doing the facilitating cannot always distinguish between the input of the one being facilitated and their own. Mulick, et al, discuss in detail the vulnerability of the parents of autistic children, and the theory, practices and problems of FC in The Skeptical Inquirer, Spring, 1993. THE STRAIGHT STORY ON MILKRemember the attack on milk for kids launched by the animal-rights supported Physicians for Responsible Medicine? The group presented old information as news and distorted it to fit its agenda. Meister sets the record straight in \"much ado about milk,\" Priorities, Spring, 1993. The information is worth having because attacks on milk are recycled periodically. NCAHF PRESIDENT DEBATES CONSUMER PROTECTION NEED William Jarvis, PhD and Jane Orient, MD, squared off in a \"Point/Counter-point debate on \"Should companies be able to distribute unproven medicines without government intervention?\" in the Winter, 1993 issue of Priorities, a publication of the American Council on Science and Health. Consumer health educators will find this debate a useful tool for discussing the need for consumer protection in our free enterprise society.

DENTAL MERCURY SAFETY A report by the U.S. Public Health Service says there is no solid evidence of harm from dental mercury amalgams. The report, Dental Amalgam: A Public Health Service Strategy for Research, Education, and Regulation, said that mercury can cause rare allergic reactions. It recommends monitoring for possible long-term effects. (The Nation's Health, May-June, 1993) GASTON NAESSENS' 714-X 714-X is a substance produced in Quebec by Gaston Naessens. It has been analyzed by the Canadian Health Protection Branch and found to contain a mixture of camphor, ammonium chloride and nitrate, sodium chloride, ethanol and water. Approval for the medicinal use of 714-X in Canada would require documentation of the product's safety and efficacy. As of March, 1993, no substantive evidence had been submitted to Health and Welfare Canada's Health Protection Branch on the safety or efficacy of 714-X and the agency says that it regards the substance to be an unproven product. The Expert Advisory Committee on HIV Therapy to the Health Protection Branch has unanimously deplored the use of 714-X for the treatment of cancer or AIDS. The Committee stressed that there could be adverse side-effects from this treatment. Under Canada's Emergency Drug Release Program a physician may request an unapproved drug on compassionate plea for a patient. (From: 714-X: An Unproven Product, Health Protection Branch Issues, 1/25/90; rechecked 3/93) Gaston Naessens has a long history of promoting dubious cancer remedies. In 1950 he was peddling GN-24 (his initials) in Switzerland which was a secret \"chemotherapeutical formula\" found to contain some mineral salts and methylene blue. In 1959, he introduced Anablast, another secret remedy alleged to act not on cancer cells but \"what causes their release.\" Naessens' claims that Anablast could treat leukemia led to a public furor in Corsica on behalf of Naessens who had been convicted of unlawfully practicing medicine in 1956. In 1964 the French Ministry of Public Health warned of false cures and sent the Inspector General of Public Health to conduct inquiries. Naessens agreed to a test and failed. He was again convicted of practicing medicine and pharmacy illegally in 1965. Naessens claimed to have studied biology at the University of Lille, but records fail to verify this. (Unproven Methods of Cancer Management, American Cancer Society, 1967) Naessens immigrated to Canada (c.1972) and became its problem as he began to build a support group for his \"ultramicroscopic condenser\" alleging to see \"somatids\" (said to be \"DNA precursors, the ground-zero elements of life\"). Naessens has attracted a following of desperate patients and ding-a-ling freelance writers who spin yarns about the grand medical conspiracy to squelch innovative cancer cures. These conspiratorial scenarios have a ready audience, and Naessens has become one of the folk heroes of the paranoid faction. In 1985, Drs. Carter and Valli, of the Ontario Veterinary College at the University of Guelph, studied the use of 714-X on canine lymphoma. They determined that the substance had no efficacy. They also found that the substance caused side effects severe enough to require supportive treatment. The researchers also found the product ineffective against bovine lymphoma in three cows treated by injection. Naessens' ability to sell himself has dramatically impacted health science in the USA. It was he who convinced former Congressman Berkeley Bedell (D-Iowa*) that 714-X had cured his prostate cancer (even though Bedell also had standard therapy). Bedell became so enamored with \"alternative medicine\" that he got Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) to introduce a bill, which he lobbied personally, that eventually established the NIH Office of Alternative Medicine \u2014 an office which thus far has functioned mainly as a public relations benefit to quackery (a result of a suspension of the standard rule that NIH contractors not use their NIH affiliation for publicity). [*Iowa is the home of chiropractic's primary training school (Palmer College at Davenport), Ayurvedic Medicine (Maharishi International University at Fairfield), and People Against Cancer (a referral agency for dubious cancer remedies run by Frank Wiewel at Otho)] MXM ESSENTIAL FORMULAS, INC. William M. London, Ed.D. A 6-page flyer titled An Opportunity for Physicians was distributed to some local physicians in Northeast Ohio last autumn. The flyer promotes a questionable multilevel marketing scheme for anti-cancer and other vitamin supplements sold by MXM Essential Formulas, Inc. of Walnut Creek, California. Dentists, chiropractors and reflexologists are also being recruited. Physicians who register with MXM through its local sales representatives introduce their patients to the supplements. The physician sends the patient's order to MXM who send the supplements directly to the patient. Anytime a patient places a repeat order, the registered physician receives a commission of 30% or more. The flyer illustrated how recruiting 600 patients who order $35 of supplements per month can earn a physician a passive income of more than $100,000 per year. A physician could earn an additional 5% on sales generated by any medical colleagues they referred to an MXM sales representative. On June 11, 1993, a customer service representative told me that MXM had changed management, and that the marketing plan has been modified, but that physicians can still earn commissions by recruiting patients. Frankly, I'm appalled by a program that encourages prescribing by physicians with a conflict-of-interest, enticed by a motivation of greed. Both the old flyer and the slick new 1993 MXM product brochure claims Herbert F. Pierson, MS, PhD, to be its nutrition consultant. Dr. Pierson once headed a National Cancer Institute research project on anti-cancer compounds in foods. I contacted Dr. Pierson and he explained to me that he initially got involved with MXM because he was led to believe there would be support for conducting well-controlled trials of the anti-cancer effects of food substances. He was unaware that MXM was still using his name and his former position at NCI to promote its products. Following my contact, he sent a letter to MXM to be distributed to its sales force objecting to the use of his \"likeness, picture or photograph, speech words, written text, video filming, association with my credibility as a research scientist, and association of my former relationship with the Federal Government, in any product promotions, product endorsement, sales pitches, meetings, distribution materials, and information packages to health care professionals.\" This misuse of Dr. Pierson's name by MXM is reminiscent of the now-defunct United Sciences of America's misuse of the names of distinguished medical scientists to promote its dubious supplement products (see NCAHF Newsletter, Jan-Feb 1987 & Mar-Apr 1987). A company representative informed me that a Dr. Bruce Halstead has replaced Dr. Pierson as scientific consultant. We suspect that this is the same Dr. Bruce Halstead who was convicted of cancer fraud by the State of California in 1985, whose medical license was revoked in 1992, and who now faces a 4-year prison sentence. Dr. London is Associate Professor of Health Education, Kent State University, and president of President of NCAHF's Ohio Division.

Volume 18, Issue #2CURE DU JOUR: KOMBUCHAThe biggest self-treatment fad seen in many years is to drink a brew made from a yeast culture called \"Kombucha mushroom.\" Symbiotic colony of yeast and bacteria. Why a mushroom? Yeasts are one-celled fungi; some mushrooms are in the same class of plants known as sac fungi (being a plant kombucha can be classified as an herb). Concerns regarding long term use include: (1) contamination with Aspergillus, a fungi that produces aflatoxin B, a potent cancer-causing metabolite; (2) development of antibiotic resistance as the body develops immune responses to Kombucha's many constituents; (3) the effects on body tissues due to prolonged exposure to plant acids. Promoters use double-talk; no claims, but lots of testimonials of wonderful effects. AIDS patients, many of whom are experimenting with Kombucha, may be at greatest risk of harm. DMSO FUMES THEORY TO BE TESTED IN COURTIn the November-December issue, we cited a report from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories that theorized that the fumes which emanated from the body of Gloria Ramirez causing the illness of several medical workers at Riverside (Calif) General Hospital were caused by Ramirez's use of a quack cancer remedy. This theory will be tested because one of the injured health workers, respiratory therapist Maureen Welsh, is suing Research Industries Corp., a Utah-based company, and its subsidiary Tera Pharmaceutical Inc., for negligently and carelessly manufactur-ing and distributing the DMSO Ramirez is alleged to have had in her body. The attorney for Dr. Julie Gorchynski disputes the DMSO theory believing that the hospital negligently failed to clean excess residue from toxic chemicals used in the hospital. [Riverside Press Enterprise, 3/1/95] ATTRIBUTIONS FOR LONG LIFEThe story of a French woman who turned 120 years of age this year was widely reported, Born In 1875, she had met Van Gogh and seen the construction of the Eiffel lower. It was reported that she smoked two cigarettes a day, and had given up wine at the age of 118. Stories about those who achieve great age are always interesting, especially the part where the oldsters answer the sure-to-be-asked question about to what do they attribute their longevity. NCAHF president William Jarvis has been collecting such reports for more than 20 years. One of the strangest attributions to great age came from India recently. Former Indian Prime Minister Morarji Desai celebrated his 99th birthday in early March. He believes that drinking his own urine (called the 'water of life' in Ayurvedic circles) deserves credit. G.K. Thakker, director of the Water of Life Foundation in Bombay, claims that the practice can cure everything from the common cold to cancer. [Reuter's World Report, March 6, 1995]! PARENTAL REFUSAL OF IMMUNIZATION STUDIEDA study done in the United Kingdom provides a useful model for similar inquiries in the USA and Canada. Community Child Health tracks childhood immunizations in the Bath District Health Authority. The prevalence of nonimmunization was found to be 0.33%. All parents who refused immunization for their children between Jan 1, 1987 and Jan 1, 1993 were polled by questionnaire; 87 of 106 replied. The reason for nonimmunization was clear in 68 cases (64% of total and 78% of replies). The most common reason was diversion by a homeopath. Religious beliefs, mainly Christian Science, was next. [British Med J. 1995;310:227] CITIZEN'S PETITION ASKS FDA TO BAN \"STRESS VITAMINS\"Stephen Barrett, MD, has petitioned the FDA to issue a public warning and to ban vitamin \"stress formulas\" with no proven ingredients. Barrett believes that virtually all such products are bogus. So-called \"stress formulas\" are dietary supplements alleged to alleviate or protect users from the effects of everyday stress or overwork. Some promoters make no claims but rely on the word \"stress\" in the product's name to sell it. Such products typically contain several times the RDAs for vitamin C and several B vitamins. Dr. Barrett stated, \"Those marketed by drug companies do not provide toxic amounts of these ingredients, but some marketed by health food industry companies contain enough vitamin C to produce diarrhea, and some contain enough B6 to cause nerve damage over a long period of time.\" Barrett added that \"Some formulas contain questionable food substances such as spirulina, bee pollen, and ginseng, to make them appear more 'complete.'\" The concept of high dosage \"stress formulas\" is said to be based on a 1952 National Academy of Sciences report which recommended extra vitamins for people sick enough to lose their appetites for a significant period of time. Leading manufacturers have falsely advertised that the ordinary physical stresses of life are reasons to take vitamins. State and federal laws still ban the sale of supplements that have not been proven safe and effective for their intended purpose. The FTC has taken action against several companies for advertising \"stress formulas,\" but case by case action cannot protect consumers from being cheated. The \"stress formula\" rip-off is detailed in Barrett's 1994 book The Vitamin Pushers. The petition is endorsed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. CURED! CRITIQUE AVAILABLEThe Sept-Oct issue of this newsletter (\"Quackery goes prime time\") the NBC program CURED! Secrets of Alternative Healing was severely criticized. It was stated that later in the year that an investigative source would reveal that none of the dramatized cases of healing attributed to \"alternative\" medicine actually happened as presented. This was fulfilled by the Winter, 1995 Forbes MediaCritic (pp.25-7) in \"Cureious,\" by Greg Gutfeld. Gutfeld writes: To produce CURED! Klein hired actors to reenact five episodes in which patients found relief or a \"cure\" through alternative therapies. One might be willing to abide such reenactments, notwithstanding the infamous re-creation of the explosion of a certain General Motors pick-up truck (also on NBC), but for one problem: The authenticity of the reenactments is doubtful. Klein says he purchased the stories from popular magazines (though he was vague on which magazines those were) as well as from people claiming to have been cured through alternative therapy. Assuming Klein really found these stories somewhere, he admits fiddling with them. \"We changed them around,\" he says, adding that he mixed details about several anecdotes in order to make one story. \"Combinations\" is how he describes these manufactured tales. \"Everyone does that.\" But neither the ostensibly \"real life\" medical doctors involved in the stories nor their patients were interviewed on CURED! to verify what supposedly happened. The article details other abuses. Most shocking is the information that producer Klein did not try to defend the show as factual. In fact, he told MediaCritic that he thinks that some of the therapies discussed on CURED! are \"sh-t.\" He said \"We weren't doing an educational program, we were doing it as entertainment.\" Roz Weinman, vice-president of standards and practices at NBC, shares this understanding. In an interview, she appeared irritated that the program should be scrutinized in terms of commonly accepted standards. Weinman didn't think the accounts had to be factual because they were not about conventional medicine. She said that a medical doctor had reviewed the show before broadcasting but couldn't recall his name. If readers find NBC's cavalier attitude dismaying, they may wish to express their outrage to Robert Wright, President, NBC-TV, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York 10012. CURED! aired on 7/5/94. The good news was Klein's remark that the ratings for the show \"stunk.\" CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD TACKLES CHELATION THERAPY ABUSEThe Health Quality Enforcement Section of the California Attorney General's (AG) Office contends that it prosecutes three or four cases a year involving the use of EDTA chelation therapy (CD to treat patients for a variety of ailments other than those for which the procedure is approved (ie, \"off-label use\"). The AG's office states that it always wins such cases, but that these cases are expensive to prosecute and require the same battle of expert opinion over and over again. The AG noted that CT is not harmful to patients at the doses usually used, but emphasized that paying for useless therapy is economically harmful, and may cause indirect harm if patients fail to seek effective therapy in lieu of Cr. The AG'S office asked the Medical Board of California MBC to consider asking for statutory restrictions that would make the off-label use of CT illegal without an FDA Investigative New Drug license. On Feb 4, the MBC debated the merits of creating such a law. Physicians John Renner and Wallace Sampson provided evidence that CT is used to treat more than 84 conditions for which there is no scientific evidence of effectiveness. The California Medical Association submitted a Medical Practice Opinion stating that it is appropriate to limit CT to heavy metal poisoning, hyper-calcemia, digitalis toxicity, and corneal calcium deposits, or as part of a controlled clinical trial under FDA standards. Representatives of the American College for Advancement in Medicine, a national organization established primarily to support the off-label use of CT, argued that the procedure was useful, particularly in the treatment of circulatory problems. Julian Whitaker, MD, a highly vocal advocate of CT, claims that the dispute is economic. He says that by diverting 100 patients a year from coronary by-pass surgery he prevents Orange County hospitals from taking in $9 million. He charges $3,000 for 30 treatments. Dozens of patients gave impassioned personal testimonials claiming remarkable improvements or cures due to CT. After a heated debate, the MBC failed to pass a ban on off-label use except for treatment of heart disease of CT by a 9 to 9 vote. A total ban on the off-label use of CT failed by a vote of 6 to 12. A substantial majority agreed to the concept of regulating CT but failing to reach any agreement on specifics, postponed consideration of regulatory language until its next meeting. Observers said that the tense atmosphere did not lend itself to rational decision-making. CHAPARRAL HERBAL PRODUCT CAUSES LIVER DAMAGEChaparral herbal products are prepared by grinding the leaves of an evergreen desert shrub known as the creosote bush or \"greasewood\" and either packing them into pills or brewing into tea. Chaparral attracted the attention of the scientific community in 1959 when several cancer patients appeared to have been helped by its use. Subsequent testing found that chaparral's effects upon cancer was mixed, including the disturbing finding that a majority of malignancies were stimulated by chaparral's major active ingredient. The use of chaparral tablets for as little as 6 weeks has been associated with liver damage. More recently, chaparral has been touted as a source of antioxidants. Now comes a report of a 60 year-old Chicago area woman who suffered severe liver damage after 10 months of taking 1-2 chaparral tablets daily.

MINNESOTA MILK-CURE ENDS WITH MISTRIALThe trial of Minnesota dairy farmer Herb Saunders, 66, ended in a mistrial on March 10. Saunders was charged with practicing medicine without a license for selling bovine colostrum (\"first milk\") as a potential cure for cancer and other serious diseases. Saunders would sell each patient a cow for $2,500, but keep the cow on his farm. He would inject a sample of each patient's blood into the cow's utter, and then sell the colostrum to the cow's owner for $35 a bottle. Saunders told an undercover state agent who posed as a cancer patient that he would \"cough out\" his cancer within months if he would take colostrum, refrain from chemotherapy. The 6-person jury voted 5-1 to convict, but the last hold-out, a part-time social studies teacher, apparently couldn't decide whether Saunders was practicing medicine without a license or offering an alternative type of care that is not medical practice. Former Iowa Congressman Berkley Bedell, who believes that Saunders cured him of Lyme disease, provided $21,000 for Saunders' defense. The Watonwan County attorney's office stated that it plans to retry Saunders. Saunders' attorney, Calvin Johnson stated that he will try to have the state's medical practice act declared unconstitutional based upon its vagueness, or have the state legislature change the law, before Saunders is retried. [Minneapolis Star Tribune, 3/16/95] FETZER INSTITUTE MANIPULATES INFORMATION CONDUITS FOR ITS ANTISCIENCE MESSAGEDavid Zimmerman exposes the aggressive efforts by the $200 million endowed Fetzer Institute (Fl) to \"broaden the view of science to include ways of knowing that are beyond the analytical and experimental models,\" to \"incorporate subjective and intuitive and appreciative ways of knowing\" into American health care. Zimmerman points out that FI's agenda is directly and provocatively antiscientific since science is based specifically upon analytical and experimental methods. He reports: Fetzer has acknowledged its leading role in the media blitz for alternative health. FI's director of international relations, Carol Hegedus said last year in reference to the 1993 New England Journal of Medicine unconventional medicine use study by Eisenberg and Bill Moyer's PBS-TV series Healing and the Mind that the\"'synchronicity of it all is not random.\" The effort was 'quite purposeful in creating attention' for the mind/body movement and its uncon-ventional methods. Most shocking is the revelation that Consumer's Union has covered up the fact that FI \"facilitated\" its mind/body series and book Mind/Body Medicine. [Priorities, 1994;6:(4):25-61] Comment: FI brings the power of a $200 million foundation to the promotion of nonscientific medicine. This is one of the most significant developments in the promotion of quackery and the political destruction of responsible medicine in America. Zimmerman's article on FIs subversion of Consumer's Union is one of the most troubling we've seen. BEE POLLEN FIRM SETTLES FALSE ADVERTISING CHARGEBee-Sweet, Inc., a North Carolina based company agreed to settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission that it falsely advertised that its bee pollen products could treat a number of physical ailments [FTC News Noses, 10124/94]. Pollen has no established therapeutic value. DR. DAVID WILLIAMSRecently we've seen a proliferation of slick, four-color mini-magazines extolling various individuals as health gurus. \"Dr. David Williams\" once claimed merely to be \"leading the worldwide search for natural remedies.\" Since then he has humbly proclaimed himself to be \"America's #1 expert in natural healing\" and \"the 'Indiana Jones' of natural medicine.\" Back when he was \"leading the world wide search\" he was pictured in a library. After proclaiming himself \"#1 expert\" he pictured himself in a white coat, holding a stethoscope, surrounded by the trappings of medicine. Williams has a celebrity picture of himself standing next to 60 Minutes reporter Mike Wallace who is publicizing shark cartilage as a cancer cure. Who is this funny guy? Williams is a chiropractor who apparently prefers publishing medicine-bashing, health-hype to popping spines. Williams has been writing and publishing his personal newsletter Alternatives \"For the Health Conscious Individual\" since 1989. In 1993, he went slick with \"a special supplement to Alternatives, dubbed Breakthroughs in Healing (is this guy original, or what?!) Williams claims to have 130,000 readers across America. (p.15) Our reading of his mini-magazines leads to the conclusion that \"#1 expert\" Williams merely reiterates the same unsubstantiated claims for health food products that have been being made for many years. It seems like his \"research\" has been simply reading health foods propaganda. Williams proclaims, \"the secret of the astonishing new all-natural cancer cure!\" \"The secret of the incredible new heart protection vitamin!\" \"The secret of the remarkable ultratrace mineral that beats chronic arthritis!\" \"The secret of nature's sure-fire cure for high cholesterol!\" \"The secret of the remarkable 29 cent herb that helps revitalize your immune system!\" \"The little known amino acid that reverses sexual impotence like magic!\" (Gee, Dave, these sound terrific!) \"Doctor\" Williams also warns his readers about misinformation being foisted on us by the bad old \"medical monopoly.\" Williams tells readers not to use sunscreen, rather, rub on \"a simple solution of vitamin C and water.\" \"Beware of the aspirin a day craze\"; if you want to \"achieve the same anti-blood clotting results as aspirin, take bromelain, an all natural extract of pineapples.\" According to the Lawrence Review of Natural Products (7i93), bromelain is a proteolytic enzyme used to tenderize meat. Medically, it has been used in burn injury debridement and to reduce soft tissue inflammation and irritation. The pharmacologic effects of bromelain are caused by an enhancement of serum fibrinolytic activity and inhibition of fibrinogen synthesis. It lowers kininogen and bradykinin serum tissue levels and has an influence on prostaglandin synthesis. Since bromelain is absorbed unchanged from the intestine at a rate of about 40%, it may have some of the benefits of aspirin, which also increases fibrinolytic activity and influences prostaglandin synthesis. However, aspirin has an experimental research record of effectiveness that bromelain does not. Williams has no experimental basis for his assertion that bromelain has the same anti-clotting features and to imply that it is preferable. Despite Williams' overconfident proclamations, he places the following weasel words appear inside the front cover: The approaches described in this special report are not offered as cures, prescriptions, diagnoses or a means of diagnosis to different conditions. . . The author or publisher assume no responsibility in the correct or incorrect use of this information and no attempt should be made to use any of this information as a form of treatment without the approval and guidance of your doctor. Thus, Williams taunts his readers with advice that they are warned not to apply! [The term \"weasel word\" is derived from the weasel's habit of sucking the contents out of an egg while leaving the shell superficially intact: a word used in order to evade or retreat from a direct or forthright statement or position\" (Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary.] JUICE PLUS+Juice Plus+ is a food supplement in which gel capsules contain flash=-dried powders of juiced vegetables and fruits. Flash-drying prevents the full degradation of enzymes associated with slower methods of food processing. According to company literature, the following features make Juice Plus+ unique: - Each capsule contains more live enzymes and nutrients than several servings of whole, raw fruits or vegetables, or glasses of juice. - The enzymes are still active. - Additional plant enzymes are added and scientifically balanced with the vegetable and fruit concentrates to increase nutrient content and aid in digestion. - Rich in antioxidant activity: increasingly linked to major health and medical benefits. - Fiber is added to increase the nutrient content. - Excellent source of nutrients for children and adults who do not have time or do not like to eat fruit or vegetables. - Juice Plus+ makes juicing the old way unnecessary for most people. NCAHF Comments: Under \"What are the benefits of LIVE enzymes?,\" company literature makes false and misleading claims about the function of enzymes in foods. In describing the work of enzymes as the \"workforce\" of the body, company literature rightly states that enzymes digest foods, and that in the cells they are involved in building new tissues and the immune system, but they either do not understand, or fail to clarify, that the enzymes in foods (or Juice Plus+) cannot possibly have anything to do with these processes. First, enzymes are not \"alive.\" Biological criteria for a living thing which are unfulfilled by enzymes include that they do not: (1) consist of cellular units; (2) possess reproductive ability; (3) demonstrate irritability; (4) early on metabolism; or, (5) grow. ). [Fuller. The Plant World Holt, 1956, p.6] Enzymes are complex protein molecules produced by living organisms exclusively for their own use in promoting chemical reactions. Orally ingested enzymes are digested in the stomach and have no enzymatic activity in the eater. Orally-ingested enzymes will not significantly aid digestion. The statement \"George Washington University has shown that chronic disease and enzyme deficiencies are synonymous\" is misleading because of the reasons stated. Further, eating whole foods is generally preferable to juicing which processes away many important constituents. Adding back some of the lost fiber still is likely to result in an inferior product. NCAHF advises consumers to avoid promoters who disseminate this type of misinformation about nutrition, biochemistry, physiology and disease. Endorsement by celebrities, athletic groups, or teams is meaningless. Such endorsements are often given in exchange for a donation or fee. Sometimes the endorser is engaged in selling the products. Even when done without financial self-interest, such endorsements may merely reflect the nutritional ignorance of those involved. The highly-publicized incident in which O.J. Simpson was shown on video tape telling 4,000 distributors that Juice Plus+ cured his arthritis, and the subsequent claim by his defense team that arthritis prevented him from being able to perform double murder, attests to the lack of veracity of celebrity endorsements. The hasty retreat of the company from the claim that Juice Plus+ can improve arthritis after using OJ's testimonial speech as a training video attests to the credibility of the Juice Plus+ -company. The company apparently was quite willing to have its distributors believe and repeat the tale to their prospective customers, but would not defend the claim once it became known publicly. Juice Plus+ is a multilevel marketed product. The tactic of providing distributors with unofficial health claims for use in selling while helping the company maintain deniability is one of the abuses typical of such enterprises. For more on abuses by direct sales companies see NCAHFs general warnings to buyers and sellers regarding multilevel marketed health products (NCAHF Newsletter, 1993; 16(2).

The March 2001 issue included a special set of articles on \"Alternative Medicine: The Importance of Evidence in Medicine and in Medical Education.\" In an introduction to the set, guest editor Arthur P. Grollman, MD of the SUNY at Stony Brook School of Medicine attributed clinical improvements before 1900, when virtually all medical treatments were ineffective, to the placebo effect and the self-limited nature of most diseases. He explained that methods for preparing standardized extracts of herbal agents and the knowledge to use them safely to significantly affect the course of disease were not available until the 20th century. Donald Marcus, MD of Baylor College of Medicine called for education about \"alternative medicine\" that is evidenced-based, not merely the integration of unproven practices into medicine. He repudiated \"alternative medicine's\" antipathy to scientific testing. He refuted three common criticisms that alternativists make about regular medicine: (1) physicians ignore mind-body interactions; (2) medical treatment does not address the cause of disease; and (3) medicine ignores prevention. Barry Beyerstein, PhD of Simon Fraser University identified reasons for the popularity of unproven therapies. He discussed seven social and cultural reasons: (1) poor scientific literacy; (2) anti-intellectualism and anti-scientific attitudes piggy-backing on New Age mysticism; (3) vigorous marketing and extravagant claims; (4) inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics; (5) social malaise and mistrust of traditional authority figures-the anti-doctor backlash; (6) dislike of the delivery of scientific biomedicine; and (7) the belief that \"natural\" remedies are necessarily safer, gentler, and more efficacious than scientific ones. He discussed three psychological reasons: (1) willingness to believe; (2) logical errors, shortcomings of judgment, and missing control groups; and (3) self-serving biases and implicit social demands. Beyerstein discussed eight reasons why ineffective therapies may seem to work: (1) the self-limited nature of many diseases; (2) the cyclic nature of many diseases that leave patients with good days and bad days; (3) the placebo effect; (4) rare instances of spontaneous remissions; (5) physical complaints arising from psychological distress, which induce people to think they have diseases; (6) it's easy to misattribute positive results to CAM treatments when they're used in addition to evidence-based treatments; (7) patients sometimes are misdiagnosed and they receive unduly pessimistic prognoses; and (8) charismatic practitioners can provide psychological uplift. Pamela Talalay, PhD and Paul Talalay, MD of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine called the 1994 Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act, which weakened regulatory authority over products such as vitamins, minerals, botanicals, and amino acids, \"a disaster waiting to happen\" [emphasis in original]. They support their argument with a summary of the dangers of supplement products. They also point out that plants have provided a multitude of life-saving drugs. For example, they wrote: \"Fourteen of the drugs in current use in cancer chemotherapy occur naturally, and of these, five originate from plants.\" But they also explained how the development of useful drugs from plant chemicals requires rigorous scientific investigation to establish safety and efficacy. They called for requiring that plant products used as drugs be evaluated for safety and efficacy by methods identical to those used for novel synthetic chemicals. Wallace Sampson, MD, clinical professor of medicine (emeritus), Stanford University School of Medicine characterized most teaching about CAM as ideologically or advocacy-based and without concern for scientific validity. Dr. Sampson described his own course at Stanford on CAM, which teaches students to think critically about claims and how to investigate them. The course addresses: (1) sources of errors in thinking, perception, and memory; (2) influences on placebo experience; (3) language distortion, myths, propaganda techniques, cult-like behavior; (4) information on specific CAM methods; and (5) recognizing misinformation in medical literature. Learning activities for students have included applying methods of critical analysis to evaluate talks by CAM promoters and visits to CAM clinics. ALOE VERA AND CESIUM CHLORIDE PROMOTERS PLEAD GUILTY On September 21st Allen J. Hoffman pled guilty in federal court to two felony counts of introducing unapproved new drugs into interstate commerce. Hoffman, doing business as T-Up, Inc. in Baltimore, MD and as Astec Biologics, Inc. of Pennsylvania, promoted and sold aloe vera products under the names of T-Up and T-Plus as well as cesium chloride products for the treatment of cancer, AIDS, and other diseases. Hoffman and others charged cancer patients and their families approximately $12,000 for a two-week treatment with intravenous aloe vera. They charged approximately $75 for a 2 oz. bottle of T-Up or T-Plus. Hoffman faces 41 to 51 months in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for November 30th. If the court so orders, Hoffman will be required to pay restitution to the victims he defrauded or to their families. Donald L. MacNay, Hoffman's codefendant in a 22-count indictment of July 1999, pled guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges on March 29, 2000 and received a 17-month sentence. DUBIOUS REPRESSED MEMORY MOVEMENT LOSING GROUND According to proponents of \"repressed memory therapy\" (RMT), numerous mental health problems in adults are due to subconscious damage from repressed memories of sexual or Satanic ritual abuse experienced in childhood. RMT practitioners claim to be able to help their clients recover memories of trauma and heal. Many mislead their clients into believing they have multiple personality disorder (MPD) and into accusing family members of abuse. The consequences have included divorces, family feuds, loss of employment (as charges have become public), lawsuits, and criminal convictions. Although many na\u00efve psychotherapists have accepted some of the premises of RMT, according to sociologist Rael Jean Isaac, PhD [writing in Priorities for Health 12(4);2000/13(1);2001.], the repressed memory movement has been on the wane since 1994. For example, the number of continuing education courses on RMT offered to clinicians has decreased considerably. Clients and falsely accused family members have initiated numerous lawsuits against RMT practitioners. Hospitals have closed MPD units. Insurers have refused to pay for RMT. Prominent RMT practitioner Bennett Braun, MD had his medical license suspended. He was expelled from the Illinois Psychiatric Society and the American Psychiatric Association. Braun's insurers had to pay a malpractice award of $10.6 million to one of his former patients. Instead of repressing memories of traumatic events, people tend to have trouble forgetting them. Memory is a process of reconstruction prone to error. Therefore, it is not difficult for therapists to implant false memories. The failure of RMT practitioners to acknowledge this is a psychotherapy scandal. Isaac quotes False Memory Syndrome Foundation Executive Director, Pamela Freyd, PhD: \"We have a whole culture that has accepted the notion that the proof that something happened is that the person forgot it.\" Elizabeth Loftus, professor of psychology at the University of Washington, has been the most prominent critic of claims about \"recovered memories\" of child abuse. RMT fanatics have responded to Professor Loftus's research findings with threatening letters, filings of complaints, lawsuits, and defamatory falsehoods in newspapers and over the Internet. Nevertheless, in June she received the William James Fellow Award of the American Psychological Society. The award citation [published in the November/December 2001 issue of Skeptical Inquirer] states in part: \"As a result of her pioneering scientific work as well as her activity within the legal system, society is gradually coming to realize that such memories, compelling though they may seem when related by a witness are often a product of recent reconstructive memory processes rather than of past objective reality.\" BIOTERRORISM BREEDS BIOBABBLE Americans have become painfully aware of the public health threat of anthrax bioterrorism. By the time people develop clinically recognizable health problems due to anthrax infection, and particularly in cases of inhaled anthrax, it may be too late for antibiotic therapy to save them. Anthrax vaccination is neither recommended nor available for the general public. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends antibiotic therapy to prevent anthrax infection only for people whose exposure has been determined on the basis of a public health investigation. No screening test exists for people to take to determine whether they have been exposed to anthrax. Consumers are scared. Truthful messages from public health officials about anthrax control do not and cannot at this time provide consumers with as much reassurance as they are seeking. Health hucksters have responded to consumer demand for extra protection against anthrax with deceptively promoted products that can only provide false reassurance. Some examples: - The mayor and Town Council of Howey-in-the-Hills, Florida endorsed colloidal silver as a \"simple solution\" for anthrax or any other malady that might strike residents. [Orlando Sentinel, October 19.] - Web sites are promoting homeopathic products as anthrax treatments and preventives. [Utne Reader Online, October 31.] - Go2Pharmacy, Inc. sent a news release saying that Thraxide, an Indian herbal supplement selling for $39.99 for a month's supply, \"could help\" combat the effects of bioterrorism and \"protect against severe bacterial toxins like Anthrax.\" [St. Petersburg Times Online, October 29.] - A guest on Howard Stern's talk-radio show touted garlic and oil of oregano to ward off and cure anthrax. [latimes.com, November 5.] The Securities and Exchange Commission said that it ordered three publicly traded companies to stop promoting products with fraudulent claims that they kill anthrax spores and provide warnings of biological and chemical attacks. The companies are the Classica Group of Lakewood, NJ; R-Tec Technologies of Flanders, NJ; and Disease Sciences of Boca Raton, FL. [The New York Times, B9, 11/17/01.] Five trade associations (the American Herbal Products Association, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the National Nutritional Foods Association, and the Utah Natural Products Alliance) for the dietary supplement industry issued a joint statement advising against use of dietary supplements as a cure or treatment from anthrax. The Federal Trade Commission has sent about 40 e-mail warnings to operators of Web sites touting bogus bioterrorism defense products and therapies. The operators must discontinue express or implied claims about benefits against anthrax, smallpox, or other diseases that are not substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. Those who continue to make deceptive and misleading claims face possible prosecution for violating the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Associated Press reported that Stephen E. Strauss, MD, the director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, told the U.S. House Government Reform Committee that there is little reason to believe that \"alternative\" medicines are effective in treating anthrax or other biological agents.\" He said that the public should have \"an unwavering trust in the currently approved drugs and vaccines\" and cautioned against \"pursuing unproven remedies.\" But at the same hearing Rep. Dan Burton (R-Indiana), the committee chairman, said that federal agencies should be encouraging \"alternative\" medicine in responding to bioterror attacks.

Prometheus Books. 2000. 300 pages. ISBN 1-57392-804-6; $26.00. Reviewed by Rebecca Long. This book combines all essential reference material on \"Therapeutic Touch\" (TT) in one volume for ease of reference. It is also fascinating reading. One of its strengths is that it contains reprints of some of the best research papers, not only by TT critics, but also by TT proponents. The papers by proponents reveal how poor the evidence is to support claims that TT is a useful method of healing. Scheiber and Selby included the two most widely cited pro-TT research papers: the Pentagon-funded study of TT on burn patients conducted at University of Alabama at Birmingham and the paper by Gordon and others on TT treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. They also included a powerful critique of these studies' methodological flaws. The editors wisely chose a recent article by Therese C. Meehan to define TT. Meehan provides an illuminating summary and criticisms of the vague theory behind TT and the problems associated with the most frequently cited papers. Since she is a proponent of TT, the criticisms in her article are not easily dismissed. Daniel Wirth's experiment in wound healing, often cited by TT proponents, is accompanied by Wirth's more recent article in which he states that out of five of his experiments, only two showed significant results in favor of the study group. The other three were either neutral or actually showed significant results in favor of the control group. Wirth writes: \"the overall results of the series are inconclusive in establishing the efficacy of the treatment [TT] interventions examined.\" The book features the most comprehensive history of TT published to date. Its coverage ranges from the physics of TT to its ethical problems. It belongs in all nursing school libraries and should be required reading for all nurses who have encountered TT. Editor's note: Therapeutic Touch includes a chapter by the author of this review. REMEMBERING VARRO TYLER Varro E. Tyler, PhD, ScD, an expert on the scientific study of plant-based medicines and a member of NCAHF's Herbal Remedies Task Force, died on August 22nd. He was 74. Dr. Tyler was a distinguished professor emeritus of pharmacognosy as well as a former dean and executive vice president for academic affairs at Purdue University. He was internationally recognized for his research and education efforts related to the field of herbal medicine. He provided important input into the development of NCAHF's 1995 \"Position Paper on Over-the-Counter Herbal Remedies.\" The paper identifies problems in the herbal remedies marketplace related to unreliable labeling, improper preparation, failure to track harm, extravagant claims of product efficacy, and industry's claim that it is too expensive to conduct well-controlled studies to determine safety and efficacy of products that can't be patented. It recommends the creation of a special category of over-the-counter medicines called \"Traditional Herbal Remedies\" (THR). THRs would be subject to limitations such as being well-established in the pharmacogonosy literature as not having lethal or damaging side effects and being indicated only for the treatment of non-serious, self-limiting conditions. Marketing of THRs would be permitted without costly and lengthy trials as long as certain requirements are met related to labeling, postmarketing surveillance, and quality control. Two of Dr. Tyler's books, Herbs of Choice and The Honest Herbal are available through NCAHF Book Sales. UTAH, A SUPPLEMENT ABUSE HATCHERY Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) is well known as a hawk in the U.S. war against controlled substances such as stimulants and depressants. A pious Mormon, he abstains from alcohol, tobacco, and coffee. But he is also the biggest champion of the dietary supplement industry which sells pro-hormones that act like anabolic steroids, ephedrine-a chemical cousin to the stimulant methamphetamine, valerian-an herbal tranquilizer, the sedative kava, and nostrums of all sorts. Hatch was the chief architect and sponsor of the 1994 Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act (DSHEA), which deregulated the supplement industry, promoted its growth, and inaugurated a new golden age of quackery. In \"Scorin' with Orrin\" (The Washington Monthly, September 2001, p. 27-35), Stephanie Mencimer provides a perspicuous expos\u00e9 of the folly of DSHEA, Utah's hospitality to scammers, Hatch's hypocrisy, and his close ties to an industry with \"a well-documented history of fraud that goes beyond the usual corporate shenanigans.\" She writes about Olympic athletes testing positive for the pro-hormone nandrolone after taking supplement products that did not provide accurate labeling. Following the Sydney Olympics, the International Olympic Committee blamed Hatch for the surge in positive tests and \"warned athletes to avoid American supplements particularly those manufactured in Utah.\" The 2002 Winter Olympic games will be held in Salt Lake City. Supplement companies are among the sponsors. INTERNET PROMOTER OF CANCER TREATMENT SUED Washington State Attorney General Christine O. Gregoire filed a lawsuit in Thurston County Superior Court in October against the promoter of \"CWAT-Treatment: BioResonance Therapy\" for cancer. Gregoire's complaint accused David L. Walker of Olympia and his company, DLW Consulting, Inc. of numerous violations of the state's consumer protection act including: making unsubstantiated health claims, misrepresenting the success rate of his treatment, making an unsubstantiated testimonial to the treatment's effectiveness, offering medical advice and treatment without having the necessary qualifications, and marketing an unapproved drug. According to the complaint, Walker's treatment-for which consumers paid between $2,436 and $5,220 for the program-uses a combination of an herbal mix known as \"Indian Mud\" ingested orally, coffee enemas, a variety of dietary supplements and the use of an electrical device called a \"bio-resonance oscillator\" or \"molecular enhancer\" that patients are instructed to use each day. The lawsuit asks that the court order Walker to stop promoting his treatment immediately, and that he pay an unspecified amount of civil penalties and restitution. On November 28th the DLW Consulting Web site continued to promote its dubious treatment program. David claims on the site that he has a PhD in physics. AUTHORITIES RAID FLORIDA \"ALTERNATIVE\" CLINICS On October 11th U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, US Customs, Florida state, and Hillsborough County authorities effectively stopped the Medical Center for Preventive and Nutritional Medicine clinics in Carrollwood and St. Petersburg from offering nonsensical, aloe vera-based injections as cancer treatments. They seized serum supplies and patient files from the clinics and took materials from the Largo home of clinic operator and \"nutrition counselor\" Joseph DiStefano. U.S. Judge Thomas McCoun III sealed the affidavits, which contain the evidence to justify the search warrants, for 120 days. Patients treated by DiStefano have protested the raid; they are trying to raise money for an attorney and say they will take their case to members of Congress. They were charged about $1,125 for the aloe vera-based protocol, which involved a \"standard series\" of 30 injections of \"albarin serum.\" The clinics continue to provide other unproven \"alternative\" treatments such as chelation, bio-energetic medicine, and colonic therapy.

Garabet and Hazmik Manuelyan from Staines, Surrey (UK) were placed under a community rehabilitation order for three years. Areni had been seen by a pediatrician who said that she wasn't developing properly and that the mother's breast milk was nutritionally deficient. [Baby death parents spared jail.

Volume 21, Issue #2 SURVEY FINDS INCREASED USE OF ALTERNATIVE HEALTHCARE A survey of 1,500 American adults conducted in November, 1997 found the highest levels of use of nonstandard methods yet recorded in a national study. Forty-two percent of the sample said that they had used some form of alternative care in the past year. Herbal therapy was the most widely used (17%), 85% of which was self-care. Chiropractic was second with 16% reporting use, 99% of which was professional care. This reflects a substantial increase in chiropractic utilization which has been at 7-10% for many years. The third most used was massage (14%), 84% of which was professional care. Vitamin therapy was fourth (13%), 79% of which was self-care. Other forms of alternative care were not widely used. Most interesting was the lack of enthusiasm for acupuncture. Despite the fact that respondents were most aware of acupuncture, only 2% reported using it. Only 10% said that they were likely to use it in the future, and 58% said that they would not. This was considerably more negative a rating than other forms of alternative care, and only yoga and hypnotherapy were as poor. Of those who used acupuncture, 57% reported being \"very satisfied.\" This was the lowest of three types of practitioners (80% of massage, and 73% of chiropractic users were \"very satisfied\"). Satisfaction was not reported with the other forms of alternative care. Only 15% of users said that their use replaced standard care. The increased use of alternative care appears to be due to successful public relations. The leading reason for positive attitudes toward alternative care was having \"learned more about it\" (47%). No information is given on the sources. It is a safe guess that the respondents learned more about alternative care from noncritical sources because those of us who track the sources know that they have been overwhelmingly noncritical. Twenty-two percent stated that the \"media made me more open-minded.\" Forty-one percent and 23% respectively became more positive as a result of their own personal experience, or the positive experience of a friend. Providers of nonstandard care have a long history of emphasizing patient satisfaction in their practices, so the findings are not surprising. True efficacy, the real measure of the value of health care, is not a factor in studies of this type of study. We conclude that this survey has revealed that the flood of propaganda about nonstandard \"alternative\" and \"complementary\" health care has increased its use because people with health problems are known to try anything that they hear about. Especially if the method does not have the strong stench of quackery. The record shows that the desperate sick will even try quackery, but only 4% of the study's population considered their current health status to be \"poor.\" Eighty-three percent rated their health as \"excellent\" (32%) or \"generally good\" (51%). Most respondents (55%) were not willing to have their insurance premiums increased to have access to alternative care; 30% would pay $10 or less a month for access; and 15% would pay $11 or more per month for coverage. The study was conducted by InterActive Solutions of Grand Rapids, Michigan for Landmark Healthcare Inc of Sacramento, California. NEW JOURNAL BRINGS SCIENTIFIC CRITICISM TO ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE [The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine](http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/sram.html) brings a badly needed skeptical approach to alternative-complementary medicine. To date, every journal we have seen has taken an open, but empty-minded perspective ie, (a) ignores the available information that has found little value in the methods being advanced under the banner of alternativism; or, (b) ignores what has been learned in the past about the pitfalls of subjective personal experience in producing clinical illusions that fooled patients and practitioners alike until doctors learned to control expectations and psychological reactions by double-blind clinical trials. We are pleased that 9 of the 53 members of The Council for Scientific Medicine sponsoring the journal are NCAHF board members. Its editor is Wallace Sampson, MD, past chairman of the NCAHF board of directors. The journal is published biannually. Cost: $50 for individuals in the US & Canada; $90 for institutions and overseas.

MEDIA PUBLICITY DRIVES HERBAL SALES According to an industry report, sales of Ginkgo and St. John's Wort surged following feature stories in national news weeklies and television magazine news shows. In the last quarter of 1997 the two herb-drugs became number one and number two in sales at $29.5 and $28 million respectively. Ginkgo is supposedly good for mental deterioration and St. John's Wort has antidepressant effects. One reason people like herbs is because they have the romantic aura of naturalness that people equate with safety, but another is the availability of such items without a prescription and at lower cost than standard drugs. Ease of access probably plays as powerful a role as perception in the growing marketplace success of herbal remedies.

The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) is engaged in a crusade against Olestra, which has made the whole matter a public issue, but the final proof of the pudding will be in the eating.* People who find such products objectionable won't use them. CSPI seems to be getting a lot of self-serving publicity for its role as the \"food police\" more than anything else.

QUEBEC SAYS ONLY PHYSICIANS MAY PRACTICE HOMEOPATHY The Quebec Court of Appeals in Canada has ruled that only licensed physicians are allowed to practice homeopathy. If this rule were to be applied in the United States, thousands of chiropractors would be outside the law. According to the 1993 Job Analysis of Chiropractic, 37% of more than 50,000 USA chiros practice some form of homeopathy. That calculates to over 18,500 practitioners. Naturopaths also practice homeopathy, but there are fewer than 1,500 practicing nationwide, and there are only about 500 homeopaths (many are fringe MDs). Apparently chiros are the most prevalent homeopathic practitioners. DOCTOR OR GURU? Newsweek featured the story of Dean Ornish, MD in its March 16, 1998 issue. Ornish has been a hero among preventive medicine adherents since he demonstrated a significant reduction in heart disease among patients who followed his strict regimen of diet, exercise, meditation, and group psychotherapy. Ornish's story is an all-too-familiar one of conversion from a depressed and suicidal young man to a zealot influenced by a swami. It helps explain why Ornish included meditation along with the more conventional ideas of dietary restriction and exercise in his program. Ornish, himself, comes across as a kind of guru as he motivates his patients to follow his monastic program of self-denial. Ornish's personal example, with his ideological commitment, may be the key to the success of the program. This may explain why we have not seen anyone replicate his results. If this is so, then we have learned something useful. We have learned that highly-motivated patients and a highly-committed doctor-teacher can combine to produce an effective preventive medicine program. Such a program may not be suitable for everyone, but it is worthwhile to know that it can work. Some may wince at the need for a doctor to be so strongly committed because ideology generally subverts the scientific method. Ornish comes across as more a guru than a doctor of medicine in the Newsweek story, but maybe that's what it takes for people to succeed in the lifestyle approach to preventive medicine. 1998 SLIM CHANCE AWARDS On January 20, the Healthy Weight Journal and the NCAHF Task Force on Weight Loss Abuse presented their 9th Annual Slim Chance Awards for those items that they believe to be the worst weight loss products of the year. This year's announcements were presented in the shadow of the tragic fen-phen fiasco that involved prescription diet pills. And, although these \"legitimate\" products may have caused more documented harm, they differ from products outside of the medical and health community in that legitimate producers track unanticipated harm and remove products from the market when it is warranted. Nonmedical product promoters generally not only do not track harm, they engage in denial and cover-ups when their products are implicated. - Worst Product. Lifestyle DHEA Cream Gel. This wild yam product is applied to \"pulse points\" such as the back of the wrist, throat, and inner thigh, from where it's allegedly \"absorbed directly into the blood stream.\" The body is supposed to produce its own DHEA as a result. - Most Outrageous. Phena-Drene/MD. This outrageous pill supposedly \"turns ugly fat into harmless water...and flows it right out of your body by the gallon!\" Promoters claim that it works so fast that you'll shrink a full size in 24 hours, four sizes in two week, lose up to 10 inches off your waist, 6 inches off your thighs, 6 inches off your buttocks, 8 inches off your stomach. \"Your very first capsule will start to melt down fat just like hot water melts down ice.\" - Worst Claim. Herbal Cleansing & Detox Program. Botanic Gardens of Hammond, Indiana, promotes a regimen of fasting, special tea and herbal tablets to control weight, improve the immune system, and to feel \"younger, better, healthier, and happier.\" The program is based upon the erroneous notion that the body is filled with toxins and needs to be \"detoxified\" periodically. - Worst Gadget. Elysee Body Toner Belt. This battery-powered passive exercise device claims to contract your muscles 300 times a minute, a \"total workout\" touted to reduce sagging and \"cellulite.\" Although the belt's four pads are supposed to deliver only gentle shocks to stimulate contractions, as you turn up the dial it can give nasty shocks where you least expect it. The device is sold by Sunday newspaper inserts and full-page ads by Health Direct of New York City.

HERBAL REMEDY SAID TO HAVE SOME MERIT Venastat, by the Ginsana USA Corp, is being marketed to relieve leg swelling due to varicose veins. It doesn't get rid of the varicose veins but helps improve symptoms of leg swelling and pain. The product contains horse chestnut seed extract which is thought to work by inhibiting enzymes that weaken the vein and allow fluid to leak out. The product is said to work about as well as wearing compression stockings. Although natural horse chestnut seeds are toxic, the extract in Venastat has been purified to remove the toxins. [Pharmacist's Letter, March, 1998] PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS SAYS TO CONSUMERS: BUYER BEWARE! The Presidential Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels dropped its earlier recommendation that makers of dietary supplements need to prove the efficacy of their products-which NCAHF applauded-and now suggests that consumers do their own homework on these products. The Commission turned its report over to HHS Secretary Donna Shalala who was to decide whether to propose its recommendations as formal rules. The problem with the Commission's position is that there simply isn't enough information available to make such judgments, especially when it comes to herbal remedies. The ill-conceived 1994 Dietary Supplements Health & Education Act made its gravest error when it permitted herbal remedies to be marketed as dietary supplements. This created an unregulated medicine industry which markets products that are as dangerous as prescription drugs with less oversight than is given common nonprescription medications. The Commission's final report appeared to be largely a sell-out to the dietary supplement industry. WATCH OUT FOR NONI JUICE The promotion of Noni juice (ie, the juice of the tropical plant Morinda citrifolia) is growing as more and more hucksters become involved in multilevel marketing schemes that sell the product. According to The Lawrence Review of Natural Products, (Oct. 1997), no information is available on side effects. We note that several studies on mice found that the juice can inhibit the growth of some cancer cells. Although proponents claim that this is accomplished by \"enhancing the immune system,\" they do not specify the aspects of the immune system that are allegedly affected. Frankly, we doubt that this is the case because immune system enhancement is an unlikely mechanism for inhibiting cancer.a When a substance inhibits the growth of cancer cells it is much more likely that it is \"cytotoxic\" (poisonous to cells). Just as with chemotherapeutic agents, fast-growing cancer cells are more strongly affected by toxic substances than are normal cells. The cancer cells are poisoned to death while normal cells are mildly poisoned but recover once the therapy is stopped. In the case of Noni, it appears that the substance is biologically active. This means that it may have medicinal value. However, it also means that it can have negative effects such as interfering with other medications. People who take other medicines should be cautious with Noni. Don't expect your doctor to know if it is safe. There simply is no good information. Consumers who have decided to become guinea pigs should watch carefully for side-effects, and should not allow themselves to be misguided by naturopaths, homeopaths, or chiropractors who claim that adverse side effects are \"the poisons coming out.\" In fact, these side-effects are due to poisons going in! Contrary to what the hucksters would like their potential customers to believe, it is not comforting to learn that an herbal remedy does, in fact, have biological activity. This is because any substance that can alter physiology has the potential for both good and ill, depending upon the nature of the individual, his problems, the dosage, how it is administered, and more. Benign, useless herbal products are less a problem because their benefits are due to the placebo effect and no harm can be done. CHELATION THERAPY REVIEW A review of original articles and abstracts published in the last 30 years on the use of chelation therapy in cardiovascular disease, with emphasis placed upon the most recent placebo-controlled studies, concluded that \"more controlled studies are required to determine the efficacy of chelation therapy in cardiovascular disease before it can be used broadly in the clinical setting.\" Studies of three different chelating agents were reviewed (these are named in the title). [Elihu, et al. \"Chelation therapy in cardiovascular and dexrazoxane,\" J Clin Phamacol, POWER OF FAITH HEALING \"This is Jonestown in slow-motion!\"\u2014Rita Swan The media has been agog recently with speculative reports on the power of intercessory prayer to heal the sick. Studies with flawed designs and weak, albeit statistically significant, findings are trumpeted as having provided scientific evidence of a mysterious benefit to healing prayer. Such vague and subtle findings pale in the face of the solid evidence of the killing power of faith healing, much of which involved intercessory prayer, documented in the journal Pediatrics (1998;101(4):625-9). Rita Swan, PhD and Seth Asser, MD, examined the deaths of 172 children from families who relied upon faith healing from 1975 to 1995. Four out of every five sick children who died after their parents put their trust in faith healing would most likely had survived if they had received medical care. Eighty-one percent (140) of the deaths were caused by conditions that had a chance of survival exceeding 90% when treated medically. Eighteen more of the children died of conditions with better than a 50% survival rate with medical care. All but three children would have benefitted in some way from medical care. Twenty-six percent of the deaths have occurred since 1988 when the American Academy of Pediatrics called for an elimination of laws that exempt parents from legal accountability for medical neglect for religious reasons. Evidence that the elimination of such laws would save lives is found in the fact that Christian Science church members in Canada are permitted by the church to seek medical help for their children because the law does not provide a refuge as it does in many U.S. states. The Christian Science church is probably the largest denomination that is opposed to medical care. The group with the most fatalities was the Faith Assembly (64). Christian Science was second with 28 deaths. The authors note that their data cannot be used to establish rates, however. Reporting of such deaths is not systematic. Curiously, despite the sympathy that Americans normally exhibit to the plights of children, very few cases of death due to religion-motivated medical neglect have received national press coverage, and reports in the medical literature are also rare. The authors have shown by their investigation that child deaths due to religion-motivated neglect are not only preventable, they are predictable and they will continue to occur as long as good people do nothing to stop them. The U.S. Supreme Court is clear on whether or not requiring parents to obtain medical care for children is constitutional. It has stated: The right to practice religion freely does not include the liberty to expose the community or child to communicable disease, or the latter to ill health or death... Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they have reached the age of full and legal discretion. (Prince v.

THERAPEUTIC TOUCH ON TRIAL THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES Most readers are aware that 11-year-old Emily Rosa has caused enormous embarrassment to the proponents of Therapeutic Touch (TT) through the publication of an experiment that she performed for a junior high school science project when she was nine [JAMA, 1998;279:1005-10.]. Emily's simple experiment was aimed at the most basic assumption of TT, which is that there exists an \"energy field\" around the body that can be sensed, and favorably altered, by a TT practitioner. If there is no energy field, or if it cannot be sensed, there is no basis for the sequential notion that the field can be altered by hand-waving. Emily simply tested whether or not 21 experienced TT practitioners could sense an energy field if they could not see whether or not anyone was actually within close proximity. They couldn't, which showed that their perception of an energy field was a product of their imaginations, not reality. Emily's test reminded those knowledgeable about the history of medicine and pseudoscience of the test done on \"animal magnetism\" practitioners in 18th-century France. Patients and practitioners attested to being able to sense feelings of discomfort or heat emanating from objects that had been \"magnetized.\" A 12-year-old boy who believed himself to be sensitive to magnetism was selected. His eyes were bandaged (blindfolded) and he was led successively to four trees that, unbeknown to him, had not been magnetized and made to embrace each for two minutes. He felt strong symptoms and reacted dramatically at each. Through this and other tests it became obvious to the Franklin Commission that the feelings sensed by believers was a product of their imaginations [Crabtree A. From Mesmer to Freud. Yale University Press, 1993, p.27.] Innocent children were involved in both instances. In 1784 a child was the subject, in 1996, a child did the test. The French boy was selected because of his innocence, and Emily is believable for the same reason. It is impossible to learn of this story without recalling the fairy tale of the Emperor's New Clothes. The story was that a deluded Emperor was tricked into wearing imaginary clothes. He was stark naked but viewers were told that only sophisticated people could see the clothes. Everyone wanted to be sophisticated so they deluded themselves into thinking that they could see the invisible clothes. When the Emperor went on parade it was a child who exclaimed that the \"Emperor has no clothes.\" Suddenly everyone was aware of the delusion. Such tales reveal ancient wisdom about human nature. TT is a delusion that thousands of practitioners, mostly Registered Nurses, have accepted only to now be exposed by a child. The reaction of the believers has only made their delusions more apparent. Part of the TT delusion is that practitioners are empowered by their \"intention to heal.\" This idea is rooted in radiesthesia (ie, \"the sensitive radiance\"), the notion that the vitalistic Life Force produces a resonance via thought processes which can be discerned by people possessing a \"sixth sense\" (aka \"Sensitives\"). TT apologists say that the TT practitioners Emily tested were not \"intending to heal.\" They also accuse Emily of blocking their powers with negative thoughts. This reminded me of the excuse offered by a psychic healer who had been caught faking a cure. When confronted with the fact that there had been no real healing by an undercover skeptic who has disguised himself for the investigation, the psychic declared that the reason the healing had not occurred was because of the presence of the skeptic's negativism-which the psychic now declared he could sense during the meeting. This is why James Randi referred to deluded believers as \"unsinkable rubber duckies.\" Society's hope lies in a sensible public that will now laugh TT off of the scene. One report from Eugene, Oregon involved comments by the family of a patient observing TT being done by a nun at Sacred Heart Hospital. Snickering, they were overhead commenting about \"rattles\" in an apparent reference to the dance of a witch doctor. Emily is the daughter of Linda Rosa, RN, Coordinator of the NCAHF Task Force on Questionable Nursing Practices. The publication of her study distinguished her as the youngest author ever to have been published by the Journal of the American Medical Association. Emily had heard her mother talk a lot about TT around the house, and came up with this simple test on her own. High level research methodologists are sure to be able to find flaws in her test, or design a stronger test, but they look pretty silly arguing with a kid who has exposed adult folly. To the TT proponents we say, where is your evidence that an energy field in fact exists? Her success is sure to inspire more kids to become active skeptics. Emily will appear on the cover of the premier issue of Junior Skeptic to be included with vol 6, #2 of Skepticlater this year by the Skeptics Society, P.O. Box 338, Altadena, CA 91001. In addition to Emily's test, the article provides a thorough description of TT history, popularity, theory, claims, practice, and scientific status. "}
