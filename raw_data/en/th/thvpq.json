Black Bolt and Medusa Blackagar Boltagon, known as Black Bolt, is the king of the Inhumans, a strain of humans genetically engineered by the Kree Empire to be living weapons. With his voice, Black Bolt harnesses immense power. When he speaks, he can produce a shockwave able to level a whole city. Even a whisper from Black Bolt renders his enemies feeble and broken.
