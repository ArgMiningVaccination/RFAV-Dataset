Today it is widely used in the U.S. as a method to encourage the body to heal naturally and function better. Placing fine needles at certain points is thought to help your nerves and brain to feel pain differently. Acupuncture is used to treat a wide range of health issues such as back, neck and joint pain, nausea, headaches, and more. Chiropractic Chiropractors use their hands to manipulate the joints and tissues of the spine or other joints in the body. They may also use some therapies such as heat, electricity or exercise advice. These treatments can help improve your health, mainly by easing pain and boosting blood flow. Chiropractic treatments may also help improve your posture and movement, and make your joints and muscles work better. Therapeutic Massage Therapeutic massage is used to treat problems related to the soft tissues of the body. It can help release tense muscles to ease pain and boost range of motion when you have an injury. It can also help reduce stress and relax the body and mind. Massage styles vary. Some use slow, deep compressions and strokes. Other types of massage use lighter pressure by applying broad, gliding and kneading strokes. Naturopathic Care Naturopathy, or naturopathic medicine, is based on helping the healing power of nature. Naturopathy is a holistic system, meaning that naturopathic doctors (N.Ds) or naturopathic medical doctors (N.M.Ds) strive to find the cause of disease by understanding the body, mind and spirit of the person. Most naturopathic doctors use a variety of therapies and techniques (such as foods, herbs and acupuncture). They focus on supporting the body's own healing abilities and helping people make better lifestyle choices to promote health.
