The agency said the pause would be extended beyond the original deadline of December 1 and those who had taken a first dose of the Moderna vaccine would be offered the Comirnaty vaccine from Pfizer/Biontech instead. South Korea on Friday approved Moderna Inc's Covid-19 vaccine, as the country attempts to speed up its inoculation efforts, drug safety minister Kim Gang-lip told a news conference. Contract drug manufacturer Lonza plans to double Swiss production capacity for Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine, helping the US drugmaker boost total output to as many as 3 billion doses in 2022. Britain's medical regulator on Friday approved Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine for use, the health ministry said, adding that it had agreed to purchase an additional 10 million doses of the shot as it eyed a spring rollout of the shot. US biotechnology firm Moderna on Monday said lab studies showed its Covid-19 vaccine would remain protective against variants of the coronavirus first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa. \"The study showed no significant impact\" on the level of neutralizing antibodies elicited against the UK variant, B.1.1.7. The US Food and Drug Administration's advisory panel, comprising external experts, has given an emergency use approval to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, making it the second drug after Pfizer to receive such an authorisation in less than a week. The US Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday issued a positively-worded briefing document about the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine ahead of a meeting by experts on whether to grant it emergency approval. The FDA was upbeat on the vaccine, saying there were no specific safety concerns identified that would require EUA and the confirmed an overall efficacy of 94.1%. Moderna Inc's coronavirus vaccine on Friday became the second to receive emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration, welcome news to a nation with a staggering Covid-19 death toll of over 307,000 lives lost. Britain has secured two million doses of Moderna Inc's Covid-19 vaccine candidate, to be available in Europe as early as the spring, the government said on Sunday, in addition to the 5 million doses it secured from the U.S. company two weeks ago. The fact that the vaccine prevented the virus from replicating in the nose is seen as particularly crucial in preventing it from being transmitted onward to others. Fauci said that delaying a second dose to inoculate more Americans creates risks. He warned that shifting to a single-dose strategy for the vaccines could leave people less protected, enable variants to spread and possibly boost skepticism among Americans already hesitant to get the shots. US biotech firm Moderna won't seek an emergency use authorization for its coronavirus vaccine before November 25, its CEO told the Financial Times on Wednesday. Results from the primary analysis of the ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of US biotechnology company Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine have revealed 94.1 per cent efficacy of the therapeutic in preventing symptomatic infections and severe illness, according to a peer-reviewed study. The announcement came shortly after the New England Journal of Medicine published results from the first stage of Moderna's vaccine trial, which showed the first 45 participants all developed antibodies to the virus. Moderna is considered to be in a leading position in the global race to find a vaccine against the coronavirus. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, noted that the experimental vaccine, mRNA-1273, was well-tolerated by the older trial participants, who were over 55 years of age. Moderna Inc's vaccine against Covid-19 could be ready for use by the end of this year, company officials said on Monday, after the drugmaker announced the start of a 30,000-subject trial to demonstrate it is effective. The trial is the first such late-stage study under the Trump administration's program to speed development of measures against the coronavirus. An experimental Covid-19 vaccine developed by the American biotech company Moderna prompted neutralising antibody activity in healthy adults, though it led to minor side effects in many patients, according to a new study. The investigational vaccine - mRNA-1273 - induced immune responses against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in all participants. "}
