Around the globe as of 26th July 2020, there is ~15.78 million confirmed cases and 0.64 million deaths. The COVID-19 infection is produced by virulent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, which belongs to large corona [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) family. These [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) are responsible for many recent infection outbreaks, SARS in 2003, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) in 2012 and recent most fatal COVID-19. Also, mortality rate related to COVID-19 is found to be very high in case of people with weak [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) e.g. elderly patients, children or patients with preexisting health problems. In this relevance, [medicinal plants](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/medicinal-plants-7390.html) can act as potential healing agents that can help people to fight against this infection by boosting their [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) or by posing viricidal effect. And thus, can contribute in reducing mortality rate related to SARS-CoV-2 infections. In this review, we attempted to compile and discuss different traditional [medicinal plants](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/medicinal-plants-7390.html) and their bioactive components that help in strengthening our immune system and also play key role in combatting microbial infections including COVID-19. This article will help researchers and industries to identify and scrutinize potential [medicinal plants](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/medicinal-plants-7390.html) that can meet their interests for various applications including development of herbal/Ayurvedic antiviral drugs, designing antimicrobial/antiviral materials, development of immunopotentiator, preparation of potential sanitizer systems etc. Medicinal plants; Immunity booster; Antiviral; COVID-19; Traditional medicines World is in great [depression](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/depression-46947.html) due to the massive spread of novel corona [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) i.e., SARS-CoV-2, which has affected majority of the countries with more than 15.78 million confirmed cases and about 0.64 million deaths as of 26th July 2020 [ [1](#1)]. Moreover, persons with weak [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) are found to be the easy targets of this COVID-19 disease including old age persons, children and patients with pre-existing clinical history like diabetes, cancer, respiratory disorders etc. [ [2](#2)]. Considering high mortality associated with this disease, whole world is struggling hard to discover effective therapeutic solution for COVID-19 treatment either by developing new antiviral [drugs](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/drugs-3667.html) or by repurposing the existing antiviral drugs. The commercially available antiviral medicines including ritonavir ribavirin, lopinavir, remidisavir alone or in combination with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and interferon-alpha are found to show some potential against SARS-CoV-2 infections [ [3](#3)]. The most promising remedy for controlling this SAR-CoV-2 outbreak is the development of safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 and enormous research efforts are in progress in this direction. According to WHO, nine vaccines had already entered the [clinical trials](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/clinical-trials-25828.html) as of 14th August 2020 [ [4](#4)]. In the present scenario of lack of any proven medicines/vaccines for COVID-19 cure, potential antiviral and immune booster herbal medicines, extracts and formulations can be good remedy which can help in lowering down the global mortality rate related to COVID-19. Ministry of Ayush, India has already released the [self-care](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/selfcare-1867.html) guidelines for preventive health measures and boosting [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) with special reference to respiratory health using traditional Ayurveda and natural herbs [ [5](#5)]. In the present review, we have discussed briefly about i) the novel SARS-CoV-2 [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) including its structure and associated global human loss, ii) Potential herbs that have antiviral and immune stimulant properties that can help in fight against COVID-19, iii) Promising phytochemicals that can be used for the development of future medicine and vaccines against SARSCoV- 2 infections, and finally iv) summarize active antimicrobial biochemical that can be useful in controlling COVID-19 spread by being an active components of sanitizers, personal protective equipments (PPE's) and antimicrobial materials/surfaces. Thus, we are here in discussing about various medicinally important plants and herbs which can serve as boon in the fight against COVID-19 e.g. [Garlic](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/garlic-24014.html) betel), Black paper (Piper known to be rich in antioxidants, vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, dietary fibers, amino acids, minerals, steroids, alkaloids, antiviral, antibacterial phytochemicals which will help in rejuvenating the immune system and also helps in killing the invaded viruses. Figure 1 shows pictures of different herbs that may be helpful in prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Figure 1: Different plants and herbs that can help in the fight against COVID-19. (a) Elderberry, Sambucussnigra (b) Garlic, Allium sativum (j) Black paper, Piper nigrum (k) Ginseng, Planaxquinquefolius (l) Black cumin, Black cumin L. sense RNA [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) from Coronaviridae [family](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/family-345.html) and order Nidovirales. This [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) is broadly distributed among different mammalian species including humans. Although most of the corona [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) infections are associated with mild clinical symptoms in human, however, two beta coronaviruses are responsible for two serious epidemics; severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong, China and middle east respiratory syndrome corona [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) (MERS-CoV) originated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia [ [6](#6)]. During last two decades, both the viral infections are reported to result in >10,000 cumulative cases with high death rates i.e., 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV [ [7](#7)]. In December 2019, a series of serious [pneumonia](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/pneumonia-2285.html) cases appeared due to mysterious source of infection in Wuhan [ [8](#8)]. Upon genetic sequence analysis, it was realized that this serious and contagious infection is due to a novel corona [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) species, originated from bat, which was later named as 2019 novel corona [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) (2019-nCoV) [ [4](#4)]. Being seventh member of the corona [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) family, this [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) is also called as SARS-CoV-2 due to its >70% resemblance to SARSCoV in genetic makeup [ [9](#9)]. COVID-19, infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a serious infection of the respiratory tract which affects both the upper respiratory tract including throat, nose and sinuses and lower respiratory tract, i.e., windpipe and lungs, of a person. As of 18th May 2020, there are more than 4.7 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 315,000 confirmed deaths across the world affecting 213 countries and territories. On the basis of structural studies, CoVs are the large genome size [RNA](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/rna-210.html) [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) with sizes in the range of 26 to 32 kilo bases in length. [Genome](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/genome-7056.html) of CoVs encodes for four key structural proteins viz. i) spike (S) glycoprotein, iii) nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein, ii) membrane (M) glycoprotein, and iv) envelope (E) glycoprotein (Figure 2). In SARS-CoV-2 virus, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein is also found in the virus envelope. All these proteins are vital for the development of complete virion structure [ [10](#10), [11](#11)]. The S glycoprotein, which forms a homotrimer protruding from the [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) surface, mediates the entry of the [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) into the host [cells](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/cells-53612.html) [ [12](#12)]. S protein has two functional subunits where S1 subunit is associated with the binding of the [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) with the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and S2 subunit assists the fusion of the [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) with the cellular membrane [ [11](#11)]. Different corona virus [species](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/species-5796.html) have unique domains at its S1 subunit to recognize different host [cells](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/cells-53612.html) entry receptors. The SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit engages with human ACE2 with similar affinity to SARS-CoV. Strong binding to ACE2 to the host cell someway explains the fast-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, same as SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) is found to be transmitted from human to human via small respiratory droplets through coughing, sneezing, or while executing close proximity interactions among people [ [13](#13)]. These droplets can then transmit by inhalation or can contaminates different surfaces which will act as secondary source of infection when the other person touch these surfaces and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth. Given the high mortality rate associated with COVID-19 and its easy mode of transmission, WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 pandemic a public health emergency of global concern on 30th January 2020 [ [1](#1)]. Figure 2: [Anatomy](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/anatomy-7113.html) of SARS-CoV-2 Virus. Medicinal plants that can help in fight against COVID-19 Piper nigrum L. (Black Pepper, Kaali Mirch): Piper nigrum L. is also referred as king of spices due to the extensive use of its dried unripe fruit in almost all cooking worldwide [ [14](#14)]. Moreover, this plant is enriched with more than 600 different phytochemicals including lignans, alkaloids/amides, terpenes, neolignans etc. having different beneficial properties. Antiviral, anti-bacterial, antiinflammatory, anti-pyretic, anti-oxidative, anti-thyroid, antitumor, immune and vaccine bioavailability enhancing properties are among the few in huge list of beneficial biological functions of peppercorn and various secondary metabolites of Piper nigrum. Ahmed et al. have very extensively and nicely reviewed the biological role of black pepper [ [15](#15)]. With proven antiviral properties, particularly against [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) responsible for infection in the respiratory tract, its key alkaloid components piperine and 10 piperamides can be the potential phytochemicals that can help in the fight against COVID-19 which is also a [respiratory tract infection](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/respiratory-tract-infection-17030.html) [ [16](#16)]. The structures of these antiviral phytochemicals sourced from Piper nigrum are given in Figure 3. Different parts of Piper guineese, which is also known as West Black Pepper, have importance in internal medicine for treating gastric ulcers, rheumatism, bronchitis and also viral infections. Figure 3: Chemical structures of various antiviral phytochemicals available in Piper nigrum. Ocimum sanctum (Holy Basil, Tulsi): Tulsi, also called as holy basil, is an indigenous plant to India and is highly renowned for its medicinal properties in Ayurvedic and Siddha medicinal system. Many in-vitro and in-vivo reports on animals and humans have proven its therapeutic potential as antibacterial, antidiabetic, anti-carcinogenic, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, cardio-protective, [immune Ayurveda, Tulsi is denoted as \"Elixir of life\" for its healing capability and promising potential in curing different health ailments including bronchitis, pyrexia, rheumatism, asthma, [skin](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/skin-29065.html) diseases, parasitic and microbial infections, gastric and hepatic disorders etc. Regarding the role of Ocimum sanctum in controlling COVID-19, Tulsi is already being used for curing pain, diarrhoea, cough and fever, which are common symptoms related to COVID-19 [ [18](#18)]. Tulsi is described as best medicine to treat pneumonia. Strong scientific evidences are available revealing the antiviral properties of Tulsi against both DNA [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) [herpes and Ursolic acid are found to be the main active antiviral ingredients in the Tulsi extract. Tulsi is reported to improve the respiratory parameters and helps in recovering from asthma. Tulsi has significant importance and role in boosting the [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) that assist human body to fight against unwanted microbial strangers including bacteria and viruses. To assess the immunomodulatory effect of Tulsi leaves, a double blinded randomized study was performed where 300 mg of ethanolic extract of Tulsi was given to 24 healthy subjects and results were analyzed [ [20](#20)]. In this 4-week study, significant enhancement in the percentage of helper T-cells and Natural Killer (NK) [cells](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/cells-53612.html) was observed in the subjects, both of which are immune [cells](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/cells-53612.html) that help the body to fight against bacterial and viral infections. This corroborates the role of Tulsi as immunomodulatory agent. Because of its multimodal therapeutic properties, we hypothesize that Tulsi may help in the prevention and controlling of COVID-19. An interesting docking study abstract reported at Social Science Research Network (SSRN, Elsevier) studied the binding affinity of 7 photophilic compounds from Tulsii. i.e., tulsinol A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and dihydrodieuginol B, with SARS CoV receptors [ [21](#21)]. This [simulation](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/simulation-28705.html) study further confirms the use of Tulsi extract against our fight against COVID-19 due to its recognized role in inhibiting [replication](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/replication-13486.html) of SAR-CoV with ACE II blocking properties. Nigella sativa (Black Cumin, Black seed, Kalonji): Nigella sativa is known for its broad therapeutic value and is reported to cure different health disorders including jaundice, conjunctivitis, rheumatism, diabetes, anorexia, gastrointestinal problems, intrinsic fever, bronchitis, [influenza](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/influenza-27662.html) etc. [ [22](#22)]. Thymoquinone is the main active phytochemicals present in black cumin and responsible for most of its therapeutic properties. Regarding its implication as antiviral properties, Nigella sativa oil and seeds have showed viricidal properties against various deadly [viruses](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/viruses-25440.html) including hepatitis C [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) (HCV) and [HIV](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/hiv-44957.html) [ [23](#23)]. In murine [cytomegalovirus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/cytomegalovirus-27470.html) mice model, N. sativa seed oil is found to suppress the viral burden to undetectable level within 10 days of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of black seed oil [ [24](#24)]. This is corroborated with the enhanced number of CD4+ T-cells and macrophages in serum and increased production of interferon- . In a case report, a complete seroreversion and regaining of 46-year old [HIV](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/hiv-44957.html) infected patient was confirmed after treating her with 10ml twice a day daily dosage for 6 months [ [25](#25)]. In another case report, a young 27 years old [HIV](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/hiv-44957.html) infected women was diagnosed during ante-natal care [ [26](#26)]. Due to its ineligibility to take antiretroviral therapy, she was kept at herbal therapy and given with 10 mL black cumin and honey mixture thrice a day for a year. Repeat serological testing for [HIV](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/hiv-44957.html) infection confirmed the effectiveness of this herbal therapy in eradicating this serious [HIV](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/hiv-44957.html) infection within 1-year time. In another group study of HCV infected patient, who are not eligible for IFN-/ ribavirin therapy showed significant decrease in the viral burden (~50% showed considerable reduction and ~17% became seronegative) by practicing black cumin seed oil based herbal therapy [ [27](#27)]. Astragalus membranaceus (Astragalus): Astragalus roots have been used in various Indian and Chinese ayurvedic medicines which are very helpful in strengthening the [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) and fight against diseases. This herb is also popular as natural supplement that assist in combating stress, killing tumor [cells](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/cells-53612.html) and remedying the [chemotherapy](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/chemotherapy-22709.html) symptoms. Polysaccharides, containing mannose, D-glucose, xylose and Larbinose, the Astragalus are found to have anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and antiviral properties [ [28](#28), [29](#29)]. In an in-vitro/in-vivo study published in 2013 on H9N2 avian [influenza](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/influenza-27662.html) [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) infected chickens, Astragalus polysaccharides is reported to enhance the [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) and prohibit the viral infection [ [30](#30)]. In the first week post treatment, IL-12, LITAF, IL-10, IL-6, IL-4 and antibody titers to reported to be increased around 40 [species](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/species-5796.html) of trees. The Cinchona bark is rich in an alkaloid chemical called as quinine which is known for its excellent antimalarial properties. Its other biological and clinical roles include ant parasitic, anti-arrhythmic, anti-spasmodic, antiprotozoal, cardio tonic (tones, balances, strengthens the heart) and as a bitter digestive aid to stimulate digestive juices. Chloroquine, which is a synthetic form of quinine sourced from cinchona bark, is in use for centuries for malaria treatment. Chloroquine was a key component of mass drug administration campaigns to exterminate malaria during 20th century, and is also in the list of WHO essential medicines [ [31](#31)]. Antiviral properties of chloroquine are explored against [HIV](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/hiv-44957.html) [ [32](#32)] and then against SARS-CoV-1 [ [33](#33)], which has structural similarity to novel SARS-CoV-2. In 2004, a Belgium researcher reported that chloroquine prohibited SARS [cells](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/cells-53612.html) [replication](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/replication-13486.html) in cell culture model [ [34](#34)]. In 2006, group of researchers from Chinese University of Hong Kong and Utah State University have investigated the effectiveness of multiple compounds against SARS-CoV in mice infection model [ [35](#35)]. They revealed that the chloroquine is only effective as an anti-inflammatory agent [ [35](#35)]. However, they suggested using chloroquine in amalgamation with other [drugs](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/drugs-3667.html) to inhibit [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) replication. Following this, in 2009, a Belgian based research group again revealed the effectiveness of chloroquine to eradicate lethal viral infection caused by human corona [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) OC43, which is closely related to SARS, by administering this drug via mother ' s [milk](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/milk-48644.html) [ [36](#36)]. Chloroquine plays role in raising the pH of the host cell lysosomes and thus interferes with the [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) strategy to acidify the lysosome, which is a requirement for the creation of auto phagosomes where a cell approaches to eat themselves. Regarding the effectiveness of chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2, a recent study involving hundred COVID-19 affected subjects, chloroquine treated group is found to be superior in shortening the disease course, improving [lung](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/lung-47780.html) imaging findings, pneumonia exacerbation and increasing [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) negative seroconversion with no side effects compared to control group [ [37](#37)]. In this first human trial against COVID-19, 500 mg dosage of the drug was given two times daily. In an expert consensus published on 20th Feb 2020 from multicenter collaboration group of Department of Science and Technology and Health Commission of Guangdong province, chloroquine phosphate tablets were suggested with dosage of 500 mg twice a day for 10 days for patients diagnosed with mild, moderate and severe cases of [pneumonia](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/pneumonia-2285.html) related to SARS-CoV-2 [ [38](#38)]. Treatment using chloroquine may enhance the treatment success rate, shorten the hospital stay and lowers the mortality associated with COVID-19. Sambucus nigra (Elderberry): Elderberry, scientific name Sambucus nigra, is an intense purple berry and widely present in Europe and Western Asia. It has been in use for many years due to its enormous health benefits. Chemically it is rich in polyphenolic compound (Anthocyanins, Flavonols, Phenolic acid), terpenes, carbohydrate fructose), citric acid, malic acid and lectins and other essential nutrients [39]. One cup of elderberries contains 106 calories [ [40](#40)]. However, their nutrient values in per 100 grams are as ~870 mg Vitamin A, 34.10 mg Vitamin C, 391.33 mg Potassium, 28.06 mg Calcium, 1.86 mg Iron, 217 mg Sodium [41] as well as some amount of other minerals, folic acid, amino acids, dietary fibers are also present. This fruit is enriched with [flavonoids](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/flavonoids-3489.html) having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help protecting the healthy [cells](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/cells-53612.html) from the attack of harmful free radicals thus have implications in [skin](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/skin-29065.html) care, boosting immune system which will supports the body to fight against flu, cold and other respiratory infections. It is also reported to have antiinfluenza activity [ [42](#42)], as well as antitumor potential, reduction of uric acid, positive effect on blood pressure [ [39](#39)]. The berries can also be made into jam, pies and sauces. The unripen elderberries, its leaves, bark and seeds contains toxic and poisonous chemicals including cyanogening glycosides which may lead to vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea if taken in raw state [ [41](#41)]. However, appropriate cooking and consuming in the form of hot syrups helps in overcoming these side effects. The flowers and fruit of the elderberry can be consumed as jam, herbal tea, syrups, juices and is an effective remedy for colds and fever. Tinospora cordifolia (Giloy, Guduchi): Giloy or Guduchi, scientific name Tinospora cordifolia is one amongst the most flexible restoring bushes. This is normal herb utilized as a part of Ayurvedic medication. It is one of the best Rasayana considered and is surprising in its strong flexibility. It holds many biologically important phytochemicals play activity in human [ [43](#43)]. bitter tonic, blood purifier properties which improve digestion and boost the [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) and also helps to reduce stress and anxiety, [detoxification](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/detoxification-15599.html) of body, to control fever, treatment in type-2 diabetes, fight against respiratory issue, improve eye vision, treat [asthma](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/asthma-3608.html) and [arthritis](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/arthritis-6214.html) disease and helps in the tumor chemotherapy. In one of the studies, methanol extract of Giloy is found to have broad spectrum antimicrobial effectiveness against various strains which are Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli, tetrahydropalmatine, choline, palmatine and magnoflorine, it also has protective role against aflatoxininduced nephrotoxicity. With their broad beneficial activity, it plays important role to improve our [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) to fight against infectious diseases. Generally, extract (juice) of Giloycan be taken orally. The following herbal formulation is receiving enormous popularity and found to be helpful for preventing and curing COVID-19 disorder. Giloy (Size on one Bhibdi) + Tulsi (6 leaves) + Ginger (1/2 tsp.) + Kali mirch (4-6 seeds) Crush/Grind them all together and use it as herbal tea or mix it with honey and consume it. It can control cough, fever and also support immunity. Azadirachta indica (Margosa, Neem): Margosa neem, scientific name Azadirachta indica almost found everywhere in India. Almost every part of neem such as leaves, root, fruit, bark, oil and seed are useful and it is widely applicable to cure or control diseases arises from parasitic, bacterial, viral or any other causes. The key phytochemicals available in neem are limonoids effect, neuroprotective effects, anti-cancerous properties [ [51](#51)] and neem tree effectively works in air purifying. Due to their excellent properties, it is effective against around 200 microorganisms. Previously our ancestors are aware of their antibacterial and antifungal type activities described in Indian Ayurveda and Unani medication. The chemical constituents of neem nimbidin, sodium nimbidate, gallic acid, catechin, polysachharides neem seed oil possess antipyretic, antifungal and antimalarial activities. However, Azadirachtin from neem oil have strong insecticidal, antifeedant activity as well as antimalarial property to inhibit the development of malarial parasites. It also has antibacterial activity some pathogenic bacterial strains. For the treatment of dermal problems including scabies, eczema and ringworm, the extract of dry neem leaf is found to be very effective. Aqueous neem leaf extract is reported to have remarkable antiviral activity against [measles](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/measles-7979.html) virus, Chikungunya and Vaccinia [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) [ [52](#52), [53](#53)]. Previously, many people utilized the neem extract (from leaves) for bathing to prevent against infection of chicken pox (causes due to varicella-zoster virus). Small amount of leave has also taken orally to kill the harmful worms inside body. It also helps in regulating blood sugar level in body. Although neem extract has many beneficial properties to benefit humans, however, taking excess amount of neem leave may have adverse effect on sexual activity by reducing of sperm count in body which may causes infertility. Syzygium aromaticum (Clove, Laung): Clove, scientific name Syzygium aromaticum, is one of the precious spices which is in use as food preservative and for many therapeutic applications from ages. This plant is rich in carbohydrates, protein, [vitamins](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/vitamins-3137.html) (A, C, E and K), thiamin, riboflavin, folate, niacin, dietary fibers, and minerals. It is also rich sources of phenolic constituents like eugenol, thymol, eugenol acetate, and gallic acid and also - cariophyllene and have enormous potential for cosmetic, pharmaceutical, food and agricultural applications [ [54](#54), [55](#55)].

Due to its antiviral effect the domestic [sales](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/sales-28173.html) of [turmeric](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/turmeric-429.html) have also increases. [Turmeric](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/turmeric-429.html) helps in the natural cleansing of the respiratory tract; it also supports in fighting against infection and its anti-inflammatory quality relieves individuals in cases of cold and flu. It is well known fact that the lower [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) is a risk in its own way and Curcumin is very helpful in addressing such issues and enhancing the [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) system. Curcumin inhibits inflammation, relieves congestion and [pain](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/pain-54372.html) thereby supports in improving the breathing process of patients with bronchial problems like sinusitis, sinus during respiration [ [102](#102)]. The main upper respiratory tract problems include congestion, cough, bronchial asthma, cold and shortness of breathing and thus affecting children and elderly population. Due to inflammation of the air ways, the process of breathing becomes difficult. This is often related to an exaggerated response but the [immune system](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immune-system-8102.html) that leads to chronic inflammation and damage to [lung](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/lung-47780.html) tissue by free radicals is competently supported by the pharmacological effects of Curcumin. [Turmeric](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/turmeric-429.html) is most common rhizome which is used daily in food and some time as a home remedy or [drugs](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/drugs-3667.html) against cough and cold, throat infection. It has antiseptic properties with substantial antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties. The most effective compounds are curcumin, arturmerone and (-) zingiberene. Curcumin ' s antiviral properties are due to its inhibitory role towards [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) [RNA](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/rna-210.html) [replication](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/replication-13486.html) which leads to reduction in the viral load. It also has excellent antiinflammatory properties and also reported to strengthen the [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) Withania Withania somniferous, since 6000 BC is one of the very important and precious herbs of Indian Ayurvedic system. Ashwagandha has main chemical constituents of phytochemicals namely withanolides which triterpenelactones-withanolides, These compounds](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/bioactive-compounds-4793.html) and due to their cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibition property they possess anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities with chemical structure as depicted in Figure 11 below [ [104](#104)]. It is seen that the pharmacological activity of Withania somnifera is mostly attributed to withaferin A and withanolide D. According to Ayurveda experts, it is reported that Whithanone reduces the electrostatic component of binding free energies of ACE2-RBD complex and thus block or weakens the COVID-19 entry and its subsequent infectivity. It is also reported that the host [cells](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/cells-53612.html) namely ACE 2 in the human body got entrapped by SARS-CoV-2 with the help of its spike protein Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) [ [105](#105)]. In order to response it, the natural phytochemicals present in the medicinal herb Withania somnifera has distinct effects on the binding of [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) within the human body. In view of the same, the potential capabilities of natural photochemical in Ashwagandha were screened and tested using a unique scientific [molecular docking](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/molecular-docking-16312.html) process. It is also reported/ claimed that \"Ashwagandha could be the top choice among various medicinal herbs in this prospective fight against COVID-19 infectivity\". Ashwagandha roots have high antiviral activities. Baba Ramdev claimed Ayurveda remedy that world help ward off corona virus. Combinations of photochemical in ashwagandha, gloy, tulsi are capable to fight corona [virus](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/virus-28980.html) as informed by Patanjali ' s Balkrishna. It inhibits the protein binding with host cell. On the other hand, natural phytochemicals have potentials to combat COVID-19 and its pathogenicity. Basically, it blocks the host protein interactions. Indirectly the triple combination is help to boost the immunity against the COVID-19 infection [ [106](#106)]. Figure 11: Chemical Structure of Withanolides. Currently, yet no any vaccine/medicine could be developed to cure COVID-19 and it may take at least 1-2 years and scientist also utilizing hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 but could not get positive response and has side effect. Immune systems in body play an important role to fight against unhealthy environment and microbes such as virus, bacteria, fungus etc. and various numbers of alternate diseases. There are lots of allopathic medicines are available to boost our immune system but we also know that there has number of side effects and are also costly. For this purpose, we find the alternate source as Ayurvedic product and medicinal plant which not only provided healthy environment to body but also boost the immune system without causing any side effect. At this COVID-19 pandemic situation, various studies reveal that those people having strong [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) has higher recovery rate against COVID-19. Since Ayurvedic products cannot completely cure the COVID-19 but it could be minimizing the risk of viral infection and reduces the mortality rate. From long time, we are aware of the beneficial properties of Ayurvedic and medicinal plant product utilizing to cure infectious and other diseases. Since these botanical plants having low cost, minimum toxicity and almost found everywhere in country, it has potential to enhance [immunity](https://www.longdom.org/peer-reviewed-journals/immunity-12162.html) to fight against COVID-19 and other infectious disease and play an important role to becomes fit and healthy India and world.
