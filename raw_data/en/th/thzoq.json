Suspension of Referrals for Monoclonal Antibody Treatment for COVID-19 WMCHealth is not currently accepting referrals for the COVID-19 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment, as the available mAbs are not effective against the predominantly circulating SARS-Cov-2 variants. Prevention remains the method of protection against COVID-19. We strongly recommend that all eligible individuals receive COVID-19 vaccine and booster doses, and mask and test when appropriate. Please contact your primary care provider if you have any questions about COVID-19 prevention or treatment.
