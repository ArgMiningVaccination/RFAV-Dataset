Along with continuing Canton Center Chiropractic Clinic's long standing individual nutritional programs and chiropractic care, Dr. D's long-term goal is to bring her community to optimal wellness. Testomonials To say I have always had positive experience with Chiropractic medicine would be a lie. Many years ago I had a very bad experience that left me never wanting to go again. However, all that changed last spring when my daughter asked me to attend an open house at Dr. Potter's office. I was reluctant and told her I was not going to become a patient but I would go with her to see what the office was all about. She had been going to him for several months as well as some our friends and they had nothing but positive comments about his care as well as the friendliness of the office staff. In July of 2009, an emergency doctor diagnosed me as having sciatica brought on by heavy lifting during landscaping. Since my wife was already seeing Dr. Potter regularly and she was experiencing excellent results, I didn't suffer very long (about a week) with sciatica before I decided to visit Dr. Potter. I definitely knew that I didn't want to see an M.D. because he would only prescribe strong anti-inflammatory medications with awful side effects. Furthermore, those medications would only mask the problem rather than treat the root cause. I was confident that Dr. Potter would fix the root cause of the problem. I could not have accomplished my physical goal of walking 60 miles in 3 Days, if it had not been for your chiropractic care and nutritional consults. You have been a gift not only to me, but, to my daughter for over 9 years and we could not be more grateful for your care. (At age 17, Ashley has been medicine free over half her life!) I would also like to extend a special Thank You to your amazing staff for their kindness, compassion and professionalism at each and every visit! They are the best! Thank you all for your commitment and dedication to natural health and to your patients!
