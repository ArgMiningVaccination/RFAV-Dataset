FDA is issuing this report so that oonsmners have ac\u00ad curate information about the dietary supplement marlcet\u00ad place. The report has four sections: a list, with more than 500 entries, of dietary supple\u00ad ment products and the unsubstantiated claims currently be\u00ad ing made for those products a ~tative list of recent FDA enforcement ac\u00ad tions against dietary supplements a list of oral representations made for specific products for hypertension, immune system problems, and cancer by employees of stores selling dietary supplements a narrative report desaibing serious adverse reactions associated with selected ingredients marlceted as dietary supplements. Products with Umubstantiated Claims To gain an understanding of the current dietary supplement marlcetplace, FDA has compiled examples of dietary supplements and the claims being made for those products. Only printed claims have been included in this list: Pamphlets and brochmes, leaflets, point-of-purchase materials, and product advertisements were the primary sources of the claims. Whenever ~ible, each dietary supplement product on the list is classified according to the following code: {AA} signifies an amino acid product; { G} signifies a glandular product; {H} signifies an herbal product; { Combo H) signifies a combination herbal product; {M} signifies a mineral product; and {V) signifies a vitamin product Each product makes at IC$t one unsubstantiated claim; most make several. The claims range from treat\u00ad ment of such chronic diseases as cancer, emphysema and multiple sclerosis to the elimination of such disorders as incontinence and varicose veins. Some promise prevention of heart disease and cataracts. Others promise cures: ''re\u00ad moval of kidney and gallstones.\" Some claim very specific outcomes, such as the product that \"inhibits platelet aggre- iv gation\" or the one that works against \"diabetic vascular damage.\" Others promise relief from \"infection.\" Unsubstantiated claims being made for dietary supple\u00ad ments in the United States today include claims for treat\u00ad ment of such infectious diseases as AIDS, chickenpox, cholera, and dysentery; they range from the general (\"infection\" and \"senility\") to the specific (\"ringworm\" and \"impetigo''). These products may be making a wide variety of claims, but they have one thing in common: Not one of the claims has been substantiated by FDA before their appear\u00ad ance in the marketplace. FDA Enforcement Actions, November 1990 through June 1993 Because of the current legal and regulatory frame\u00ad worlc, FDA exercises oversight on the dietary supplement industry on a case-by-case basis. F.ach case is extremely resource-intensive. This section of the report lists repre\u00ad sentative FDA regulatory actions, between November 1990 and June 1993, against 188 dietary supplement prod\u00ad ucts that made unsubstantiated claims about serious medi\u00ad cal conditions. It includes only actions taken under the drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by FDA's health fraud program. Items in this section marked by an asterisk are product seizures; all other list\u00ad ings are warning letters. As the other sections of this report make clear, this investment of resources has failed to stem the tide of unsubstantiated claims. Oral Claims for Dietary Supplements As the long list of printed claims shows, unsubstan\u00ad tiated claims currently are pervasive in the dietary supple\u00ad ment industry. No pictw'e of the current situation would be complete, however, without an understanding of oral rep\u00ad resentations being made about these products. To com\u00ad plete this picture, earlier this month personnel in each of FDA' s 21 district offices across the nation inf onnally vis\u00ad ited local stores that sell dietary supplements. During their visits, they asked salespeople the follow\u00ad ing questions about the use of dietary supplements for spe\u00ad cific serious and life-threatening diseases: \"What do you sell to help high blood pressme?\" \"Do you have anything to help fight infection or help my immune system?,. \"Do you have anything that works on cancer?'' The results of those visits are presented by disease category. Of the 129 requests for information summarized in this section, 120 resulted in recommendations of spe\u00ad cific dietary supplements. In three instances, store employ\u00ad ees declined to make recommendations. On six occasions, employees merely provided references from reading mate\u00ad rial on dietary supplements. The oral representations of dietary supplements dem\u00ad onstrate the pervasiveness of unsubstantiated claims for serious diseases being made for these products aaoss the nation. Health 1187.ards Associated with Dietary Supplements Unsubstantiated claims now being made for dietary supplements represent only part of the pictme: In addition, some of these products present health hazards that can be serious and are sometimes fatal. The report on health hazards focuses on selected in\u00ad gredients currently available in dietary supplement prod\u00aducts: nine herbal substances, two amino acids, four vita\u00ad min and mineral products that can be toxic at higher doses, and one other product. This list is not intended to be all-in\u00ad clusive. Conclusions Roughly 80 percent of the dietary supplement market\u00ad place consists of vitamins and minerals that are marketed at reasonable potencies and make no unsubstantiated health claims. The conclusions of this report do apply, however, to the other 20 percent of the marketplace: those dietary supplement products that present safety concerns or make unsubstantiated claims. Thousands of unsubstantiated claims are being made about hundreds of dietary supplements. Some ingredients marketed as dietary supplements have demonstrated seri\u00ad ous and even life-threatening hazards. As a result, millions of Americans are spending bil\u00ad lions of dollars every year on dietary supplement products, V many of which have shown little or no evidence of either safety or effectiveness. In this blizzard of claims for dietary supplement products, valid claims are currently in\u00ad distinguishable from invalid claims. Moreover, people may be replacing legitimate treatments of demonstrated effectiveness with unproven and questionable remedies. For example, high blood pressure is a well-understood condition that is readily treatable. Left untreated, or im\u00ad properly treated, it can be life-threatening. This report suggests that the success of FDA's rather modest enforcement actions of the past few years has been limited. The samples collected-along with oral represen\u00ad tations of uses for dietary supplemenl.,_show that in nearly all cases unsubstantiated claims are moving off the product label and into catalogues, brochures, and oral sales pitches. The history of health quackery in this century demon\u00ad strates that enforcement actions may cause manufacturers to remove claims from the label-but the products stay on the market Even without claims on the label, sales litera tme and salespeople continue to make unsubstantiated claims. Moreover, products continue to be bought and used because of the original unsubstantiated claims made on their behalf. The bottom line is this: The marketplace has changed little over the years despite fDA's efforts. If anything, unsubstantiated claims are becoming more exaggerated, more products of unknown effect are available, and their use is escalating. When it comes to dietary supplements, the position of the Food and Drug Administration is straightforward: Di\u00ad etary supplements should be safe, and any health claim on their labels or in promotional literature should be scientifi\u00ad cally valid. Many of these products can be beneficial. FDA has prepared this report so that consumers will have infonna\u00ad tion about the broad range of claims being made for them. We will have learned little from the tum-of-thecentury days of the traveling medicine show if the proliferation of unsubstantiated claims for dietary supplements is allowed to continue.

Anamu-Llanten caps or Rio Piedras, PR Employee recommended these products for cancer treatment, especially extract Anamu-Llanton. Employee stated that Co Q removes malignant and sick Co Q Enzyme caps cells. Pau D'Arco (Lapacho) caps/extract Capsules Cartilade Shark Cartilage Capsules Antioxidants Antioxidants DIETARY SUPPLEMENT SURVEY \"DO YOU HA VE ANYTHING THAT WORKS ON CANCER?\" San Juan, PR Employee stated that although there are no products available to \"cure\" cancer, some are available that could help patients and recommended Pau D'Arco and Lion Tee~. In regard to literature, book entitled Prescription for Natural Healing was recommended which cites Pau D'Arco as good as an alternative treatment for cancer. Oklahoma City, OK Employee recommended Radical Fighters to help strengthen the immune system. He provided a copy of a one-page leaflet titled \"Protect Yourself' and a magazine titled Better Nutrition. He then recommended Cartilade and said the product was achieving results in the protection of cartilage. He provided a one-page leaflet titled \"Some Basic Facts About Cartilade. 11 Creve Coeur, MO Creve Coeur, MO Employee said literature was unavailable because of FDA, but said the antioxidant products are good for cancer prevention. She responded that for breast cancer prevention she recommended the Super C, E, and Carotene combination product. The employee stated he wasn't sure. Label stated that \" ... Studies indicate that exposure of our bodies to certain conditions ... can cause the generation of free radicals (oxidants) that may be responsible for cellular damage. . . . Vitamin E is a protector and helps prevent damage to the cells in our bodies .... \" The labeling also discusses the effectiveness of vitamins C, E, and Beta Carotene as antioxidant nutrients that can \u00b7provide protection. In response to questions, the employee said he wasn't sure if the product was effective in preventing cancer. DIETARY SUPPLEMENT SURVEY \"DO YOU HA VE ANYTHING THAT WORKS ON CANCER?\" Aloe Vera Juice Studio City, CA Employee said Aloe Vera Juice and Carinova worked on cancer. She said Carinova some people take Power Mushrooms for cancer, but mostly for AIDS. Power Mushrooms BLD Blood Cleanser Dearborn, Ml Employee said BLD cured two cysts in her breasts. She recommended Shark Cartilage shark cartilage to prevent cancer. A display said it was a \"New Weapon Against Cancer\". She also recommended Prescription for Nutritional Healing, a book by James Balch, M.D. Honey Suckle Crystals Shennan Oaks, CA Employee said honeysuckle tea would cure cancer, and showed the label with the claim. In response to a request for tablets, she produced a bottle with no English writing. The insert claims were different from the tea, but she insisted that the product was the same. The two proprietors, male and fem ale, offered to treat the patient for cancer. When the customer returned to buy the tea, the female said it was illegal to say that the product would definitely cure cancer. Kal\u00b7Multi Harper Woods, MI Employee said he would not tell what _specific products would work on ( 4 multivitamin) cancer, and showed the customer the book Prescription for Nutritional Co-EnzymeQlO (Co-QlO) Healing. He referred to the section in the book titled \"Cancer,\" and showed Shark Cartilage the customer where the store had the products listed in the section. He said CoQlO was one of the better products. He said the vitamin product contained most of the vitamins recommended in this section of the book. He recommended the shark product and said he was surprised it was not in the book, and said the book Shru:ks Don't Get Cancer was temporarily out of stock. He recommended talking to a doctor about taking the multivitamins. DIETARY SUPPLEMENT SURVEY \"DO YOU HA VE ANYTHING THAT WORKS ON CANCER?\" Shark Cartilage Louisville, KY The owner's husband said that shark cartilage is the only product on the market that would prevent cancer. He was unsure if it would cure it. He recommended one tablet three times daily. Beta Carotene Louisville, KY Employee said Beta Carotene will prevent, but not cure, cancer. She said it Co-EnzymeQlO (Co-Q 10) would destroy \"Free Radicals,\" atoms that have either too many protons or Beta Carotene Juice electrons. She relied on the book Prescription for Nutritional Healing by Garlic James Balch, pages 120-121. Co-EnzymeQlO (Co-Ql0) Casselberry, FL Employee recommended carotene, and barley green for cancer Beta Carotene prevention. She said she could not explain how they worked because that Barley Green would constitute illegal prescribing, and instead recommended books sold in the storefront. She said Co-Q 10 was too strong for cancer prevention, but was for people who actually had cancer. Advanced Shark Cartilage Raleigh, NC A handwritten sign by the shark product said \"Sharks don't get cancer\". After a request for literature, the employee allowed the customer to choose from pamphlets available under the counter, and reviewed the book with the customer. The Atkins Center Anti- Scotia,NY Employee recommended a book with a cancer section that recommended Oxidants antioxidants. When the customer asked where to find such products, the employee pointed out The Atkins Center Anti-Oxidant product. A brochure on the product was also available. DIETARY SUPPLEMENT SURVEY \"DO YOU HA VE ANYTHING THAT WORKS ON CANCER?\" Advanced Shark Cartilage Roanoke, VA Employee made no verbal claims but the store sold a book called Sharks Don't Get Cancer. The employee told the customer that the store did carry the shark cartilage product, and recommended a copy of the store's July magazine, which lists products and their indications related to cancer prevention and treatment. Essaic Tonic Virginia Beach, VA Employee recommended these products and provided literature from the Shark Cartilage back of the store to accompany it. The literature for the Essaic Tonic included claims to cure cancer, AIDS, thyroid conditions, diabetes, ulcers, and common colds. He also recommended the book Sharks Don't Get Cancer for cancer tumors, and The Cancer Answer and The Cayce Encyclopedia. The employee said the essaic mixture could be made at home from ingredients sold in the store, but the tonic was stronger. He recommended 4 tablespoons two times daily. Biochem Formula XI Rocky Hill, CT The employee was not sure so he called his son who works at another health PROSTA-MAX food store. He recommended using Saw Palmetto berries in combination with vitamins. He showed me the Biochem Formula XI Prosta-Max product. MAXI-PROS PLUS Bloomfield, CT The employee claimed that this was the \"hottest\" thing out in the market for prostate problems. He claimed that the \"Saw Palmetto berries\" were the key ingredient.

These antioxidants combat free radicals that cause cancer. Owner opened bottle because it was the last one on the shelf and she wanted to smell it to make sure it was not old. Schenectady, NY Employee stated they had a new product, shark cartilage, and provided literature. Schenectady, NY Employee gave me two brochures to read re: \"cancer\": Prescription for Nutritional Healint: and The Vitamin Herb Guide. I was asked what type of cancer I was referring to and I replied \"pancreas\". With that, the product recommended was \"Mega-Zyme\", which he stated contained a \"pancreatic enzyme\". Seattle, WA Employee recommended Beta Carotene. Employee also recommended shark cartilage, and said she had heard of cases where it had caused cancer to go into remission. She pointed out that it was proven that sharks do not get cancer. \\0 \\0 Flora Herbal Tea Blend DIETARY SUPPLEMENT SURVEY \"DO YOU HA VE ANYTHING THAT WORKS ON CANCER?\" Kent, WA The employee stated that there were other products; however, she would recommend the tea over anything else. She explained that it was proven to work and referred to \"testimonials\" inside the Well Being Journal referring to people who had been cured of cancer using the tea. I told her that I had throat cancer and she recommended that I gargle the tea before swallowing it. She warned of side effects-for example, she broke out with acne because the tea was getting rid of toxin~ in her body. She continued to explain that the tea was underground for some time, but it had just started to come out again; but it would probably go underground again soon. When asked how long I should take it, she replied until it clears up and then another two or three months; in fact she would probably never stop taking it. Illn~es and Injuries Associated With the Use of Selected Dietary Supplements Products marketed as \"dietary supplements\" include a diverse range of products, from traditional nutrients, such as vitamins or minerals, to such substances as high-po\u00ad tency free amino acids, botanicals, enzymes, animal ex\u00ad tracts, and bioflavanoids that often have no scientifically recognized role in nutrition. There is cwrently no systematic evaluation of the safety of products marketed as dietary supplements. Dietary supplements routinely enter the marketplace with\u00ad out undergoing a safety review by FDA. Published studies on the safety of these products are extremely sparse. There is no systematic oollection and review of adverse reaction reports for dietary supplements, as there is for drugs, and physicians rarely seek information about their patients' use of dietary supplements. Despite the lack of any system for gaining information about the risks of dietary supple\u00ad ments, an inaeased number of reports of adverse reactions to dietary supplement products has recently been recog\u00ad nized. Because of concern about these products, FDA has, in the last year, initiated an effort to collect and evaluate existing studies and case reports on safety problems asso\u00ad ciated with dietary supplements. As a result of that effort, FDA has begun to identify dietary supplements for which serious adverse reactions have been documented. A list of selected dietary supplements associated with serious safety problems follows. This list is not intended to include all hazardous ingredients in dietary supplements. LHerbals Herbal and other botanical ingredients of dietary supplements include processed or tmprocessed plant parts (bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, and stems), as well as ex\u00ad tracts and essential oils. They are available in a variety of forms, including water infusions (teas), powders, tablets, capsules, and elixirs, and may be marketed as single sub\u00ad stances or in oombination with other materials, such a~ vi\u00ad tamins, minerals, amino acids, and non-nutrient ingredi\u00ad ents. Although data on the availability, consumer use, and health effects of herbals are very limited, some herbal in\u00ad gredients have been associated with serious adverse health effects. A. Chapan-al (Larrea tridentata) Chaparral, commonly called the creosote bush, is a desert shrub with a long history of use as a traditional medicine by Native Americans. Chaparral is marketed a~ a tea, as well as in tablet, capsule, and concentrated extract form, and has been promoted as a natural antioxidant \"blood pwifier,\" cancer cure, and acne treatment At lea'it six cases (five in the United States and one in Canada) of acute non-viral hepatitis (rapidly developing liver damage) have been associated with the consumption of chaparral as a dietary supplement Additional cases have been reported and are tmder investigation. In the majority of the ca~ re\u00ad ported thus far, the injury to the liver resolves over time, after discontinuation of the product In at leac;t two pa\u00ad tients, however, there is evidence that chaparral consump\u00ad tion caused irreversible liver damage. One patient suffered terminal liver failure requiring liver tram,'J)lant Most of these cases are associated with the consump\u00ad tion of single ingredient chaparral capsules or tablets; how\u00ad ever, a few of the more recent cases appear to be a~oci\u00ad ated with oonsumption of that oontain chaparral as one ingredi\u00ad ent Chemical analyses have identified no contaminanL\" in the products associated with the cases of hepatitis. Prod- 100 ucts from at least four different distributors and from at least two different sources have been implicated thus far. After FDA' s health warning, many distributors of chaparral products voluntarily removed the products from the market in December of 1992. Some chaparral products remain on the madcet, however, and other distributors who removed their products from the market are seeking to clarify the stab.ls of these products. B. Comfrey (Symphytum o.fficinale (common comfrey)) Preparations of comfrey, a fast-growing leafy plant, are widely sold in the United States as teas, tablets, cap\u00ad sules, tinctures, medicinal poultices, and lotions. Since 1985, at least seven cases of hepatic veno-occlusive dis\u00ad ease-obstruction of blood flow from the liver with poten\u00ad tial scarring (cirrbosis)-including one death, have been associated with the use of commercially available oral comfrey products. Comfrey, like a number of other plants (e.g., Senecio species), contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The toxicity of pyrrolizidine aJkaloids to humans Hepatic veno-occlusive disease, of pyrrolizidine alkaloid-containing products, docu\u00ad mented repeatedly throughout the world. Hepatic veno\u00ad occlusive disease is usually acute and may result in fatal liver failure. In less severe cases, liver disease may pro\u00ad gress to a subacute form. Even after apparent recovery, chronic liver disease, including cilThosis, has been noted. Individuals who ingest small amounts of pynolizidine al\u00ad kaloids for a prolonged period may also be at risk for de\u00ad velopment of hepatic veno-occlusive ~ is complex, and the condition is probably llllderdiagnosed. The degree of injury caused by pyrrolizidine alkaloid\u00ad containing plants, like comfrey, is probably influenced by such factors as the age of the user, body mass, gender, and hepatic function, as well the total cumulative dose in\u00ad gested and the type of exposure (i.e., whether exposure was to leaves or roots, infusions or capsules). Infants in general appear to be particularly susceptible to adverse ef\u00ad fects of exposure to pyrrolizidine alkaloids; there are re\u00ad ports of infants developing hepatic veno-occlusive ~ following aaite exposure of less than one week. Trans\u00ad placental pynolizidine poisoning bas been suggested by the occurrence of hepatic disease in the newborn infant of a woman who consumed herbal tea during pregnancy. Although liver damage is the major documented fonn of injury to hwnans from pyrrolizidine alkaloid-containing herbals, animal studies suggest that their toxicity is much broader. Animals exposed to pynolizidine alkaloids have developed a wide range of pulmonary, kidney and gastro\u00ad intestinal pathologies. Pyrrolizidine alkaloid-containing plants, including comfrey, have also been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Four countries (the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and Germany) have recently restricted the avail\u00ad ability of products containing comfrey, and other countries permit use of comfrey only physician's prescrip\u00ad tion. C. Yohimbe (Pausinystalia yohimbe) Yohimbe bark containing a variety of phanna\u00ad cologically active chemicals. It is marketed in a nwnber of products for body building and \"enhanced male perfor\u00admance.\" Serious adverse effects, including renal failure, seizures and death, have been reported to FDA with prod\u00ad ucts containing yohimbe and are currently under investiga\u00ad tion. The major identified alkaloid in yohimbe is yohimbine, a chemical that causes vasoclilation, thereby lowering blood pressure. Yohimbine is also a presaiption drug in the United States. Side effects are well recognized and may include central nervous system stimulation that causes anxiety attacks. At high doses, yohimbine is a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor. MAO inhibitors can cause serious adverse effects when taken concomitantly with tyramine-containing foods (e.g., liver, cheeses, red wine) or with over-the-counter (OTC) products containing phenylpropanolamine, such as nasal decongestants and diet aids. Individuals talcing yohimbe should be warned to rigorously avoid these foods and OTC products because of the increased likelihood of adverse effects. Yohimbe should also be avoided by individuals with hypotension (low blood pressure), diabetes, and heart, liver or kidney disease. Symptoms of ovenlosage include weakness and nervous stimulation followed by paralysis, fatigue, stomach disonlers, and ultimately death. D. Lobelia (Lobelia injlata) Lobelia, lobeline. These alka\u00ad loids have pharmacological actions similar to, although less potent than, nicotine. There have been several reported cases of adverse reactions associated with con- 101 sumption of dietary supplements containing lobelia. Depending on the dose, lobeline can cause either auto\u00ad nomic nervous system stimulation or depression. At low doses, it produces bronchial dilation and inaeased respira\u00ad tory rate. Higher doses result in respiratory depression, as well as sweating, rapid heart rate, hypotension, and even coma and death. As little as 50 milligrams of dried belb or a single milliliter of lobelia tincture has caused these reac\u00ad tions. Because of its similarity to nicotine, lobelia may be dangerous to susceptible populations, including children, pregnant women, and individuals with cardiac disease. Lobelia is nevertheless folllld in dietary supplement prod\u00ad ucts that are marketed for use by children and infants, pregnant women, and smokers. E. Germander (Teucrium genus) Germander is the common name for a group of plants that are contained in medicinal teas, elixirs and capsules or tablets, either singly or in combination with other herbs, and marketed for the treatment of obesity and to facilitate weight loss. Since 1986, at least 27 C$e8 of acute nonviral hepati\u00ad tis (liver disease), including one death, have been associ\u00ad ated with the use of commercially available germander products in France. These cases show a clear temporal re\u00ad lationship between ingestion of germander and onset of hepatitis, as well as the resolution of symptoms when the use of germander was stopped. In 12 cases, re-administra\u00ad tion of germander was followed by prompt recwrence of hepatitis. Recovery occurred gradually in most cases, ap\u00ad proximately two to six months after withdrawal of ger\u00ad mander. Analyses of these cases does not indicate a strong relationship between the dosage or duration of ingestion and the occmrence of hepatitis. Although the constituent in germander responsible for its hepatic toxicity bas not been identified, germander con\u00ad taim several chemicals, including polyphenols, tannins, diterpenoids, and tlavonoids. On the basis of the 27 French hepatitis cases, the French Ministry of Health bas forbidden the use of ger\u00ad mander in drugs. Its use bas been restricted in other COllll\u00ad tries. F. Willow Bark (Salix species) Willow bark bas long been used for its analgesic (pain killing), antirheumatic, and antipyretic (fever-reducing) properties. Willow bade is widely promoted as an \"aspirin-free\" analgesic, including in dietary supplement products for children. Because it shares the same chemical proper\u00ad ties and the same adverse effects as aspirin, this claim is highly misleading. The \"aspirin-free\" claim is particularly dangerous on products marketed, without warning labels, for use by children and other aspirin-sensitive individuals. The pharmacologically active component in willow bark is \"salicin,\" a compound that is converted to salicylic acid by the body after ingestion. Both willow bark and as\u00ad pirin are salicylates, a c~ of compounds that work by virtue of their salicylic acid content. Aspirin (acetylsali\u00ad cylic acid) is also converted to salicylic acid after inges\u00ad tion. All salicylates share substantially the same side ef\u00ad fects. The major adverse effects include irritation of the gastric mucosa (a particular bai.ard to individuals with ul\u00ad cer disease), adverse effects when used during pregnancy (including stillbirth, bleeding, prolonged gestation and labor, and low-birth-weight infants), stroke, and adverse effects in children with fever and dehydration. Children with influema or chickenpox should avoid salicylates because their use, even in small doses, is associated with development of Reye syndrome, which is characterized by severe, sometimes fatal, liver injury. Salicylate intoxica\u00ad tion (headache, dizziness, ringing in ears, difficulty hear\u00ading, dimn~s of vision, confusion, lassitude, drow~iiness, sweating, hyperventilation, nausea, vomiting, and central nervous system disturbances in severe cases) may occur as the result of over-medication, or kidney or liver insuffi\u00ad ciency. Hypersensitivity, manifested by itching, broncho\u00ad spa.w and localized swelling ( which may be life-threaten\u00ad ing), can occur with very small doses of salicylates, and may occur even in those without a prior history of sensi\u00ad tivity to salicylates. Approximately 5 percent of the popu\u00ad lation is hypersensitive to salicylates. G. Jin Bu Ruan Jin Bu Huan is a Chinese herbal product whose label claims that it is good for \"insomnia due to pain,\" ulcer, \"stomachic [sic] nervous insomnia, spasmodic cough, and etc.\" Jin Bu Huan bas been recently reponed to be responsible for the poisoning of at least three young children (ages 13 months to 2 1'2 years), who accidentally ingested this prod\u00ad uct. The children were hospitalized with rapid-onse~ life\u00ad threatening bradycardia (very low heart rate), and central nervous system and respiratory depression. One child re\u00ad quired intubation (assisted breathing). All three ultimately 102 recovered, following intensive medical care. Aldiougb the product label identified die plant source for Jin Bu Huan as Polygala chinensis, this appears to be incorrect since preliminary analyses indicate die presence of tettabydropaJroatine (TI-IP), a chemical not found in Polygala. TIIP is found, however, in high ooncentrations in plants of cenain Stephania species. In animals, expo\u00ad to TIIP results in sedation, analgesia, and neuromus\u00ad cular blockade (paralysis). The symptoms of the three children are consistent with these effects. An additional case of TIIP toxicity, reported in the Netherlands, appears to be associated with the same prod\u00ad uct, and is being investigated. H. Herbal products containing Stephania and Magnolia species A Chinese herbal preparation containing Stephania and Magnolia species that was sold as a weight-loss treat\u00ad ment in Belgium has been implicated recently as a cause of severe kidney injury in at least 48 women. These cases were only discovered by diligent investigations by physi\u00ad cians treating two young women who presented with simi\u00ad lar cases of rapidly progressing kidney disease that re\u00ad quired renal dialysis. Once it was determined that both these women had used the herbal diet treatment, further in\u00ad vestigation of kidney dialysis centers in Belgium found a total of 48 individuals with kidney injury who had used the herbal product. At the time that a report of these adverse effects was published in February 1993, 18 of the 48 women had ter\u00ad minal kidney failure that will require either kidney trans\u00ad plantation or life-long renal dialysis. I. Mahuang Ma huang is one of several names for herbal products containing members of the genus Ephedra. There are many common names for these evergreen plants, includ\u00ad ing squaw tea and Mormon tea Serious adverse effects, including hypertension (elevated blood pressure), palpita\u00ad tions (rapid bean rate), neuropathy (nerve damage), myo\u00ad pathy (muscle injury), psychosis, stroke, and memory loss, have been reported to FDA with products containing Ma huang as ingredients and are cwrently under investigation. The Ephedras have been shown to contain various chemical stimulants, including the alkaloids ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and norpseudoephedrine, as well as vari\u00ad ous tannins and related chemicals. The concentrations of these alkaloids depends upon the particular species of Ephedra used. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are am\u00ad phetamine-like chemicals used in OTC and prescription drugs. Many of these stimulants have known serious side effects. Ma huang is sold in products for weight control, as well as in products that boost energy levels. These prod\u00ad ucts often contain other stimulants, such as caffeine, which may have synergistic effects and increase the potential for adverse effects. II. Amino Acids Amino acids are the individual constituent pans of proteins. Consumption of foods containing intact proteins ordinarily provides sufficient amounts of the nine amino acids needed for growth and development in children and for maintenance of health of adults. The safety of amino acids in this form is generally not a concern. When mar\u00ad keted as dietary supplements, amino acids are sold as single compounds, in combinations of two or more amino acids, as components of protein powders, as chelated single compounds, or in chelated mixtures. Amino acids are promoted for a variety of uses, including body-build\u00ading. Some are promoted for claimed phannacologic effects. The Federation of American Societies for Experimen\u00ad tal Biology (FASEB) recently conducted an exhaustive search of available data on amino acids and concluded that there was insufficient information to establish a &'lfe intake level for any amino acids in dietary supplements, and that their safety should not be a'iSumed. FASEB warned that consuming amino acids in dietary supplement form posed potential risks for several subgroups of the general popula\u00ad tion, including women of childbearing age (especially if pregnant or nursing), infants, children, adolescents, the elderly, individuals with inherited disorders of amino acid metabolism, and individuals with certain disea~es. At least two of the amino acids consumed in dielary supplements have also been associated with serious inju\u00ad ries in healthy adults. A. L-tryptophan L-ttyptophan is associated with the most serious re\u00ad cent outbreak of illness and death known to be due to con\u00ad sumption of dietary supplements. In 1989, public health officials reali7.ed that an epidemic of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) was a~ociated with the ingestion of L\u00ad ttyptophan in a dietary supplement. EMS is a systemic connective tissue disease characterized by severe muscle 103 pain, an inaease in white blood cells, and cenain skin and neuromuscular manifestations. More than 1,500 cases of L-ttyptophan-related FMS have been reported to the national Centers for Disease Conttol and Prevention. At least 38 patients are known to have died. The true incidence of L-tryptophan-related EMS is thought to be much higher. Some of the individu\u00ad als suffering from L-tryptophan-related EMS have recov\u00ad ered, while other individuals' illnesses have persisted or worsened over time. Although initial epidemiologic studies suggested that the illnesses might be due to impurities in an L-ttyptophan product from a single Japanese manufacturer, this hypo\u00ad thesis has not been verified, and additional evidence sug\u00ad gests that L-tryptophan itself may cause or contribute to development of EMS. Cases of EMS and related disorders have been found to be associated with ingestion of L-ttyp\u00ad tophan from other batches or sources of L-ttyptophan. These illnesses have also been associated with the use of L-5-hydroxytryptophan, a compound that is closely related to L-tryptophan, but is not produced using the manufactur\u00ad ing process that created the impurities in the particular Japanese product B. Phenylalanine A number of illnesses, including those similar to the eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS) associated with L-tryptophan consumption, have been reported to FDA in individuals using dietruy supplements containing pheny\u00ad lalanine. There are also published reports of scleroderma/ scleroderma-like illnesses, which have symptoms similar to EMS, occwring in children with poorly controlled blood phenylalanine levels, as well as in those with phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder characterized by the inability to metabolize phenylalanine. Ill. Vitamim and Minerals Vitamin and mineral dietruy supplements have a long history of use at levels consistent with the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA's) or at low multiples of the RDA's, and are generally considered safe at these levels for the general population. Intakes above the RDA, how\u00ad ever, vary widely in their potential for adverse effects. Cenain vitamins and minerals that are safe when con\u00ad swned at low levels are toxic at higher doses. The differ\u00ad ence between a safe low dose and a toxic higher dose is quite large for some vitamins and minerals and quite small for others. A. VitaminA Vitamin A is found in several fonns in dietary supple\u00ad ments. Preformed vitamin A (vitamin A acetate and vita\u00ad min A palmitate) has well-recognized toxicity when con\u00ad swned at levels of 25,000 International Units (IU) per day, or higher. (Beta-carotene does not have the potential for adverse effects that the other forms of vitamin A do, because high intakes of beta-carotene are converted to vi\u00ad tamin A in the body at much lower levels.) The RDA for vitamin A is 1,000 retinol equivalents (RE) for men, which is equivalent to 3,300 IU of preformed vitamin A, and 80 percent of these amounts for women. The adverse effects associated with consumption of vitamin A at 25,000+ IU include severe liver injury (in\u00ad cluding cirrhosis), bone and cartilage pathologies, elevated intracranial pressure, and birth defects in infants whose mothers consumed vitamin A during pregnancy. Groups especially vulnerable to vitamin A toxicity are children, pregnant women, and those with liver disease caused by a variety of factors, including alcohol, viral hepatitis, and severe protein-energy malnutrition. There are some studies that suggest vitamin A toxicity has occmTed at levels of ingestion below 25,000 IU. In ad\u00ad dition, the severity of the injuries that occur at 25,000 IU suggests that substantial, but less severe and less readily recognized, injuries probably occur at somewhat lower in\u00ad takes. Most experts recommend that vitamin A intake not exceed 10,000 IU for most adults or 8,000 IU for pregnant and nursing women. B. VitaminB, Neurologic toxicity, including ataxia (alteration in bal\u00ad ance) and sensory neuropathy (changes in sensations due to nerve injury), is associated with intake of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplements at levels above 100 milligrams per day. As little as 50 milligrams per day has caused re\u00ad swnption of symptoms in an individual previously injured by higher intakes. The RDA for vitamin B 6 is 2 milli\u00ad grams. Vitamin B6 is marketed in capsules containing dos\u00ad ages in the 100-, 200-and 500-milligrams range. C. Niacin (nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) Niacin taken in high doses is known to cause a wide range of adverse effects. The RDA for niacin is 20 milli\u00ad grams. Niacin is marketed in dietary supplements at poten\u00ad cies of 250 mg, 400 mg, and 500 mg, in both immediate and slow-release fonnulations. Daily doses of 500 mg from slow-release fonnulations, and 750 mg of immediate- 104 release niacin, have been associated with severe adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal dis~ (burning pain, nausea, vomiting, bloating, aamping, and dianbea) and mild to severe liver damage. Less common, but more seri\u00ad ous (in some ~ life-threatening), reactions include liver injury, myopathy (muscle disease), maculopathy of the eyes (injury to the eyes resulting in decreased vision), coagulopathy (increased bleeding problems), cytopenia (decreases in cell types in the blood), hypotensive myo\u00ad cardial ischemia (heart injury caused by too low blood ~me), and metabolic acidosis (increases in the acidity of the blood and urine). Niacin (nicotinic acid) is approved as a prescription drug to lower cholesterol. Many of the observed adverse reactions have occurred when patients have switched to OTC f01D1ulations of niacin, and particularly when they have switched from immediate-release f01D1ulations to dietary supplements containing slow-release niacin fomm\u00ad lations without the knowledge of their physicians. D. Selenium Selenium is a mineral found in dietary supplement products. At high doses (approximately 800 to 1,000 micrograms per day), selenium can cause tissue damage, especially in tissues or organs that concentrate the ele\u00ad ment The toxicity of selenium depends upon the chemical form of selenium in the ingested supplement and upon the selenium levels in the foods consumed. Human injuries have occurred following ingestion of high doses over a few weeks. IV. Other Products Marketed as Dietary Supplements A. Gennaniwn Germanium is a nonessential element Recently, ger\u00ad manium has been marketed in the form of inorganic ger\u00ad manium salts and novel organogennanium compounds, as a \"dietary supplement.\" These products are promoted for their claimed immunomodulatory effects~ or as \"health\u00ad promoting\" elixirs. Germanium supplements, when used chronically, have caused nephrotoxicity (kidney injury) and death. Since 1982, there have been 20 reported cases of acute renal failure, including two deaths, attributed to oral intakes of germanium elixirs. In surviving patients, kidney function has improved after discontinuation of ger\u00ad manium, but none of the patients have recovered nonnal kidney function. One particular organogennanium compound, an azaspiran organogennanium, bas been studied for its potential use as an anticancer drug. Forty percent of the patients in this study experienced \u00b7transient neurotoxicity (nerve damage), and two patients developed puhnonruy toxicity. Because of these side effects, medically super\u00ad vised administration of this drug with monitoring for tox\u00ad icity has been recommended for those using gennanium chronically. 105 "}
