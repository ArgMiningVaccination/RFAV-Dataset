For more and more brides, a wedding would not be complete without a healthy dose of mysticism\u2014and even a touch of witchcraft. \"If you want to plan a witchier wedding, or just something outside the norm, you want to start with your ring,\" says Bri Luna of [The Hoodwitch](http://www.thehoodwitch.com/). \"Most people gravitate toward diamonds for engagement rings, but crystals and gems have different meanings. A diamond isn't the worst stone, but it's not really representative of love. Emerald is the stone that represents the heart chakra.\" Melissa Madara, co-owner of [Catland Books](http://www.catlandbooks.com/about/), wears a moonstone engagement ring. Madara's wedding will take place at Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery next fall, on a September date that was deemed \"fortuitous\" by an astrologer. And before the big day, \"we're going to be charging all my jewelry as talismans for the wedding,\" Madara says. \"My wedding jewelry will sit under the new moon to the full moon. We're also going to let it sit in ritualized water to make me open and ready to do this life-changing, magical work of marriage.\" For her engagement party, Madara focused on cleansing rituals. \"We had someone wash away all the past relationships that we've ever had, and bless the one we have now,\" she said. \"Then we washed our hands in a bath of rue, and everyone at the engagement party pelted us with rose petals.\" (For rookie alchemists: Rue is an herb associated with protection; it's also thought to promote love.) Bachelorette parties are following mystical suit. Colleen McCann, founder of [Style Rituals](http://www.stylerituals.com/), works with brides to create personalized medicine bags for them to carry on their wedding day. The bespoke kits can hold anything from sage bundles and healing crystals to old photos and herbs that invoke love. And they're not just for the bride. \"I've done many bachelorette parties,\" McCann says. \"I'll put together medicine bags for everyone in the bridal party, and sometimes I do it for the groom as well.\" In order to put together personalized bags for each member of the party, McCann does intuitive crystal readings to tap into each client's energetic needs. A former stylist, McCann also consults with brides to find a \"power color\" that will bring good vibes to the wedding day; that color can be incorporated into bridesmaid dresses or decor. With these new traditions come new roles for the wedding party. \"I'll be using my bridal party as my coven; we're going to be doing a lot of magic together,\" says Madara. The night before her wedding, Madara and her bridesmaids will light special incense to ensure that the bride-to-be doesn't have stressful dreams. And on the big day, Madara's maid of honor will anoint the bridal party using a custom oil infused with herbs associated with grounding and love. Those herbs may include rose hips, licorice root, and lemon balm. \"I also like jasmine for this sort of thing because it's a bit dreamier and makes you feel like you're in a fairy tale,\" Madara says. McCann has been known to \"sage off\" wedding couples before they walk down the aisle; other couples are engaging in relaxing pre-ceremony rituals ranging from meditation to sound healing and more. \"It's really important to have self-care the morning of the wedding,\" says Sarah Bisceglie of [Maha Rose Center for Healing](https://www.maharose.com/). \"You know how hectic weddings get\u2014people start coming early, you have family members you have to entertain. But it's very important to prioritize relaxation to get ready for what will happen.\" Bisceglie recommends an early-morning meditation on the day of the wedding. \"If you can meditate in the morning, you can continually visit that relaxing, grounding place that you started the day in,\" she says. [Lisa Rose Lodeski](https://www.trulyliving.net/) is a master Reiki practitioner who meets with couples before wedding ceremonies, typically about an hour before they're set to walk down the aisle. (Don't fret: \"I can do Reiki standing, so that the dress doesn't get wrinkled,\" Lodeski says.) \"We have a whole lot of nervous emotional and physical stuff that comes up right before we walk down the aisle,\" Lodeski says. \"But Reiki helps clear the energy, clear the aura, so that as two people come together as a couple, their energy is totally clear. They'll be relaxed, their chakras will be balanced, and any kind of block that's keeping them from feeling their authenticity is removed.\" Couples may also cleanse the space they get married in. At Madara's wedding, \"the physical space itself will be ritualized,\" she says. \"We're going to be employing a floor wash for the tiles of the aisle. It's a common practice in hoodoo and folk magic: Brew a bunch of herbs and use them as part of a wash to bless the space.\" Of course, New Age wedding ceremonies call for an officiant who's on the proper wavelength. Madara's officiant will be her business partner, who is a chaos magician. To lead her recent ceremony, Sarah Faith Gottesdiener of [Visual Magic](https://visualmagic.info/) tapped priestess [Dori Midnight](http://www.dorilandia.com/index.html). A justice of the peace who's also an intuitive healer with her own apothecary, Midnight began the ceremony with a practice called calling the circle. \"It's calling in the elements, calling in the direction, and grounding us all here in the space together,\" Gottesdiener explains. To keep the magic alive at the reception, Luna suggests making crystal grids for tabletop decor. The grids are created by placing crystals in intentional patterns that direct energy toward a specific goal; it's believed that the crystals become charged with the energy behind that goal. Lodeski suggests employing wishing bowls. To create the bowls, couples ask guests to write a \"good-vibration wish\" on a strip of paper and send it back with the RSVP card. The wishes can then go into one giant bowl at the entrance of the reception or be put into smaller bowls at each tabletop. After the reception, \"instead of taking a bag of mints, people take a wish,\" Lodeski says. And, like magic: \"It's always the exact "}
