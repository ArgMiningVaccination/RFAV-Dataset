As they reported online December 8th, 2015 in Molecular Psychiatry, the team looked at 23,748 individuals with ASD and nearly 209,000 unaffected individuals, all born in Sweden between 1984 and 2007. The group found that ASD was 59 percent more prevalent in children born to women with PCOS a relationship that was independent of PCOS complications such as increased neonatal distress or C-section delivery. The apparent PCOS link may seem odd at first glance. But, it fits with a theory for autism development that centers on androgens-male sex hormones. Many researchers suspect conditions that boost androgen levels or otherwise upset hormone balance during pregnancy may alter fetal brain formation in ways that contribute to social deficits, delayed language and other autism-associated symptoms later in life. The diagram is showing the break in the hormonal layers in the brain. Although ASD is five times more common in boys than in girls, babies born to mothers with PCOS in the study had the same risk regardless of the sex of the child. A different research shows having elevated levels of steroid hormones, (testosterone, progesterone, and cortisol) are found in ASD children. Because some of these hormones are produced in much higher quantities in males than in females, this may help us explain why autism is more common in males. In my lecture, I will talk about ways to minimize the risk and discuss my personal story. Biography Melinda Luke has her expertise in helping PCOS women from personal experience. She has an Undergrad in Medical Administration and Coding. After starting a family, she has worked for Insulite Laboratories, where she talked with PCOS women all over the world.

Her websites and health coaching programs are packed with the latest information. SyndromeHypnosis, neuroscience and epigenetics: PCOS behavior Jimi Sayo London PCOS Talks Meetup, UK Statement of the Problem: The motivation and belief system in a PCOS patient to adopt radical lifestyle choices to manage PCOS are challenged by discouraging messages and daily setbacks. The truth is, we're all hypnotists, affecting people with what we say and how we say it, influenced by suggestions from the media, medical experts, friends and family. The mind will selectively hold on to messages and memories that suit an unconscious but outdated benefit. With PCOS, she who was the fittest and most fertile in famine conditions of the past, was key to the survival of her clan. Today, the ancient advantage has turned on her, creating mental and physical lethargy, stuttering fertility and a struggling endocrine system in a body under-engineered for the gastronomical and toxic excesses of the 21st century. Conclusion & Significance: The good news is the woman with PCOS has the genetic advantages of a warrior mind and body if her unconscious is rewired to reverse the hormonal chaos. Her biological fate is not set in stone, thanks to epigenetics and the power of suggestion through hypnosis, psycho sensory therapies like Havening (amygdala depotentiation therapy), EFT and EMDR. These tools change the thinking environment with a positive knock on effect on behavior and life-style choices that can create and sustain a life free of PCOS. Hypnosis has been used medically since the ancient Sleep Temples of 1700's Egypt, where deep trance was combined with curative suggestions. In the 1850s, the surgeon, James Esdaile, performed amputations under hypnosis. In the 1960s, David Elman taught hypnosis to medics. Havening is challenging thinking on healing. It's the 21st Century, and my presentation will demonstrate what the body can do, when the mind tuned for healing. Biography Jimi Sayo has practiced as a Hypnotherapist and Wellness Coach for ten years. She motivates women by reprogramming their desire for change and empowerment. She specializes in education based weight control, coaching her clients to a greater understanding between their nutritional choices, and aligning their past with their present. She combines her skills in therapeutic hypnotherapy, Neuro Linguistic Programming, and Havening to coach her clients to greater self-awareness. She is the host of the online PCOS Summit, and runs the London PCOS Talks Meetup World Congress on Polycystic Ovarian SyndromeThe relationship between surviving childhood abuse and developing PCOS later in life: A Case Study Sara Jacobsen Conceive With Joy, USA Statement of the problem: One in every 10 women is diagnosed with infertility in the USA. Researchers have studied the relationship between women experiencing childhood abuse and developing PMS, uterine fibroids, endometriosis and pelvic pain. However, not much research has been done on the relationship between experiencing childhood abuse and developing PCOS. This presentation will highlight the potential relationship between experiencing childhood abuse and developing PCOS. This presentation will detail how I, the presenter, healed myself of PCOS through healing my childhood sexual abuse, and through ritual. Lastly, this presentation presents possible viable alternative healing modalities, such as spiritual healing, energy healing, and Shamanism, for women desiring to heal naturally from PCOS. Methodology and theoretical orientation: Our subject, Sara Jacobsen, was diagnosed with PCOS and infertility at age 29. Subject was given treatment of an herbal remedy which she consumed for one month. A month after diagnosis, subject met a Priestess of the fertility Goddess Oshun, and received a spiritual cleaning on her womb by said Priestess. Subject released emotional pain over childhood sexual abuse through spiritual healing work and rituals with the Goddess Oshun, as well as energy healing and Shamanism, over an 8 month period of time. Findings: Subject then went back to her doctor and underwent a trans-vaginal ultrasound again as well as a blood test again. Subject's physical markers of having PCOS were gone. Conclusion and Significance: The significance of this case study is threefold. 1. To establish the connection between experiencing childhood abuse and later developing PCOS or other gynecological disorders 2. To educate the practitioners in attendance on this phenomenon so they can better educate their patients and 3. To inform practitioners in attendance of possible techniques for patients to naturally heal from PCOS including practicing spiritual healing, energy healing, mindfulness techniques and Shamanism.

Currently, she is working in private hospital practicing Obstetrics and Polycystic Ovarian SyndromeWorkshop Day 2Page 33 Issue Congress on Polycystic Ovarian SyndromeA critical appraisal of PCOS diagnosis and management What does Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) mean for women today? This disorder affects 10-15% of women between the ages of 14 to 44. The luteinizing hormone (LH) and insulin resistance are the most common endocrine aberrations seen in PCOS. Symptoms include irregular or absent period cycles, excess body and facial hair, diabetes, excessive acne, pelvic pain due to cyst, obesity and challenges with pregnancy. However, this shouldn't deter women from their dream of having children, because it is still possible. During this session, we will examine: the implications of PCOS on health and fertility level; pathophysiology of PCOS and the incidence of PCOS in women who are of reproductive age; current fertility treatments and options available to assist women who are diagnosed with PCOS on getting pregnant: metformin, clomid, Intrauterine Insemination (IUI) and In Vitro Fertilization (IVF); the advantages and disadvantages of birth control on the female reproductive system; diagnostic criteria and assessment of PCOS for better outcomes and how to best prepare a woman with PCOS diagnosis for conception? Our goal is to help you better educate the women in your care with PCOS about their bodies and their options, and to provide those women with realistic hope when it comes to starting and/or growing their families.

In western medicine, the same standard of care is applied to this demographic. However, the results are variable and may not offer an effective solution. Unlike other cultures, addressing the Indian diet and phenotypes may be the key to treating this population. Symptoms such as insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, infertility, irregular menstruation, and higher testosterone are several symptoms that may manifest in PCOS. It is possible that not these patients that present with the symptoms will be diagnosed with PCOS after routine examination. Some patients may have symptoms but have normal ovulation and ovarian health. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) options for PCOS treatment. Eastern medicine considers culture and phenotypes when treating patients which may offer a solution for Indian PCOS patients. TCM can offer treatments which can help to prevent and treat hormonal imbalance in Indian PCOS patients leading to better overall health outcomes. In addition, the TCM view can also better define prevention and early intervention measures which can be taken. TCM methods can also be applied to those with PCOS symptoms but do not have the diagnosis. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: By analyzing the Indian population diet, lifestyle, and gene-culture coevolution, a trend was discovered. Based upon the emerging commonality of Indian women, a universal TCM diagnosis could be adapted. Though each patient is an individual and TCM diagnosis is based upon this individuality, the common gene that runs through most Indian women is derived. Findings: The common TCM diagnosis for PCOS in Indian women is spleen deficiency and kidney yang deficiency. TCM protocols account for acupuncture treatments, herbal therapy, and diet. These factors are addressed within this paper which may help both eastern and western medicine doctors to better understand and formulate optimal protocols to treat PCOS in this population.

Ovarian SyndromeHooded disease-PCOS: Lifestyle-change with DEBEC-System: First Eckert-Krause Fachinstitut f\u00fcr Stoffwechsel und Gesundheit, Austria Background: and hair/skin problems as main-factors for PCOS, don\u00b4t reflect every symptom of PCOS. Insulin resistance, hyper-cholesterolemia and reduced metabolism lead to far-reaching implications as increased risks of e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Hashimoto and endometrial cancer. Throughout a woman's life, PCOS is present, actual without curing. This endocrine-metabolic disorder is multifarious, the root cause yet unknown. Therefore, a defined therapy after early diagnosis is important. Method: Pilot-Case Study, DEBEC-Systematic (Diagnostics-Eating-Balance-Exercise-Coaching) steering physical activity, dietary- change, holistic coaching. Period: 24 months, Endpoint: 15 kg weight-reduction and lifestyle-adaption. Measuring: weight (kg) and girth of waist (cm), hip (cm), neck (cm), BMI, body fat (in %), waist-hip ratio (WHR). Blood test: hormonal status, choles-terol, triglyceride, fasten glucose. Review after 36, 48, 60 months to emblaze sustainability of DEBEC-Method. Results: After 24 month's therapies: weight reduction 17.1 kg (11 kg within 12 months). Blood test: normal hormonal status (under birth control pill), normal blood sugar level but cholesterol and triglyceride are out of specification (OOS). Contraceptive: Try and Error with Midane, Y asmin, Y az, Cerazette related to side-effects. Personal: motivated, full of energy, success within her studies. Psychological: learned accepting living with PCOS. Review after 36, 48, 60 months cho-lesterol was still OOS and weight was 61\u00b12 kg (BMI 22.8\u00b11.5). Conclusion: This Pilot Study shows how an individual based therapy with defined mod-ules (DEBEC) can be successful related to health risk reduction suitable for daily use. Fat metabolism was not affected and must be further under control. Because of training about nutrition and exercise, the patient is en-abled for own health management (e.g. weight control in a 2-kg weight scope round BMI 23). Coaching is important for the pa-tient to preserve over a long time-period. Broader evidence based long-term studies are needed to fulfill individual requirements of PCOS-Patients with the DEBEC-Method. Biography Marion Eckert-Krause is a specialist for metabolic diseases. After training as a Practice Nurse and Garden-er, she has studied Biology and Waste Management, and then she has worked for several years in field of sales before moving to internal sales via key account management.

Ovulation Induction with Clomiphene Citrate (CC) is a first line treatment given in different doses. Researchers have reported that escalating the dose of CC in the same cycle after knowing the follicle size (also called stair-step protocol) is more effective than increasing it in the subsequent cycle (also called traditional protocol). However, the literature is sparse, and this study purpose is to bring light to a different and better method of using CC. Methodology & Theoretical Orientation: A Randomized Control Trial was done in women receiving CC for OI as a stair-step protocol (SSP) in the study group the dose of CC was increased gradually from 50 mg to 150 mg when the follicle size was insufficient to look for ovulation and later pregnancy. The study group was compared to control group where the dose was increased in next cycle after every failure of the previous dose. Findings: The women in study group using SSP has higher ovulation rate and pregnancy rate. The duration of treatment was significantly shorter in study group. The dose of 100 mg was the most effective dose for OI in either group. Conclusion & Significance: By using SSP , effective treatment is provided in significantly shorter time in without any detrimental effect on ovulation and pregnancy rates Women with PCOS and Infertility are benefitted using SSP .

They have more anxiety and depression, more arthritis and tendinitis, more headaches, and more irritable bowel syndrome. This presentation will discuss the issues of pain and mood disorder in women with PCOS, and how they are closely linked and are greatly related to both the nutritional status and the endemic inflammation of the gut in women with PCOS. The evolving world of \"nutritional psychiatry\" recognizes that the brain is intricately linked to gut health, and that gut inflammation, and the resultant impaired gut barrier (leaky gut), result in systemic endotoxemia and consequently more mood disorders and hypersensitivity to pain stimuli. Women with PCOS are greatly impacted by various pain syndromes and anxiety. Women generally have heightened pain sensitivity and develop significantly more mood disorders than do men, which relates to the role of estrogen in both gut and brain wellbeing. Women with PCOS generally are more inflamed and have more gut dysbiosis. My presentation will bring all bodily systems together into a clear and cohesive focus, centered upon hormonal balance and the detection of nutritional deficiencies and gut dysbiosis, factors which lie at the center of mood disorders and chronic pain for women with PCOS. Biography Felice Gersh is a Board Certified in both OB/GYN and in the new specialty of Integrative Medicine.

However, further research has highlighted the multifaceted nature of PCOS involving several endocrine releasing glands beyond the realm of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. The endocrine releasing glands potentially involved as part of this multi-glandular syndrome are the thyroid, hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenals (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) and the pancreas. Apart from these glands, the liver is often impacted in those with PCOS. Abnormal lipoprotein profile can be found, typically including low high-density lipoproteins (HDL), elevated low-density lipoproteins (LDL), elevated triglycerides, elevated total cholesterol and low apoprotein A-12. The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considerable in conditions correlated with insulin resistance (IR) which is a common feature of PCOS. It is speculated that NAFLD is a hepatic indicator of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome and IR are both an increasingly common finding in a PCOS presentation. Considering the multi-dimensional nature of PCOS; a treatment protocol needs to address all factors to successfully treat and manage this complex syndrome. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is just one of many nutritional medicines that is considered an effective adjunctive therapy for the treatment of PCOS. NAC is a sulfur containing derivative from the amino acid L-cysteine and is a precursor to glutathione. This lecture will uncover the diverse actions of NAC, beyond that of purely correcting sex hormone imbalance in women suffering with PCOS.

She is the Founder and the Director of Reproduc - tive Wellness, a naturopathic practice specialising in reproductive endocrinology located Congress on Polycystic Ovarian SyndromeDoes PCOS increase the risk of developing endometrial cancer? Paul Stanciu Oncology Center of North London, UK Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome is an endocrine disorder encountered in 4-18% of all women at reproductive age. On the other side, endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynecological cancers in developed countries. About 25% of women with EC are pre-menopausal and 5% of all cases are diagnosed at ages younger than 40 years. In 1949, Speert was the first to suggest the association between PCOS and EC. Women with PCOS present several risk factors for EC: unopposed estrogen exposure of the endometrium increases the risk for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, but there is also obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, nulliparity, and progesterone resistance. Until the end of the last century several studies that support this association were published. Most of this studies lack control groups and the number of the subjects was too small. One recent study from UK shows an increased endometrial expression of genes involved in insulin signaling pathway (IGF1, IGFBP1 and PTEN) for women with PCOS and EC. Also, Cyclin D1 expression was shown to be significantly increased in the endometrial cancers associated with PCOS. Recent meta-analysis show women with PCOS are three times more likely to develop EC. This translates into a lifetime risk of 9% for developing EC compared with only 3% in the general population. Danish Cohort Study published in 2015 found an almost fourfold increased risk for endometrial cancer. Considering that, early endometrial cancer detection and treatment are associated with more than 86% survival rate at 5 years, this association calls for implementation of risk-reducing measures and sustained screening programs. Biography Paul Stanciu has completed his residency training in Obstetrics and Gynecology in Romania. He obtained his PhD from Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy from Timisoara, Romania. He did an Oncological Gynecology Fellowship with St. James's Hospital in Dublin, Ireland and now he is fellow with one of the busiest Oncology Center of North London area at Watford. He has published several papers regarding minimally invasive techniques used to treat gynecological malignancies and has a great interest in fertility sparing patients with polycystic ovary syndrome Erika Toth MSc, MA, University of Szeged, Hungary Due to the nature of the condition, PCOS patients suffer both from primary and secondary psychological consequences. The primary psychological consequences stem from the hormonal imbalance, while the secondary psychological consequences follow the emotional burden patients face. Despite this phenomenon, medical treatment of PCOS often only focuses on the physiological sypmtoms, and psychological problems remain untreated. Psychological problems however often impact the physiological symptoms, thus worsening the condition. A recent study conducted at our university aimed to explore this multidimensional syndrome, and its relation with depression, anxiety, satisfaction with life, self-efficacy and certain demographic variables. Analyzing data of women with and without PCOS, significant difference was observed in their values of depression and satisfaction with life. No significant difference was found related to their values of anxiety, self-efficacy and their demographic values. The result of the research project suggests that screening and prevention of depression should be part of PCOS treatment, and patients need accurate information about the long-term risks associated with this condition in order to achieve a sustainable lifestyle change.
