Emma Walmsley, Chief Executive Officer, GSK: \"We have delivered another excellent quarter of performance, with strong sales and earnings growth, notably in HIV and Vaccines, and continued strengthening of the R&D pipeline and product portfolio. The approval of Arexvy , the world's first RSV vaccine, was an important milestone for us and is at the f orefront of a next wave in vaccine innovation for GSK . Completion of the Bellus Health acquisition also strengthened our late -stage respiratory pipeline. Our momentum supports the upgrade we have made to our financial guidance for 2023 and further increase s our confidence in delivering longer -term profitable growth for shareholders .\" The Total results are presented in summary above and on page 7 and Adjusted results reconciliations are presented on pages 19, 20, 22 and 23.

Issued: Wednesday, 26 July 2023, London, U.K. Press release Second quarter 2023 2 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit ors review report Results Summary 2023 guidance GSK revises its full year guidance at constant exchange rates (CER). All expectations and full -year growth rates exclude any contributi ons from COVID -19 solutions. During the first half of 2023, GSK exceeded its full-year guidance expectations with a strong performance. This was due to GSK' s strong business momentum across all product areas but particularly in HIV, as well as in General Medicines. The strong allergy season and a favourable post-pandemic recovery in comparison to the first half of 2022 also contributed to the performance. As a result, GSK has upgraded its full -year 2023 guidance at constant exchange rates (CER), excluding any contributions from COVID -19 solutions : Turnover is expected to increase between 8 to 10 per cent (from 6 to 8 per cent ) Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase b etween 11 to 13 per cent (from 10 to 12 per cent ) Adjusted earnings per share is expected to increase between 14 to 17 per cent ( from 12 to 15 per cent ) In the second half of 2023, GSK expects continued strong performance across all three product areas but with lower growth reflecting a tough comparison to the second half of 2022, particularly in HIV and General Medicines. GSK still expects Adjusted operating profit growth to be higher in the second half of 2023 relative to full -year expectations, with growth of investment reducing in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. This guidance is supported by the following turnover expectations for full year 2023 at CER: Vaccines - expected increase of mid -teens per cent in turnover (unchanged ) Specialty Medicines - expected increase of high single -digit per cent in turnover ( from mid to high single - digit increase ) General Medicines - expected increase of low single -digit per cent in turnover ( from broadly flat to slightly down ) Adjusted Operating profit is now expected to grow between 11 to 13 per cent at CER (previously 10 to 12 per cent increase), reflecting higher sales and higher royalty income partially offset by cost of sales which is now expected to increase broadly in line with turnover, reflecting a greater contribution from General Medicines. SG&A is anticipated to increase at a rate broadly aligned to turnover, reflecting targeted support for launches and R&D continues to be expected to increase at a rate slightly below turnover. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected to increase between 14 to 17 per cent at CER, reflecting higher operating profit and more favourable net finance costs. Expectations for non -controlling interests and tax rate of around 15% are unchanged . Additional commentary Dividend policies and expected pay-out ratios remain unchanged for GSK. The future dividend policies and guidance regarding the expected dividend pay -out in 2023 for GSK are provided on page 36. COVID -19 solutions In Q2 2023, turnover increased by 4% at CER reflecting the comparison to Q2 2022. Excluding COVID -19 solutions, turnover increased by 11% at CER. The adverse impact of lower sales of COVID -19 solutions was one percentage point of growth in the quarter on Adjusted operating profit but increased the margin by 1.8 percentage points. GSK does not anticipate further significant COVID -19 pandemic -related sales or operating profit in 2023. Consequently, GSK now expects full-year 2023 turnover growth to be impacted by approximately 8%, with Adjusted Operating profit growth being reduced between 4% to 5% versus the prior year. All expectations, guidance and targets regarding future performance and dividend payments should be read togeth er with 'Guidance, assumptions and cautionary statements' on page 55. If exchange rates were to hold at the closing rates on 30 Jun 2023 ($1.26/\u00a31, \u20ac1.17/\u00a31 and Yen 183/\u00a31) for the rest of 2023, the estimated impact on 2023 Sterling turnover growth for GSK would be -2% and if exchange gains or losses were recognised at the same level as in 2022, the estimated impact on 2023 Sterling Adjusted Operating Profit growth for GSK would be -5%.

Sales outside of the US in the quarter also include stocking for the UK national immunisation programme and channel inventory replenishment in China. US sales declined 10% in the quarter impacted by unfavourable wholesaler and distributor inventory movements plus lower non -retail demand partly offset by strong retail growth and pricing. The US cumulative immuni sation rate grew from 30% at year end to 32% at the end of Q1 23 with vaccination in adults 65 and older boosted by co -pay removal in the Inflation Reduction Act. Shingrix is now available in 33 countries. Meningitis Q2 23 266 13% 13% YTD 546 upon the momentum from Q1 23, Meningitis vaccines grew again in Q2 23 primarily driven by Bexsero , the vaccine against meningitis B, with higher sales in Europe mainly from inclusion in National Immunisation Programmes and in International due to increased private and public market demand. YTD sales benefitted from the initial stocking of Menveo liquid formulation and higher CDC purchases in the US as well as demand in anticipation of a Bexsero price increase in International in Q1 23.

Cervarix , grew in Q2 23 in International and Europe reflecting higher demand and timing of deliveries. This is partly offset by Infanrix/Pediar ix, due to the negative impact of a CDC stockpile borrow in the quarter and continued competitive pressure in the US. Outside of Q2 23 performance drivers, YTD turnover includes growth of Hepatitis vaccines resulting from continued travel market recovery i n Europe and International and a decline on Synflorix , reflecting lower demand related to decreased birth cohorts and phasing of public market supply in International . Specialty Medicines there were minimal sales of Xevudy contrasting with strong sales YTD 2022. Specialty Medicines growth excluding C OVID -19 solutions reflects consistent performance in Q2 23 and YTD driven by HIV and Respiratory/Immunology and Other categories YTD 3,048 18% 14% The performance of HIV benefit ted from strong patient demand, driven by the Oral two -drug regimen (Oral 2DR) and Long -Acting medicines which contributed approximately eight percentage points of growth . Pricing favourability driven by the US contributed two percentage points of growth . YTD includes t he majority of the inventory depletio n now expected from the 2022 bui ld. sales growth continues and now represent 51% of the total HIV portfolio compared to 39% for Q2 2 2, driven by market share growth of 4 p ercentage points versus Q2 22. Long -Acting medicines sales in the quarter were \u00a3212 million, growing \u00a31 28 million v ersus Q2 22 and \u00a361 million v ersus Q1 23, with approximately three quarters of sales coming from patient switches f rom competitor products. Respiratory/Immunology and Other Q2 23 792 16% 16% YTD Nucala and Benlysta plus Duvroq (Daprodustat) in Japan. Growth in Q2 23 exceeds YTD reflecting the impact of wholesaler inventory movements in US and International regions in Q1 23. antibody treatment for severe asthma, with additional indications including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) . Strong growth in all regions in Q2 23 reflected patient demand in severe eosinophilic asthma and for the new indications with ongoing launches. YTD growth is slightly lower due to impact of US inventory depletion in Q1 23 and an unfavourable prior period Return and Rebates for Lupus, continues to show consistent growth representing strong demand in US and Europe a longside biological penetration and volume uptake in China and Japan. US growth in Q2 23 shows an acceleration following wholesaler inventory movements in Q1 23 .

Jemperli grew strongly in Q2 23, achieving \u00a325 million sales driven by increasing new patient starts in the US, and is now available in 18 markets worldwide. Zejula Q2 23 117 (3%) (2%) YTD 231 6% 4% In the US, growth of the first line indication of Zejula , a PARP inhibitor treatment for ovarian cancer, was more than offset by reduction in use in second line following the update to prescribing information agreed with the FDA in Q4 2022. Zejula delivered strong sales growth in Europe and International markets in both Q2 23 and YTD. 23 and YTD by both Respiratory and Other General Medicines categories, with ongoing demand for Trelegy in all regions. YTD benefit ted from a strong allergy season in Japan and continued post pandemic recovery of the antibiotic market in Europe and International regions. Respiratory Q2 23 YTD reflects growth of Trelegy and the single inhaled triple therapy (SITT) class across all regions and of Anoro in Europe and International. YTD g rowth also includes the benefits of a strong allergy season in Japan. In Q2 23 and YTD favourable US prior period RAR adjustments to Seretide/Advair and Trelegy were offset by adverse adjustments for COPD and asthma. Trelegy grew in Q2 23 and YTD with strong performance across all regions, reflecting increased patient demand and growth of the SITT market. Favourable US prior period RAR adjustments contributed 7 percentage points of growth in Q2 23 and 3 percentage points YTD. asthma and COPD. Growth in Q2 23 and YTD reflected targeted promotion in certain International markets and the benefit of favourable US prior period RAR adjustments which contributed 16 percentage points in Q2 23 and 14 percentage points YTD. Growth was partially offset by the ongoing impact of generic competition in Europe, US and cer tain International markets. Other General Medicines Q2 23 YTD 1,748 2% 6% Growth in Q2 23 reflects ongoing post pandemic demand for anti -infectives in Europe and International, and certain third party manufacturing agreements . Ongoing generic competition continues to impact this product group in Q2 23 and YTD.

Excluding this effect, Specialty Medicines grew in Q2 23 and YTD driven by strong HIV performance and Nucala and Benlysta continued growth, partially offset by Oncology, due to the withdrawal of Blenrep in November 2022. General Medicines grow th was driven by Trelegy increased patient demand and growth of the SITT market. Vaccines product group was broadly flat in Q2 23 and YTD reflecting lower non -retail demand, wholesaler destocking and a strong Q1 22 comparator on Shingrix growth resulting in a decline of 10% in the quarter for Shingrix , offset by favourable CDC stockpile movements in Established 2022 cause d a 8 percentage point s adverse impact on growth in Q2 23 and 12 percentage points in YTD. Excluding this effect, Europe grew strongly in Q2 23 and YTD. Vaccines strong growth reflected Shingrix stocking, launches and uptake and Bexsero national immunisation campaigns in France and Spain alongside ongoing travel vaccin e recovery. Specialty Medicines delivered double digit growth due to HIV, Oncology, and in Respiratory/ Immunology for Benlysta and Nucala which included the impact of new indication launches. International Total Q2 23 1,924 (7%) 2022 caused a 17 percentage point s adverse impact on growth in Q2 23 and 14 percentage points in YTD . Excluding this effect, all product groups grew in Q2 23 and YTD. Vaccines double digit growth was driven by Shingrix stocking in China and uptake in Japan plus launches in other markets. Specialty Medicines grew due to HIV, Oncology and Respiratory/ Immunolog y with Nucala delivering strong growth in severe eosinophilic asthma and new indications. General Medicines product group was driven by Respiratory, with Trelegy growth and a strong allergy season in Japan. Other General Medicines growth was driven by strong post pandemic antibiotic demand for Augmentin .

In the quarter , positive mix and efficiencies were offset by higher freight and energy costs and the year to date also reflected an unfavourable comparator to a one -time benefit from inventory adjustments in Q1 2022 . Q2 2023 Year to Date \u00a3m AER CER \u00a3m AER CER Selling, general & administration Total 2,268 in Total and Adjusted SG&A in Q2 2023 primarily reflected an increased level of launch investment in Specialty Medicines, particularly HIV and Vaccines including Shingrix and preparation for the launch of Arexvy . Total SG&A also reflected an increas e in significant legal costs in the quarter (see details on page 19). Year to date growth in Total and Adjusted SG&A is primarily relating to an increased level of launch investment in Specialty Medicines, particularly HIV and Vaccines , and the Zejula royalty dispute provision in Q1 2023. Growth was partly offset by favourable comparison due to impairment provisions relating to Ukraine in the year to date 2022 and the continuing benefit of restructuring and tight control of ongoing costs . Q2 2023 Year to Date \u00a3m AER CER \u00a3m AER CER Research & development Total 1.9% Growth in Total and Adjusted R&D reflected continued investment across a combination of both early and late -stage programmes. There was increased investment in the early -stage research portfolio, particularly CCL17 for osteo arthritic pain and IL18 for ato pic dermatitis. There was also increased investment in the HIV portfolio, particularly in next generation long -acting HIV medicines. In addition, there was higher investment in Jemperli as phase II/III trials in rectal and colon cancer progress as well as in ongoing trials in endometrial cancer and momelotinib, a potential new treatment of myelofibrosis patients with anaemia; and for bepirovirsen, to support development in chronic hepati tis B. These increases in investment were partly offset by decreases related to the completion of late -stage clinical programmes for otilimab and Cell & Gene Therapy. Within Vaccines there was increased investment in recently acquired pneumococcal progra mmes, partly offset by reduced investment in RSV following the successful completion of a phase III clinical trial and decreased spend on other programmes. The year to date factors were similar, but also include d reduced R&D investment in Blenrep versus the same period in 2022.

(Pfizer) put option and Pfizer and Shionogi & Co. Ltd (Shionogi) preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare . Year to date includes a favourable comparison due to an accounting credit of \u00a3460 million ( YTD 2022: \u00a31,0 31 million charge) arising from the remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities and the liabilities for the Pfizer put option and the Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends. This was partly offset by the upfront income in Q1 2022 of \u00a30.9 billion received from the settlement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) . Q2 2023 Year to Date \u00a3m AER CER \u00a3m Operating profit Total 2.3% Total operating profit margin was higher in the quarter and year to date due to strong operating performance and favourable movements in contingent consideration liabilities, partly offset in the year to date by an unfavourable comparison due to the \u00a30.9 b illion upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead in Q1 2022. Adjusted operating profit in Q2 2023 benefitted from strong sales across all three product areas and higher royalty income, partly offset by increased investment in R&D and product launches. The adverse impact of lower sales of COVID -19 solutions was one percentage point of growth in the quarter but increased the Adjusted operating profit margin by 1.8 percentage points. Year to date Adjusted operating profit was also impacted by lo wer sales of COVID - 19 solutions which led to a drag of 3 percentage points at AER and CER but increased the Adjusted operating profit margin by 2.9 percentage points. Excluding COVID -19 solutions sales, year to date Adjusted operating profit benefitted fro m strong sales partly offset by increased legal charges primarily relating to the Zejula royalty dispute and an unfavourable comparison to one -time benefits from inventory adjustments in the year to date 2022. Contingent consideration cash payments made t o Shionogi and other companies reduce the balance sheet liability. Total contingent consideration cash payments in the year to date 2023 amounted to \u00a3579 million ( YTD 2022: \u00a3615 million).

The R&D segment operating expenses primarily reflected continued investment across a c ombination of both early and late -stage programmes, as well as pneumococcal programmes. This was partly offset by decreases related to the completion of late -stage clinical development programmes and reduced investment in RSV and Blenrep versus the same period in 2022.

The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities. Q2 20 23 Year to Date \u00a3m AER CER \u00a3m AER CER Non-controlling interests Total (13%) (15%) 251 (19%) (24%) The increase in Total profit from continuing operations allocated to non -controlling interests in Q2 2023 was primarily driven by a higher allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a312 7 million (Q2 2022: \u00a341 million). The year to date was impacted by lower net profits in some of the Group's other entities with non -controlling interests with a stable allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3267 million ( 2022 : \u00a3268 million) . The Q2 2023 and year to date decrease s in Adjusted profit fr om continuing operations allocated to non -controlling interests reflected lower profit allocations from ViiV Healthcare of \u00a3136 million in the quarter (Q2 2022: \u00a3151 million) and year to date \u00a3256 million (2022: \u00a3264 million) and lower net profits in some of the Group's other entities with non-controlling interests . Q2 2023 Year to Date \u00a3p AER CER \u00a3p AER CER Earnings per in Total EPS in the quarter primarily reflected remeasurement credits for contingent consideration liabilities compared to charges in Q2 2022 partly offset by higher non -controlling interests. In the year to date there is an unfavourable compa rison due to upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead in Q1 2022. Adjusted EPS in the quarter and YTD reflected strong growth in sales across all product areas excluding COVID - 19 solutions, a benefit from mix, higher royalty income, lower finance costs and lower non -controlling interests, partly offset by investment behind launches in Specialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines and higher supply chain costs, freight and distribution costs. The year to date growth was also impacted by inc reased legal charges primarily relating to royalties. The decline in lower margin COVID -19 solutions sales resulted in 1 percentage point impact on Adjusted EPS growth in the quarter and 3 percentage points in the year to date . Currency impact on results The results for the year to date 2023 are based on average exchange rates, principally \u00a31/$ 1.23, \u00a31/\u20ac 1.14 and \u00a31/Yen 168. The results for Q2 2023 are based on average exchange rates, principally \u00a31/$ 1.25, \u00a31/\u20ac 1.15 and \u00a31/Yen 173. The period -end exchange r ates were \u00a31/$ 1.26, \u00a31/\u20ac 1.17 and \u00a31/Yen 183. Comparative exchange rates are given on page 37. In Q2 2023, turnover was up 4% at AER and 4% at CER. Total EPS from continuing operations was 40.1p compared with 17.5p in Q2 2022. Adjusted EPS was 38.8p compared with 34.7p in Q 2 2022, up 12% at AER and 16% at CER . The adverse currency impact primarily reflected the weakening of emerging market currencies against Sterling partly offset by weakening of Sterling against the US Dollar and the Euro. Exchange gains or losses on the settlement of intercompany transactions had a two percent adverse impact on the four percentage point s adverse currency impact on Adjusted EPS. In the year to date 2023, turnover was stable at AER and down 2% at CER. Total EPS from continuing operations was 76.9p compared with 54.8p in YTD 2022. Adjusted EPS compared with in YTD 2022, up 13% at AER and 12% at CER . The favourable currency impact primarily reflected the weakening of Sterling against the US Dollar and the Euro partly offset by the weakening of emerging market currencies against Sterling. Exchange gains or losses on the settlement of intercompany transactions had a one percent adverse impact on the one percentage point favourable currency impact on Adjus ted EPS.

Q2 2023 Cash generated from operating activities from continuing operations for the quarter was \u00a31,62 0 million (Q2 2022: \u00a31,58 4 million). The increase primarily reflected favourable timing of profit share payments for Xevudy and timing of returns and rebates, partly offset by additional pension contributions and an increase in trade receivables due to higher sales. Total cash pa yments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in the quarter were \u00a3 278 million (Q2 2022: \u00a3395 million), all of which was recognised in cash flows from operating activities. These payments are deductible for tax pu rposes. Free cash inflow was \u00a3 348 million for the quarter (Q2 2022: \u00a3264 million inflow). The increase primarily reflected favourable timing of profit share payments for Xevudy and timing of returns and rebates, partly offset by an increase in trade rece ivables due to higher sales , additional pension contributions and higher dividend payments to non - controlling interests. H1 2023 Cash generated from operating activities from continuing operations was \u00a3 1,907 million (H1 2022: \u00a33,936 million). The decrease primarily reflected an unfavourable comparison due to the upfront income from the settlement with Gilead received in Q1 2022, additional pension contributions, increase in trade receivables due to higher sal es, increase in seasonal inventory and lower payable balances reflecting increased investment in 2022. Total cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in the half year were \u00a3 565 million (H1 2022: \u00a3603 million), all of which was recognised in cash flows from operating activities. These payments are deductible for tax purposes. Free cash outflow was \u00a3 341 million for the six months (H1 2022: \u00a31,741 million inflow). The decrease primarily reflected an unf avourable comparison due to the upfront income from the settlement with Gilead received in Q1 2022, additional pension contributions, increase in trade receivables due to higher sales, increase in seasonal inventory , lower payable balances reflecting incre ased investment in 2022 and higher dividend payments to non - controlling interests . Total Net debt At 30 June 2023, net debt was \u00a3 18,220 million, compared with \u00a317,197 million at 31 December 2022, comprising gross debt of \u00a3 21,474 million and cash and liquid investments of \u00a3 3,254 million. Net debt increased by \u00a3 1 billion primarily due to the net acquisition cost of B ellus Health for \u00a31.4 b illion, dividends paid to shareholders of \u00a31.1 billion, and \u00a3 0.3 billion free cash outflow. This was partly offset by \u00a30.8 billion disposal of investments, \u00a30.1 billion disposal of businesses, \u00a30.2 billion of income received from equity investments and net favourable exchange impacts of \u00a3 0.7 billion from the translation of non -Sterling denominated debt and exchange on other financing items. At 30 June 2023, GSK had short -term borrowings (including overdrafts and lease liabilities) repayable within 12 months of \u00a3 5,921 million with loans of \u00a3 2,286 million repayable in the subsequent year .

This will support growth and returns to shareholders, reduce risk, and help GSK's people thrive while delivering sustainable health impact at scale. The Company has identifi ed six Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) focus areas that address what is most material to GSK's business and the issues that matter the most to its stakeholders. Highlights below include activity since Q1 2023 results. For more details on annual updates, please see GSK'S ESG Performance Report 2022 at: https://gsk.to/2022ESGPerf . Access Commitment: to make GSK's vaccines and medicines available at value -based prices that are sustainable for the business and implement access strategies that increase the use of GSK's vaccines and medicines to treat and protect underserved people. Progress since Q1 2023: GSK continues to support access to vaccines through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. In July, Gavi announced the first countries to be allocated doses of the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine against malaria, a vaccine developed by GSK and partners for use in malaria endemic countries. These nine new countries will start rolling out the vaccine with Gavi support from early 2024, joining the three countries (Ghana, Kenya and Malawi) involved in the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme. The announcement marks an important s tep towards reaching millions more children with this ground -breaking vaccine . In 2013, GSK and Save the Children formed an ambitious and strategic global partnership using the companies' combined expertise, resources and influence to help save one million children's lives . In June, the partnership reached a ten -year milestone and reported progress reaching over 3.5 million children in 51 countries with essential healthcare, training over 39,000 health workers and immunising over 240,000 children under the age of five. Performance metrics related to access are updated annually with details from the most recent year on page 9 of GSK's ESG Performance Report 2022. Global health and health security Commitment: develop novel products and technologies to treat and prevent priority diseases, including pandemic threats. Progress since Q1 2023: GSK is committed to tackling tuberculosis, the world's second -leading cause of death by infectious diseases after COVID -19. GSK's early research, up to proof -of-concept ( phase IIb), led to the development of candidate vaccine M72/AS01E against tuberculosis. GSK partnered with the Bill and Melinda Gates Medical Research institute for further development. In June, Wellcome and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced fun ding (approximately $550 million) for a phase III trial of the M72/AS01E candidate vaccine. If successful in late -stage clinical trials, it will be the first new vaccine to help prevent pulmonary tuberculosis in over a century . GSK has been working with partners since 1999 to tackle neglected tropical diseases, including lymphatic filariasis (LF), a debilitating disease caused by a parasite transmitted to humans through the bites of mosquitoes. A key component in eliminating LF, is the use of GSK's albendazole to reduce the level of parasites in infected people and break the cycle of transmission to endemic countries. GSK provides albendazole to endemic countries, including Bangladesh, through its donation programme. In June, Bang ladesh , via the WHO's South -East Asia Regional Office, announced that it has eliminated LF - a significant milestone in our joint effort to get ahead of disease together. Performance metrics related to global health and health security are updated annually with details from the most recent year on page 13 of GSK's ESG Performance Report 2022. Environment Commitment: committed to a net zero, nature -positive, healthier planet with ambitious goals set for 2030 and 2045. Progress since Q1 2023: GSK is dedicated to doing more to protect the environment and was selected by the Science Based Target Network (SBTN) to be part of the first group of companies preparing to set science -based targets for nature, building on our existing nature targets. GSK will be using their new guidance and methodologies to reduce our impacts on nature, increase positive outcomes for people, and build business resilience. GSK remains resolutely focused on delivering on existing nature targets while following new guidance and methodologies. GSK is supporting key suppliers to reduce their impact on nature by setting ambitious new standards for suppliers who provide materials that are highly dependent on nature, like lactose, gelatine and soy. The standards, developed in collaboration with third -party experts, aim to support these suppliers to assess, improve, and verify their approach to addressing a range of nature impacts - and associated climate and social impacts - including land -use, water stewardship and biodiversity. Meeting these standards should have positive impacts for nature and people and make our supply chains more resilient. More information can be found at: https://gsk.to/sustainable .

Progress since Q1 2023: GSK is committed to reducing health inequities and understands the industry can do more by investing in local interventions to help create healthier communities and sustain best practices from the pandemic. In June, GSK announced the launch of the COiMMUNI TY Initiative to contribute to a more equitable and resilient public health infrastructure and bolster existing partner efforts - leading to more vaccinated adults. Through the initiative, grant funding will be provided to support national, state, and loca l non -profit organi sations and community -based groups focused on adult immuni sation and health equity, increased information on adult immuni sation trends will be made available through enhanced vaccine tracking capabilities and new resources will help impl ement tangible solutions.

GSK also uses a number of adjusted, non -IFRS, measures to report the performance of its business. Adjusted results and other non -IFRS measures may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted results are defined below and other non -IFRS measures are defined on page 54. GSK believes that Adjusted results, when considered together with Total results, provide investors, analysts and other stakeholders with helpful complementa ry information to understand better the financial performance and position of the Group from period to period, and allow the Group's performance to be more easily compared against the majority of its peer companies. These measures are also used by manageme nt for planning and reporting purposes. They may not be directly comparable with similarly described measures used by other companies. GSK encourages investors and analysts not to rely on any single financial measure but to review GSK's quarterly results announcements, including the financial statements and notes, in their entirety. GSK is committed to continuously improving its financial reporting, in line with evolving regulatory requirements and best practice. In line with this practice, GSK expects t o continue to review and refine its reporting framework. Adjusted results exclude the profits from discontinued operations from the Consumer Healthcare business and the following items in relation to our continuing operations from Total results, together with the tax effects of all of these items: amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software and capitalised development costs) impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) and goodwill major restructuring costs, which include impairments of tangible assets and computer software, (under specific Board approved programmes that are structural, of a significant scale and where the costs of individual or related projects exceed \u00a325 million), includ ing integration costs following material acquisitions transaction -related accounting or other adjustments related to significant acquisitions proceeds and costs of disposal of associates, products and businesses; significant settlement income; signif icant legal charges (net of insurance recoveries) and expenses on the settlement of litigation and government investigations; other operating income other than royalty income, and other items Costs for all other ordinary course smaller scale restructuri ng and legal charges and expenses from continuing operations are retained within both Total and Adjusted results. As Adjusted results include the benefits of Major restructuring programmes but exclude significant costs (such as significant legal, major re structuring and transaction items) they should not be regarded as a complete picture of the Group's financial performance, which is presented in Total results. The exclusion of other Adjusting items may result in Adjusted earnings being materially higher o r lower than Total earnings. In particular, when significant impairments, restructuring charges and legal costs are excluded, Adjusted earnings will be higher than Total earnings. GSK has undertaken a number of Major restructuring programmes in response to significant changes in the Group's trading environment or overall strategy or following material acquisitions. Within the Pharmaceuticals sector, the highly regulated manufacturing operations and supply chains and long lifecycle of the business mean that restructuring programmes, particularly those that involve the rationalisation or closure of manufacturing or R&D sites are likely to take several years to complete. Costs, both cash and non -cash, of these programmes are provided for as individua l elements are approved and meet the accounting recognition criteria. As a result, charges may be incurred over a number of years following the initiation of a Major restructuring programme. Significant legal charges and expenses are those arising from th e settlement of litigation or government investigations that are not in the normal course and materially larger than more regularly occurring individual matters. They also include certain major legacy matters. Issued: Wednesday, 26 July 2023, London, U.K. Press release Second quarter 2023 18 Research and development ESG Total and Adjusted results Financial information Audit ors review report Results Summary Reconciliations between Total and Adjusted r esults, providing further information on the key Adjusting items, are set out on pages 19, 20, 22 and 23. GSK provides earnings guidance to the investor community on the basis of Adjusted results. This is in line with peer companies and expectations of th e investor community, supporting easier comparison of the Group's performance with its peers. GSK is not able to give guidance for Total results as it cannot reliably forecast certain material elements of the Total results, particularly the future fair val ue movements on contingent consideration and put options that can and have given rise to significant adjustments driven by external factors such as currency and other movements in capital markets. ViiV Healthcare ViiV Healthcare is a subsidiary of the Group and 100% of its operating results (turnover, operating profit, profit after tax) are included within the Group income statement. Earnings are allocated to the three shareholders of ViiV Healthcare on the basis of their respective equity shareholdings (GSK 78.3%, Pfizer 11.7% and Shionogi 10%) and their entitlement to preferential dividends, which are determined by the performance of certain products that each shareholder contributed. As the relative performance of these products changes over time, the proportion of the overall earnings allocated to each shareholder also changes. In particular, the increasing proportion of sales of dolutegravir and cabotegravir - containing products has a favourable impact on the p roportion of the preferential dividends that is allocated to GSK. Adjusting items are allocated to shareholders based on their equity interests. GSK was entitled to approximately 83% of the Total earnings and 82% of the Adjusted earnings of ViiV Healthcare for 2022. As consideration for the acquisition of Shionogi's interest in the former Shionogi -ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012, Shionogi received the 10% equity stake in ViiV Healthcare and ViiV Healthcare also agreed to pay additional future cash co nsideration to Shionogi, contingent on the future sales performance of the products being developed by that joint venture, dolutegravir and cabotegravir. Under IFRS 3 'Business combinations', GSK was required to provide for the estimated fair value of this contingent consideration at the time of acquisition and is required to update the liability to the latest estimate of fair value at each subsequent period end. The liability for the contingent consideration recognised in the balance sheet at the date of a cquisition was \u00a3659 million. Subsequent remeasurements are reflected within other operating income/(expense) and within Adjusting items in the income statement in each period. Cash payments to settle the contingent consideration are made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare each quarter, based on the actual sales performance and other income of the relevant products in the previous quarter. These payments reduce the balance sheet liab ility and hence are not recorded in the income statement. The cash payments made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare in H1 2023 were \u00a3 565 million. As the liability is required to be recorded at the fair value of estimated future payments, there is a significan t timing difference between the charges that are recorded in the Total income statement to reflect movements in the fair value of the liability and the actual cash payments made to settle the liability.

At 30 June 2023, the Group's aggregate provision for legal and other disputes (not including tax matters described on page 10 was \u00a3 0.3 billion (31 December 2022: \u00a30. 2 billion). The Group may become involved in significant legal proceedings in respect of which it is not possible to meaningfully assess whether the outcome will result in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably estimate the liability, if any, that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, the Group would provide appropriate disclosures about such cases, but no provision would be made. The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proce edings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations. The Group's position could change over time, and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed by a material amount t he amount of the provisions reported in the Group's financial accounts. Significant legal developments since the date of the Q1 2023 results: Intellectual Property Coreg In 2014, GSK initiated suit against Teva in the US District Court for the Distric t of Delaware for inducing infringement of its patent relating to the use of carvedilol ( Coreg ). In 2017, the jury returned a verdict in GSK's favour, awarding GSK lost profits and reasonable royalties for a total award of $235.51 million, which was ultimately upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On 11 July 2022, Teva filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States seeking to overturn the Federal Court decision. On 15 May 2023, the US Supreme Cour t denied Teva's request. Certain issues remain to be resolved at the District Court and the parties await the scheduling of a status conference. Product Liability Zantac On 23 June 2023, GSK reached a confidential settlement in the first case that was scheduled to go to trial in California state court (the Goetz case). The settlement reflects the Company's desire to avoid distraction related to protracted litigation in thi s case. GSK does not admit any liability in this settlement and will continue to vigorously defend itself based on the facts and the science in all other Zantac cases. The next case in California (the Cantlay/Harper case) has been set for trial in Novemb er 2023. Cases in Texas, Illinois, and Florida have also been scheduled for trial in 2024 and 2025. The Delaware Superior Court has scheduled a hearing regarding admissibility of expert testimony as to general causation for 22 January 2024. GSK will contin ue to defend itself vigorously against all claims. On 12 May 2023, the British Columbia Supreme Court dismissed a proposed class action on behalf of a class of ranitidine users in Canada. Plaintiffs have filed an appeal. GSK will continue to vigorously defend proposed class actions by ranitidine users that have been filed in Ontario and Quebec as well as individual actions filed by ranitidine users in Canada. Commercial and corporate Zejula Royalty Dispute On 12 June 2023, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales granted the Group's request for permission to appeal the 5 April 2023 judgment which upheld AstraZeneca's interpretation of the two license agreements. The appeal will be heard in January 2024. Issued: Wednesday, 26 July 2023, London, U.K. Press release Second quarter 2023 36 ESG Total and Adjusted results Auditors review report Results Summary Financial information Research and development Returns to shareholders Quarterly dividends The Board has declared a second interim dividend for 2023 of 14p per share (Q 2 2022: 16.25p(1) per share ). Dividends remain an essential component of total shareholder return and GSK recognises the importance of dividends to shareholders. On 23 June 2021, at the GSK Investor Update, GSK set out that from 2022 a progressive dividend policy will be implemented guided by a 40 to 60 percent pay -out ratio through the investment cycle. The dividend policy, the total expected cash di stribution, and the respective dividend pay -out ratios for GSK remain unchanged . GSK expects to declare a dividend of 56.5p per share for 2023. In setting its dividend policy, GSK considers the capital allocation priorities of the Group, its investment str ategy for growth alongside the sustainability of the dividend. Payment of dividends The equivalent interim dividend receivable by ADR holders will be calculated based on the exchange rate on 10 October 2023. An annual fee of $0.03 per ADS (or $0.0075 per ADS per quarter) is charged by the Depositary.

They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to distribute. Non-current assets included as part of a disposal group are not depreciated or amortised while they are classifi ed as held for distribution. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for distribution are presented separately from the other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. A discontinued operation is a component of the entity tha t has been disposed of or distributed or is classified as held for distribution and that represents a separate major line of business. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the statement of profit or loss and comparatives are r estated on a consistent basis.

Accounting policies and basis of preparation This unaudited Results Announcement contains condensed financial information for the three and six months ended 30 June 2023 and should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report 202 2, which was prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted Internationa l Financial Reporting Standards . This Results Announcement has been prepared applying consistent accounting policies to those applied by the Group in the Annual Report 202 2. The Group has not identified any changes to its key sources of accounting judgements or estimations of uncertainty compared with those disclosed in the Annual Report 202 2. This Results Announcement does not constitute statutory accounts of the Group within the meaning of sections 434(3) and 435(3) of the Companies A ct 2006. The full Group accounts for 2022 were published in the Annual Report 2022, which has been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and on which the report of the independent auditor was unqualified and did not contain a statement under section 498 of the Companies Act 2006. Exchange rates GSK operates in many countries and earns revenues and incurs costs in many currencies. The results of the Group, as reported in Sterling, are affected by movements in exchange rates between Sterling and other currencies. Average exchange rates, as modified by specific transaction rates for large transactions, prevailing during the period, are used to translate the results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures into Sterling . Period -end rates are used to translate the net assets of those entities. The currencies which most influenced these translations and the relevant exchange rates were: Q2 1.26 1.23 1.30 1.24 Euro/\u00a3 1.15 1.18 1.14 1.19 1.17 Yen/\u00a3 173 162 168 159 161 Period -end rates: US$/\u00a3 1.26 1.21 1.26 1.21 1.20 Euro/\u00a3 1.17 1.16 1.17 1.16 1.13 Yen/\u00a3 183 165 183 165 159 Issued: Wednesday, 26 July 2023, London, U.K. Press release Second quarter 2023 38 ESG Total and Adjusted results Auditors review report Results Summary Financial information Research and development Net assets The book value of net assets increased by \u00a3 2,063 million from \u00a310,096 million at 31 December 2022 to \u00a3 12,159 million at 3 0 June 2023. This primarily reflected contribution from Total comprehensive income for the period partly offset by dividend s paid to shareholders. At 30 June 2023, the net deficit on the Group's pension plans was \u00a3945 million compared with \u00a31,355 million at 31 December 2022. This decrease in the net deficit is primarily related to higher UK asset values, an increase to the UK discount rate from 4.8% to 5.3%, decrease to the US Cash balance credit rate from 3.9% to 3.7% and cash contributions of \u00a335 3 million made to the UK Pension scheme s offset by an actuarial experience adjustment for higher inflation than expected in UK pension increases of approximately \u00a3400 millio n. The estimated present value of the potential redemption amount of the Pfizer put option related to ViiV Healthcare, recorded in O ther payables in Current liabilities, was \u00a3 850 million (31 December 2022: \u00a31,093 million). Contingent consideration amounted to \u00a3 6,227 million at 3 0 June 2023 (31 December 2022: \u00a37,068 million), of which \u00a35,252 million (31 December 2022: \u00a35,890 million) represented the estimated present value of amounts payable to Shionogi relating to ViiV Healthcare, \u00a3 516 million (31 December 2022: \u00a3673 million) represented the estimated present value of contingent consideratio n payable to Novartis related to the Vaccines acquisition and \u00a3 455 million (31 December 2022: \u00a3501 million ) represented the estimated present value of contingent consideration payable to Affinivax. Of the contingent consideration payable (on a post -tax b asis) to Shionogi at 3 0 June 2023, \u00a3903 million (31 December 202 2: \u00a3940 million) is expected to be paid within one year.

Descriptions of the significant legal disputes to which the Group is a party are set out on page 35 and on pages 2 65 to 267 of the 202 2 Annual Report . Business acquisitions On 18 April 2023, GSK announced it had reached agreement to acquire late -stage biopharmaceutical company BELLUS Health Inc . (Bellus). On 28 June 2023, GSK completed the acquisition which was effected through a Plan of Arrangement (the \"Arrangement\") pursuant to the Canada Business Corporations Act. The Arrangement was approved by Bellus' shareholders on 16 June 2023. Upon comp letion, GSK acquired all outstanding common shares of Bellus for US$14.75 per common share in cash, representing a total equity value of US$2.0 billion (\u00a31.6 billion). The acquisition provides GSK access to camlipixant, a potential best -in-class and highly selective P2X3 antagonist currently in phase III development for the first -line treatment of adult patients with refractory chronic cough (RCC).

A gain of \u00a34m arose prior to transfer from Level 3 on the equity investment which transferred to a Level 1 valuation methodology. Net gains and losses include the impact of exchange movements. Financial liabilities measured using Level 3 valuation methods at 30 June 2023 included \u00a35,252 million ( 31 December 2022: \u00a35, 890 million) of contingent consideration for the acquisition in 2012 of the former Shion ogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture, \u00a3516 million ( 31 December 2022: \u00a3 673 million) of contingent consideration for the acquisition of the Novartis Vaccines business in 2015 and \u00a3455 million (31 December 2022: \u00a3 501 million ) of contingent consideration payable for the acquisition of Affinivax in 2022 . Contingent consideration is expected to be paid over a number of years and will vary in line with the future performance of specified products, the achievement of certain milestone targets and movements in certain foreign currencies. The financial liabilities are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows, the most significant inputs and assumptions in the valuation models being future sales forecasts, probability of milestone success, the discou nt rate, the Sterling/US Dollar exchange rate and the Sterling/Euro exchange rate. The exchange rates used are consistent with market rates at 30 June 2023 .

Infectious Diseases Arexvy (respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, adjuvanted) In May 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Arexvy (respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, adjuvanted) for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in individuals 60 years of age and older. This was the first RSV vaccine for older adults to be approved anywhere in the world. The US Centers for Disea se Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (A CIP) voted in favour of recommending the vaccine in adults aged 60 and older using shared clinical decision making in June 2023. Also in June 2023, the European Commission authorised the vaccine for active immunisation for the prevention of LRTD caused by RSV in adults 60 years of age and older. This followed a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) which was adopted in April 2023. New data from the AReSVi -006 (Adult Respiratory Syncytial Virus) phase III trial showing that one dose of the vaccine is efficacious against RSV -LRTD and severe LRTD in adults aged 60 years and older over two full RSV seasons were reported in June 2023. Safety and reactogenicity data were co nsistent with initial observation from the phase III programme. The trial also evaluated efficacy following an annual revaccination schedule. Results suggested revaccination after 12 months does not appea r to confer additional benefit for the overall popul ation.

The results show that after 12 months of treatment most (90%) participants preferred cabotegravir + rilpivirine long -acting versus bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (5%), Not having to worry about taking daily HIV medicine (85% ) was cited as a top reason for preferring long -acting therapy. There were also emotional well -being benefits of switching to cabotegravir + rilpivirine long -acting; over 70% of participants who switched showed improvements in adherence anxiety and fear of disclosure after 12 months of therapy. Previously presented findings showed that the regimen of cabotegravir + rilpivirine long -acting dosed every two months demonstrated non -inferior efficacy compared to continuation of daily oral bictegravir/emtricitabi ne/tenofovir alafenamide.

Continuing results repres ents performance excluding discontinued operations. GSK also uses a number of adjusted, non -IFRS, measures to report the performa nce of its business. Adjusted results and other non -IFRS measures may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information presented in accordance wi th IFRS. Adjusted results are defined on page 17 and other non -IFRS measur es are defined below and are based on continuing operations. Free cash flow from continuing operations Free cash flow is defined as the net cash inflow/outflow from continuing operating activities less capital expenditure on pro perty, plant and equipment and intangible assets, contingent consideration payments, net finance costs, and dividends paid to non -controlling interests, contributions from non - controlling interests plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, a nd dividends received from joint ventures and associates (all attributable to continuing operations). It is used by management for planning and reporting purposes and in d iscussions with and presentations to investment analysts and rating agencies. Free ca sh flow growth is calculated on a reported basis. A reconciliation of net cash inflow from continuing operations to free cash flow from continuing operations is set out on page 44. Free cash flow conversion Free cash flow conversion is free cash flow from continuing operations as a percentage of profit attributable to shareholders from continuing operations. Working capital Working capital represents inventory and trade receivables less trade payables. CER and AER growth In order to illustrate underl ying performance, it is the Group's practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate (CER) growth. This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in Sterling ha d remained unchanged from those used in the comparative period. CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates. \u00a3% or AER% represents gr owth at actual exchange rates. Total Net debt Net debt is defined as total borrowings less cash, cash equivalents, liquid investm ents, and short -term loans to third parties that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Discontinued operations Consumer Healthcare was presented as a discontinued operation from Q2 2022. The demerger of Consumer Healthcare was completed on 18 July 2022. The Group Income Statement and Group Cash Flow Statement distinguish discontinued operations from continuing opera tions. Share Consolidation Following completion of the Consumer Healthcare business demerger on 18 July 2022, GSK plc Ordinary shares were consolidated to maintain share price comparability before and after demerger. Shareholders received 4 new Ordinary shares with a nominal value of 31\u00bc pence each for every 5 existing Ordinary share s which had a nominal value of 25 pence each. Earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share and d ividends per share were retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation in all the periods presented. Earnings per sh are Earnings per share has been retrospectively adjusted for the Share Consolidation on 18 July 2022, applying a ratio of 4 new O rdinary shares for every 5 existing Ordinary shares. Total Earnings per share Unless otherwise stated, Total earnings per sha re refers to Total basic earnings per share. Total Operating Margin Total Operating margin is Total operating profit divided by turnover. COVID -19 solutions COVID -19 solutions include the sales of pandemic adjuvant and other COVID -19 solutions including vaccine manufacturing and Xevudy and the associated costs but does not include reinvestment in R&D. This categorisation is used by management and we believe is helpful to investors through providing clarity on the results of the Group by showing the contribution to growth from COVID -19 solutions. Turnover excluding COVID -19 solutions Turnover excluding COVID -19 solutions excludes the impact of sales of pandemic adjuvant within Vaccines and Xevudy within Specialty Medicines related to the COVID -19 pandemic. Management believes that the exclusion of the impact of these COVID -19 solutions sales aids comparability in the reporting periods and understanding of GSK's growth including by region versus prior periods and also 2023 Guidance which excludes any contributions from COVID -19 solutions.

Assumptions related to 2023 guidance In outlining the guidance for 2023, the Group has made certain assumptions about the healthcare sector, the different markets in which the Group operates and the delivery of reven ues and financial benefits from its current portfolio, pipeline and restructuring programmes. In the second half of 2023, GSK expects continued strong performance across all three product areas but with lower growth reflecting a tough comparison to the sec ond half of 2022, particularly in HIV and General Medicines. For full year sales, Vaccines is expected to increase by mid -teens per cent, Specialty Medicines, including HIV, is now expected to grow high single -digit per cent , and General Medicines is now e xpected to grow low single digit per cent . GSK still expects Adjusted operating profit growth to be higher in the second half of 2023 relative to full -year expectations, with growth of investment reducing in the second half, particularly in the fourth quar ter. These planning assumptions as well as operating profit guidance and dividend expectations assume no material interruptions to supply of the Group's products, no material mergers, acquisitions or disposals, no material litigation or investigation costs for the Company (save for those that are already recognised or for which provisions have been made) and no change in the Group's shareholdings in ViiV Healthcare. The assumptions also assume no material changes in the healthcare environ ment or unexpected significant changes in pricing as a result of government or competitor action. The 2023 guidance factors in all divestments and product exits announced to date. The Group's guidance assumes successful delivery of the Group's integration and restructuring plans. Material costs for investment in new product launches and R&D have been factored into the expectations given. Given the potential development options in the Group's pipeline, the outlook may be affected by additional data -driven R &D investment decisions. The guidance is given on a constant currency basis. Assumptions and cautionary statement regarding forward -looking statements The Group's management believes that the assumptions outlined above are reasonable, and that the guidanc e, outlooks, ambitions and expectations described in this report are achievable based on those assumptions. However, given the forward - looking nature of these guidance, outlooks, ambitions and expectations, they are subject to greater uncertainty, includin g potential material impacts if the above assumptions are not realised, and other material impacts related to foreign exchange fluctuations, macro -economic activity, the impact of outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID -19 pandemic and ongoing challenges and uncertainties posed by the COVID -19 pandemic for businesses and governments around the world, changes in legislation, regulation, government actions or intellectual property protection, product development and approvals , actions by our comp etitors, and other risks inherent to the industries in which we operate. This document contains statements that are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward -looking statements\". Forward -looking statements give the Group's current expectations or forecasts of fut ure events. An investor can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, dividend payments and financial results. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations (including under the Market Ab use Regulation, the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority), the Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward -looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherw ise. The reader should, however, consult any additional disclosures that the Group may make in any documents which it publishes and/or files with the SEC. All readers, wherever located, should take note of these disclosures. Accordingly, no assurance can b e given that any particular expectation will be met and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward -looking statements. All guidance, outlooks, ambitions and expectations should be read together with the guidance, assumptions and ca utionary statements in this Q 2 2023 earnings release and the 2022 Annual Report. Forward -looking statements are subject to assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which relate to factors that are beyond the Group's control or precise estima te. The Group cautions investors that a number of important factors, including those in this document, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward -looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limit ed to, those discussed under Item 3.D 'Risk Factors' in the Group's Annual Report on Form 20-F for 202 2. Any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Group speak only as of the date they are made and are based upon the knowledge and information available to the Directors on the date of this report.

The condensed financial information comprises: the income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the three and six month periods ended 30 June 2023 on page s 25 to 26; the balance sheet as at 30 June 2023 on page 27; the statement of changes in equity for the six month period then end ed on page 28; the cash flow statement for the six month period then ended on page 29; and the accounting policies and basis of preparation and the explanatory notes to the condensed financial information on pages 30 to 44 that have been prepared applying consistent accounting policies to those applied by GSK plc and its subsidiaries (\"the Group \") in the Annual Report 2022, which was prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") as adopted by the United Kingdom . We have read the other information contained in the Results Announcement, including the non -IFRS me asures contained on pages 30 to 44 and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed financial information. Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed financial information in the Results Announcement for the three and six months ended 30 June 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with United Kingdom adopted International Accounting Standard 34 and the Disclosure Guidanc e and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority. Basis for Conclusion We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK) 2410 \"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity\" issued by the Financial Reporting Council for use in the United Kingdom (ISRE(UK)2410) . A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. As disclosed on page 37, the annual financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards. The condensed set of financial statements included in this Results Announcement have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted International Accounting Standard 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\". Conclusio n Relating to Going Concern Based on our review procedures, which are less extensive than those performed in an audit as described in the Basis for Conclusion section of this report, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the directors have inappropriately adopted the going concern basis of accounting or that the directors have identified material uncertainties relating to going concern that are not appropriately disclosed. This Conclusion is based on the review procedures performed in accordan ce with ISRE (UK) 2410, however future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern. Responsibilities of the directors The directors are responsible for preparing the Results Announcement of the Company in accordance w ith the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority. In preparing the Results Announcement, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
