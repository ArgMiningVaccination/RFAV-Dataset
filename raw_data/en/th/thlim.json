Introduction This rev iew aim s to present with in one document information rel ated to rinderpest cont rol in ng whi Operat ion Li feline Sudan (OLS) Sout hern Sect or Li vestock Program me has been operat ing; 1989 t o 2000. The revi ew ai ms to be an i nform ation resource for the devel opment of the rinderpest elimination st rategy for sout Sudan, as part of the global rinderpest eradi cation effort . The review focuses m ainly rebel- controlled areas of sout hern Sudan (sout hern sect or) where i t is more difficult for the governm ent veterinary servi ces to collect inform ation, wi th the aim of com plementing Pan-Afri can R inderpest Campaign (PAR C) Sudan i nform ation and obt aining a com prehens ive picture of t he rinderpest status of t he sout hern region of Sudan. The information presented has been collated from the internal files, dat abase and report s of the OLS Li vestock Program me Co-ordi nator, and has been co llected over t he years of t he program me by sout hern Sudanese ani mal heal th workers, Uni ted Nat ions Chi ldren's Fund (UNICEF)/ OLS and non-governm ental organi sation (NGO) personnel , and has been report ed to UNIC EF/OLS Li vestock Project as the co-ordi nating agency of the OLS Li vestock Program me. The role of OLS Livestock Program me Co-ordination has recently been taken ove r by Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)/OLS. There are gaps in the available in form ation and t he important deficits are di scussed i n section 6. 2. Cattle population and sub-populations 2.1 Cattle Population Estimates The size of the cattle population in the southern region of Sudan has been es timated using various m ethods by the Governm ent of Sudan (GOS) and by the OLS Li vestock Program me (Tabl e 1.1 bel ow, Tabl e 1.2 i n Annex 1). Table 1.1 Summary of Cattle Population Estimates 1975-7 GOS Aerial Census (1) 1998 GOS (3) OLS Southern Sector working figures OLS Northern Sector areas not included in working figures Eastern 7.8 millio n During 1975-7 a nat ional aerial livestock census was carri ed out by the Ministry of Agri culture, Food and Nat ural Resources, which estim ated the total population of the sout hern region to be 5.6 m illion (1). A concurrent ground survey indicated that there was an estim ated net cattle population growth of 12% (1). A second aeri al survey was carri ed out in 1983 coveri ng the Jongl ei Canal area by the l for Devel opment of the Jongl ei Canal Area, M inistry for Na tional Planning (2). B or, Kongor, Ay od, W aat and Fangak Districts were survey ed duri ng bot h wet and dry seasons . The t otal popul ation vari ed from 471,339 i n mid wet season to 784,669 i n late dry season. Si nce t he districts survey ed m ake up approxi mately half of the Jongl ei region, it is not possi ble to make a di rect com parison wi th the 1975-7 survey . Cattle population figures provide d by Governm ent of Sudan in 1998 give an estim ated population of 10,281,382 for the southern regi on (3). The m ethod of dat a collection is not known t o the aut hor. 5 The OLS Southern Sector Livestock Pr ogram me has been attem pting to estim ate the cattle population in the accessible rebel-controlled areas (so uthern secto r). W henever an agency starts activ ities in a new area an estim ate is m ade, and this is periodically updat ed. Vari ous m ethods of est imation have been used and i nclude: quest ioning key inform ants, direct o bservation in villages and cattle cam ps, participatory mapping, listin g of chiefs an d their cattle cam ps or villages, househol d survey s, vaccination figures. In most of the pastoralist and agro-pas toralist tribes it is taboo to ask how m any cattle a person owns. This m akes direct questioning, household su rveys, or obvious counting of cattle very difficult. W hen as king about the overall population of an area, key inform ants tend to exa ggerate figures. This m ay be because th ey don't know the real figure or due to pride or because a higher figure m ight bri ng increased anim al health inputs. Estim ation by listing chiefs and their cattle camps or villages can also result in exaggerated figures fo r sim ilar reasons. The best m ethod for estim ation is probably a com bination of several of the above m ethods t o allow cross checki ng of fi gures. The OLS Li vestock Program me estimates for 1993 t o 2000 ha ve been col lected by UNICEF and NGOs usi ng one or more of the above m ethods. Figures fo r each adm inistrative area therefore va ry in accuracy. W hen estim ating the popul ation, experi ence has shown t is important to be cl ear whi ch geographi cal area i s being est imated and whether it is the wet or dry season population. The wet s eason population of a given area includes the cattle in their perm anent 'highland' villages or cam ps, whilst the dry season population m ay include cattle entering from neighbouri ng areas for dry season grazi ng. The popul ation in a given area m ay vary consi derabl y between y ears because of displacem ent due to insecur ity, return of previously displaced pe ople, and loss of cattle through raiding, disease or i ncreased off t ake due t o famine. Som e major changes si nce t he 1975-7 aeri al census i nclude: - an overall increase in cattle population, - heavy loss of cattle in Bor County (Jonglei) a nd Northern Bahr el Gh azal due to raiding, - increased cattle-keeping in W estern Equatoria due to di splacem ent of agro-pastoralis ts into the region, and - frequent raiding and displ acem ents of cattle in Upper Nile and Jonglei regions. Based on al l the vari ous est imates, the aut hor has drawn up a 'best estimate' to give worki ng popul ation figures for t he southern sect or areas. Det ailed estimates for t he governm ent-cont rolled areas have not yet been obt ained. In t he author's opinion it is lik ely th at the overall estim ate fo r the southern region is 6.8-7.8 million cattle (so uthern secto r total of 5.8 m illion plus 1-2 m illion in governm ent-controlled areas). There need regular ation of cattle popul ations usi ng a vari ety of com plementary methods i n order t o cross check t hese worki ng figures and correct them as necessary. 2.2 Cattle Sub-populations The m ajority of cattle in the southern region of Sudan ar e com munally grazed and transhum ant. In the wet season m ost cattle are on the higher ground in or near villages, whilst in the dry season they move to the lower lying grasslands along rivers and swam ps. Based m ainly on geographical boundaries, ethnic groups and seasonal m ovem ents, the cattle popul ation can be di vided sub- popul ations (Annex 2, m aps 1-6). 2.2.1 Geographical boundaries (Map 1) The west ern and sout hern border of sout hern Sudan i s mountainous and form s the tsetse bel t from Raga through W au, south Tonj, The tsetse which transm its trypanosom iasis, has pr evented cattle-keeping in these areas, although there are sm all but significant cattle populations in Kajo Keji, parts of Torit and west Kapoeta. Some of the m ajor rivers form boundari es between ethnic groups and their ca ttle. However, som e major dry season grazi ng areas are al ong t he Nile where nei ghbouri ng popul ations share grazi ng e.g. bet ween B or and Yi rol. There i s seasonal m ovem ent of cattle across the Nile between Phou and Liech States, and m ovem ent of cattle across the Nile for trade from Yirol to Bor. The swam ps along m ajor and e physical barri ers duri ng the wet season as the rising water levels push cattle towa rds the higher ground. As the dry season starts the floods recede and the cattle follow, grazi ng the toic (seasonal ly flooded and 2b) The adm inistrative boundaries have varied over tim e and the different political groups have differe nt divisions and names for each area. The adm inistrative boundaries shown in Maps 2a and 2b are a hybrid of Sudan People's Liberation Movem ent (SPLM) counties (N orthern Bahr el Ghazal, Lakes, W estern and Eastern Equato ria and part of Jongl ei) and Sout h Sudan Independence M ovem ent (SSIM ) States (Upper Ni le and part of Jongl ei) related to areas of rebel cont rol. The adm inistrative boundari es mainly follow phy sical and et hnic boundari es. 6 2.2.3 E thnic Groups (Map 3) There are a l arge num ber of et hnic groups i n the sout hern regi on of Sudan. In t he agri cultural areas of west ern B ahr el Ghazal there are Luo-speaking tribes. In Western Equatoria there are the Azande . In Eastern Equatoria there are the Moro, Achol i and Pari . In Jongl ei along t he Ethiopian border t here are t he Kachi po and t he Anuak. Al l these trib es are p redominantly sed entary cu ltivators and keep almost no cattle. Some sedentary ag ricultural trib es keep a sm all but significan t number of cattle. Th ese in clude the Burun and Shilluk in Upper Ni le, and t he Let uka, Lopi t and M oro in East ern Equat oria. The main cattle-k eeping tribes are th nilotic trib of Dinka and Nuer inhabiting most of Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Lakes, Upper Nile and part of Jonglei, the Karam ajong-related tribes of Toposa, Jie and Nyangatom in Eastern Equat oria, and t he Didinga, B oya and M urle of east ern Equat oria and Jongl nort h of sout hern regi on are t he nom adic pastoral Baggara and Fel lata tribes that move sout h into northern Bahr el Ghazal and Upper Nile during a few months of the year for dry season grazing. 2.2.4 Cattl e Husbandry Systems (Map 4) Cattle-k eeping in the southern region can be broadly divided into four types: sedentary agriculture; very few cattle are kept. This includes the western and s outhern counties that are included in the tsetse belt and i ndividual ethnic groups along the Ethiopian border and the Shilluk tribe in Upper Ni le, agro-pastoralist transhum ant; on the lower-lying savannah and flood plains of norther n Bahr el Ghazal, Lakes, Jonglei and Upper Nile, large num bers of cattle are ke pt. There are seasonal m ovem ents between wet and dry season grazing areas. transhumant pastoralist; in the sem i-arid area so uth east o f the Nile in the eastern part of eastern Equatoria (Toposa, Nyangatom and Jie) and the eas tern part of Jonglei (Murle), th ere are m any cattle following ents. nomadic pastoralist; enter the sout hern regi on the nort h only during the dry season. 2.2.5 Pol itical Control (Map 5) The ci vil war i n the sout hern regi on is fought between t he Governm ent of Sudan and t he Sudan Peopl e's Li berat ion Army (SPLA) wi th various ot her rebel factions wi th vary ing al legiances t o one or ot her of t he two. M ap 5 shows t he approxi mate areas current ly under cont rol of the Governm ent, the SPLA, and ot her fact ions. Areas of cont rol vary greatly with time, an d relativ ely stab le areas can becom e very insecure and vice versa . The confl ict has had vari ous effects on different cattle populati ons at different tim es. It has prevented traditional sharing of grazing areas by neighbouri ng cattle populations, interru pted traditional trad e routes, exacerbated traditional raiding patterns, altered transhum ant migration pat terns, and displaced cattle-keeping com munities. Based on the factors listed above the fo llowing division of the sout hern Sudan cattle population into sub-populations is suggest ed (M ap 6). The sub-popul ations broadl y follow ethnic groups, whi ch in general follow adm inistrative boundari es. Cattle Sub-Populations I. East of the Nile 1. South East Z one 1A. Torit County, west ern part Includes t he governm ent-held areas of Tori t town and La fon. The popul ation has m inor trade and m inor seasonal migration links wi th Uganda. 1B.

Kajo Keji County; Moro and other tribes. Som e cattle are traded to Uganda. 2.3 Major Cattle Movements between Sub-populations 2.3.1 Rai ding Raiding of cattle is a traditional activity am ongst m ost of th e pastoralist and agro-pastoralist tribes, and is usually reciprocal. There i s localized rai ding bet ween and am ongst Nuer and Dinka t ribes in Nort h West and Nort h East Zones. In the Sout h East Zone i ntertribal raiding is very common bet ween Toposa, Di dinga, B oya, Letuka, urle. Nom adic nort hern tribes rai d Nort h West and Nort h East Zones. However with the ongoing civil war and in creased availability of weapons, raidi ng of cattle has been carried out on a larger scale an d more violently. In addition, looting of cattle h as been carried out by Government soldiers, m ilitias an d rebel arm ies to feed soldiers an d for trad e. As m entioned in sectio n 2.1 this has had a particular im pact o n the cattle population of Bahr el Ghazal (3B and 3C), causing a significant reduction in cattle ownership and cattle num bers due to looting of cattle and their transporta tion to the north, and on the cattle popula tion of Bor County (1D) which were heavi ly raided and sl aught ered i n 1992 by a rebel army. 2.3.2 T rading The major cattle trad e routes include; from North West to the north, from Nort h West to Sout h West and onward t rade t o CAR, Congo and Uganda, from Yirol (3E) and Phou Kapoet a (1A and 1B ) Keny Uganda, Kajo Keji (4C) to Uganda. of Graz ing Resources Shari ng of grazi resources i s great er wi thin sub-popul ations t han bet ween, however t here are som e significant linkages: the nort hern tribes ent er the Nort h West and Nort h East during the dry season, cattle from Wanding, Akobo and Nyand it districts (2B) m ove to Ethi opia for shared grazing with the Ethiopian Nuer duri ng the dry season, some Didinga cattle (1 A) m ove to Uganda for dry seaso n grazing, Yirol (3E) and B or (1D) share grazi ng areas al ong t he Nile, cattle from Liech State (3A) m ove across the N ile to Phou State (2A) for dry season grazing, there are shared grazing areas at th e borders bet ween Gogri al (4E). Marri age Payments In most of the cattle-keeping tribes of southern Sudan ther e is a tradition of paying dowry for brides. This involves the payment of an agreed number of cattle b y the husband's extended family to the bride's ex tended family, an d is a substantial type of cattle m ovem ent within sub-populati ons. Marriages are som etimes arranged between neighbouring populations including different ethnic groups, and are a small but significant type of cattle m ovem ent between sub- populations. Marriages between sub-populations and the associated excha nge of cattle are one way of cem enting good relationshi ps and reduci ng Rinderpest Disease Outbreaks 3.1 Outbreak Reporti ng Methods In the first few y ears of t he OLS Li vestock Program me, 1992-94, ri nderpest outbreaks were report ed through radi o, by letter or duri ng co-ordi nation m eetings, by local veterinary personnel and i nvest igated by mainly UNIC EF veterinarians. Outbreak reporting and investigation were lim ited to the few areas that could be accessed. From 1995 onwards an increasing num ber of areas could be accessed a nd an increasing num ber of ag encies were involved in devel oping com munity-based ani mal heal th program mes1. Local veterinary personnel woul d then pass out break report s to their support ing field vet erinarian for i nvest igation. Th e inform ation was t hen passed t o UNIC EF via radi o, project report s or duri ng co-ordi nation m eetings. Not all outbreak inform ation was passed on, som e report s were i ncomplete, and fol low up was not always carri ed out . In 1998, UNIC EF/OLS realised the need t o devel op an i mproved sy stem for disease out break report ing and i nvest igation to: stimulate rout ine report ing of di sease out breaks and m aintain cent ralised records for sout hern Sudan, improve the quality an d quantity o f outbreak reports, improve i nvest igation and fol low up of out break repor ts, esp ecially sam ple co llectio n for laboratory confi rmation, gather basel ine dat a on epi demic diseases t o assist in planning cont rol measures, ensure al l rumours of ri nderpest and ri nderpest -like disease were report and establish a ri nderpest rumour regi ster. An addi tional veterinarian was ted (funded by OAU - IB AR - PARC) t o be the focal point for di sease out break report ing and i nvest igation. W ith advi ce from PAR C, he devel oped di sease out break report ing and i nvest igation guidelines whi ch included report ing by radio message, an out break report form and i nstructions for i nvest igation and sampling of a possi ble rinderpest outbreak. The focus of t he guidelines was ri nderpest but they coul d be appl ied to other di sease out breaks. They were di ssem inated as a m anual to all field veterinarians and to the local An imal Health Auxiliaries (AHAs) and Stockpersons. Tr aining in use of the guidelines wa s provided during the VSF-Belgium AHA and St ockperson t raining courses. The vet erinarian al so ca rried out field visits to invest igate possi ble rinderpest outbreaks or co-ordinated the follow up of reports by NGO or UNICEF veterinarians. There are no laboratory facilitie s within southern Sudan, although in r ecent years a sm all num ber of NGOs have provi ded m icroscopes i n som e field bases. A basi c vet erinary laborat ory support ed by SC-UK and UNIC EF/OLS was set up in 1995 i n Loki choki o, the logistical base on t he Keny a-Sudan border from which most flights and vehi cles depart to southern Sudan. The labor atory was able to carry out parasito logy of faeces, blood sm ears, lym ph node and skin scrapings, and brucello sis testing of sera. The laboratory also received, stored and forwarded serum for ri nderpest antibody testing, and t issue sam ples for ri nderpest virus testing. Rinderpest antibody testing and ri nderpest virus testing was carried out at the Nat ional Veterinary Research C entre (NVR C), Muguga, Keny a. Som e samples were sent to Pirbright, Uni ted Kingdom . The st orage and t ransport ation of hern Sudan hrough Loki choki o to Nairobi and del ivery to the laborat ory is com plex and delays are frequent at one or m ore stages, causi ng det erioration of sam ples. To dat e different ial diagnosi s of ri nderpest has not been carried out. NVRC, Muguga is able to test for Mucosal Disease, Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis and Malignant Catarrh, but lacks t he resources t o make these tests avai lable at all times. M ost outbreak di agnoses have therefore been based on hi story and cl inical exam ination and few l aborat ory samples have been col lected, prevent ing confi rmation of di agnoses. To encourage sam pling, out break sam pling ki ts were devel oped by UNIC EF/OLS for distribution to all field bases, t o ensure t he necessary equi pment for rinderpest sam ples was available. These kits were introduced t o som e locations duri ng 2000 and t he distribution is cont inuing in 2001. With the increased attention to out break reporting since 1998, the quantity and quality of outbreak reports has improved. The fol low up of ri nderpest rumours has al so improved al though i t has not always been possi ble due t o problem s of access or security. Sam ple collection has increas ed but is not routinely carried out, and there are still problems with the logistics o f delivering samples to the lab oratory. 9 1 Relief 3.2 Rinderpest Outbreaks (Tabl e 3 bel ow, Annex 2 - M ap 7) 3.2.1 South East Z one Rinderpest was confi rmed in 1992, 1993 and 1995 i n eastern Kapoe ta. It was confi rmed in Tori t and west Kapoet a in 1998 and t here were a num ber of rum ours from east Kapoet a and Pibor. Some of these were i nvest igated and no di sease was found, whi lst others were not fully invest igated. In 1999 t here was a report from Loudo, an area under governm ent control. Disease surveillance in the ne ighbouring areas under southern sector showed no rinderpest and a delay in the northern sect or invest igation prevent ed full invest igation. At the end of 2000, report s cam e from the Jie tribe via Pibor (governm ent area) and i n early 2001 t here were rum ours of deaths in wildlife in Pibor County. These reports are still being investigated at the tim e of writing. The South East Zone is thought to contai n endem ic foci of rinderpest. There is little or no anim al health service coverage of large areas of the zone and little or no vaccination in these areas. 3.2.2 North E ast Zone There have been no confirm ed outbreaks of rinderpest in th is area since before 1992, however access and coverage has been very low, so i t is possi ble that in the earl y years ri nderpest coul d have been present but was unreport ed. In 1997 there were som e report s from Bieh and Phou St ates and i n 1999 a report from Ulang, Lat jor St ate. These were not fully invest igated due t o securi ty probl ems. A report from Nyandit, Bieh St ate in 1999 was not fully invest igated due t o securi ty probl ems but a gave a cl ear descri ption of rinderpest -like disease affect ing one sm all herd. R ing vaccination was carried out and there were no further cases. Several reports were received in 2000, but follow up showed ot her di seases or no di sease was found. This zone be harbouri ng rinderpest endem ic foci , in particular along t he Sobat river, an area t hat is difficult for both northern and southern sectors to acce ss. Rinderpest vaccination in this area ha s been very low and outbreak reports have been di fficult to follow up properl y. 3.2.3 North West Z one In 1992 there were widespread out breaks i n Liech, Tonj and Gogri al. Rinderpest was agai n confi rmed in Liech i n 1993. Since t hat time the majority of ri nderpest rumours were found t o be anot her di sease or no di sease was found. In 1997 an NGO veterinarian saw a sm all num ber of cases of rinderpest-like disease in one herd in Buaw, Liech. No sam ples were collected. Ring vaccinati on was carried out and there were no further cases. In 1997 there were reports from the northern part of Li ech St ate under governm ent cont rol. These were not fully invest igated. In 1999 t here was a rash of report s from Tonj and Gogri al from the east ern toics neighbouri ng Li ech St ate. Invest igation showed t hese to be associated with the m ovem ent of Nuer cattle into these toics due to a new Di nk-Nuer peace agreem ent and a fear that the incoming cattle m ight bring rinderpest. There have been no ri nderpest outbreaks i n Yirol and R umbek count ies since before 1992. In 2000 a case of rinderpest - like disease was investigated near B illing, Rum bek. Sam ples were rinderpes t virus negative. Ring vaccination was carried out and there were no further cases. 3.2.4 South West Z one This is an area with a very low cattle population. There have been no confirm ed reports of rinderpest since before 1992. 10 Table 2: Ri nderpest 1. Clinical disease and l ab conf irmation 3. Clinical disease w ith lab negat ive 2.

Go ats in Tam bura (5) and Liech (5) were rin derpest sero -positive (sam ples co llected in October 1996). sero-positive goats in Liech is not surprising consid ering the 1993-94 outbreaks in the area. The cause of rinderpest sero-positive goats in Tam bura is not clear, since the cattle population in the area is very sm all and t ransient, and t here had been no know ri nderpest outbreaks. However i t is possi ble that the goat s might have been traded form Bahr el Ghazal. This highli ghts the im portance of background details of the goats if goat surveillance is to be used in the future. Goats in Tam bura (3), Liech (1), Yiro l (21), Bor (17) were p ositive for PPR.

Rinderpest Vaccination 4.1 Rinderpest Vaccination Figures Table 4.1 in Annex 3 shows the annual num ber of cattle vaccinated against rinderpes t by sub-population in OLS southern sector. These figures are deri ved from the vaccination m onitoring form s filled in by the local anim al health workers and subm itted to OLS Livestoc k Program me by UNICEF and NGOs. These figures are not com plete because some vaccination has been carried out but form s have not been subm itted for a va riety of reasons; poor filling of form s and subm ission by com munity -based anim al health worker s (CAHW s), supervisors and/or NGOs, loss of form s due to looting, insecurity, or lack of access to collect or subm it form s. In addition th e data for 2000 is not yet com plete; form s are still being received at the tim e of writing. Under optim um conditions of access and security form s take approxim ately two weeks to reach the OLS Livestock Progra mme in Nairobi. However som e form s can take up to one year to arrive due to insecurity or lack of road or air access. The breakdown of figures for 1992 is not available. Table 4.2 in Annex 3 shows the cattle vaccination figures by sub-population and base d on the cattle sub-population figures in section 2 the annual percentage vaccination has been calculated. This data is presented in Graph 1, Annex 3. 4.2 Vacci nation Coverage Since the start of the OLS Livestock Program me the aim has been to carry out m ass vacci nation in accessible areas, in line with the first p art of the OIE Path way fo r rinderpest erad icatio n. Between 1989 to 1992, vaccination was carried out free of charge by team s of v accinators using heat labile vaccine, supported by a UNICEF veterinarian (4). There was very lim ited access to the rebel- held areas of southern Sudan. Most vaccination was carried out from bases in Kapoeta, Bor, Pibor, Nasir and A kon. An average of 285,000 cattle were vaccinated annually. In addition, ICRC provided 1.3 m illion doses of rinderpes t vaccine during this period. The distribution of this vaccine is unknown, but when added to that of UNICEF, it is possible that up to 600,000 cattle were vaccinated annually. From 1993 t he livestock program me started to adopt a com munity-based approach t o animal heal th servi ce del ivery, with an initial focus on l using therm ostable rinderpest vaccine (4). CAHW s were tr ained to carry out rinderpest vaccination as well as vaccinati ons and treatm ents for other diseases. On ly parts of Equatoria were accessible by road. The rest of the rebel-held areas had to be acce ssed by air. Initially the num ber of places accessed was lim ited, 13 but as new airstrips were cleared a nd given flight perm ission, access expanded. In 1993 and 1994 vaccination efforts focussed on the areas with m ajor rinderpest outbreaks; Tonj, Gogrial, Kapoeta and Liech. Gradually more NGOs joined the program me and set up com munity-based ani mal heal th program mes in many areas, provi ding a m ore regul ar presence and ext ension of coverage furt her from the airstrips. CAHW s under t he supervi sion of Supervi sors (ol d Veterinary Assistants, and later, AHAs and Stockpersons trained by VSF-Belg ium) carried out the vaccinations. In 1996 paym ent for rinderpest vaccination was introduced with the aim of providing a sustainable m eans of rem unerating the CAHW s and Supervi sors. In 1996 a si milar program me was st arted in OLS Nort hern Sect or, based i n Khart oum, to serve t he governm ent- controlled areas of the southern region and parts of the transition zone. A sum mary of the vaccinations carried out in these areas by region is shown i n the table bel ow. Table 4.3 OLS Livestock Programme Northern Sector Rinderpest Vaccinations 1996 to mid-2000 Year Equatori a Upper Ni le Bahr el Ghaz al Total 18,021 hese fi gures i nto speci fic areas has not yet been obt ained but the areas covered by the nort Upper Ni Nasi r, Fanjak, added Pi bor, M ayom and B entiu in 1998, and Kodok, Tonga and B or in 1999 - Bahr el Ghazal ; Awei l town, Gogri al town, R aga County, Wau town and surroundi ng area. Since the peak of alm ost 1.8 m illion vaccinations in 1994, in spite of incr easing geographical c overage, vaccination levels have fallen to approxim ately 0. 5 million per year since 1998. The reasons for lower vaccination figures include: no rinderpest outbreak in most areas, red ucing demand by cattle k eepers, after one or m ore vaccination cam paigns, reduced presentation of cattle fo r re-vaccination by cattle keepers, some major cattle areas have becom e inaccessible Kapoet a, in addition to the above, som e areas have never or rare ly been accessed due to lack of capacity; Kapoeta east, Pibor, Fashoda, m ost of W estern oria, demand from com munities for NGOs to addre ss other anim al health priorities, demand from agenci es and donors t o address broader food securi ty issues, disruption of vaccination activities by drought, fam ine, insecurity, political disputes, withdrawal of flight perm ission, and reduced dem and from cattle keep ers because of paym ent. When a communi ty-based ani mal heal th programme st arts and progresses i n a new area, t here appears t o be a common pattern of vaccination figures. In the first 1-2 years demand for rinderpest vaccina tion is hig h, local animal health workers are very active in carrying out rind erpest vaccination, and vacci nation figures reach up to 80%. These fig ures then d rop in sub sequent yea rs as, with the a bsence o f rind erpest outbreaks, the ca ttle-k eepers' and animal health workers' priorities change. Demand fo r vaccination only rises again if there is a rumour of a rinderpest outbreak w ithin the area or i n a nei ghbouri ng area. 5. Sero-monitoring 5.1 Sero-moni m onitoring after v accination have been collected interm ittently from different parts of s outhern Sudan since the rinderpest vaccination program me started. The available serology results are present ed in Annex 4, Tabl e 5. A t otal of 2,364 sera have been t ately 1,000 sam ples) are still to be received. In 1995 a consul tant devel oped a random sampling sy stem for sero-m onitoring in sout hern Sudan, however t his has not been im plem ented. A sim plified system was developed that invol ved the annual collection of 40 sam ples from each of 10 cattle cam ps in a given area. No area h as ever managed to do this due to; difficulties of random sampling when access is lim ited, lack of cattle handling facilities m akes it a strenuous and tim e-consum ing activity, 14 blood-sam pling is not im mediatel y accepted by cattle-keepers, requi ring discussion a nd persuasion, serum collectio n is given lower p riority th an other activ ities, difficu lties o f handling, storing and transporting seru m from the field to the lab oratory, delays in report ing of resul ts has di scouraged furt her sam pling. Samples have therefore been collected in an ad hoc way by field vet erinarians and supervi sors dependi ng on t heir ability and interest. The num ber of sam ples collected in each sam pling area and in each year are therefore sm all, reduci ng the significance of any analysis. In addition samples are not random ly selected. They tend to be col lected from the m ore accessible cattle cam ps and herds, and from the m ore willing cattle keepers. In som e cases sam pling has been carried out to assess the level of i mmunity before carrying out a new vacci nation cam paign when no recent vaccination has been done. In ot her cases i t has been carri ed out within a few m onths of a cam paign to assess sero-conversi on. Most samples have been recorded on t he standard OLS sero-m onitoring form , whi ch includes i nform ation age group and vaccination status. Ho wever because ear-notching is not com prehensively carried out , vaccination status recorded is based on information from the cattle-k eeper. Th e reliab ility o f this source m ay vary depending on whether the person present is the owner, l ong-t erm keeper, y oung person or nei ghbour. Until 1998, all serum were collected as liquid serum . In 1998 filter papers for serum collection were introduced, and although there have been som e initial probl ems with their use (inadequate coverage of the filter paper with blood) they seem to have stim ulated increased seru m collectio n activ ities an elim inated problems of storage and transport of serum samples. Serum samples or filter papers are subm itted to the NVRC, Muguga for rinderpest antibody ELISA. There have been a series of probl ems related to use of t his laborat ory; lack of fundi ng for resources and personnel has prevent ed purchase of reagent s and ELISA ki ts for ext ended periods and has prevented testing fro m being carried out quick ly because staff are com mitted to other duties, payment for l aborat ory servi ces was i ntroduced but invoices arri ved l ate and UNIC EF pay ment procedures were sl ow; prices for l aborat ory procedures di d not cover act ual costs, when testin g was carried out there were d elays in sending the resu lts to UNICEF. The cum ulative effect of these problem s has caused results to be received up to two years after serum collection. As mentioned above, t hese del ays are a m ajor di scouragem ent for fi eld level workers t o collect further sam ples. 5.2 Sero-moni toring Resul ts In spite of the low num ber of sam ples and the bias toward s sam pling cattle that have b een recently vaccinated, som e observat ions can be m ade. The percentage of sero-positives in the overall population (vaccinated, unvacci nated and unknown vacci nations status) ranges from 46.7% t o 81.6% wi th an average of 71.7%. Ou t of the 11 sub-popul ations sam pled, 8 have percent age immunity levels of great er than 70%. Out of the known vaccinated population, 79.2% are sero-positiv e, with a range from 55.6% to 91.2%. Out of the 9 sub- populations sam pled with known vaccinated cattle, 6 showed the proportion of sero -positives to be greater than 75%, indicating that in m ost areas, vaccinati on was being carried out effectively. Out of the known unvaccinated population, 56.7% are sero-positive with a range from 18.9% to 100%. Out of the nine sub-populations sam pled with known unvacci nated cattle, seven show the proportion of sero-positives to be less than 70%. One group of 80 unvaccinated cattle sam pled in Naita, east Kapoeta in 1997 showed a sero-prevalence of 81%, possibly indicating a recent outbreak of rinderpest in the area. Limited serol ogical testing of sheep and goat s for PPR indicates that the disease i s likely to be present in most parts of southern Sudan (section 3.4). No PPR se rology has been carried out in cattle. The contribution of PPR sero-conversion in cattle to rinderpest im munity on sero-c onversion after rinderpest vaccina tion are therefore not known. 6. Information Deficits and Recommendations Due to the ongoing conflict in southern Sudan som e areas ar e very difficult to access and therefore inform ation on these areas is m inimal or absent. W here a com munity-based ani mal heal th program me has been previ ously established, l ocal trained anim al health workers are usua lly able to m aintain basic services including vaccination a nd disease reporting and i nvest igation, if the support ing NGO or UNICEF/ FAO i s able to maintain com munication and basi c suppl ies through short , opport visits. However, rapi rinderpest outbreak i nvest igation, especi ally sample collection, is very difficult under t hese ci rcum stances. In areas where no com munity-based ani mal heal th program me has ever been established, training of AHAs and/or Stockpersons has im proved com munication and quality of disease outbreak reports. Som e of these areas ha ve received m inimal support from UNICEF through occasional visits and delivery of sm all quantities of vaccines and m edicines, but UNICEF and NGOs ha ve lacked the capacity to 15 fully support these areas, and t he motivation of som e of these isolated AHAs and Stockpers ons has waned. If ri nderpest surveillan ce is to become more co mprehensive and system atic as so uthern Sudan progresses to ward s rinderpest elimination, then a m ore regul ar program me of support and rem unerat ion for t hese local personnel needs t o be devel oped and funded. Som e areas have never been vi sited and have no known l ocal animal heal th workers. These areas n eed to be visited for information gathering and rinderpest su rveillan ce, estab lishment of communicatio n channels, id entificatio n of local p eople for train ing to carry o ut surveillan ce, an d a reg ular programme of visits an d support devel oped. The estim ate of the cattle population in southern Sudan is a very rough figure and it is likely that with the ongoing conflict it will continue to be very difficult to get an accurate figure. However som e improvem ent in the current estim ates can be m ade: obtain estim ates of the cattle population in the northern s ector areas of southern Sudan, to com plement the southern sector figures, taking care not to count the sam e cattle twice, update population figures as areas of access alter, cross-check popul ation figures usi ng di fferent methods where current estimates do not seem realistic. The cattle sub-populations described in this review should be m apped in m ore deta il to verify that the division of sub- popul ations suggest ed by the aut hor is valid and t o clarify relationshi ps wi thin and bet ween sub-popul ations. M any areas of southern Sudan have alr eady been m apped by livestock NGOs participatory mapping techni ques. Inform ation coul d be ext racted from the exi sting m aps and com plemented by mapping of al l areas as part of the ground level planning of future rinde rpest elim ination activities. These m aps should include wet and dry season grazing areas, cattle m arkets and trade rout es, raiding routes, locations of anim al health personnel and cold chain, roads, airstrips, and rivers, and locati on of last rinderpest outbreak . Copies of the m aps should be subm itted to a central point for col lation usi ng an appropri ate com puter mapping program me, to produce an overal l livestock m ap for southern Sudan. The col lation of al l rinderpest rumours from northern sect or areas woul d improve t he overal l picture of ri nderpest in southern Sudan. The OLS Li vestock Program me needs t o cont inue t o make every effort to investigate every rinderpest rumour, and where p ossible obtain laboratory confirmation of rinderpest or another disease. Th is will n ot be possible unless there is a laborat ory in the regi on that is ready and ab le to carry out rinderpest different ial diagnosi s at all times. System atic use of participatory surveillance m ethods will assist in cross-check ing rinderpest rum ours and investigations, and should be included in the active surveilla nce system for rinderpest elim ination. Bearing in m ind the frequent delays in rum our follow up due to access and security problem s a protocol for retr ospective investigation of outbreaks shoul d be devel oped usi ng a com of the northern sector rinde rpest vaccination figures by adm inistrative areas shoul d be obtained so that the distribution of rinderpest v accination in southern Sudan can be m ore accurately presented. A large num ber of sera dating from 1998- 2000 are awaiting rinderpest ELISA tes ting. Once the results are received they shoul d be ent ered into Tabl e 5, sero-m onitoring has not yet been carri ed out . Although t he sam ple sizes are sm all this might provi de som e further indication of l ikely rinderpest endem ic foci. The l ri nderpest elimination fro needs revi ewed, preferabl through consul tation and ri nderpest shoul d t servi de ory servi ces for sout hern Sudan, fi nanci al support needs t o be secured t o allow it to provi de adequat e servi ces to verify the or absence of ri nderpest in sout hern Sudan. 16 References 1.
