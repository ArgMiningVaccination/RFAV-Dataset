[SHOP OUR PLANS](https://enroll.ambetterhealth.com/?_agent_id=ambetter) It may seem like herbal supplements are a relatively new addition to the wellness scene, but in reality they have been around for thousands of years. Before there were pharmacies, people relied on herbs and natural remedies to keep them healthy or help them recover from injury and illness. You might be wondering if those same remedies can help keep you healthy today. The answer is more than a simple yes or no; the herbal supplements on the shelves today may contain dozens of compounds, and that means you may not know all of the ingredients that are included in the supplement. It is important to become an informed consumer if you're considering herbal supplements, as they could have unexpected side effects. How Your Daily Dose Affects Your Illness Some people swear by herbal supplements, such as melatonin to help sleep or Echinacea to fight colds and respiratory infections. But while some herbal supplements have been proven beneficial to good health, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health notes that not all supplements have been proven effective. And, although herbal supplements are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, they do not face the same scrutiny as prescription and over-the-counter medications. So, it is up to you to educate yourself about possible side effects and interactions. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the computer programs used by pharmacists to warn against possible drug interactions only applies to prescription and over-the-counter drugs, so even alerting your pharmacist to your herbal supplement use may not tell you if there are possible drug interactions. Identifying the Dangers Certain people may be at greater risk for harmful side effects from herbal supplements. In particular, people taking heart medications, blood thinners, hypoglycemic medications, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may face serious side effects from certain herbs. For example, gingko\u2014which is popular for mental function\u2014may increase the risk of bleeding if you take blood-thinning drugs. Just as with prescription medicines, not all supplements are right for all people. Before you begin taking an herbal supplement, educate yourself and check for possible interactions between any medications you may be taking. (Remember to include both prescription and over-the-counter drugs.) Also check for any other side effects that could affect you, even if you are not taking other medications. And finally, if you have questions, check with your healthcare provider about whether or not that herbal supplement is right for you. Ambetter from Arkansas Health & Wellness "}
