Interested in becoming a Reiki Practitioner? kind words Testimonials I'm a 28 year old guy who had no real knowledge about any of this kind of thing nor did I really take it seriously. I saw Anne-Maree who completely changed my perspective and understanding on spirituality, healing and how I viewed myself. In 2 short minutes she understood the trauma I was carrying based on my body language, Why I was the way I was, And how I could overcome it. After the first session I left feeling, lighter, clear minded and way more in tune with myself, It was like all the anxiety I had just simply disappeared and I had regained a part of myself I thought had been lost forever. I've seen her again since and had even more healing done which has helped me dramatically in my everyday life. I am now more present, grounded & open to every scenario that is presented to me. As well as being more confident and feeling more \"whole\" as a person. I urge you if you were like myself and second guessing this kind of thing, Be open minded and give it a go. It has literally changed my life for the better and I cannot thank Anne-Maree enough for what she has done for me. Samuel S I would not be the person I am today without the help and support of Anne-Maree, I first came to see AM many years ago, young and lost with no direction. Her sessions are authentic and totally awesome! Reiki has dramatically improved all areas of my life and with the guidance from Anne-Maree's sessions I can positively say that I'm truly happy with my feet planted on the ground. I would thoroughly recommend her to anyone and everyone!! Sanchia G AM's teachings and methods of healing have been so helpful for me over many years.

I had two Reiki sessions and I can honestly say she has changed my life and helped with chronic endometriosis pain. I literally leave my sessions bouncing out the door feeling positive and happy! Find any excuse to visit and you will leave a happier person with a better understanding of your self. Sophie W I came to see Anne-Maree around 3 years ago & she has well and truly, honestly changed my life. Her sessions are so much more than Reiki, her grounded, truthful and lovingly assertive style of therapy supported me to change unhelpful patterns that were keeping me small, anxious and distant from who I was. Her guidance over the years has helped me to heal from my past and to feel confident and clear about my future, content within my relationships, passionate and appreciative of my skills and the inner knowing that I have the ability to navigate anything that may come my way. I would recommend her sessions to EVERYONE! There are no real words to explain this, but thank you x Sammie F Frequently Asked Questions What is Reiki and how will it benefit me? Reiki is a Japanese healing tradition which means Universal Life Force Energy. It is used for stress reduction and relaxation and promotes the body's self healing. It is administered by \"laying on hands\" and is based on the idea that an unseen \"life force energy\" flows through us. Reiki treats the whole person including body, emotions, mind and spirit creating many beneficial effects including relaxation, peace, security and wellbeing. Reiki is a simple, natural and safe method of spiritual healing and self-improvement that everyone can use. It also works in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery. What are the health benefits of Reiki session? The common benefits of a Reiki session are; Relaxation, Stress Relief, Boost Energy, Reduce Fatigue, Aid Digestion, Improve Sleep, Reduce Anxiety, Improve chronic pain. In addition to Reiki, Anne-Maree uses a combination of Spiritual Healing and Counselling methods to help you understand and work through past trauma, grief and times of life which may be causing you to feel stuck, anxious, depressed and uncertain of how to move forward. what can i expect during a Reiki consultation with Anne-MAree? A initial consultation with Anne-Maree goes for 90 minutes. You will begin with 45 minutes of interviewing and counselling, with the remaining session including a card reading and reiki healing. Follow up sessions are 60 minutes and include the same modalities as an initial consult. It is common to feel a deep sense of relaxation, clarity and ease after a session. How often should I get Reiki? We suggest a minimum of 4 x 1:1 sessions with Anne-Maree to see profound shifts and to receive the true benefit of a consultation. This usually looks at about a 4-6 week gap in between sessions to allow enough time for growth, integration and development in between. We then recommend to book as you please or when navigating new life experiences. When will I feel a difference after a Reiki session? Each individual client will experience a Reiki session with Anne-Maree differently as no two clients experiences are they same. However it is common to feel a sense of clarity, grounding and relaxation after each session and at times it is normal to feel tired after an emotional release. For majority of our clients, after a consistent 4 sessions it is common to feel a significant shift in self awareness, self belief, self confidence, overall well-being and life circumstances. what do i wear during the reiki treatment? We recommend to wear something comfortable, which allows the energy to flow freely. It is recommended that you remove watches "}
