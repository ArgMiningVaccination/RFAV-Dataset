Introduction [1](#B1-molecules-26-00628)], while microorganisms faced with antimicrobials develop their own resistance in the process. This very same scenario is now replayed in the clinical setting whereby the application of antibiotics has caused the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [ [2](#B2-molecules-26-00628)]. Some factors such as the inappropriate and incorrect prescription of antibiotics, their overuse in clinics and animal husbandry, in addition to poor sanitation of water in developing countries have exacerbated the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance [ [3](#B3-molecules-26-00628), microbes can be life-threatening as the clinical outcomes worsen [ [11](#B11-molecules-26-00628), [12](#B12-molecules-26-00628)]. This may also cause challenges for successful treatment [ [13](#B13-molecules-26-00628)]. [14](#B14-molecules-26-00628)]. Vertical gene transfer occurs from a parent cell while horizontal gene transfer of plasmids is acquired from other cells; the acquisition can also be due to a spontaneous recombination [ [9](#B9-molecules-26-00628), [15](#B15-molecules-26-00628), [16](#B16-molecules-26-00628)]. Due to the acquisition of these genes, bacteria are able to produce enzymes such as -lactamase, carbapenemase, and nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) that act against the antibiotics, on the efflux pump on the bacterial cell membrane, or change the original target site of the antibiotic [ [17](#B17-molecules-26-00628)]. Fungi can also develop antifungal resistance. For example, Candida, an opportunistic yeast, can develop resistance to drugs when an antibacterial drug is consumed by the host. Despite the drug not being targeted to Candida, prolonged exposure can introduce Candida resistance to the drug [ [18](#B18-molecules-26-00628)]. Both Aspergillus and Candida species have shown resistance to antifungal drugs such as azole and fluconazole, which can be used to treat systemic fungal infections by inhibiting its growth [ [19](#B19-molecules-26-00628), [20](#B20-molecules-26-00628)]. Viruses have also shown antiviral resistance; for example, influenza virus has shown resistance against Oseltamivir, Amantadine, and Rimantadine. Resistance to Acyclovir by herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been detected in different countries [ [21](#B21-molecules-26-00628)]. [22](#B22-molecules-26-00628)]. Furthermore, scientists in the 18th century have identified active components of medicinal plants that possess biological effects [ [22](#B22-molecules-26-00628)]. [23](#B23-molecules-26-00628)]. Therefore, the use of EO was taken as a new direction to treat microbial infections due to their antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral properties [ [24](#B24-molecules-26-00628)]. EO contain mixtures of volatile and concentrated organic compounds that are produced naturally in plants [ [25](#B25-molecules-26-00628)]. EO are produced in almost all parts of the plants such as flowers, fruits, leaves, stems, seeds, buds, twigs, bark, and stored in epidermal cells, glandular trichomes, secretary cavities, EO are plants' secondary metabolites that play a significant role in plant reproduction, as they attract pollinators to contribute to distributing the seeds and pollens. However, some EO such as oil from Cryptomeria japonica also possess a repellent effect against arthropods and pests, which is a crucial part of the plant's defense mechanism [ [30](#B30-molecules-26-00628), [31](#B31-molecules-26-00628)]. These EO and their constituents are well documented for antimicrobial potentials [ [32](#B32-molecules-26-00628), [33](#B33-molecules-26-00628)]. EO obtained from medicinal plants are reported to have more than 20-60 constituents of different concentrations and two to three main compounds, which are usually in high amounts (20-70%) [ [34](#B34-molecules-26-00628)]. [35](#B35-molecules-26-00628), [36](#B36-molecules-26-00628)]. Terpenoids are diverse natural plant products that show various pharmacological properties due to their diverse structure and functions [ [37](#B37-molecules-26-00628)]. Terpenes are one of the most valuable classes of natural origin compounds that have economic value due to their use in different sectors such as in pharmaceuticals and food [ [38](#B38-molecules-26-00628)], with most of the common or medicinally important terpenes being monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Monoterpenes are found in about 90% of EO. These EO have a broad spectrum activity against bacterial infections due to their high content of oxygenated monoterpenes [ [39](#B39-molecules-26-00628)]. Terpenes are the hydrocarbons that consist of isoprene units with the general formula (C5H8)n joined together by the head to tail rule\u2014this meaning the fourth carbon atom of a single unit bonds with the first carbon atom of another unit to form a 1-4 linkage. [34](#B34-molecules-26-00628)]. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (2005), EO can be used safely, and its components can be used as additives in antimicrobial drugs to reduce the development of resistance against antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral drugs [ [34](#B34-molecules-26-00628), [40](#B40-molecules-26-00628), [41](#B41-molecules-26-00628)]. Owing to the presence of various compounds, these EO have antimicrobial potential. This review summarizes EO effectivity on microorganisms and aims to extensively focus on the effectiveness of EO and their compounds against various microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Moreover, we will discuss the potential of various EOs in inhibiting microbial growth in addition to identifying the mode of action of EO and synergistic activity. Finally, the genomic perspective of EO against bacteria and the proteomic technologies used to study the bacterial proteome when treated with EO will be discussed. 2. Essential Oil Research 2.1. AMR and Antimicrobial activity [42](#B42-molecules-26-00628), [43](#B43-molecules-26-00628)], as the composition and the nature of each functional group gives each EO its antimicrobial of a few selected and popular compounds in EO against different microorganisms. 2.1.1. Antibacterial Activity of EO [51](#B51-molecules-26-00628), [65](#B65-molecules-26-00628)]. The antibacterial activity of EO refers to their ability to inhibit or inactivate bacterial growth [ [66](#B66-molecules-26-00628), [67](#B67-molecules-26-00628)]. Several studies have reported that some plants and EO such as clove, thyme, rosemary, oregano, cinnamon, and pimento showed potent pathogens [69](#B69-molecules-26-00628), [72](#B72-molecules-26-00628)]. such as eugenol, carvacrol, and thymol are mainly responsible for their antibacterial action against different bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli; phenolics [47](#B47-molecules-26-00628), [50](#B50-molecules-26-00628), [51](#B51-molecules-26-00628), [60](#B60-molecules-26-00628)]. [51](#B51-molecules-26-00628)]. Properties of certain compounds permit the ability of inhibiting the growth of most Gram-positive bacteria and a few Gram-negatives. This is explained by the outer structure of Gram-positive bacteria, which contains a thick peptidoglycan cell wall that allows penetration by hydrophobic compounds. [73](#B73-molecules-26-00628)]. The result obtained from one study indicated the effectiveness of oregano EO against Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, and E. coli [ [73](#B73-molecules-26-00628)]. It was determined that oregano EO slowed the growth and lactic acid production of bacteria. Moreover, oregano EO when added to S. typhimurium significantly inhibited its growth [ [73](#B73-molecules-26-00628)]. In addition, oregano and lavender EO showed a bactericidal effect on Klebsiella pneumoniae with a Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 63,000 \u00b5g/mL [ [74](#B74-molecules-26-00628)]. Furthermore, cinnamon bark EO had been shown to cause oxidative stress to K. pneumoniae, leading to the loss of cell viability [ [75](#B75-molecules-26-00628)]. The results mentioned above showed both oregano and cinnamon bark EO possess great antibacterial benefit; in addition, many studies have investigated their efficacies as antimicrobials against several species. [76](#B76-molecules-26-00628)]. Moreover, Echinophora platyloba DC. EO showed a strong activity against bacteria, and S. aureus and L. monocytogenes were the most sensitive bacteria with MIC of about 6250 and 12,500 \u00b5g/mL [ [77](#B77-molecules-26-00628)]. Rosemary EO was tested against human tumor cells including SK-OV-3, HO-8910, and Bel-7402; it was shown to have a variety of activities, based on the MTT or 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The EO was shown to possess antiproliferative cellular activity. The antioxidant activity was also assessed by measuring the inhibition of peroxidation percentage by the disc diffusion and resazurin plate assays. The results show that rosemary EO possesses antiproliferative, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial activity against different microorganisms tested [ [78](#B78-molecules-26-00628), [79](#B79-molecules-26-00628)]. [80](#B80-molecules-26-00628)]. There were some EO that were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria while some were more effective against Gram-negative bacteria, and some EO were effective for both. E. platyloba DC, oregano EO, as well as the compounds with phenolic properties such as hydrophobicity have been found to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria while lavender, oregano EO, and citronellol, carveol compounds can inhibit more Gram-negative bacteria. Both Gram-positive and negative bacteria have been affected [81](#B81-molecules-26-00628)]. Treating human fungal infections mainly involves the use of oral tablets or topicals creams. It is also more difficult to apply treatment for fungal infections than bacterial, because human and fungal cells share the commonality of being eukaryotic. If the fungal treatment targets and acts against a common structure in eukaryotic cells, this may also lead to toxicity for the human cells, compromising host safety [ [81](#B81-molecules-26-00628)]. When developing an antifungal drug, it is important for pharmaceutical industries to target a structure that is found specifically only in fungal cells such as the chitin structure [ [81](#B81-molecules-26-00628), [82](#B82-molecules-26-00628)]. [83](#B83-molecules-26-00628), [84](#B84-molecules-26-00628), [85](#B85-molecules-26-00628), [86](#B86-molecules-26-00628)]. It has been found that EO exerted antifungal activity with roles in blocking cell communication, attenuating fungal growth, and been tested against different Candida species, and their antifungal activity by the broth microdilution method have shown that Ocimum micranthum and Ocimum selloi are active against Candida species values of 312.5-1250 g/mL [ [89](#B89-molecules-26-00628)]. Therefore, Ocimum EO can be used to treat infection with fungus such as C. albicans [ [89](#B89-molecules-26-00628)]. Due to an abundance of the phenolic constituents including carvacrol and thymol as major components in oregano and thyme, EO have shown significant inhibitory activity against fungal pathogens by breaking the fungal cell membrane [ [23](#B23-molecules-26-00628)]. In general, oregano has been found to affect both spore germination and destroy fungal cell membranes. In addition, it has been determined that the mycelial growth of three fungal Aspergillus species was inhibited by 90-100% due to the activity of cinnamon and clove EO [ [90](#B90-molecules-26-00628)]. A study has reported the fungicidal potentials of EO and pure constituents to hamper viable cell count, mycelia growth, and mycotoxin production by these fungi after treatment with clove, can disrupt the chitin synthesis in fungal cell walls to causes abnormality in glycoproteins synthesis and mitochondrial structure, as sporulation [92](#B92-molecules-26-00628)]. 2.1.3. The majority of effective antivirals against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) has become ineffective due to antiviral resistance, although they have contributed to combating viral infections; several antivirals have also induced adverse reactions. As a result, many studies have been done to explore new antiviral treatments to these viruses [ [94](#B94-molecules-26-00628), [95](#B95-molecules-26-00628), [96](#B96-molecules-26-00628), [97](#B97-molecules-26-00628)]. In addition to the limited effective antiviral medications, alternative therapeutic substances such as EO have been explored, as several trials have shown that EO can possess significant antiviral activity against many RNA and DNA viruses by inhibiting viral multiplication [ [98](#B98-molecules-26-00628)]. [99](#B99-molecules-26-00628)]. A study has proven the antiviral activity of plaque reduction However, thymus EO was tested against HSV and influenza and showed no effective results [ [101](#B101-molecules-26-00628)]. In a different study, the -caryophyllene, which is constituent in many EO, has been examined for its viricidal activity against dengue virus (DENV) proteins, and effective results were reported as it acted on inhibiting the replication of the DENV [ [102](#B102-molecules-26-00628), [103](#B103-molecules-26-00628)]. Compounds such as -terpinene and cuminyl-aldehyde have been found to have antiviral activity against two types of viruses; a significant inhibition was observed on HSV-1 (DNA virus), while a lesser inhibitory effect was observed on the parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI-3) (RNA virus) [ [97](#B97-molecules-26-00628)]. Moreover, ajwain EO, which was tested against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), was found to be effective with viral inhibition at 0.5 mg/mL of oil [ [104](#B104-molecules-26-00628)]. 2.2. Synergistic Activity in EO [106](#B106-molecules-26-00628)]. Exploiting the synergistic combination of EO and antimicrobial agents have been suggested as one possible alternative strategy for combating antimicrobial resistance. According to a number of studies, several EO constituents have shown the ability to enhance conventional antimicrobial efficacy and potency when used in combination [ [105](#B105-molecules-26-00628), [106](#B106-molecules-26-00628)]. [25](#B25-molecules-26-00628), [107](#B107-molecules-26-00628), [108](#B108-molecules-26-00628)]. In a different study, the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) of EO was evaluated, and the data showed promising outcome against fungal and bacterial species [ [109](#B109-molecules-26-00628), [110](#B110-molecules-26-00628)]. Hence, when more than one EO were combined, a greater efficacy was achieved. Oregano and thyme EO combined showed synergistic effects against different fungal species studied with FIC 0.5, except for Aspergillus niger, which that displayed an additive effect with an FIC value of 0.75 \u00b1 0.16. Moreover, a synergistic effect was found between carvacrol and thymol, which are compounds contained in thyme and oregano, respectively, to have a synergistic effect against Penicillium spp, A. flavus, and Fusarium species with FIC 0.5. A synergistic effect was also reported between carvacrol and thyme EO that showed an enhanced effectiveness against S. typhimurium [ [109](#B109-molecules-26-00628), [110](#B110-molecules-26-00628)]. [17](#B17-molecules-26-00628), [111](#B111-molecules-26-00628)]. Tea tree oil has react synergistically with tobramycin against E.coli ATCC 25922 and S. aureus ATCC 29213, with a mean post-antibiotic effect of 1.3 h against E. coli and 1.7 h against S. aureus [ [112](#B112-molecules-26-00628)]. This study showed that this combinatory therapy is effective against the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. In addition, tea tree oil in combination with peppermint oil showed a synergistic activity against A. niger with an FIC of 0.43 \u00b1 0.06 [ [110](#B110-molecules-26-00628)]. Additional combinations of tea tree oil with different types of EO have been shown to give different synergistic and additive activities against A. flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, and A. niger. For instance, tea tree combined with cinnamon or eucalyptus showed additive activity in all fungal species with 0.5 FIC 1. If combined with thyme, the combination will give an additive activity with 0.5 FIC 1 against all species except A. niger. Moreover, the combination of oregano and tea tree has been shown to be additive against both P. chrysogenum and A. niger [ [110](#B110-molecules-26-00628)]. [113](#B113-molecules-26-00628)]. The checkerboard method was used to evaluate the combined effect of the EO and tetracycline. Using quantitative RT-PCR, the largest decline of the tetracycline effluxes was detected from S. epidermidis cells treated with S. fruticosa EO. The mRNA level of Tet(K) gene was lowered by 2\u00b72-fold, which indicated efflux pump inhibition. Findings demonstrated the synergistic potential of Salvias' EO combined with tetracycline, with lowered MICs values showing S. fruticosa EO to be the most effective of the three EO tested [ [113](#B113-molecules-26-00628)]. [114](#B114-molecules-26-00628)]. The results indicated that the tested EO alone as well as in combination had allelopathic effect, while the synergistic effect of S. officinalis l. and T. vulgaris l. EO in terms of fungal growth was found to be 0.06%. Furthermore, thyme and sage EO exhibited in vitro antiproliferative activity on melanoma cell lines A375 and B164A5 alone, as well as in combination [ [114](#B114-molecules-26-00628)]. [115](#B115-molecules-26-00628)]. The EO was analyzed by MIC in addition to GC-MS and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) parameters. The results suggested that the EO may act as a potential antifungal agent and could serve as a natural adjuvant for fungal infection treatment. [116](#B116-molecules-26-00628)]. In addition, Melissa officinalis EO has been examined against avian influenza virus (AVI) [ [117](#B117-molecules-26-00628)]. The combination of M. officinalis EO and oseltamivir antiviral drug showed synergistic activity as the results showed a reduction in the viral genome copy number, which proves the inhibitory effect against AVI [ [117](#B117-molecules-26-00628)]. 2.3. Mode of Action of EO Compounds on Pathogenic Bacteria [Figure 1](#molecules-26-00628-f001)) [ [23](#B23-molecules-26-00628)]. The mode of action of each EO compound may differ, as some act on the outer membrane of bacteria and some act on the membrane proteins' efflux system. The hydrophobicity of EO enables them to penetrate the cell wall of bacteria, which subsequently disrupts the cell wall, causing increased permeability and the release of intracellular materials [ [51](#B51-molecules-26-00628), [118](#B118-molecules-26-00628)]. [119](#B119-molecules-26-00628)]. [75](#B75-molecules-26-00628)]. These proteins that were lost play a role in energy generation; losing these proteins may disrupt the bacterial cell membrane and subsequent killing of the bacteria [ [75](#B75-molecules-26-00628)]. Moreover, the lavender EO (LVO) has been shown to cause oxidative stress to bacteria by oxidizing the outer membrane of the bacteria [ [120](#B120-molecules-26-00628), [121](#B121-molecules-26-00628), [122](#B122-molecules-26-00628)]. In fact, LVO and meropenem, in addition with reactive oxygen species (ROS), have resulted in bacterial membrane disruption. [17](#B17-molecules-26-00628), [123](#B123-molecules-26-00628)]. This protein plays an important role in antibacterial resistance that helps bacteria to survive. A major mechanism of antimicrobial resistance is increasing the expression of efflux pumps in bacteria, which will subsequently result in lowering the antibiotic concentration in bacterial cells [ [65](#B65-molecules-26-00628)]. The efflux pump of bacteria works to protect the bacterial cell by pumping a large amount of antibiotics out of the cells [ [124](#B124-molecules-26-00628)]. Recently, some studies have found that EO are able to inhibit the efflux pump of the bacteria, and the compounds present in the EO have many targets on the bacterial cells [ [125](#B125-molecules-26-00628)]. Therefore, the inhibition of efflux pumps is a vital target for EO and their metabolites [ [126](#B126-molecules-26-00628)]. [44](#B44-molecules-26-00628)]. The leakage of the cell content includes ions such as potassium ion (K+) and hydrogen ion (H+), and also proteins and genetic material such as DNA ( [Figure 2](#molecules-26-00628-f002)) [ [127](#B127-molecules-26-00628), [128](#B128-molecules-26-00628)]. For example, the loss of cell content in Bacillus subtilis after exposure to Origanum compactum EO is an indication of the increased membrane permeability, which results in cell lysis [ [128](#B128-molecules-26-00628)]. Furthermore, cinnamaldehyde cinnamon oil decreased the intracellular ATP in Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) [ [130](#B130-molecules-26-00628)]. A high concentration of EO compound such as carvacrol can result in cell lysis by depleting intracellular ATP in B. cereus [ [131](#B131-molecules-26-00628)]. 3. Recent Approaches 3.1. Genomics Perspective [132](#B132-molecules-26-00628), [133](#B133-molecules-26-00628)]. Therefore, it is important to know how EO operates at the genetic level and how they modulate microbial genes [ [134](#B134-molecules-26-00628)]. The availability of the complete genome sequence for several pathogenic microorganisms provides extremely useful information regarding potential drug targets and is a very useful resource in order to mine for novel antimicrobial drugs [ [135](#B135-molecules-26-00628)]. Using this approach, genome databases coupled with bioinformatics are used as tools for the transcriptional examination and recognition of the molecular basis. This will enable us to screen compounds/molecules as potential inhibitors of pathological targets and may also help us discover and optimize more effective next-generation antibiotics. [136](#B136-molecules-26-00628)]. In addition, by using scanning electron microscopy, qPCR, and a 96-well plate method, cinnamon oil has been found to have activity against the expression of icaA gene and biofilms of S. epidermidis [ [137](#B137-molecules-26-00628)]. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) has shown that cinnamaldehyde is able to kill the tested bacteria, thus indicating its effectiveness in biofilms [ [137](#B137-molecules-26-00628)]. All these findings prove that different EO can modulate gene expression by upregulating and downregulating stress and virulence genes of different microorganisms. 3.2. Proteomics Perspective [138](#B138-molecules-26-00628)]. They have been used to separate, identify, and quantify the different classes of EO components and will be discussed below. [139](#B139-molecules-26-00628)]. It consisted of the isoelectric focusing (IEF) method in the first dimension, which separates the proteins according to the isoelectric focusing, and in the second dimension, separation is performed based on the molecular size by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS- PAGE) [ [140](#B140-molecules-26-00628)]. The basic principle of these techniques is to separate the complex protein mixture into two steps by placing the mixture in a gel and applying an electrical current. This technique is widely used in proteome analysis, bacterial pathogenesis, diseases research, and the purification of proteins [ [140](#B140-molecules-26-00628)]. [141](#B141-molecules-26-00628)]. The sample is mixed with an energy-absorbent matrix, and a laser beam is used to ionize the samples. Then, the molecules are charged, and consequently, the time of ion flight may differ according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) value [ [142](#B142-molecules-26-00628)]. [143](#B143-molecules-26-00628)]. Overall, MALDI-TOF MS has been more cost-effective, reliable, and rapid compared to other diagnostic tools [ [144](#B144-molecules-26-00628)]. [145](#B145-molecules-26-00628)]. [146](#B146-molecules-26-00628)]. LC-MS/MS may be used to analyze the effect of EO on the proteome of bacteria by comparing the proteome of the cells that are treated with particular EO against untreated cells [ [120](#B120-molecules-26-00628)]. [147](#B147-molecules-26-00628)]. Bacteria that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics were studied using proteomic analysis [ [148](#B148-molecules-26-00628)]. The study revealed an increase in several proteins related to antibacterial resistance mechanisms such as the outer membrane protein (To1C) that is involved in the efflux pump system [ [148](#B148-molecules-26-00628)]. 4. Limitations in Essential Oils Research [149](#B149-molecules-26-00628)]. However, the mechanisms by which the EO function are not fully understood in detail. Moreover, there have been reports of the negative impact of excessive doses of EO on human health [ [150](#B150-molecules-26-00628)]. [151](#B151-molecules-26-00628)]. The large amount of secondary metabolites may have synergistic or antagonistic properties when used in non-standardized form. Thus, there is a need to optimize the analysis of a range of EO and compounds more clearly for the effective yet safe use of EO for human beings. The formation of residues in biological systems and allergic reactions associated with the use of EO are also among other challenges regarding their use as antimicrobial agents [ [152](#B152-molecules-26-00628)]. [153](#B153-molecules-26-00628), [154](#B154-molecules-26-00628)]. Nevertheless, more detailed research studies are required regarding the potential use of encapsulated EO as efficient antimicrobial agents. [23](#B23-molecules-26-00628)]. This might be attributed to the synergy between various metabolites or the combined antimicrobial effect of various components. 5. Future Strategies and Prospects [23](#B23-molecules-26-00628), [155](#B155-molecules-26-00628)]. Moreover, EO are important for reducing the antimicrobial resistance; more effort is needed to do long-term studies to determine the EO effectiveness in vivo by conducting clinical trials in order to discover its full potential, the needed dose, and determine if any side effects emerge [ [23](#B23-molecules-26-00628), [99](#B99-molecules-26-00628)]. EO can be effective by either the absorption, ingestion, or inhalation through lungs of its volatile compounds [ [25](#B25-molecules-26-00628), [156](#B156-molecules-26-00628), [157](#B157-molecules-26-00628)]. These oils are effective and used in raw and processed food preservation, perfumery, and in alternative medicine due to their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities for burn healing, and malarial infection [ [25](#B25-molecules-26-00628), [158](#B158-molecules-26-00628), [159](#B159-molecules-26-00628)]. EO are also shown to give synergistic activity when used with antibiotics and thought to be effective to treat antimicrobial resistance, and in the public point of view, it is more accepted due to its traditional use [ [23](#B23-molecules-26-00628), [160](#B160-molecules-26-00628), [161](#B161-molecules-26-00628)]. Previous discoveries of EO against antimicrobials still did not explain exactly the EO mechanism of action and their chemical nature, and this makes the effectiveness and action of EO against antimicrobials unclear and in need of improvement [ [23](#B23-molecules-26-00628), [162](#B162-molecules-26-00628)]. [34](#B34-molecules-26-00628)]. Further extensive studies might be designed to evaluate or predict the adoptive behavior of microbes to the EO after chronic or sub-chronic use. As reported in previous studies, B. cereus have become less susceptible to the antimicrobial effect of carvacrol subsequent to culturing at low concentrations of the compound [ [163](#B163-molecules-26-00628)]. Meanwhile, a significant enhancement in the sensitivity of the same bacteria to the action of EO was observed after alteration in the phospholipids and fatty acids composition, which alter the fluidity and passive permeability of the bacterial cell membrane. Additionally, the effect of EO on the bacterial membrane proteins and phospholipids and their mechanisms is not fully understood yet. A few EO have been shown to have low toxicity to the human body; however, other EOs may affect human cells negatively and might be considered unsafe to be used. Thus, more studies are needed to check EO toxicity through many clinical phases [ [164](#B164-molecules-26-00628), [165](#B165-molecules-26-00628)]. [34](#B34-molecules-26-00628)]. Nevertheless, with the emerging concept of green consumerism, it is expected that the use of EO and medicinal plants will increase, and further exploration will occur. The use of natural products-based drugs, nutraceuticals, herbs, and isolated pure compounds is tremendously increased in medicine, the food sector, cosmetics, and didactics. The use of modern analytical techniques can help mankind in the further development of evidence-based medicine with more efficacy and safety. Thus, new nanoencapsulation strategies and synergistic studies can help provide powerful information about this topic of interest in future [ [34](#B34-molecules-26-00628), [124](#B124-molecules-26-00628)].
