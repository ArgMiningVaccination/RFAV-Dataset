The homeopathic medicines are prepared from a wide range of natural sources. Over 75% of the medicines origin from the vegetable kingdom, i.e. flowers, roots, leaves, and the juice. Certain chemicals and minerals are also used to prepared certain medicines. For instance, sulfuric acid, nitric acid. Most of the minerals and metals are used as a source of medicine, such as gold, silver, zinc, tin, iron and so on. Some microbes, bacteria, virus are also used to prepare a special group of medicines (called Nosode), for instance, influenza virus, bacteria which produce tuberculosis, etc. Some of the body's secretions such as the hormones (thyroid hormone, for instance) also find a place in the homeopathic pharmacopeia. The animal kingdom has a special place in the homeopathy pharmacy and homeopathy medicines are prepared from the animal sources almost in a nonviolent technique. Some insects such as the Spanish fly (Apis Mellifica) and certain animal products such as the venom of Cobra snake (Naja) are used in a unique manner. How are the homeopathic medicines prepared The revolutionary method of drug preparation in homeopathy, called Potentization, utilizes a very minute quantity of the original drug substance. A very small portion of any substance, say a drop of Surukuku snake venom, as one part, is mixed with 99 parts of alcohol or distilled water. Some powerful strokes are given to this mixture of about 100 drops/ml. It makes so-called 1c potency. Now, out of this 100 drops, one drop is taken and mixed with 99 drops of alcohol, again to undergo the process of vigorous strokes, making the potency 2c. The process is continued higher level up to 30c, 200c, 1000c, 10000c, 50000c and 100000c. No material, only the medicinal power... As you can realize, there is infinitesimal original drug substance in the higher potency medicines. Actually it crosses Avogadro's limit. There is no detectable material in the potency higher than 24. What is left behind is the power or energy of the medicine. One may call it dynamic power, which is capable to induce definite changes in the body system to bring about the healing process.
