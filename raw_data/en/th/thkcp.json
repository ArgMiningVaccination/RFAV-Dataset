Co- Principal Investigator s: Ryan Sponsor: Metagenics, Inc. A. ABSTRACT The maintenance of health and the progression of disease are associated with an individual's genetic make-up and environmental factors, including lifestyle choices (such as diet, exercise, behaviors, stressors, sleep, tobacco and alcohol use), environmental exposures and socioeconomic determinants. Environmental factors have been shown to influence, sometimes rapidly, epigenetic processes thereby influencing genetic expression.1 Regulation of the human genome by the epigenome is now regarded as a cornerstone, heritable, physiologic process, play ing a key role in phenotypic expression of health and disease. DNA methylation is a well-researched, primary epigenetic process.2 Aberrant DNA in hyper- hypomethylated regions of the genome, generally results in inhibition or Protocol Study Title: Methylation Diet and Lifestyle (MDL) Study PI: Ryan Bradley, ND, MPH and Kara Fitzgerald, ND IRB #: RB100217 Approval Date: 2.9.18 Ver. 1.1 2 expression of certain genes and has been associated with the pathogenesis of numerous conditions, ranging from inflammation and accelerated aging, to cancer, autoimmunity, diabetes, heart disease, dementia, allergic disease, posttraumatic stress disease and others.3-6 Likewise, certain healthy diet and lifestyle habits have been demonstrated to favorably influence DNA methylation patterns.7,8 Understanding that environmental factors can potently and sometimes rapidly, favorably or negatively influence epigenetic expression, a short-term diet and lifestyle intervention may significantly augment DNA methylation expression. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a 9-week diet and lifestyle intervention on patient- reported quality of life, symptoms, and DNA and biochemical methylation-related biomarkers in healthy males ages 50-72. B. SPECIFIC AIMS B.1 Primary Aim: To evaluate a 9-week diet and lifestyle intervention on patient-reported quality of life.

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE C.1. Methylation background and significance Methylation, happening in every cell, virtually continuously, signifies the enzymatic addition of a single carbon compound on a substrate and regulates gene expression, protein function, and RNA processing.9 Folate vitamer, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) acts as key substrate within these pathways by transferring a methyl group to cobalamin by the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). This is a coenzyme used by methionine synthase and transfers a methyl group to homocysteine, creating methionine. Methionine undergoes a structural transformation under the presence adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to become S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe). SAMe, the universal methyl donor, is essential for over a 100 methylation reactions by transferring a methyl group to DNA, proteins, phospholipids, amino acids and neurotransmitters. Research into the epigenome demonstrates that DNA methylation is a cornerstone regulator of gene expression. Genetic methylation is reliant on SAMe availability. Myriad environmental factors, as outlined above, also influence genetic methylation either directly or through altered SAMe availability. Imbalances in methylation pathways due to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is a rapidly emerging area of investigation implicated in numerous disease processes.10 While genetic polymorphisms alter enzyme function, it may increase risk of certain disease s.10-12 Investigation into a single nucleotide polymorphism of MTHFR has gained popularity. Individuals with a point Protocol Study Title: Methylation Diet and Lifestyle (MDL) Study PI: Ryan Bradley, ND, MPH and Kara Fitzgerald, ND IRB #: RB100217 Approval Date: 2.9.18 Ver. 1.1 4 mutation on MTHFR gene, result in higher plasma levels of homocysteine, a risk factor associated with atherosclerosis and coronary artery diseases.13,14 Hyperhomocysteinemia is significantly inversely correlated with DNA hypomethylation and exacerbated by folate deficiency.15 C.2. Diet and lifestyle intervention as a means to support proper methylation Inadequate diet and physical inactivity are indicated as two of the top 5 modifiable risk factors in several chronic diseases as well as associated with all-cause mortality.16 A diet lacking adequate intake of essential nutrients and antioxidants, as well as lack of exercise increase biomarkers associated with oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and DNA hypom ethylation .17,18 Oxidative overload places stress on cellular metabolic function, and is correlated with an increased risk of chronic diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.19-21 With regard to the epigenome, poor diet has been associated with accelerated aging as evidenced by Horvath's Epigenetic Clock looking at DNA methylation patterns.8 Oxidative stress has also been shown to limit methyl donor availability, thereby impacting DNA methylation, by promoting transsulfuration and glutathione synthesis while inhibiting the methylation cycle. Oxidative damage to the epigenome further contributes to aberrant DNA methylation patterns.22 A nutrient-rich diet and regular, moderate, aerobic exercise reduces oxidative stress, and risk of disease, by increasing antioxidants and activity of antioxidant enzymes, while also altering gene specific DNA methylation levels.7,23,24 Phytochemicals in various plant foods have demonstrated the ability to modulate DNA methylation. These include quercetin, found in red onion and apple skins, green tea, and red grapes; epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), found highest in green and white in soybeans; apigenin, found celery; and curcumin, found in turmeric.25 In addition, regular physical activity has shown to induce epigenetic changes in DNA methylation and lower homocysteine levels.26,27 To date, this would be the first known clinical trial investigating diet and lifestyle intervention on patient-reported quality of life, symptoms, and DNA and biochemical methylation-related biomarkers in healthy males ages 50- 72.

Measurement of Potential Confounders DNA Methylation Pathway Profile Assesses changes to SNPs - DNA genotype which may affect enzymatic function which include, methionine metabolism, detoxification, hormones, and vitamin D. D.4.1. Primary Outcome: Patient-reported Quality of Life Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information - PROMIS - 29 Profile The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a collection of patient-reported health status inventories funded by the NIH. PROMIS provides a standardized, reliable, and valid measure of health status that assesses physical, mental, and social well - being from the patient perspective. The PROMIS-29 Profile is a collection of self-report short forms containing items from 7 PROMIS domains (Physical Function, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Pain Interference, and Pain Intensity). The PROMIS-29 Profile consists of 4 questions per domain rated on a 5- point rating scale along with a 1 question Pain Intensity section rated on an 11-point scale. The domains are assessed over the past 7 days except for the Physical Function domain which has no specified time frame. PROMIS- 29 Table 2. Grading of PROMIS -29 101-125 Moderately severe 126-150 Severe PROMIS-29 provides a continuous symptom severity score (7 categories). Total raw scores range from 29 to 150. A raw score is created from each subscale (except Pain Intensity) that makes up the Profile except the Pain Intensity item. Scores are translated into T-scores which are re ferenced to mean score levels in the general U.S. population. Lower PROMIS scores have been shown to predict reduced health related quality of life for multiple conditions. D.4.2. Secondary Outcome: Patient-reported Symptom Change D.4.2.1. Primary Measure: Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP) Protocol Study Title: Methylation Diet and Lifestyle (MDL) Study PI: Ryan Bradley, ND, MPH and Kara Fitzgerald, ND IRB #: RB100217 Approval Date: 2.9.18 Ver. 1.1 13 Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP) is a patient centered outcome measure that allows for the participant to self-select their top health concern(s) or symptom(s) they are dealing with in their own words. The participant can also choose an activity that is limited by that health concern. The participant is then asked about their own general wellbeing. Each of these questions is scored on a 0-6 scale. The medications that the participant is taking related to the specific symptoms and their desire to cut down the medication is also recorded. Scoring of the MYMOP is an average of all of the profile questions answered. Participants only have to choose one symptom and answer the well-being profile question. If a second related symptom and activity level are identified all of the scores are included in the average final score. MYMOP has been shown to be an effective outcome measurement for health concerns, especially in a diverse population and has more sensitivity to change compared to the SF- 36.29,30 D.4.2.2. Symptom/Adverse Event Questionnaire is a standardized ninety-one point monitoring form that requires asking questions pertaining to the following organ systems: eyes/ears/nose/throat, gastrointestinal, neurological/ musculoskeletal, psychological/general, cardiopulmonary, skin, genitourinary and whole body systems.

Protocol Study Title: Methylation Diet and Lifestyle (MDL) Study PI: Ryan Bradley, ND, MPH and Kara Fitzgerald, ND IRB #: RB100217 Approval Date: 2.9.18 Ver. 1.1 14 D.4.3. Tertiary Outcome: Changes in methylation at CpG sites of DNA The tertiary outcome will be the assessment of methylation changes at \"CpG\" sites on DNA using a commercial available assay kit. CpG sites are sites on DNA in which a cysteine base is separated from a guanine base by only one phosphate; CpG sites are known sites for regulation by methylation. The Infinium MethylationEPIC Kit by Illumina uses the latest technology to assess methylation status of over 850,000 DNA sites across the genome. Using DNA provided from a saliva sample, this assay measured changes in methylation at \"CpG\" sites of DNA, i.e., whether or not sites for methylation are, or are not, methylated. For a given time point, the degree of methylation at each site (i.e., ) is pres ente d as a color ranging from \"green\" (i.e., =0, low methylation) to \"red\" (i.e., =1, high methylation). We will compare the methylation state of participants at base line to their status at the end of the study. \"Differential\" methylation is considered a change in CpG site methylation of 0.66. See Figure 2 below for a typic al representation of the results of the assay.28 Figure 2: Typical Demonstration of Results Applying the Infinium MethylationEPIC Kit A saliva sample will collect approximately 2 mL (~1 teaspoon) into a cryovial. Saliva samples will be labeled only with a study ID, date of collection, and visit number and frozen to - 70 \u00b0C. At the conclusion of the study, all samples will be batched shipped to: Yale University Center for Genome Analysis Attn: Guilin Wang, PhD, Associate Director of Microarray; Heffernan B-36, West Profile - Doctor's Data Study Title: Diet and Lifestyle (MDL) Study PI: Ryan Bradley, ND, MPH and Kara Fitzgerald, ND IRB #: RB100217 Approval Date: 2.9.18 Ver. 1.1 15 Methionine is an important amino acid involved in the methylation of DNA, proteins, and neurotransmitters. Impaired methionine metabolism may be caused by genetic changes, nutritional deficiencies, aging and environmental toxins and associated with various health conditions such as cardiovascular disease. This test measures various intermediates in methionine metabolism, including (SAM), and adenosine. Abnormal levels may indicate single nucleotide polymorphisms to specific enzymes. A venous blood draw will collect 6 mL of blood (~1 tablespoon) into an EDTA tube (purple top). D.4.4.2. Folate Vitamer Panel - Doctor's Data Folate exists in several different chemical forms which are most commonly involved in one carbon metabolism. Abnormal levels of folate vitamers may indicate single nucleotide polymorphisms affecting enzyme function pathways. A venous blood draw will collect 6 mL of blood (~1 tablespoon) into an EDTA tube (purple top). D.4.4.3. Tertiary Measure: Medical Symptoms Questionnaire (MSQ) The MSQ is a 71 question survey that measures various health areas including: Digestive tract, Eyes, Energy/Activity, Emotions, Head, Heart, Joint/Muscles, Lungs, Mind, Mouth/Throat, Nose, Skin, Weight, and Other. Each question is measured on a 5 point rating scale ranging from Never or almost never have symptom to frequently have it and effect is severe. Scoring: Optimal scoring is less than 10, Mild Toxicity: 10-50, Moderate Toxicity: 50-100, Severe Toxicity: over 100. This instrument is a non-validated tool utilized in the functional medicine community to assess health. The current study may have the potential to validate the MSQ by comparing results to the PROMIS-29 and NUNM Multi-system Symptom/Adverse Event Questionnaire. D.4 .5. Measurement of Potential Confounders DNA Methylation Pathway Profile - Doctor's Data This test assesses changes to DNA genotype, called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which may affect enzymatic function. Potential biochemical pathways impacted include, methionine metabolism, detoxification, hormones, and vitamin D. This is a blood spot test and requires collection of 5 drops of blood after a finger stick.

HUMAN SUBJECTS RESEARCH Protocol Study Title: Methylation Diet and Lifestyle (MDL) Study PI: Ryan Bradley, ND, MPH and Kara Fitzgerald, ND IRB #: RB100217 Approval Date: 2.9.18 Ver. 1.1 24 E.1. Potential Risks E.1.1. Blood Draws There will be three blood draws during this study. The main risks associated with drawing blood are infection, bruising, redness, pain, discomfort, or bleeding at the needle puncture site. Occasionally, individuals may feel lightheaded or faint during or immediately after a blood sample is collected. There is also a rare risk of swelling around the vein. E.1.2. Study Product Ingestion Most of the ingredients are essential macronutrients and micronutrients. Risks associated with any dietary supplement include gastrointestinal symptoms such as gas, bloating, digestive upset and change in bowel movement frequency or consistency. Individuals with known sensitivities, intolerances, and allergies to any of the product ingredients will be excluded from the study. The product ingredients are approved for human use by the FDA under GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status and are frequently consumed in commonly eaten foods, spices, flavorings, and beverages. The study products are described in sections D.7.1. and D.7.2. Lactobacillus species are usually well-tolerated when taken orally. Lactobacillis actobacillus acidophilus and the Lactobacillus plantarum 299v strain have been used safely in studies lasting from one week to six months. E.1.3. Confidentiality There is a small risk that information about a study participant could be inadvertently disclosed to non-study personnel . E.2. Protection Against Risks E.2.1. Blood Draws Study protocol and procedures to minimize risks associated with blood draws are in place. Blood samples will be obtained by certified phlebotomists, or licensed physicians in medical facilities, which includes procedures and staff to handle medical emergencies. E.2. 2. Study Product Ingestion Prospective participants will be screened for eligibility to minimize potential contraindications to the study product as well as determine general health status. Adverse event monitoring will occur throughout the study. E.2.3. Confidentiality Protocol Study Title: Methylation Diet and Lifestyle (MDL) Study PI: Ryan Bradley, ND, MPH and Kara Fitzgerald, ND IRB #: RB100217 Approval Date: 2.9.18 Ver. 1.1 25 Throughout the study, measures to ensure the privacy of information on study participants will be maintained. Details of Confidentiality and Data security are outlined in section G.1. Participants will be told about any new information that may affect their willingness to participate in the study. E.3. Potential Benefit Participants may not receive a direct benefit from their participation in this research. Participants may experience improved quality of life through adherence to the lifestyle recommendations included in the proposed intervention, however their composite effects are unknown. Participants may experience improved cardiovascular health through adherence to the physical activity and stress management recommendations in the proposed intervention. F. Importance of Knowledge to be Gained The proposed research will benefit society by producing proof- of-concept data on the efficacy of diet and lifestyle factors to alter epigenetic signaling after a short-term intervention. Demonstrating alterations in methylation sites in pathways with known associations with disease risk may lead to improvements in disease prevention initiatives and interventions toward the improved health of the public. G. DATA COLLECTION, SOURCES AND ANALYSIS G.1. Confidentiality and Data Security Throughout the study, measures to ensure the privacy of information on study participants will be maintained. All study investigators and staff have been certified in human subjects research and have received training in HIPAA regulations. Participants and staff will be informed of the confidentiality of information and assured that data will be used only for statistical purposes and group analyses in which the individual cannot be identified. No data beyond what is stated in the Informed Consent will be sought without authorization from the participant. Information on illnesses and hospitalizations will not be sought from hospitals or doctors without a signed medical release from the subject. Conversely, no information on any individual will be released to anyone other than study personnel without a signed medical release from the participant, or where appropriate, the next of kin or a physician in case of a life threatening emergency to the subject. All study personnel will be instructed not to discuss any participants with persons other than study personnel. Each participant will be assigned a unique alpha-numeric ID upon screening. All blood tubes, and associated paperwork will be marked using the unique ID to protect patient confidentiality. All data resulting from study visits will be collected on standardized case report forms (CRFs). Data will be transferred from CRFs to a secure REDCap database for data management. REDCap Protocol Study Title: Methylation Diet and Lifestyle (MDL) Study PI: Ryan Bradley, ND, MPH and Kara Fitzgerald, ND IRB #: RB100217 Approval Date: 2.9.18 Ver. 1.1 26 is a secure, web-based application that supports electronic data capture for research studies. REDCap features include: 1) intuitive data entry features; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export; 3) user-based privileges that support HIPAA compliance; 4) seamless data export to common statistical packages; and 5) procedures for importing data from external sources. The REDCap database will be accessible only by the study team. Data will be destroyed 3 years after completion of the study. Computer files will be deleted from the server and paper files will be destroyed using a professional document shredding service. All completed forms will be kept in locked files to which only project personnel have access. These files will also be in locked rooms. Data from paper forms will be manually entered into REDCap and kept as electronic files. Electronic files will be password protected with access given to study personnel only. All analyses will be conducted by study staff at the Helfgott Research Institute. The study biostatistician will only access de-identified data exported from REDCap to Excel or SPSS. Only de-identified data will be presented in any reports, presentations or manuscripts. G.2. Informed Consent Consent will be obtained from the participants for the study protocol. The Consent Form will include the purpose of the study, a description of the procedures, a list of risks and benefits, an assurance of confidentiality, an assurance of withdrawal without prejudice, study incentives, and telephone numbers for answering questions about the research. Participants will also be given information on their right to privacy for personal health information based on HIPAA regulations. Procedures for data sharing using de-identified data will be explained. G.3. Adverse Event Monitoring If an Adverse event (AE) is reported at Study Visit 1 or Study Visit 2, the Study Coordinator will contact the CI and/or the PI as soon as possible, i.e., during the appointment, for AEs graded as \"moderate\" or more severe (Grade 3 or higher). If the Study Coordinator is unable to reach the CI/PI within the appointment, the participant will be contacted by the PI as soon as possible within the same day. The Study Coordinator and CI will complete the \"Standardized Adverse Events Questionnaire: Spontaneous Reporting\" form (Appendix A) in order to capture detail s regarding the adverse event and any action taken. If a participant calls the Study Coordinator or the Principal/Clinical Investigator to report AEs, a similar procedure will be followed, which will include completion of the \"Standardized Adverse Events Questionnaire: Spontaneous Reporting\" form. G.3.1. Risk Classification: Low All procedures are considered \"low risk\" as per the NUNM Helfgott Research Institute Procedure/Intervention Risk Classification list. These low-risk procedures include administering Protocol Study Title: Methylation Diet and Lifestyle (MDL) Study PI: Ryan Bradley, ND, MPH and Kara Fitzgerald, ND IRB #: RB100217 Approval Date: 2.9.18 Ver. 1.1 27 questionnaires, and venipuncture/blood draws on non-pregnant adults. Participants will be told about any new information that may affect their willingness to participate in the study. G.3.2. Reporting to the NUNM Institutional Review Board All adverse events will be recorded in the Adverse Event Log. Anticipated adverse events will be re ported to IRB during continuing review. Unanticipated problems will be reported to IRB within 10 working days of the investigators being notified of the event. Serious adverse events will be reported to IRB within 24 hours of the investigators being notified of the event. G.3.3. Adverse Event Definitions Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject. An AE can therefore be an unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms (nausea and loose stools), or disease temporally associated with the study, whether or not related to the study procedure, or a worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness. Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life- threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Other important medical events requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent a serious outcome would also be considered SAEs. Unanticipated Problems (UP): Any incident, experience, or outc ome that meets all of the following criteria: 1) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB - approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 2) related or possibly related to participation in the research and 3) suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psych ological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. G.4. Statistical Analysis PROMIS 29 T-scores will be presented as mean (SD), for each group at each of the three data collection time points. For the primary aim, we will compare changes in PROMIS-29 T-scores betwe en groups, using a linear mixed model with random intercept to test for a Group*Visit interaction. If there is a significant main effect, we will also present uncorrected contrasts comparing changes from baseline to Week 5, and from baseline to Week 9, between groups. Although PROMIS T-scores are not particularly susceptible to extreme outliers, data will be examined for any outlying PROMIS scores or changes in PROMIS scores. If these scores are deemed to be in error, then they will be treated as missing in all analyses. Otherwise, scores Protocol Study Title: Methylation Diet and Lifestyle (MDL) Study PI: Ryan Bradley, ND, MPH and Kara Fitzgerald, ND IRB #: RB100217 Approval Date: 2.9.18 Ver. 1.1 28 will be retained in the main analysis; but we will conduct separate sensitivity analyses to test for effects of outlying data on results. Mixed models incorporate all available data, without excluding any participants from analysis. Nevertheless, any participants who have baseline data only will be excluded from analysis. As an exploratory follow-up analysis, we will re-analyze changes from Week 1 to Week 9, using data from completers only. For the secondary aim, the total score of the MSQ will be analyzed similarly to PROMIS-29. Since MYMOP asks for two symptoms without distinction, we will classify each problem as either the Primary problem (the problem with the highest symptom rating at baseline; or, in the case of a tie, the first problem listed) or the Secondary problem. We will also calculate the average of the two problem scores, at each collection time point. If only one problem is listed, then this will be used as both the Primary and Average, for that individual, with Secondary score missing. Changes in MYMOP severity scores will be compared between groups using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Separate comparisons will be made between changes over the first 4 weeks of the study and changes over the entire 9-week intervention period. G.5 SPONSOR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR INTERVENTIONAL PRODUCT(S) The sponsor, Metagenics, is responsible for supplying the interventional product(s) in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). These products will be fully characterized, properly coded and suitably packaged in a way to provide protection against deterioration with appropriate labelling. Sufficient samples of each batch and a record of analyses and characteristics will be kept by the sponsor for reference so that, if necessary, an indepe ndent laboratory is able to re-check the interventional product(s), e.g. for quality control or bioequivalence. Records of the quantities of interventional products supplied will be maintaine d with batch or serial numbers by sponsor. The sponsor will ensure that the investigator is able to establish a system within their institution for adequate and safe handling, storage, use during the course of the study and, if appropriate, return or destruction of the inter ventional product(s) upon completion of the study. G.6 SPONSOR MONITORING The sponsor, Metagenics, will appoint suitable and appropriately trained monitor(s) and clinical research support personnel to conduct regular site visits starting with recruitment and continuing on a schedule that is mutually agreed upon by the study coordinator and sponsor. Follow up information from these visits will be provided to site, sponsor and to Principal Investigators in a timely manner for their reference purposes . Protocol Study Title: Methylation Diet and Lifestyle (MDL) Study PI: Ryan Bradley, ND, MPH and Kara Fitzgerald, ND IRB #: RB100217 Approval Date: 2.9.18 Ver. 1.1 29 Sponsor will ensure to provide ongoing training to their study personnel so that they are suitably qualified and to keep them up to date with new developments in clinical research. H. Incentives Participants will earn $50.00 for each week they participate in the study, up to $450 if they participate for the full 9 weeks. Checks will be mailed after visit 2 (week 5) and visit 3 (week 9), compensated for each week they participated. J. References 1. Alegr\u00eda-Torres JA, Baccarelli A, Bollati V.
