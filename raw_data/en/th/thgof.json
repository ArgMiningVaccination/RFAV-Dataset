After that, the guide places magnets in that specific points in order to balance them. Once achieved the physical relaxation, the therapist focuses, through Ra-Haraktys healing, on the energetic, emotional and mental bodies harmonizing their chakras.

The clay of the region represents the earth: we absorb its minerals and properties that allow us to root; the sacred resin of the copal represents the fire that lights our vitality; the air, in the form of the roar of the jaguar and the song of the eagle, will enhance our senses. Finally, water will purify any negative residue. [GET YOUR TICKETS](#) [CONTACT US](/the-tribe/contact) Energy Cleanse The physical body suffers pain, inflammation and imbalance due to uneven loads. The guide uses several resources, which can be branches of magic herbs, drums, fire, among others, to dislodge or break the emotional knots. The therapist chooses the instrument according to the person. The clean energy has the power to remove any badly qualified vibration. The herbal bouquet, for example, absorbs and transforms it.

We connect with those intimate and unforgettable moments, inviting people to share an occasion of fraternity sitting in a circle on the ground looking at each other, recognizing each other as equals and sharing that sweet elixir, a gift of the gods.
