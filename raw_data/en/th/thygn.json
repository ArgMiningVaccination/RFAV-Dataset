The biggest source of mRNA vaccine skepticism, according to vaccinologist Bali Pulendran, PhD, the Violetta L. Horton Professor and professor of pathology and of microbiology and immunology, is rooted not in biology but in our own psychology -- specifically, an amorphous, free-floating fear of the unknown. - - News Center Researchers solve mystery of how statins improve blood vessel health Statins designed to lower cholesterol have long been noted to work in mysterious ways to improve other aspects of cardiovascular health. A Stanford Medicine-led study uncovers how they do it. \"The study gives us an understanding, at a very deep mechanistic level, of why statins have such a positive effect outside of reducing LDL,\" said professor of medicine Joseph Wu, MD, PhD, referring to low-density lipoprotein, or \"bad\" cholesterol. \"Given how many people take statins, I think the implications are pretty profound.\" - - SciTechDaily Cracking the Code of Autoimmune Diseases: New Approach Identifies Key Protein Fragments Study opens pathway to better diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases. Researchers from Washington University, Stanford University, and Oxford University have developed a method to identify protein fragments and immune cells that cause autoimmune reactions. Co-corresponding author K. Christopher Garcia, PhD, and co-first author Xinbo Yang, PhD, of Stanford Medicine. - - Washington Post Gene-edited cells move science closer to repairing damaged hearts New research offers a path toward transplants that can fix damage from a heart attack without causing life-threatening arrhythmias. \"The arrhythmias are one of the key roadblocks. The investigators conducted an important study but will need to test more animals to show these genetically modified cells do not cause irregular rhythms and can improve heart function,\" said Joseph Wu, director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute. 2022 - - News Center New blood test to identify infections could reduce global antibiotic overuse A diagnostic test developed by Stanford Medicine scientists can separate bacterial and viral infections with 90% accuracy, the first to meet standards set by the World Health Organization. The new test is described in a paper published Dec. 20 in Cell Reports Medicine. \"Antimicrobial resistance is continuously rising, so there has been a lot of effort to reduce inappropriate antibiotic usage,\" said Purvesh Khatri, PhD, associate professor of medicine and biomedical data science, and the senior author of the paper. \"Accurately diagnosing whether a patient has a bacterial or viral infection is one of the biggest global health challenges.\" - - News Center Researchers may have found a new path for halting cancer cell production After finding long, repetitive sequences in the genomes of seven kinds of cancer, researchers at Stanford Medicine and their colleagues developed a molecule that curbed their production. Although the scientists aren't sure what role the repetitive sequences play in cancer, they were encouraged that they appeared to have found a way to inhibit the creation of more cancer cells. \"The most dramatic result was that you could actually target them and stop cell proliferation,\" said Michael Snyder, PhD, professor and chair of the department of genetics. - - Human Performance Alliance Speeding up bone healing in menopausal females lder women heal bone fractures slower than men. Now a team has found that a single, localized delivery of estrogen to a fracture can speed up healing in postmenopausal mice. The findings could have implications for the way fractures in women are treated in the future. \"The majority of stem cell research is done on male animals. There's very little research that has actually been done on females,\" said Wu Tsai Alliance member Charles Chan, PhD, an assistant professor of surgery at Stanford University and co-senior author of the paper published Oct. 30 in Nature Communications. \"The research is long overdue, especially the question of why women heal differently from men.\" - - Pharmacy Times Expert: Immune Reconstitution With Orca-T Reveals 'New Realm of Engineered Donor Grafts' for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Pharmacy Times interviewed Everett Meyer, MD, PhD, medical and scientific director of the Cellular Therapy Facility, Stanford Health Care and Assistant Professor of Medicine, Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, on the poster presentation titled \"Rapid Immune Reconstitution and Elevated Regulatory T Cell Frequencies in Patients Treated with Orca-T\" at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exhibition in New Orleans, Louisiana. - - Helio Stanford researcher receives award for lifetime achievement in hematology Irving Weissman, MD, will receive the Wallace H.

'The discovery could open the door to treatments that, by taming brain inflammation in people who don't get much exercise, lower their risk of neurodegenerative disease or slow its progression,' said Professor Tony Wyss-Coray, of the Stanford School of Medicine in California, which carried out the research. October 7, 2021 - The Edge How can technology help you track real time data about your health and wellbeing? And why should you track anyway? In this episode, Michael Snyder, professor of genetics, talks about how tracking can help you gain deeper understanding of what is going on in your body at a physiological level. Often, illnesses begin developing in our bodies quietly, before any symptoms begin to show up. Snyder's research shows that by tracking on a regular basis, we can pre-empt diseases. Health data collection using wearable tech can help us take a proactive approach toward prevention of disease. And like they say, prevention is better than cure. - - News Center Study predicts who may benefit from CAR-T cell therapy for blood cancers CAR-T cell therapy works for many types of blood cancers, but more than half of patients relapse. A Stanford study provides a clue as to why. The researchers showed a correlation between the density of the target molecules on the cell surface and the likelihood that a patient will respond well to CAR-T cell therapy. They also devised a way to assess the function of engineered CAR-T cells before they are used in patients. Crystal Mackall, MD, the Ernest and Amelia Gallo Family Professor and a professor of pediatrics and of medicine and David Miklos, MD, PhD, professor of medicine and chief of bone marrow transplantation and cellular therapy are co-senior authors of the study, which was published online July 26 in Nature Medicine. - - The Stanford Daily Vaccine supplement can expand immune system's virus protection, Stanford research finds Certain additives can strengthen vaccines to protect the body from a broad range of viruses, researchers at the Stanford School of Medicine found in a study published in late June in Cell.
