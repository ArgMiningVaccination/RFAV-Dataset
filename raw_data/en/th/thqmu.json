As we receive additional guidance and clarification on the new health care reform laws from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor and Internal Revenue Service, we may be required to make additional changes to this summary of benefits. This summary of benefits, as updated, is subject to the approval of the Colorado Department of Insurance. In addition to the benefits described in this summary, coverage may include additional benefits, depending upon the member's home state. The benefits provided in this summary are subject to federal and Colorado laws. There are some states that require more generous benefits be provided to their residents, even if the master policy was not issued in their state. If the member's state has such requirements, we will adjust the benefits to meet the requirements. The family deductible and out-of-pocket maximum are embedded, meaning the cost shares of one family member will be applied to the individual deductible and individual out-of-pocket maximum; in addition, amounts for all family members apply to the family deductible and family out-of-pocket maximum. No one member will pay more than the individual deductible and individual out-of- pocket maximum. All medical services subject to a coinsurance are also subject to the annual medical deductible. Annual out-of-pocket maximums include deductible, copays, coinsurance and prescription drug. In-network and out-of-network deductible and out-of- pocket maximum are exclusive of each other. For plans with an office visit copay, the copay applies to the actual office visit and additional cost shares may apply for any other service performed in the office (for example, X-ray, lab, surgery), after any applicable deductible. Preventive care services include physical exam, preventive screenings (including screenings for cancer, HPV, diabetes, cholesterol, blood pressure, hearing and vision, immunization, health education, intervention services, HIV testing) and additional preventive care for women provided for in the guidance supported by Health Resources and Service Administration. For medical emergency care rendered by a non- participating provider or non-contracting hospital, reimbursement is based on the reasonable and customary value. Members may be responsible for any amount in excess of the reasonable and customary value. If your plan includes an emergency room facility copay and you are directly admitted to a hospital, your emergency room facility copay is waived. If your plan includes out-of-network benefit and you use a out-of-network provider, you are responsible for any difference between the covered expense and the actual non-participating providers charge. Non-emergency, out-of-network air ambulance services are limited to Anthem maximum payment of $50,000 per trip. Certain services are subject to the utilization review program. Before scheduling services, the member must make sure utilization review is obtained. If utilization review is not obtained, benefits may be reduced or not paid, according to the plan. Certain types of physicians may not be represented in the PPO network in the state where the member receives services. If such physician is not available in the service area, the member's copay is the same as for PPO (with and without pre-notification, if applicable). Member is responsible for applicable copays, deductibles and charges which exceed covered expense. Human organ and tissues transplants require precertification and are covered as any other service in your summary of benefits. The family deductible and out-of-pocket maximum are embedded indicating the cost shares of one family member will be applied to both the individual deductible and individual out-of-pocket maximum; additionally, amounts for all covered family members apply to both the family deductible and family out-of-pocket maximum. No one member will pay more than the individual deductible and individual out-of-pocket maximum. All medical and pharmacy deductibles, copayments and coinsurance apply to the out of pocket maximum. Additional visits may be authorized if medically necessary. Pre-service review must be obtained prior to receiving the additional services. If your plan includes out-of-network benefits, all services with calendar/plan year limits are combined both in and out of network. Transplants covered only when performed at Centers of Medical Excellence or Blue Distinction Centers. 23 Respite care limited to five consecutive days per admission. Freestanding lab and radiology center is defined as services received in a non-hospital based facility. Coordination of benefits: The benefits of this plan may be reduced if the member has any other group health or dental coverage so that the services received from all group coverage do not exceed 100% of the covered expense. Supply limits for certain drugs may be different; go to Anthem's website or call Customer Service. Certain drugs require preauthorization approval to obtain coverage.
