Background. Cancer patients are among the main consumers of traditional, complementary, integrative, and alternative medicine (TCIM) such as natural products (herbals, integrators, etc.) and mind and body practices (yoga, acupuncture, etc.). Methods.A questionnaire on TCIM was submitted to 415 Italian cancer patients. /T_he questionnaire consisted of three sections: (i) bio-graphical and clinical information; (ii) use of natural substances; and (iii) use of mind-body practices. Results. 406 patients completed the questionnaire. /T_he prevalence of TCIM use was 72.3%. Of them, 75.6% started to use TCIM after a tumor diagnosis./T_he main reasons for using TCIM were to mitigate side eects (65.0%), to regain physical and mental balance (35.9%), to relievepain (18.3%), and to improve the ecacy of cancer therapy (16.0%). 44.7% of patients taking natural products used them during conventional therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.), and in 67.5% of cases without consulting a doctor. As a consequence, only about 50% of patients taking natural substances used these compounds appropriately, and the most common errors were related with the purpose of reducing the side eects of the therapy (52.3%) and for boosting immune system (32.1%). Conclusions. /T_here is an impelling need to provide patients with scienti/f_ically validated information to raise awareness about the bene/f_its andrisks of using TCIM. 1. Introduction According to the International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC), 1 in 5 people in the world will developcancer in their lifetime, and about 8% women and 12% men die from this pathology. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (6.9%), and together with lung cancer itremains the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver(8.3%), and stomach (7.7%) [1]. Although in the last yearsearly detection and eective treatments have reducedmortality rates, they remain high, particularly in low-incomecountries [2, 3]. Moreover, cancer therapies are often ac-companied by severe side eects that not only aect thequality of life, but can also lead to more suering and to areduced response to treatments [4, 5]. /T_his is why an in-creasing number of patients is turning to unconventional approaches, i.e., complementary medicines, hoping to im- prove the outcomes [6-9]. /T_he World Health Organization (WHO) de/f_ines com- plementary medicine as \"a set of health practices that are notpart of a country's tradition or conventional medicine andare not fully integrated into the dominant health system.\" In2017, the WHO unit of traditional and complementaryHindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2022, Article ID 2923967, 10 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/2923967medicine (TCM) unit was redened to include the term \"integrative medicine\", in order to increase the integrativeapproachesofbothTCMandconventionalmedicineandinrelationtosocialpolicy,aswellastoknowledgeandpractice.IJ\u00f8he unit is named \"traditional, (TCIM)\" Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) divides complementary and alternative medicineinto the following: (i) biological products (BP), includingvitamins and minerals, herbal, and probiotics products; (ii)mind-body practices (MBP), such as yoga, meditation,qigong, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation (both chi-ropractic and osteopathic), relaxation, hypnotherapy, andPilates; and (iii) other complementary health approachesthat may not t neatly into any of these groups, such astraditional healing practices, Ayurvedic medicine, tradi-tional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, and naturopathy [11]. anticancer eects of traditional or to overcome multidrug resistance and minimizeharmful side eects caused by radiotherapy and chemo-therapy [12-18]. Despite the growing interest of healthcare professionals in TCIM and the increasing number of scientically vali-dated studies, patients often turn to TCIM without pro-fessional input, taking information from unveriablesources such as social networks, friends, and other patients, taking these products as self-medication [19-21], often underestimatingtherisksofadverseevents, especiallywhentaken in combination with chemotherapy (CT) [22-25].Patients expect as main benets a reduction of chemo-therapy side eects, damage avoidance or minimization,boosting the immune system, and improvement of the re-sponse to conventional therapies [26, 27]. IJ\u00f8hisstudyaimstoassesstheprevalenceofTCIMamong cancer patients in Italy. Our goal was to analyze the use ofTCIM during conventional therapies, paying particular at-tentiontothosepatientswhodeclaredtotakeTCIMasself- medication, in order to highlight the risks of TCIM use in combination with conventional drugs. IJ\u00f8he novelty of thiswork lies in the fact that the information was collectedexclusively from the patients and not from healthcareprofessionals, who were often unaware. IJ\u00f8he oncologicalcharacteristics, the TCIM methods chosen, at what stage oftherapy they were taken, and the frequency of use were alsoexamined. In addition, we assessed the source of informa-tion,patients'expectationstowardsthesecompounds,andiftheir expectations were fullled. 2.Methods 2.1. Data Sources and Patients Setting. A descriptive cross- sectionalsurveywasconductedbetweenApril2018andMay2019 to collect data on cancer patients' choices of TCIM.Patientswere askedto completethequestionnaire usingtheonline form, available on the web portals of the ItalianInstitute of Health, AIMaC and ARTOI websites, or thepaper form, oered to patients at the AIMaC and ARTOIinformation points, located in the main oncologic hospitalsand in the waiting rooms of the oncologists who kindlyparticipated in the project. All papers and electronicquestionnaires collected were returned to the investigators and then the data were coded for analysis, in compliance with EU Regulation 2016/679 established by the EuropeanParliamentandCouncilonApril27,2016fortheprotectionof individuals, with particular regard to the processing ofpersonal data and the free movement of such data. Patientscompleted the questionnaire anonymously, and withoutassistance. Patients' participation was on a voluntary basis and did not interfere with their medical treatment. All participatingpatientsreceivedinformationaboutthestudy.Patientswereconsidered eligible if they met the following inclusion cri- teria:theywereItalian-speakingover18yearsofage,without distinction of gender, diagnosed with cancer, aware of theirdiagnosis, able to understand the questions, and free fromany condition that made lling out the questionnaire in-appropriateorburdensomeforthepatientsthemselves.IJ\u00f8hissurvey was approved by the Ethics Committee of the ItalianNational Institute of Health. 2.2. ET_he Questionnaire. IJ\u00f8he questionnaire used for the survey consists of three sections: the rst section concerns personal and clinical information, including demographic(age and sex) and clinical data (location of primary tumor,time since diagnosis, position in the cancer treatmentpathway, and drugs received); the second section concernsthe use of biological products (BP) such as vitamins andminerals,herbalandprobioticsproductsetc.,whichofthemwas used, when they were taken (before, during, or aftertherapy),forhowlong,howoftenandforwhatpurpose,whosuggested them, whether or not the choice was discussed with an oncologist or health specialists and, nally, whether they had any benet; the third section concerns MBP andfollowsthesamecriteriaasthepreviousone.Someproductsthatmayalsoberoutinelyprescribedmedicaltherapies,suchasiron,vitaminD,andcalciumsupplements,wereincludedin the BP analysis. IJ\u00f8he online questionnaire software developed by Daniele Open Source Moodle available from (https://github.com/moodle/moodle). It can be GitHub at https://github.com/kordan/moodle- mod_surveypro. 2.3. Data Analysis. IJ\u00f8he median, range, and relative fre- quencies were used in the descriptive analysis. Frequency analysesandcrosstableswith 2testswereperformed.Only the questionnaires for which at least the rst section wascompleted were analyzed. A cut-o value of p<0.05 was used. No dierences were observed between data collected using online or paper questionnaires.2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine3.Results 3.1. Patients' Characteristics. 415 patients agreed to partic- ipateinthissurvey.Onlyquestionnairesinwhichatleastthe rst section was completed were considered analyzable, therefore, we then evaluated the responses of 406 of the 415patients. 76.8% of patients were women, with a median ageof56(range24-84),23.2%weremenwithamedianageof62years (20-93). IJ\u00f8he most frequent site of primary tumor by gastrointestinal cancers(12.3%), hematological cancers tumors (5.7%), and cervical and lung tumors (3.9%each) (Figure 1). Out of 406 patients that completed the questionnaire, 116 patients (28.6%) reported not using TCIM, 228 (56.2%) used BP, 192 (47.0%) used MBP, and 30.3% used both. Patient's therapy phases (before, during, and after therapy)and therapy categories (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and exclu-sive) are shown in Table 1. 3.2. Analysis of Patients' Responses about TCIM Choices. As detailed in Table 2, the BP most commonly reported by patients were salts and micronutrients MBP were \"massages and manual care\"(63.4%ofpatients),withpsychicandspiritualtreatments(meditation, music and art therapy, mindfulness, etc.) 33.5%, yoga (23.6%), acupuncture (20.4%), osteopathic medicine(15.2%),reiki(14.1%),Qigong/TaiChi(12.6%),light sports practices, (6.8%), etc. 80.7% of patientstaking BP reported taking more than one product, whilemore than one MBP was chosen by 41.9% patients usingMBP. When and why did patients try TCIM approaches? As shown in Table 3, more than 70% of the patients whoresponded to the questionnaire stated that started usingTCIM immediately after diagnosis (71.1% and 79.1% for BPandMBP,respectively),andalmosthalfofthemweretakingTCIMduringconventionaltherapy(44.3%and31.4%forBP and MBP users, respectively). Although no statistically signicant dierences were noted between BP and of pa-tients taking BP, p<0.01). Overall, 71.9% of patients reported a regular BP use, while it was slightly higher, butnot statistically signicant, the percentage of patients whostated to practice habitually MBP (75.9%, p0.829448) (Figure 2). IJ\u00f8he most common motivations for the use of BP were (multiple responses were allowed): improving the immunesystem (66.2%), mitigating side eects (44.7%), andimproving the impact of cancer therapy (26.3%) (Figure 3,black bars). Regarding the choice to use MBP, the mainreason was the need to regain physical and mental balance(75.9%), followed by mitigating the side eects of conven- tional therapy (27.2%) and relieving pain (17.3%) (Figure 3, greybars).Nosignicantdierenceswereobservedbetweenthe responses of women and men. AsfortheprocessthatledpatientstochoosetheBPor MBP approaches, in our study 11.0% of BP patients and28.3% of MBP patients made their choice on their ownwithout consulting anyone. To these, it should be addedthe percentage of those who obtained information fromsocial media or magazines (9.2 and 6.8 for BP and MBPpatients, respectively), relatives, friends (24.0% and20.9% for BP and MBP patients, respectively). However, among those taking BP, the oncologist was the main consultant(32.0%),followedbythefamilydoctor(12.7%)and by the dietician/nutritionist (11.0%) (Table 4 leftcolumns). In addition, 22.3% of patients who learnedfromunveriablesources,didnotinformtheironcologistor family doctor, and 39.2% of them reported to take BPduring therapy. As regards to patients using MBP, the sources of in- formation were healthcare professionals (29.4%), personaldecision (28.3%), relative or friends (20.9%), patients' as-sociations (11.5%), other patients (6.8%), etc. (Table 4 right columns). Afterwards, when asked if they perceived any benet, 90.6% of patients who made use of MBP answered in the armative (Figure 4(a)), while this percentage decreasedsignicantly among patients who took BP (48.2%), and33.3% of them did not answer (Figure 4(b)). Finally, we compared the patients' responses on why they had taken one or more BP with the actual propertiesand toxicokinetic characteristics of the same productsaccepted by the competent body or in the scientic % of patients Breast cancers Gastrointestinal cancers Hematological cancers Hepato-pancreato-biliary cancers Cervical cancer Lung cancers Oral cavity cancer Central nervous system cancers Ovary cancer Prostate cancer Other03691215304050 Figure1: IJ\u00f8he distribution of patients by tumor type.Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 3Table1: TCIM and therapy phases of patients.

In this study, we started a survey about the use of TCIMs by cancer pa- tients with the aim of (i) assessing the use of these productsin relation to disease stage and suggested therapies and (ii)analyzinghowBPorMBPwerechoseninrelationtocancertherapies, to highlight the potential risks from harmfulcombinations. As previously reported [8, 28-30], the BP mentioned most frequently used products by patients were herbals,accounting for almost 40% of the products, followed byvitamins, salts, and minerals. IJ\u00f8he most commonly usedherbals were curcumin and aloe products, both of which wereamongthebest-knownherbalremedieswithhealingor soothing properties. Among MBPs, massage and manualcare appear to be the most commonly used practices(63.4%),followedbymindandbodypractices(33.5%),yoga(23.6%), and acupuncture (20.4%) (Table 2). An essential aspect that emerges from this survey is that patients begin to turn their attention to BP after a cancerdiagnosis (more than 80% of interviewed patients), as al-ready highlighted in several articles [6, 9, 31-35]. Moreimportantly,nearlyhalfofthepatientssaidthattheystartedtaking BP while they were in therapy. In general, BP use seems to be more common among patients at an early stage of the disease (0-1 years after diagnosis), (36.0% and 21.6%for BP and MBP using patients, respectively). In contrastMBPsweremorecommonamongpatientsinfollow-upandlong-termsurvivors(47.9%vs.30.7%ofBP),suggestingthattheirchoicemightberelatedtoadierentwayofviewinglifeafter the cancer experience, or after the acute phase of theirdisease.IJ\u00f8he main reasons of BP choices were to support the immune system (66.2%), which is often severely compro-mised by chemotherapy, and to reduce the side eects ofchemotherapy (44.7%). As for the MBP, the main reasonswere search for psycho-health balance (75.9% of pa-tients), understandably destabilized by the disease, tocounteract the toxic eects of chemotherapy (27.2%) and to relieve pain (17.3%). In general, it can be deduced that the reasons for the complementary choices lie in the desire toachieve holistic well-being, and to optimize the therapeuticeect of conventional therapy, which can also be severelycompromised by dramatic side eects, such as cachexia andchronic inflammation induced by chemotherapy, whichitself can lead to severe morbidity and to a signicantlyincreased mortality [4, 36, 37]. Anotherimportantissuethatwetriedtoaddresswasthe source of information and TCIM choices were dis-cussedwiththefamilydoctorortheoncologist.Asdescribed insimilarstudies,morethanhalfofthepatients(53.9%ofBP and 73.4% of MBP users) learned about TCIM from un-controllable or nonprofessional sources, which cannot al-ways guarantee correct information. In addition,approximately one third of the patients interviewed did notinform the oncologist or family doctor about the productsthey were taking[14, 38].IJ\u00f8he issue of self-selected productsshould not be undervalued, herbal remedies in special way,are considered natural, and erroneously safe, under-estimating the eects of drug/BP interactions that can se-riouslycompromisetheecacyofthetherapyorincreaseitstoxicity[20,39,40].Tothisend,patients'responsesontheir motivation to take a specic BP were compared with the actual properties and toxicological characteristics of thesame product (according to scientic literature and or of-cialreportsfrominstitutionalsites).Ouranalysissuggestedthat almost half of the BPs taking patients used BPsTable6: Accuracy of intended use of BP.

IJ\u00f8he mostcommon errors were related to the hope of increasingchemotherapyecacyandreducingsideeects,particularly those related to a weakened immune system (Table 6). To highlight the importance of correct information and therisksthatpatientsrunwiththeuseofBPs,wewouldlike to illustrate two examples taken from the questionnaire. A 48-year-old breast cancer patient said that during the therapy with letrozole and triptorelin, an eective therapyfor most hormone-sensitive cancers [41], she had takenmistletoeandnux-vomicaofherownaccord,toincreasetheeectiveness of the therapy. As well known, letrozole ismetabolized by the CYP450 CYP3A4 and appears to be eective in im- proving the quality of life of breast cancer patients during chemotherapy and follow-up [42, 43], the fact that rawmistletoe contains toxic constituents cannot be overlooked;moreover, high doses of mistletoe have been shown in vitroto inhibit CYP3A4 activity. Consequently, mistletoe couldpositivelyaectthemetabolismofletrozolebyincreasingthebioavailability of the drug, but also have a negative eect byincreasingtheadverseeectsofthedrugitself[44-47].Nux-vomica extracts are usually used in the traditional Chinesemedicine for their eects on the nervous system analgesicand anti-inflammatory activity. Preclinical studies an anticancer eect in breast cancer cells; unfor- tunately, at high doses it can be toxic due to poisonous compounds present in its composition such as strychnine,brucine, and loganine [48, 49]. Furthermore, [50, 47-year-old woman with metastaticbreastcancer.Inthequestionnaire,shestatedthatshewastakingAHCC(activehexosecorrelatedcompound),a shiitake mushroom extract, which the patient used toalleviate the side eects of paclitaxel and bevacizumab. IJ\u00f8heantioxidant have been recently described,and theuse of AHCC appears to be protective against the side eects of chemotherapy. Inaddition, AHCC is also a potential aromatase, akey enzyme of hormone-sensitive breast cancer growth[52-54]. variant V158Mgenotype of COMT (catechol-o-methyltransferase, estro-gens inactivating eects of aromatase inhibitors as in the use of letrozole [55]. 5.Conclusions Accordingtothescienticliterature,theresultsofourstudyhave conrmed that cancer patients increasingly turn toTCIM treatments after the diagnosis with the aim to reducesymptoms and also the negative eects of anticancertreatments, with the hope of obtaining an improvement inthe quality of life. However, the survey has highlighted afrequent lack of correspondence between the benetsexpected by patients from specic treatments and theiractual,evidence-basedproperties,emphasizingthepotentialrisks coming from TCIM use without consulting healthcareproviders,particularlyiftakenduringconventionaltherapy.IJ\u00f8he importance of this survey is to point out the impellingneed to provide reliable and scientically validated infor- mationontheuseofTCIM,notonlyontheirbiologicaland pharmacological properties and on their potential benets,but also on the risks of an incorrect association with anti-cancer drugs. IJ\u00f8he importance of this information also haseconomic implications, considering the economic burdenfor public health systems to diagnose and treat this pa-thology. It is therefore understandable that a therapy that isnot optimized for a patient, because it includes ancillarysubstances that may have conflicting eects, may also resultin economic harm to the patient and to the health careeconomy.
