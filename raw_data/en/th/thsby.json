Everyone 5 years or older should get a booster shot at least five months after receiving the second dose of their primary Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination series. People who received two shots of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine should try to get the same vaccine as their booster, but they have the choice to switch to any of the three types of vaccines authorized in the U.S. People ages 5 to 17 who previously got the Pfizer primary series more than five months ago are eligible for the Pfizer booster shot only. Everyone 18 years or older who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should get a booster shot at least two months after receiving their primary dose. Pfizer or Moderna (mRNA COVID-19 vaccines) boosters are preferred in most situations. Immunocompromised people who received J&J as a first dose and an mRNA vaccine at least 28 days later as an additional dose should get a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine at least two months after the additional dose of mRNA vaccine, for a total of three doses. Hospitals in the NYC Health + Hospitals system offer Pfizer and J&J vaccines. NYC Health + Hospitals/Gotham Health sites offer Moderna vaccine and Pfizer vaccine for children 5 to 11 years of age.
