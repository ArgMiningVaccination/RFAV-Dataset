Cacao was something I was already familiar with, yet hadn't gotten around to trying. But being in Bali felt like the perfect place to have my first taste. A group of around thirty of us came together on the full moon; sharing what we were grateful for, meditating, and singing songs around a roaring open fire. Our cacao had been lovingly prepared using only natural, organically grown ingredients; blended with some fresh coconut milk, palm sugar, and a few drops of essential oils. We each took a cup, and held it in our hands as we blessed it, and gave thanks. And finally, I took my first sip. It wasn't as sweet or as chocolatey as the hot chocolates I was used to drinking back home, but it was delicious. It warmed me, and felt nourishing and full of goodness. This is cacao, and the gift of stepping into sacred ceremony. So, I'm going to share with you what cacao actually is, where it comes from; and the many healing properties it holds for us on a physical and spiritual level. I'll also share with you how you can create your very own sacred cacao ceremony at home. What is cacao? What many of us in the west have come to know and love as chocolate, is worlds apart from the plant medicine it's made from; and the ancient history rooted in Central and South America. Cacao has been used in ancient ceremonies by South Americans (the Maya) for thousands of years. It has an active ingredient in it called theobromine\u2014which can be translated to, \"Food of the Gods.\" So it makes sense that cacao was given its sacred status, and enjoyed in communal ceremonies by the Maya with their Gods. The word cacao actually came from the Maya word Ka'kau, and the Maya word Chokola'j\u2014which means to drink chocolate together. You probably already know that cacao comes from the cacao bean\u2014which is also used to make chocolate. But the cacao plant is seen as a medicinal plant, and has been used for a number of spiritual, medicinal and ceremonial purposes throughout history. It's quite different to chocolate! Like I mentioned, cacao has a very different taste to the chocolate you're probably used to. Milk chocolate usually only contains around 20-40% cacao, with milk and sugar making up the rest of the ingredients. Ritual cacao is made from mostly cacao beans, some water, cacao butter, and then mixed with a little bit of natural sugar to taste. It is always consumed in a warm liquid form out of a cup or mug, and usually has a very bitter taste to it. Different spices can be added such as chilli, cinnamon, nutmeg, or vanilla, depending on what you like. So, when they say that eating chocolate is basically the same as eating a salad, because it comes from a plant\u2014that's true, but only when it comes to raw cacao, and not your typical selection box. Cacao is naturally high in iron, magnesium, and B-complex vitamins; which gives it a number of physical benefits, as well as the spiritual benefits it has long been connected with. What can you expect from a cacao ceremony? Shamanic healing is one of the oldest holistic healing practices, which has been used by ancient cultures worldwide for centuries. A cacao ceremony is actually a type of shamanic healing, but it doesn't have hallucinogenic or \"out of body\" effects, unlike some other shamanic experiences. Cacao ceremony is rooted in helping to re-balance the energies within us, and restore good health. There are so many different ceremonies in existence today. Some will lead you a journey of dance, while others will centre on meditation and inner reflection. Many cacao ceremonies will involve a group of people sitting in a sacred circle, taking prayer, letting go of anything heavy, setting intentions, giving thanks for all the abundance in their life today. This often involves opening up to complete strangers in the circle, and creates a safe and intimate space where everyone's fears, hopes, sufferings, and dreams can be shared. What we often find is we have similar problems and fears, as well as hopes for our lives. This means that the people in the circle act as a mirror for each other. A cacao ceremony will often end in dance, which allows the cacao to activate within the heart and body, and create transformation. Through opening the heart, cacao enables us to hear our true self, work through blockages and past traumas, dissolve any pent up negative energy, and help us align with who we truly are. It's also a wonderful time to give ourselves mental and physical space and peace. You get to switch off, and retreat inwards, helping you to learn more about yourself, and gain clarity on where you are and where you're headed. The physical benefits of cacao ceremony As mentioned above, cacao is packed with vitamins and minerals that are great for cardiovascular health. Cacao is also renowned for releasing dopamine and endorphins in the body, which [soothe symptoms of PMS](https://revoloon.com/shanijay/menstrual-cycle-planning/) as well as depression, by boosting our mood. Cacao contains anandamide, which is known as the bliss molecule. This is the same thing produced in your body when you workout and you feel a rush of good energy. Plus, it helps to balance blood sugar levels, and create more blood flow to the brain; helping to strengthen awareness and focus.
